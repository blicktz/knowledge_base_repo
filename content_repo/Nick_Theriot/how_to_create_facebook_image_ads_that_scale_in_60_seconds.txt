So we've been recently making these image ads that have been crushing for both our Legion clients and our e-com clients and they literally take about 60 seconds to make very quick and it allows you to push out a lot of different types of image ads really quick inside of your account to also help out with creative diversity inside of your Facebook ad account. Today we'll be diving into basically just how to make winning Facebook image ads in like literally like 60 seconds. It's very fast.

You don't need a designer. You don't need to pay anyone else. You can do this you yourself and ChatGPT and some other software I'm going to show you guys today.

Those videos not sponsored or anything like that. Just something I've been reusing has been crushing it for us. So I just took a screenshot from one of these accounts that we're running right now.

They're fairly new accounts. So we just came into this account and just like literally some of the first sets of ads we pushed out in this account has been crushing and beating the ads inside of this ad account from you know the client that was originally running it. Now in this particular image right here the biggest thing to notice is that they're both image ads and both of these image ads were created in in the way of like the the process I'm going to show you guys today.

So first things first I'm going to ChatGPT. I'm going to upload my product info doc and my market research doc into ChatGPT and I'm basically just going to say like hey it's only two docs I want you to use and basically if you don't know how to do this just go to how to make winning ads of ChatGPT in 2025 full guide where I show you how to make your product research doc and your product info doc because once you have these two docs it's pretty much like the foundation of all your future ads and everything like that. So I'll show you how to make those things and then basically all I'm doing here is uploading those docs and priming ChatGPT with like hey you're only allowed to use these things so that way everything I'll tell you now is going to be based off these two docs.

Next thing I'm going to do is go to creativeos.com. This is the software I've been using lately. Again no this video is not sponsored there's no affiliate link or anything like that so have fun and I was very skeptical at first about getting on creativeOS.

I actually did get converted by their ads on Facebook so this is probably like one of the most recent purchases I made specifically from their ads on Facebook itself but I was like hey you know at the worst I'm maybe gonna waste like 100 bucks and I think honestly there's cheaper settings but I know I'm paying $100 a month but I think there's like a 30 or 45 dollar month plan. Yeah long story short cool thing about creativeOS is that this particular platform right here is it pretty much just gives you like a ton of Facebook image ads that have been vetted significantly so there's other platforms like Atria, Foreplay, where like community kind of built creative platforms where you just get to see a ton of ads saved by the community but the cool thing about creativeOS is that and I did hop on a call with the founder after already using it to I just wanted to verify these things. The cool thing about creativeOS is that with creativeOS you don't like save ads and immediately gets added in for everyone to save.

Their team actually has an application process that takes hundreds of thousands of Shopify brands puts it down to like the top 800 brands and then they have further from those 800 brands a further like filtration systems where like you know the ad has to have been running for at least a year or at least you know a certain period of time they're also the brand itself has to have been running for a certain amount of time it also has to be at least like 100 something ads active so they have a very very strict filtration process for ad templates they add in and then once those templates are added in their whole design team basically just goes take these templates and turns them into Canva or Figma. I don't know why but I just have a strong like negative stigma to Figma. I've used it once and I did not like it it's extremely complicated and I don't know I've just never loved Figma so I never used Figma but I love Foreplay or Canva specifically and cool thing about this is that you can literally just pop it in right here and then boom once you take it into Figma or Canva not Figma you can literally go ahead and it's going to give you the copy all of the things right here to where it literally takes you literally 60 seconds.

So watch let me show you I got my template and already kind of some examples here but I'm just gonna do some more I'm just gonna say using this headline inspo please create me 10 headlines for my product plus persona there we go trying to spit out some stuff and the cool thing like I like about this is that it's basically you're taking in various different templates and you don't really have to think about copy now is this the only thing I ever do for image ads no it's just one of those things that can help you guys out with push out more image ads when you're in that particular time crunch right there so here it's gonna push out a bunch of image ads and the product info and research doc these are both example docs I've built for athletic green so that's why it's this energy powder right here veggies you drink sounds impossible feels incredible nutrition 60 seconds sounds too easy feels amazing I really like veggies you drink veggies you drink and then I'm also going to pull sounds too easy and then I'm gonna do yeah I'll do feel wonderful cool I'm gonna delete this product photo boom I'm gonna upload my product photo again I don't work with athletic greens they're not a client or anything like that I just use them as an example because I've been having too many clients complain I've been sharing their ads in my YouTube videos so that's the only reason why um delete their logo add in a logo right there uh performance I'm just gonna name this performance I'm just called greens performance greens now I don't have image ads for our images for these little things so I'm just gonna put delete that boom move that up and then what I'm gonna do is let me just here is my headline please give me three sub benefits there we go effortless energy boost boom instant gut relief oh my god okay and then stronger immunity simpler routine there we go now we have an ad ready to roll colors I would say are iffy on this so I could spend some a little bit more time here like for example changing it more towards the like athletic green ones so I can actually change all of these that looks good this also needs to change right here change all of these all right quick quick that looks amazing now let's just say I wanted to do some iterations of this or like a test a few different headlines real quick I can go in and let's just say there's another one mom's love no pills no hassle some streaming feels revitalizing okay cool I can come in and do this boom duplicate and then breakfast you sip sounds strange healthy habits zero prep sound realistic feels perfect there we go so now I literally have three image ads I can launch file download deselect the first one done download give it a second there we go and then I literally have my creatives right here ready to go super simple and honestly looks 10 times better than anything you could probably make in Photoshop itself this is just another example I made like really quick following the same process let me actually log back in it's actually logged myself out I want to show you all some of the other templates in here oh here like another amazing one three reasons why use simply for new design here I can come and do the same I don't have a good photo for this but I'll just kind of toss this in ag1 oh wait hold up here is my headline inspo let's just see what this one is oh here we go three reasons why I choose is I want to get my energy back I choose ag1 to get my energy back there we go go back to chat gpt now I already created the three sub benefits for me so I didn't have to do it but I'm going to do it like this there we go and then one more sub protein big results so there we go I know like this one would be a good one to like basically go ahead and I could split test you know different like three reasons why I choose ag1 to get my energy back instead I could do something like this and be like give me two more with different desires and then we can see what this pushes up three reasons why I choose these you want to stop getting sick and the next one's in my daily bloating and duplicate that and then I would also go add in like the specific sub benefits but I'm not going to do that for this video obviously I would also do like a much better photo on this side right here but yeah you guys know the key thing right like you would go in you could add in like a more of a higher quality photo here but some other product photography and then boom like this would be ready to roll so yeah creative os really phenomenal product something I've been using a lot lately they have a lot of different ad types right here offers deals and discounts social proof testimonials there's also some other stuff they have like different like specific industries yeah a lot of cool stuff ad layout this is like if you want to like only one by ones right here I personally do only the one by ones because 90 percent of our english or our um not english ads but 90 of our ads we use specifically with what you call it um one by ones so here just gonna do one more example for y'all just because I'm actually actually generally interested how to make this look so I'm gonna type that put that in right there ag1 upload oh that looks good I'm gonna change this color there we go that's more ag green all right free gift when you spend to be honest I think ag1 does have an offer like this let me go to our website real quick it's actually a free gift when you spend 90 dollars 79 or it's actually a free gift when you subscribe and save so we'll go here free gift when you subscribe and save and obviously I would want to like add in that that's some legal stuff that we should probably keep there but I don't know the legal stuff specifically for this product and then use code nick terrio there we go cool and then obviously you can duplicate that now for this one right here I'd probably just test different like product photos here so let's see maybe I'd bring in something like this and I can toss that in right there uh that would be a problem let's see if I can just shrink shrink this a little bit can I oh it is stuck there we go obviously you'd make this look a little bit better but just to show y'all right there so I could do that and then like I don't know maybe another one I do let me crop this I think you just don't click original oh wait hold up I'd only show that one gift yeah there we go so just some creative differences right there look at that it's literally like 10 minutes we've made what these three creatives these three creatives these three creatives right there we just made nine new image ads and like this is literally me intentionally rushing to get this youtube video done whereas like if I actually spent like a good hour really taking my time and being very particular about the copy and like actually having the right photos that my photographer already took for me again this is not a product you promote or anything like that putting all that in together like you can create a lot of image ads really quick so hope you enjoyed this video again creativeos.com it's not a sponsored video or anything like that just something genuinely that we've been liking if you look right here I've already saved 22 hours total for just how much I've actually been using this platform and everything like that so I actually have been using it and stuff so that's just something I'm throwing at y'all real quick as like a youtuber or anything like that but yeah creativeos.com hope you all enjoyed this video that like button hit that
