I don't know how I'll be able to work today after all of this food I'm currently eating right now. I wanted to start off this video today. There is a mystery pet reveal today for this video.

Just going to have a Zoom call real quick with actually a new team member for Attire Solutions. We're actually expanding right now and I want to give and well I say we're expanding. I want to give a huge thank you to Julian Berker of Empire Growth Agency.

He actually reached out to me. He's part of one of my mastermind groups and men. He reached out to me and was like hey dude.

Long story short I get a Facebook ads person for free. Don't have to pay them and they're running some out of accounts for me and help me out. So that's pretty cool.

I can use all the help I can. Getting back to what I was saying earlier is to really understand why I wanted this pet. Because this pet isn't just like every single pet you get.

I mean obviously it's very common. Like it's a common pet that people have. But it's not your typical dog or cat.

And this is something I've never dreamed about owning before. Like I've always been fearful of these animals. And one day my business partner Dakota decided he wanted to get one.

Dakota got this pet and at first I was terrified of it. I did not like it at all because I went with them to actually pick it up. And I know it was going home to put it at his house.

Because I remember I did not even want to be in the vehicle. Got it. Fine.

Whatever. And then they try it and then boom. If you take your website from a 1% conversion rate to 2% conversion rate.

That's doubling your monthly sales. And sometimes they go from a 1% to a 4%. Just by simplifying their website.

Having a nice clean structure on their websites. Of that person. Whether it's sports.

Or maybe just like street. Etc. And it gives a rating on every picture.

And the higher the quality overall of that image. The more reach you have organically on Facebook and Instagram. So like one day.

Three, four weeks later. After he got this pet. Like just a girl I followed on Instagram.

Actually posted one of these things per set. I was like you know what. Let me send it over to him.

Because you know he might be interested in another one. And he actually did get it. Since he got it.

I was like. I don't know. This is really cool.

Like I don't know. I started having this weird interest. That started in this particular pet.

Really like through this weird interest. I started getting into this pet. I decided to start watching some YouTube videos.

Out of just complete curiosity. To learn more about this type of pet. Or this animal.

And through watching these YouTube videos. I started to develop just more and more of an interest. And it was very weird.

So basically for me. It was definitely really weird to want this animal. I also have a fear for it.

And interest for it as well. Into it. Chicken caprice.

Okay. With a strawberry banana smoothie. Alright.

Thank you. So yeah. So that's where my thoughts were.

But I just kept on watching YouTube videos of this pet. And I started wanting it more. So fast forward.

A month and a half later. And this past week. Week before.

I was in like a serious buyer. Like actually about to buy it. So I pretty much had two options.

So my main option was ordering one. And I really wanted to order it. Because I could grow it up as a baby.

And everything. But the problem with growing up as a baby is. I'm already comfortable.

With handling this pet. And Dakota had a second one. So I was like.

You know what? Let me see. If I can bring this one home.

Or purchase it from him. Etc. And that's what it came down to.

And things were still at the shop. So. Because of that.

There was less people there. So it was a little easier to let go. Than say if we were really busy.

We were always around him. And we would give him a lot of attention and stuff. Whereas now.

I can give him plenty of adequate attention. Over here. Because shop is closed pretty much right now.

And guys. I am so happy. Because I got his tank set up.

It looks amazing. So let's actually go. And finally show you.

What my new pet is. Some of you guys already know. Some of you guys already kind of suspected it.

That was probably the biggest clue giveaway. I want to introduce you guys. To Phoenix.

Here is Phoenix. I know he's already made a few appearances. To the channel.

But. What we did was. Like I said.

We brought him from the shop. Now he's officially. In my room.

At home. So he's vibing with me. While we're making some Facebook ad gains.

And he's making some snake gains. Fed him last night. And basically we did this.

We came there. And we kind of redid his cage a little bit. Just added some mulch now.

Took out that other material we had. Cleaned it up a little bit. And got this nice little target stand.

To put the whole setup on. And I really want to come there. And actually also paint this.

But later date. And we also got a cool little blacklight for him. But Phoenix itself.

I know y'all have seen him a few times. He is a California kingsnake. And he is two years old.

He has already had one owner. We picked him up like in January. And he did pretty good at the shop.

I fed him last night. He's been hiding all day today. And finally.

After hours of waiting. He's made his appearance. Probably going to take him out of the tank.

We'll see how he is. Just because. Did feed him last night.

Usually after you feed snakes. You want to wait a little bit of period of time. Because they're a little bit more vulnerable.

They're a little bit more aggressive. So definitely don't want to. Startle him too much.

So we'll see how he's acting today. Simply. What we've gotten the ritual of.

Is when we're taking him out and stuff. Is always. Make sure.

To. It's okay dude. It's okay.

There you go buddy. There we go. There we go.

I'm not going to go too close to him. Kennedy is holding the camera. She doesn't care for him too much.

It's not that I don't care for them. It's just. It's just a snake.

But he is extremely chill. Like I said. He has been with multiple owners already.

He's about two years old. God. He's extremely strong.

Oop. And yeah. And I'm actually going to put him back up guys.

I don't want to hold him out too long. Like I said. He did eat last night.

I can definitely still feel that nice little rat in him. So I don't want to put too much strain on him. But there we go.

That is Phoenix. That is my new little pet. I've never really had a reptile before.

Besides like some little lizards. Well. Really little.

And we put way too many in the cage. And one side to eat all of them. So that was very traumatic.

But yeah. That is Phoenix. He is my new little pet.

I'm really excited. And thank you guys so much for watching this video. I'll probably do like another whole video.

Kind of like around him and stuff. Maybe going over some more things around him. But I don't really know.

What else would you guys would like to know? Drop a comment though. Welcome Phoenix to the channel.

And thank you guys for watching. She say I'm a triple honey. Welcome to Trivago.

Tell me who you know. Who is it tripping for a follow? But all in that here like Showtime and the Apollo.

Puffing up your chest. The next thing you know is hollow. But well.

Hello. I've been swinging like some jello. You got one in a fun guy.

He gets some portobello. So I guess I need some grease up on my elbow. Duh.

But now my light turned yellow. And I've been looking for a cheat code. Like don't come.

And a neat ball. Bringing the receipt home. But we know.

We know that. Keep your head up. And you see pull back.

Oh. How do people see you? That converting to me.

22 years on a personal brand. Oh. Oh.

Oh. Yeah. I told you.

How do people see you? That converting to me. 22 years on a personal brand.

Oh. Oh. Oh.

Oh. Oh. Oh.

Oh. Oh. Oh.

Oh. Oh. Oh.

Oh. Oh. Oh.

Oh. Oh. Oh.
