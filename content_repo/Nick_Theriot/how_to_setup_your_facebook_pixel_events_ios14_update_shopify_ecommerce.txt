yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel nick terrio here and today i have a new video for you guys today we're going to dive into facebook's new rollout of the aggregated event measurement this will be a pretty quick video just kind of dive into it real quick and talk about it for you guys give you guys a few pointers and tips and a few things we know currently right now and things maybe you can take action on so that being said make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos helping empower the shopify ecom business owner in 2021 and scale to the moon so guys let's get started so facebook just rolled out this new aggregated event measurement tool nothing that we're surprised about because of the you know all the talk with ios 14 and i've already kind of summarized this video but i want to dive into it and actually give you guys a few tips about it and maybe a little bit more information about it for you guys who don't know what's going on with it so we do know for a fact to use this you must verify your domain first so if you haven't verified your domain already you must do that asap now what's going to happen is we're going to run through this and i'm going to show you what it does essentially is you need to assign the events that you want to use with your pixel so your purchase your add to cart your view content you need to tell the pixel which events that we want to prioritize so that way facebook makes sure they get counted so for people running ecom businesses shopify and stuff you're likely going to be okay because it's already pretty set up for that but if you're having multi you know things going on with your domain you're selling ecom on that domain you're also selling courses or other things inside of maybe click funnels etc you're going to have some issues so let me explain why so at the beginning of the month of february 2021 facebook rolled out the new aggregated event measurements essentially what this is is we're going to tell facebook what web events we want to prioritize on ios 14 devices so to get to this you simply just go to your business tools and then you're going to select your pixel then once you get to the pixel you'll probably see something likely like this and then all you want to do is click on the aggregate event measurement it should be popped up by now on yours and what we want to do is hit configure web events now again you must have your domain verified first before you can do this so if you haven't it'll say something like this so you want to make sure you verify your domain and then click on it and you can see right here some of the events already that facebook is prioritizing for this specific domain so let me click on edit now one issue so if you go ahead and change up these events right now all of your ads inside of your ad account will be paused for 72 hours so be sure you're aware of that before you start making any some any changes so let me click on edit and as you can see right here we have our pixel so you make sure you have your pixel selected event name and you want to make sure you you know just choose the ones you want so these are the highest priority ones specifically for ios 14 devices again this won't be affecting android from the way it's making this sound it's just going to be for ios 14 devices so you must go ahead and what you're going to do is you're going to select your pixel and you're going to you know go ahead and you have your highest priority and lowest priority obviously your highest priority you want to be purchased your second initiate checkout ads cart view content now one thing that you're going to see right here is you're going to see that purchase is taking up four events and we can actually even go further five six seven eight now why is the question and the big answer for that is value optimization value optimization takes up four events and the reason why is because to pass enough data with facebook they must take up more events i know it's weird it doesn't really make sense to me either but essentially for the value optimization to be go pass through the pixel they take more than one event up which requires more events on your domain so right now we're seven out of eight and all we're doing is optimizing for view content ads cart and shade check on purchase if i were to turn value optimization off then as you can see goes back to one event but you lose the ability to run value optimize the eyes campaigns so that's as simple as that you want to go through all this you want to make sure you have your event set up that you want to track and again you can just raise these and move these around how you want again if you're running shopify you have your pixel set up properly you verified your domain you're likely don't need to do this but more for people who are running you know multiple different things on their domain itself so maybe you have an e-commerce store and also on the side you have a click funnel running with that domain as well and then you have lead capture a view sales page all that might have more stuff going on which will cause some issues so you must get this put together again verify your domain first assign events that are most important to you and value optimization does take four events for purchase and you can change these eight events but it will cause ads to pause for 72 hours and let me just quickly double check real quick and show you guys what value optimization is and yes these results are not fake we've literally been getting capped at $22,000 a day and ad spend for this particular ad account for last like three or four days it's not fun at all but let's take a look i did set up a campaign specifically for you guys just to show y'all what value optimization is this is for more of the higher frequency stores that are getting a lot more purchases and stuff like that if you go right here you can see optimization for ad delivery is set to value essentially what a value campaign does is it goes ahead and it finds the highest priority or the highest buyers essentially that are going to purchase in the market right now so it looks at all your highest placed orders and then it finds people like those people so it's almost like a look-alike audience in a way so i'm still kind of testing it i've never really did much value optimization but i do know a few people that's had some major success with this so because of that it's something that we want to make sure we're setting up on our domain so that way if we want to run it and it works well far as we can so we don't have to worry about not having the ability to due to the aggregated events so i hope this helped you guys explain everything i know it's a kind of quick video just kind of like just dropping some knowledge for you guys make sure you get this all set up properly look at all your events and make sure that the ones that facebook has selected are the ones you want to optimize for are the ones you want to track because if it's all wrong i do have another store that's on woocommerce and it's all set up wrong so i have to go ahead and do a lot of you know work to make sure it's set up properly or we're going to be missing out on a lot of potential data back and it's going to screw up optimizations or screw up reporting it's gonna screw up all of that and we're gonna see a negative impact on results so it's important for you at least go take a look at this just in case facebook had a weird glitch with your ad account but 95 of y'all are probably okay but again just take a quick look see what's going on and then if it looks good you're good to go so i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you're an e-com business owner and you're spending over a thousand dollars a day in paid advertising and would love to hop on a call with this to go ahead and kind of navigate you through with scaling higher we've scaled multiple stores to multiple six figures per
