yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriault and today I want to dive into a video that goes over retargeting and some of the psychology that goes into retargeting when running Facebook ads specifically going to some of the audiences to go after and what exactly to put at each stage of retargeting this will be applicable to you if you're currently running Facebook ads right now you're seeing results at your top of funnel but right now you're seeing little to no results on your retargeting side or maybe you have no clue how to set up the retargeting on the back end of your funnel you don't know what audiences to go after or maybe you don't really know what to put at each stage just a hint there's nine different audiences I like to target when doing the retargeting side of on the back end of the business so let's jump into it it's going to significantly increase your ROAS pretty much overnight once you get all this set up now the way it sets up first one is our middle of funnel campaign and this is essentially going to be your page engagement so this is people who visit your Instagram profile visit your Facebook page like the Facebook post liked an ad commented on ad shared an ad clicked on ad but didn't purchase this is all the people who are like your social shoppers these are people who are aware of your brand but have yet to take any specific actions such as visit your website or add anything to quarter make a purchase it's simply just aware of your brand and now we need to do a little bit more marketing to really show off what your brands about you know other people love it and you know tie in some of that social proof and some of that other psychology to get them to come to your website and take action I like to exclude website visitors and purchases so I'm going purely after social engagement and like I said they're aware of our brand but just not curious enough curious enough to come to our site so we want to educate them a little bit more build some social proof and also tie into their needs of why didn't you buy this product so what I like to do is push some more unique selling points of your product so let's say if you have a cold audience ad that kind of briefly goes over why people should buy this ad you know how this products will make their life better uh then you know maybe elaborate a little bit more on those in ad set number one so for this particular product it's a little bit uh it's a pretty cool product it's a very unique product uh so I like to kind of go over and do like a little manufacturer video of them making it and then um going over a few things with like you know a little bit more deeper of a description for it next one right here we have the user generated content which is absolutely powerful to essentially convey to people that other people love it so they'll love it too and so within the first three days people are more aware of the product and now within the next four to seven days is what I like to do right here four to seven days we're showing people testimonials user generated content to further instill in their mind that hey people love this product I need to buy I'm more aware of the product now I'm aware more aware of what it does um now hey here's some testimonials and stuff I need to go check this out this looks cool so then we finally get them to the website because again all these audiences right here have never even visited the website yet this is purely people who have just been watching the ads because it goes by time frame so these ads are rolling past them on their timeline and obviously you can see the results are really good now going into the next one we got the bottom of funnel campaign and bottom of funnel campaign we're going after people who visit the website but did not add to cart and did not purchase and essentially what this is this is people who visit your website they looked at your product they probably looked at a few testimonials in your description of your product they understand your product but are just not completely sold yet on your product so what I like to do is I like to do some more longer form direct response copy really tie into people why they need to buy this product go over some of the pros the cons you know the beliefs they might have the unique selling points the objections they might have overcome everything take some risk away if you really just do a simple google search long form direct response copy look at people like breakthrough advertising writing copy that sells there's a lot of books on that and it's really hard for me to just demonstrate in this video but just longer form direct response copy with a strong call to action to come back and purchase now the second audience I like to do is just a 30 to 180 day audience of website visitors and I like to just promote other products to them and again this is another one of those I just kind of reset back up testing a few new products and because the other ones just weren't working well they weren't hot so just simply testing some new ones inside there now the next one's a bandit cart campaign this is essentially the campaign where when someone adds to cart they go back on their timeline and it shows them exactly what they added to cart on their facebook feed and we like to run a dynamic product catalog campaign and basically just give them a really good discount to come back and complete their order so if we go right here to a bandit cart uh so another campaign that's been working really well for us you can see we're doing a 14 day audience you can also test a three and a seven day audience depending on how many ads or carts you get uh you know if you get a lot you could probably do a shorter audience if you don't give many ads carts then you have to go a little bit like wider um you know so you can make sure you get your ad feeds out to people so uh this is probably one of my favorite ads because it works amazing it's something that you can literally just set on and forget about uh on another ad account we've been running the same ad since uh like december so like seven months ago and it's steady converts at four to four four x uh four x to five x uh return on ad spend every single day last one is your previous buyers this is a great time to increase customer retention so a lot of advertisers they come on board they do all this stuff right here and they never market to their past buyers again your past buyers can be some of your greatest assets because these are people that's already purchased from you loving your product and most likely are probably going to purchase from you again depending on the type of niche you're in for this particular client they sell metal signs and obviously we have a good variety so they might want to purchase another one for their house or for a friend as a gift for christmas or something like that or a birthday so i like to do a seven day audience and just basically telling people thank you literally just going out to people who purchased the last seven days telling them thank you for purchasing and giving them a coupon code to go make another purchase with a really good discount so just to upsell people up with a higher order then we have 30 days which is excluding seven days including 30 days and we're doing the ugc collector and this is basically what i'm doing is i'm telling people hey i have a really good discount code for you and if you drop a picture below in the comments with your metal sign i'm going to give you a discount code that you can use and we'll use that picture on marketing campaigns and you get a discount to make another purchase so we get a lot of good reviews and we get um you know like testimonials and pictures and stuff in this particular ad and again i just reset this all up so please bear with me i know we don't have any results right now uh and then lastly is 180 days people who purchase the last 30 to 180 days i'm simply upselling them on other products um in the store now this is only a brief touch on retargeting and some of the psychology that goes into it if you would
