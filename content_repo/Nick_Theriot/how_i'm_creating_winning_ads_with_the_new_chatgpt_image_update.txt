So last week we got AI images with ChatGPT and we started testing this on a couple of accounts now. One particular account, we uploaded, I think, 12 new image ads made completely with ChatGPT. And then we did like a couple of small edits in Adobe Photoshop, which is just like adding like a text on it.

And we found a new winner for one of our clients purely through AI and made a post about this a couple of days ago. And like crushing for one of our accounts. Now, a lot of questions, a lot of kind of comments about how we're doing this.

So I want to kind of dive into today exactly what we're doing when it comes down to these ChatGPT AI images. And again, this is still fairly early on. It's only been out for about a week to two weeks now.

Time of posting this video, probably about three weeks. But I just want to kind of give you all some entry level things that we're doing right now with AI images. And what's kind of what I'm seeing as a trend across everyone that's using this.

So first things first, I'm just going to talk about the probably the easiest way to use these ChatGPT images. Go on, you know, like Pinterest, for example. And then you basically just like take your product.

So like, for example, I just pick this random shoe or boot. And then I just went on Pinterest and type in like men's boots photo shoot. And I just started finding all of these different like visuals and stuff like that.

Here, I just went inside of ChatGPT and literally just said, hey, like here's a pic of my product and an image. I want you to replicate with the guy wearing my product. Now, this particular case, I would crop this guy out because it looks too similar to this guy.

And, you know, I don't want to like reuse the exact same guy. So I would literally just go and crop it out to where it just shows the boots on the guy. And there we go.

Now it looks like our own piece of content right there. So all you do, take your product, take a Pinterest image and just have ChatGPT replicate that. And it's for the most part, I would say it's like an 80% success rate in terms of like, hey, this actually is a viable like thing that we can leverage when going and create content.

There's 20% of the time where like the sizing will be all off or just the visuals look terrible from ChatGPT. And we can't use that asset and we have to actually kind of like, you know, play with it a little bit to actually pull out a decent type of piece of content we can use for an ad and stuff like that. Another key thing is you'll notice this boot is pretty like basic.

It's nothing crazy with like a whole bunch of designs on it and stuff. I'm finding that more basic products that have been seen thousands of time already by ChatGPT work really well. Whereas products that are very customized and heavily modified and stuff like that, those tend to do worse with ChatGPT.

So for example, I have a student that sells, you know, not boots, but another type of shoe for women. And they have these really crazy exotic designs on their shoe. And every time they give ChatGPT something, it just doesn't work well at all because their design is so crazy.

So you have to really pay attention to that or just at least something early one that I've noticed works really well. Now, this is one way to use ChatGPT. Find images on Pinterest and then take your product and have it replicated.

The other aspect of using these ChatGPT images is going and being more detailed with here's my product. And here's a very detailed summary of what I want back from you. So here I gave it a picture of a product and I just pretty much described the whole scene that I want.

As a 23-year-old white male influencer with over 1 million followers on Instagram in the luxury niche, create me a photo wearing the shoes on a yacht in Miami. I should see the Miami city off into the background as the sun is setting. The guy is standing up on the back of the boat facing the camera.

The camera is a professional DSLR camera. And there we go. Now we have a near like photo shoot quality image right here.

Since it's shoes, I would technically probably do something where it's more like close up of the shoes and stuff. But again, it looks pretty good and a little bit trimming and work. And this could work really well.

I also played around with it. Here's the close up one. Close up one looks really good.

And then I kind of played around with it, you know, adding in a model. And yeah, you know, so what? So a couple other things I did.

Now there's one other thing that I didn't actually prepare for y'all today. And I'm actually going to do this live, which I'll actually give a shout out to Dara Denny. Because she's actually the one that quoted this on her Twitter and actually gave me a really good idea.

You can also go ahead and say something like create an image with a viral Instagram influencer posting this on their Instagram story. Something like that. And then use using an iPhone 15 image quality.

There you go. So and long story short, I've seen some pretty cool stuff around this. I've seen a few different people on Twitter posts around this.

Like I said, first person I saw actually posting this was Dara Denny. So big shout out to her with like, you know, the context on that. So not the best image, but obviously you guys get the point.

You could go ahead and just be more detailed in it where it's just like, hey, look, this don't want you to pretend you are. This is the photo you're taking and, you know, it needs to be this quality versus like some professional quality like camera and stuff. So this is so far what we're experimenting with right now with ChatGPT images.

I do see a lot of long term potential in this. Obviously, it's only going to get better. I mean, I just think about a year from now, like it's going to be so much better than it currently is now.

Are we testing these? Yes, we are testing these. We're completely going all in on this.

No, we're not. We're doing this just like any other creative format. It's a creative format we're testing, experimenting with.

If it works for some accounts, we'll use some more and create some more. If it doesn't work for some accounts and guess what? Like I'm not going to be crying.

It's just like, cool. Well, sweet. We tested one type of image asset.

I do think this is also going to be a phenomenal tool to be used within organizations to help get ideas across to designers and photoshoot people a lot faster and giving them a more like specific. Here's what I'm looking for as an example for some of the production team and all those good things. So hope you all enjoyed this video.

I know this was a pretty short video, but just want to update y'all of what's currently we're using it and how we're using it. And then for y'all, it's, you know, it's going to be kind of like an ever improving thing. So I'll probably do another video in a month or two where we go a little bit more deeper in some of the prompts we're using and stuff like that.
