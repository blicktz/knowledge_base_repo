everything you need to take in place to scale your e-commerce brand from say twenty thousand dollars a month to a hundred thousand dollars a month so this is going to go over every little aspect of the brand kind of looking at it from a bird's eye view and i'm hopefully just going to bring some type of value or level of value to you guys i don't really know exactly how to position this but in short if you're trying to go from twenty to a hundred thousand dollars plus a month this is the exact strategy you need to follow so that being said make sure you hit the like button before we get started and hit that subscribe button for new videos monday wednesday and friday every single week just like this one all righty guys let's get started okay so when you start to scale your business um you know from zero to twenty thousand dollars a month it's like okay you know it's it's more it's about product market fit product validation and stuff and you know you're probably just doing maybe some facebook ads uh maybe a single product you're you got your your shopify store set up you're spending a few hundred dollars a day on facebook ads you know you're doing maybe a thousand dollar a day here there you know a few a week maybe and then you really want to scale it and push it further it's not just about spending more there's a lot of little things that go into it and kind of like our strategy we take when we come on board with a brand and really push it so let's dive into my computer i'm going to show you guys a few things so this is what it looks like when we kind of come on board with a agency or as an agency with a client and stuff this is everything that we have to do in order to get them to scale so there's a lot of little things going on you know another agency might just literally have a shopify logo and a facebook ads logo and say hey we run the facebook ads but no there's a lot of little key concepts we have to position to properly and effectively uh scale the brand from twenty five thousand dollars a month or twenty thousand dollars a month to a hundred k plus and these are the same concepts and same actions that you can take at home and do yourself but yeah and if you want someone to do it for you then click the link below to book a call with me and my team we can actually run all this for you so the main focus for scaling is you have to you have to keep this picture in mind right here you know in order to increase revenue you have to have customer acquisition you know you have to be able to you know keep position getting more customers and stuff you can increase your average order value so let's say you have a 70 average order value and then all of a sudden it's an 80 average order value and you do 100 orders a day you just added an extra what like thousand dollars per day just by increasing your average order value by 10 bucks because you get 10 more for every single order so increase your average order value and then your lifetime value and obviously you can see right here there's one money bag and it goes all the way up to three money bags your lifetime value is going to make you the most money and 99 percent of people are focused just right here customer acquisition they're not focused on this they're not focused on this and that's why the results are suffering so we want to do all of this while clearing out cash because we do not want to burn up cash flow you know we need to have cash in the bank we need to have a rainy day fund you know you need to have at least three to six months of expenses saved up in your business checking account for you know scaling and don't be the e-commerce brand that invests everything you make into your business starting out you want to have some cash at least 10 20 percent left over in the business banking account because what happens is you know we work with some brands that goes balls to the wall to invest everything into their business and they're literally clearing nothing not really saving anything and that's great that's trust me that's an amazing amazing mentality and stuff but the problem is let's say you do that for a few months and then one month you have a big red month and then the following month you have a whole bunch of chargebacks or refunds it can wipe out your business like that because you're not you're not really storing any cash in the back end so you need to find that that good safe haven of you know consistently scaling but also to saving a good portion of cash in a bank account and this also too might mean you're not taking a check you know you're the owner not taking a check right now just to keep cash in the bank and keep a good portion and continue to grow that every single month and that's also why a lot of the systems and stuff we do we try to focus on a profit focused thing because some of this is just not ready to scale that so that's the main focus for selling right here get a good healthy amount of customers in at good cost average order value lifetime value we're going to increase revenue but we also want to increase revenue while clearing cash we want to make sure we have cash in the bank so once we have all that kind of just like laid out and stuff now we can really start right here so first things first is you need to have a really good product info you know understand the product and stuff kind of like the copywriting around the product then you can dive into the audience personas so actually figuring out okay this is our product this is the features this is the benefits what's the pain points it's also our audience personas what's the desires they have really diving into our audience you know ideal customer and stuff then once we have all that we can start laying out some irresistible offers you know maybe bundle deals you know combos uh this could be you know percent percentage off for your first order maybe a dollar sign off for your first order free shipping for your first order you know just some type of offer we can do sometimes it might not be that type of offer you know like one for example we ran the offer the perfect gift for valentine's day that was our offer we're leading with and you know it just depends it you know your offer sometimes we won't have any sometimes we'll have a few but just whatever offers we can do to get first-time customers in the door then we go over all the cogs shipping break-even or as we understand all the metrics we need to hit with your current products right now we want to know the cogs for every single product we want to know the shipping for every single product we want to know the break-even or us for every single product where you're profitable where you're profitable at a 20 off discount code all that good stuff so i want you we understand all those key metrics and stuff so i recommend all you guys to perform this these activities get all this labeled out and like say google sheet right there go through all of this so you can really understand your current numbers and your metrics and stuff now you can start focusing on the key actions you can take to really increase revenue so first things first is just increasing your shopify conversion rate so we've lately been using like sms bump so when someone bandits their cart checkout it shoots them over a text message on their phone that's been super cool for us really been enjoying that um going through some website speed optimization and stuff looking at you know the products and how can we you know position upsells whether it's like recommend the products together on a product page or maybe it's at checkout right there and we have free shipping over 100 bucks and you know add 34 more dollars to your cart to get free shipping and have a few products right there and upsell looking at aov how can you increase aov with the current products and current stack we have on the website product recommendations uh card hook logic kind of like you know change up a few things prudely is pretty cool where it shows kind of like the little pop-up shows with like uh you know showing off like hey this person just recently purchased and then bundle offers what products we can bundle together so we really just want to take a look at the website how can we improve it how can we increase your conversion rate because let's say for example we change nothing with your ads and we double your conversion rate you double your revenue just by literally fixing up your website so we want to make sure your website's nice and ready to go before we start running ads so that way we understand that there's nothing that could be affecting the performance of the ads outside now once you have a really dialed in website uh we recommend just starting off with wicked reports wicked reports is gonna be huge for ios 14 because it's actually gonna bypass some of the tracking capabilities that's being removed so third-party analytics and all that good stuff um just set it up it's really cool not really gonna dive too much into it but it'll help you a lot with you know increase in ROAS and all that good stuff ad copy that's the first thing we do after we get all that because now it's all right we got the website up and running it looks good we got our analytics our tracking software stuff and stuff let's actually start creating some of the ads and stuff so um for our ad copy you know kind of like our system process we want to read reviews of products we're going to read facebook comments we want to read reviews of similar products you know help other like brands of similar products or positioning the product you want to look at amazon reddit youtube all that good stuff uh something recently we've been starting to experiment with is answered the public dot com and we we find you know we follow a core like three concepts when creating an ad that's grab attention great desire and a reason to take action now so and sometimes the reason to take action now it's not a seller or discount it's increasing the pain they're currently in right now and the only way to get past it is by going ahead and taking the action right now some of the ad copy angles we go after pain benefits testimonials social proof you know maybe a story and also association as well which works really well for clothing brands and then creatives so you got your ad copy together you got a few key pieces of ad copy structured headlines all that good stuff now go ahead and create all your creatives so there's a variety of different angles we can take ugc which is user generated content influencers behind the scenes how to use the product product shots testimonials ceo video talking about the products and stuff a thank you video even just all the facts and customer questions you get on a day-to-day basis and your customer service and addressing some of those in ads right there so really just building out all these assets and stuff so that way when you launch your facebook ads or when you get to the next step of launching facebook ads you have all this ready to go you can really hit that hit the road running so we'd like to start off first with creative testing so we have a creative testing campaign we have an audience testing campaign and by the way we're arguing with facebook ads now so uh then we're gonna start scaling some of those winners into cbo campaigns we're gonna start by retargeting campaigns and stuff and then like i said we try to shoot for about six new creators per week three a top tofu one mofu one bofu one pps just trying to keep those things fresh and looking good for uh people in our remarketing audiences and stuff and then we're gonna test you know various different scaling methods manual bidding cbo's duping to high digits just literally just increasing budget by 20 so we're gonna test a few different various scaling methods to see what works as every account is swear is different so now that you have all your core stuff set together you you know you're building out your customer acquisition stuff now and you're starting to push revenue in there now again we might want to circle back to our shopify and start looking at some of the analytics for facebook ads and shopify and start looking at some with what the average order value is looking like what's what's the website conversion rates looking like what what's gonna be adds at a product page what else can we add to the you know increased average order value maybe kind of like tweaked off for a little bit we want to look at all that good stuff while we start pushing some facebook ads because now we're starting to do customer acquisition we also want to make sure we're like i said we want to focus on that average order value because that's we're going to make good portion of money right there so once you start getting all this running you're you're starting to streamline some of this stuff's looking good you know maybe spending a few hundred bucks a day on facebook ads and stuff this is all happening within a week to two weeks this is happening quick it's not months this is one to two three maybe even four weeks at most you're getting all this running you're pushing all of this you're really starting to get some momentum and everything built up then your clavier right there is where you want to start really getting into next so you got your facebook ads for customer acquisition average order value is just on the site kind of essentially you know you're just upselling people but now you really need to focus on that lifetime value and clavier does a really good job with this so clavier's email marketing and you know you're gonna recover some abandoned carts from this you're gonna you know get some emails that just came into your system that haven't purchased anything yet you do some welcome emails and stuff but your lifetime value is essentially getting your customers to either do two things purchase more or get you more referrals so maybe you acquire a customer but you have no other products to sell you have a really good referral program and all your customers are turning into walking salesmen and one customer starts doing like a thousand dollars you know a month it turns like referrals and stuff so the lifetime value of that customer is significantly higher now because they're walking you know salesman referrals all that good stuff so so yeah so start setting up clavier start running some email marketing campaigns to your existing purchases either you know positions of that loyalty program of getting them to purchase more or if they can't purchase more but it's a one-time one-time product store you should start doing like some referrals and some really cool things for them or even just start working on some new products for these existing customers that would satisfy or complement the main product you sold them so we're gonna start increasing that lifetime value and you can just consistently go through the system over and over you can go through this whole system maybe once a week optimize every single little part of it and the more you consistently do this you're gonna slowly improve return on ad spend i mean so return on ad spend is actually literally a lag in the cater all your lead indicators is like your your um you know percent jump between you know people dropping their cart on the website your ctr percent your cost per click and stuff like that focus on all your lead indicators and stuff and you know really try to get that cost per acquisition down increase that average charter value and then start focusing on that lifetime value of increasing your lifetime value and getting existing customers to purchase more from you or be basically walking salesman for you or all three of them the third one now is for miscalanus this is just a few little odds and ends right there we do create a facebook vip group on facebook and load all your customers in this is a super super valuable resource because what this does is it allows you to go ahead and basically just like put all your customers in a group and you have a really cool chat room with all your customers and what you can do is you can go ahead and you can show off new products dropping you can do polls you can do like hey we're thinking about launching this product what do you guys think you can get some pre testimonials and stuff for new products it's literally just like an amazing database um so put all your customers in a facebook vip group you can do private launches you could do discount codes exclusive to the group products exclusive to the group so that way you help increase the exclusiveness of it and more and more people are going to want to join it so that's how you do the vip group again product upgrades just upgrading the product and stuff how can you make it a better product new product variants so variants of your current products right now and just like best sellers and yeah just keep repeating the process so this is kind of like our whole system right here one thing i didn't touch touch on if you you have a multi-product store you want to leave with the best-selling evergreen products and then you want to cross sell upsell on your other products that you have on site so it's kind of like your whole system and stuff when we come into a business and we start rebuilding everything for our clients and you know stuff that we leverage for their brands and stuff how you get to from 25 km off to 100 km off now obviously i didn't talk about fulfillment but you definitely want to look into like a 3pl you want to look at inventory numbers and all that good stuff but that's more logistical stuff and inventory stuff that you know while i have exclusive knowledge on that it's not something i really want to cover in this video so hope you guys enjoyed if you're an e-com business owner and you're spending at least a thousand dollars a
