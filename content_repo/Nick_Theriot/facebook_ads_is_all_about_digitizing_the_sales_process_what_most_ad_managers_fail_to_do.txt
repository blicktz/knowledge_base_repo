Hey guys, Nick here and I'm creating a video today to actively talk to you guys about running Facebook ad campaigns And some of the shit y'all doing wrong with going ahead and following up and retargeting people and you know Digitizing the sales process essentially and that's what I'm most Facebook ad marketers believe You know, they think you can just go ahead or at least some of the beginner Facebook ad marketers Is I can go ahead I can grab this shaker cup right here post a picture of it my phone and put it on buy now page with nothing to give credibility or social proof or You know some testimonials or anything like that. So basically just a shaker cup on a sales page and I get a Facebook ad that basically just that same picture I used on this sales page. I Upload it to you know Facebook I say grab this awesome shaker cup and put a buy now link and I Run you know twenty dollars a day of some ads I'm not split testing my assets.

I'm not split testing my ads by creative copy headlines everything knowing none of that and I push it out. I spent about fifty dollars this mug. We're selling it for a ten dollar I mean this little coffee mean chicken cup thing.

I'm selling it for ten dollars and I spent fifty dollars on ads Facebook ads do not work for me. I'm gonna go ahead. I'm a cry on Facebook move cry the forums and stuff like that Facebook guys do not work for me And then you know hate on everyone else who is getting results with Facebook ads that they're a scammer that their Course sucks because I can't get at results with Facebook guys.

So why would your course get results, etc? That's the typical mindset of every single Facebook ad marketer right now. That's not getting results And I want to show you guys today Exactly how do you get results with Facebook ads and that I want you to kind of pull back?

And you know free frame your mindset and your view on Facebook ads because this is what completely changed my perspective on Facebook ads and essentially anything and really and You know you've got to take a step back and you got to really learn the psychology of selling the marketing of a product slash service And this is not gonna be a huge lecture on that But basically some few tips and tricks that you know I know and just gonna save you from going have to go get a full degree on Marketing and stuff like that because you do not need that It's all stuff you can do my show you in this video and you know, it's nothing too hard. So the problem is Why people aren't buying from you is not just because you have an awesome or a shit product is because there's no credibility to your name There's no social proof to your name. There's no reason to buy not creating a sense of urgency or demand and you know Sometimes like a product like this, you know, just a shaker bottle There is no urgency in demand to get it Maybe you know with you run some Google ads to it and you catch the people who's actively looking for a shaker bottle but something like this Get some testimonials and stuff of someone using it Coming there and putting it on a site, you know put those reviews on the site make an awesome offer like hey You buy two of these and you get free workout plan or maybe some vitamins or something else actively related to a shaker bottle who Normally doesn't shake your bottle as people in fitness so you can do active stuff like that What's other stuff you can you can follow up with them retarget them with some higher-end coaching and I'm really kind of coaching but higher-end products Higher-level products so the people who buy this Sometimes if they just add to cart you can remarket to them with other products you're doing so But without going too far ahead, let me just kind of show you guys Facebook ads you need to reframe yourself and stop looking at it as just pushing ads out paying money to get it in front of a lot of people and Hope they buy you need to reframe yourself and look at it as a tool to digitize the sales process Let that sink in all it is is a tool to digitize the sales process There's many different ways to digitize the sales process You can use Instagram influencers.

You can use Facebook ads. You can use Instagram ads. You can use Google display ads.

You can use Google search And maybe not like Google search, but It's all tools to use to digitize the sales process. The first thing you do is create awareness and build some report with your audience So which what can you do for that? Well, you can just run a simple PPE campaign or post engagement campaign engagement campaign So you can run software running just an engagement campaign you could probably do you know You know three of those about three of those videos maybe just let's do two to keep it simple But you run some engagement campaign.

So you're selling for instance. I'm doing Facebook ad coaching So what I could do is I run two Facebook ad campaigns to can't put some video content just like this Basically, just create an awareness for who I am building that relationship and through Education I am and providing value I'm building a relationship with them and I'm kind of push it Positioning myself in their mind as ooh, Nick's the Facebook ad expert. So I need to go to Nick and I need Facebook ad stuff So I can start building a relationship and I can do is through this engagement campaign.

So this be engagement Video number one And this will be engagement Video number two so through these two engagement campaigns I've built I'm in the middle right here and I am retargeting as if I can do anything cool right here. No, I can't okay Um right here. So what I'm doing is I'm actively retargeting people in the middle With this video number two right here, I'm actively coming there and retargeting people with This second video so let me explain this real quick So I have this first video right here with some content the second video right here and I'm actively retargeting these people It's probably not the best way to do it So I'm actively retargeting engagement video one people with Video number two so some person of video Watchers video number one So I'm pushing out this one constant right here engagement video number one I'm running it at you know, whatever and I'm actively retargeting 75% of the people who watch this video with engagement video number two so Basically like watching one of my YouTube videos and I'm pushing them down Facebook ads Again, I'm trying to sell Facebook guys coaching.

So this first video will push out, you know, hey You know addressing a media common need or create some awareness. So, you know, maybe a common problem Hey, your Facebook ads ain't working properly because you're not split testing etc, etc, etc And then engagement video number two I'm maybe it's more of a video like this or I'm actually going through and building a split testing thing or you know, maybe I'm going further in on Psychology of split testing and throughout all of this. I'm not offering a single thing.

I'm not offering a single product I'm not offering a single service. I'm not offering a free offer guide download course offer, etc All I'm doing is providing value So then I come there and I keep building these audiences people watch this video people watch this video and now I Can start pushing out something so after they watch two full videos of mine now I'm a target again 75% video watchers Video number two And now I'm gonna target them with some type of free offer some type of guide a lot of people who are on my email marketing list Downloaded free Facebook ads guy to offer so this will be just like a you know free Facebook ads guy or a free guide that addresses That addresses the two issues I've brought up in engagement videos So basically I posted a video addressing hey your ads are stuck in this split testing Video number two. Here's why here's what you gotta do etc, etc, etc Then this free guide is gonna be addressing You know the top ways or basically a video maybe like this or how to set up, you know a specific how to take the first action with split testing so the free guides and solve solve and Solve a pain point um, so maybe they don't know how to take action with split testing Plus Create the next issue So here's the thing once you come there and solve the immediate pain point You need to come there and also what's the next thing?

So if they know how to split test now or at least they know how to the pre framing everything or if you know I pre frame them that they need split testing I showed them how to you know why any split testing so now they're really like damn I need to do certain one split testing It's a serious issue. I need to address Then I come there and put out a free guide. Here's the overlay of how to split test So maybe kind of like something like you guys are people who are watching this on my email marketing list So I created a full overview just like this video of split testing and then um I don't know why I put free guides soul of pain Solving a pain is what I meant, but um, so then I create a guide and everything kind of overviewing everything then what's the next thing?

What's the next logical thing? Well, what about coaching for split testing and you know now you have a free guy and everything What about a five week or six week intensive program that I help you? um I Help you basically Implement split testing into your business you're gonna learn all the steps and processes that I've used and etc etc etc So be a info product and Again, but this time instead of retargeting people who watch the video, we're just gonna retarget people Who download it guide?

So that way we have people And again to split this info product We're just gonna call it six week intensive program Boom boom and we'll sell this info product for 397 So there we go So a free guy and everything and we're gonna start retargeting people with this guy So now this is like a stage to Facebook ads marketer campaign or fact actually You know this is like a stage three because most of these most people just want to run like this free guide and then boom a program but Because we've built some engagement we built some awareness of who I am Of what I do and what I solve like problems I solve in business and then following up with them a free guide We built multi-layerable Basically, you know Trust and stuff, you know, we've engaged them with this first video second video and a free guide So they're a lot more inclined To who I am what I do then just downloading this guide Because there's a lot of people made more marketing lists that I felt to do a building some engagement first and building relationship and just sending them a free guide They took that information ran they don't carry out what else I got But building disengagement and stuff and building, you know, this relationship with some important stuff exactly how a real sales process works Where you know, you call up a prospect and everything you're actually be like, hey, hey, mr. Prospect. Hey, I want six thousand dollars for Facebook ads You know, look at you and go crazy or hey You know, I want this model money that they're not gonna give you money.

They want to work with people who are Inclined to buy from you people, you know, they want to work with people who've already built a relationship with them They know they know Nick really good and stuff like that. They know he's good Facebook ads marketer He's always talking about he's always providing value on his social media and stuff like that You know, I'm cool Giving him shot But anyway without going off to this so this is like a stage two campaign stage, you know, stage three Facebook ads marketer campaign right here So I said a lot of people just run these two But now what's the next step? What will Make this ultimately fail because this will be easy this this free guys I'm easy to get creating the video engagement stuff That's all easy and stuff But the next thing you are missing is the testimonials people want to make sure this shit works before they invest into it so now Retargeting is gonna come in key to get this specific program right here because No one really wants to no one's gonna like buy immediately.

That's that's a given right there. So You may have to come there and do a webinar first So we're gonna invite them from here to this webinar. So I wait through this webinar We can address you know everything you know where they're at now and stuff that you brought them up to speed with the guide and stuff like that So now we might need to actually retarget These leads with a webinar So, um, you know, they might not ultimately buy just yet Yeah, that's fucked up, um, all right, let's see and then you drag this So you may have to retarget them with a webinar and then also what you have to do is With this guide right here You need her everyone who views this info product page You'll need to retarget with testimonials So pushing out testimonials and stuff showing them that other People I've worked it works for other people something else you have to do retarget answering Checkings So you have to start following up these people every which way so you know if you expect just to sell it Immediately it's not gonna work.

You need to come there and start retargeting these people So once they actually view the info products it's just say if you push them from this free guide to the info product You're trying to sell you know, it doesn't work and this could be anything. This could be a Shopify online thing It's gonna be Facebook ads coaching. This can be any type of coaching or consulting you guys do Any type of flex info product anything basically online and even in store, too.

So You can do all this so as soon as they view this page They're gonna start getting hit with testimonials So when people view the info product you can retarget them with testimonials and stuff and you can create sub audiences to where it's like I want to retarget everyone who viewed the info product but did not buy And you can put some contextual retargeting so you can be like, you know, hey, this is John, etc. John John Went through the program, etc Went from making a thousand dollars a month for Facebook ads or from running campaigns that are dissatisfying clients and now giving him raving testimonials You can retarget them with coming up just common objections. So, you know, figure out why people aren't buying What is it because your sales page sucks?

Well, okay, we'll fix that But if it's maybe I don't know if I need split testing that bad then keep reiterating the fact that they need split testing in their business So you're hitting them with multiple different layers of ads And then like I said, you may need like hiring, you know webinar to upsell them and then you can really do the same shit right here You know view people who went to the webinar And then again, you know retarget them with those common objections as well, so This is always to where you kind of building a lot of attention around what you're trying to sell But through Facebook ads you're answering. I mean come on in a sales process you build awareness you Position the offer for them to get and then you're gonna handle the objections and then you get the clothes now With Facebook ads you're basically digitizing the sales process so that way you can you know Position them to get that offer you're gonna track them through engagement video and stuff It's a great awareness for you and then positioning themselves to get that offer and then after you submit the offer to them Sometimes they're not educated enough. So through a webinar you're gonna educate them and You know if they view this product don't go we'll create a web, you know have a webinar follow up with them be like hey, you know full 60 man, you have to test whether you can just push them straight to this, you know sales page or if you need to go ahead and You know after they download that free guide retarget those leads with the webinar to Pre-frame them to that next decision You know hey, this is where they at with split testing now now we need to push them up And go to the next level the you know, this is why you need to testing your business This is why just that free guy you can't just rely on that that to get you the results you want Etc.

Etc. Here you go answering again some struggles and stuff there or having and stuff like that so then once they watch the webinar have them to have it to where they can go straight to the info product online view the link and stuff and then Again everyone who did not buy retarget with testimonials answering comment objections creating more content Credibility for you, you know, how easy it is just to go online and say for instance if you do Facebook ads coaching you can go on Upwork.com. I know this is something I'm trying to do right now Upwork.com there's a lot of different ways to get published and random news sites that add credibility to you You can get colors published on Fox News and stuff like that to be sub channels of Fox, but you can still promote it as Fox News so There's tons of little stuff like that to add credibility and you give me just retargeting these people with all these different types of content and Still using this content to persuade them to get this thing this program and that's all the objections and all the reasons why they won't buy You're building trust you're answering objections sure you're comparing it to other products and stuff like oh You know you think you might want to go work with a consultant just to figure out how to do split testing just download or get into our program We're gonna teach you so and it's be a lot cheaper and you both do it for yourself And you won't be dependent on anyone else for results.

So there's tons of different ways you can do it but this is which you need to be doing if you're selling anything online because You got to build you can imagine that whole sales process imagine you going into a store to buy a high-value product or you know Even just selling a $10 product you have to do all this because people aren't as trustworthy online you so many people getting burned online so you come there and actually go ahead and you know Imagine the whole sales process of building awareness, you know doing the research becoming educated Positioning and submitting the offer to them answering all the objections showing them proof it works Imagine all of that and then how to Incorporate that with Facebook ads and your business to digitize the sales process to have a 24-7 automated system That's selling around the clock for you That's what you gotta imagine when running this type of work and this type of content and stuff Not just running here's my free offer or here's my $300 course buy it now You got to start building this awareness and relationship Solving in giving them some higher level Level you know because it's easy to just to watch videos but then to insert an email that's an immediately drop your conversion rate because you know It's that they have to actually do something then buying a course. That's a whole nother level game So that's why you have to make sure you have all of this so you're not spending 300 and you know, you might even well spend a thousand dollars before you get one sell of 397 But then when you add all of this just retargeting everything and getting leads in a cheap rate everything like that building the rare is building The trust and stuff then you start getting people to purchase about a hundred two hundred dollars Then over time you better get that down through split testing and testing all your ads and stuff like that Etc all the way down to a lot cheaper for rate more affordable rate to keep your business alive Guys pretty much in the video. I don't really have like a specific topic to talk about but I want to help you guys kind of expand your View on Facebook ads and this is what really changed mine because I used to just think Pump money in submitted to send it to a shitty page and I get sales now I look at as how can I go into a business take their full sales process digitize it to do Something that sells 24 7 around the clock That's making them money that then we can just put money in and get out after the full systems laid out.
