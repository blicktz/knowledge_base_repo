yo what's good on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nigg terrier today i have an exciting new video for you guys today i want to show you a new utc platform called incense we've been using it over the last say six months kind of transitioned from billow to this platform and i'll kind of explain why in a little bit this allows us to really scale up our ugc production across all of our clients accounts i really want to show it to you guys i think you guys will absolutely love it uh for a lot of different reasons so with that being said before we get started hit that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday let's get started guys again just a disclaimer um still feeling a little sick so um got the thing so um yeah everything's good long story short um but just a little on the weather so that being said let's dive into the video go on a happy note so this is incense pro so that's what you should call it and like i said we absolutely love it basically it's a ugc platform you work with content creators and it allows you to really scale up your ugc content production for your brand or brands if you're an agency working with the client side right there so what does ugc well long story short it's basically just people creating content with products um you send them uh it's called user generated content and it's not typically high production it's just them using their phone and using the product and documenting it with the phone um obviously you can see right here one particular one right here i'm just kind of going on in the background of this particular girl showing off this hair um health plan right here so long story short it's that's what ugc is if you live in the rock what makes ugc so powerful though is that 50 of consumers trust ugc more than a standard ad just because it's really authentic organic things like that and we'll typically see um anywhere up to 100 to 200 better click-through rates and return on ad spin so it's really native to the platform it's really trustworthy it's very organic it's very natural doesn't feel like an ad and we get a higher click-through rate higher robust cut down your advertising costs all that good stuff right there so really strong benefits if you're just getting into ugc so why incense though let me just take you through the platform first before i go into why but again we've since then transitioned from billow specifically to incense now so there's a few different plans on it it's a definitely a little bit more expensive than billow but the features you get versus billow is very um big differences some features like being able to pick your creators being able to look at your creators instagram profiles before you get to work with them being able to chat with the creators on a one-to-one basis before you get to work with them um getting to set your own budget of how much you want to set up talk with the creators like those are some big things right there um but yeah we're on like the quarterly package it quarterly package of advanced that's just because we're working with seven different brands um that um you know we're working with so basically we're on a higher package so now going into it simply obviously you need to sign up do whatever book a call uh yada yada yada so this is when you actually get to the platform right here which you get in so let me just show you guys the creator marketplace first before we actually fill out a brief because this is one of my favorite aspects right here of this is the fact that you get to get actual access to the creators instagram whereas billow you can't do that that's one of my biggest things so you can see just some of the creators in here and we can go a little bit more specific they have creators on instagram youtube and tick tock so let's say we're going to go find someone on instagram the location you can either do the location of their audience or like are the location of the creator we want primary united states creators gender maybe we want a female creator age i don't know let's just say 20 to 30 years old if you want to do ethnicity if you need to followers a minimum of 20 000 followers again if you're just giving them to shoot a video for you it doesn't necessarily need to really care about the followers but if you want to use this as an influencer platform and because that's also another thing you can do is you can pay these people to shoot like content with your product and you get to keep it and it never goes on their profile um it's gonna be substantially less to do that but if you want them to actually repurpose that content on their instagram profile and act as an influencer you can also do that and it's gonna cost a little bit more just because they're posting on their profile that they know it's a monetary incentive for you like you're gonna make money off of this so they're obviously gonna charge you more for that but then there's also on top of that white listing and if you're not familiar with white listing white listing is basically the act of using that influencers profile page and running ads through it so basically you run ads through that page right there and you can essentially you know use their page basically to run ads out of simple as that so you can just see some right here and you can also do engagement right too if you want price as well again price on this platform are a little bit more expensive you know we've we pay creators anywhere from 50 to 200 for what we need but again that just goes off so many different factors so you really realistically you can't just kind of go based off just that um and you can kind of see there's some that are a little bit more expensive but again this could be for like actual like uh publishing on their profile as well so that's not just that's not just um you know like again average price per standard post so that's for them to post and everything like that so don't base it off that or um you know you get kind of the wrong impression on things so long story short a lot of really cool stuff and again you can actually like click on their profile view full profile um get a little bit of like information on their stuff but you also can check out their instagram right there as well so let's just show you that right there so so the reason why check out their instagram is important is because before we work with this particular creator right here um we we like to see how well they create content and also on top of how well they create content but um other brands they've worked with what's some of their standard content look like that and we can also get some ideas of what they have access to so yeah so just to show you some of the quality of the creators now let's actually go and create something like let's go create a campaign that we can um you know utilize so fill out a brief right here uh that's basically how you do it so you'll choose your brand so you you have to input the brand so basically campaign name so this is what the creator will see um inside their little database to bid on jobs essentially i recommend you use a campaign name that actually sells the product too so for this particular brand right here they have this one product that we got some ugc videos for and basically uh the first brief we did was like personalized metal infinity sign and it didn't really get many creators and then the second time i relaunched it and i put the perfect gift for couples and the perfect gift for couples outperform significantly so you almost have to do a little bit of marketing of the campaign itself uh to get more creators also the higher quality creators so just be just understand that right there um that could be big right there too so perfect gift for couples you can also drop a campaign cover right here it's basically just a little image right here so i recommend just utilizing your product anything like that um yeah so now campaigns hype do you want this to be an influencer partnership or do you want to do custom content creation and that's a big thing right there so an influencer partnership right there is going to be basically where you're hiring these content creators to create content and post it on their instagram and their like stories things like that or youtube or tick tock you know whatever platform uh custom content creation on the other hand this is where um we're giving them um they're just creating content for us sending it to us and then that's it call it a day so let's just say if we want to do that um and we want to do instagram campaign objective uh we want it more like salesy so you know long story short conversions like i i really don't haven't seen a big difference in these right here you know uh basically just what do we want we want conversions maybe we want app installs maybe we want more traffic brand right and stuff like that um i i personally haven't seen a big difference selecting these it's because at the end of the day the content creator is just going to basically look at the brief and then with that brief right there create a video on it so that objective right there doesn't really do anything it's not it's like i'm not optimizing for anything here in terms like facebook and stuff payment method so you can do money or you can do product i'm gonna do just money right here so like if you have a you know if you have a high ticket product and you want to give people just the product itself and because it's a high ticket product like obviously completely understand but if you have a product that's like ten dollars and you're not going to expect to get a 300 video for 10 bucks so you can get um away by just offering the product but you'll tend to get a lower quality of creator as well so something else to look at right there how many creators do you want to hire so just how many you can leave this blank for like an infinite amount you don't have to hire all of them just basically uh when the project will close price cap per creator so how much are you willing to pay each creator so it might be 10 bucks and you might have a really amazing product to where like sometimes you even put like zero um just because again the product's so good you don't want to pay them anything um i found a sweet spot about 100 to 200 um for a higher tier creator that is um in terms of quality um basically the way they work like they're very thoughtful in the work and stuff like that um they take each job a little more serious so you have to play around with that again if your product's 300 bucks you might be able to just do the product if your product's 50 bucks you might have thought or put 100 bucks on top of that so it just depends you're gonna have to play around with it and figure it out for yourself can't tell you what to do we started at 50 got some pretty good results at 50 then i went to 100 knows a big 90 day difference at 100 and i've gone all the way up to 200 and 200 from 100 to 200 i didn't really notice a big difference but maybe more of just them using a higher quality camera um or cell phone something like that so campaign timing um this is more if you want to kind of like you know do like influencer partnerships and stuff and only need it for a specific time period uh so i just put that unlimited right there for custom content creation product delivery so we'll handle the shipment to creators um don't don't do all this like just ship the product to the creator if you're an agency um simply just tell the client to send the product to the creator if you are a um econ brand just simply ask for email address and send the product to them simple as that so um very short product description so a perfect gift for couples um our personalized metal infinity sign our personalized metal infinity sign is a great gift to showcase love for each other something random just a little bit of description just a little short one sentence description on what your product is now who do you want who do you want to work with um okay so i only want to use people in the united states due to shipping there's a specific category um they have a ton of different categories you know maybe it's like home and garden food and drinks health and wellness maybe if i'm like doing like a sport and fitness brand can you like health wellness and sports and fitness so you just like a few different categories too if you want you don't have to select just one i tend to leave this blank for certain products that are very broad but if i know specifically if i'm going after like a sports person i'm gonna go after like sports and fitness people but for this particular product it's a very broad product um so again she's gonna have to depend on your product gender if i want a specific gender maybe it's female or female right here again age what level of creator do you want to work with you want to work an 18 year old do you want to work with a 50 year old like you want to work with 30 year old like who do you want for a creator obviously 20 and 30 is be the biggest group of people um this particular product 20 and 30 years old actually works really well so like i can choose that again i'm not doing an influencer deal so i care less about followers but if i'm doing influencer deal i may care about followers um again if ethnicity if it's if ethnicity is related to the product in any way um and you need to choose ethnicity you can um an engagement rate so um i if i'm doing an influencer deal um i like two percent or higher find two percent works pretty well but again engagement rates really big right there it's basically just a percentage of like likes comments and stuff to like followers and reach all that fun stuff i forgot how exactly it's calculated but again it's more towards an influencer specific deal right there yeah and then you can manually pick creators if i want to invite people specifically to it and now you're going to start getting down to this and this is going to be kind of overwhelming for a second but i'm gonna break it down for you right there so so here is what you're basically going to your creative assets so this is what the creator will do this is where i prefer this over like billow for example because billow does not give you this level of control it just does not so this is where i can get like hyper specific of what i want so let's say for example i want a horizontal video um or vertical video i typically do a lot of vertical videos because i can crop that to a 4x5 and that's my facebook ads and i can also leave it as a vertical video that says 9 by 16 and that's all my instagram stories reels and stuff like that for instagram stories instagram reels tick tock reels snapchat all that fun stuff so vertical video actually is the most like one that you can utilize across multiple placements really don't care um i can do stories or feeds or reels um but there's some new stories now creatives number of creatives let's say for example if i want this particular creator to do three different vertical videos i'm gonna put that uh creator up creatives up right there so now what should creators do right here it's a big thing right here this is where i see so many comments of people saying oh i tried billow or i tried incense and it did not work and then i'm like okay tell me your brief and their brief is something like a one sentence of unbox the product these creators will do whatever you want to do so it's a freaking hammer right here or a pen this pen can be used in so many different ways and if i sit there and stare at it and be like oh it's not writing for me well no shit you have to pick it up and you actually have to plan out what you want to write in your head and then write that out same thing right here um i see this all the time groups them in yada yada yada you got to tell these creators what to do okay so this is where i'd recommend go and check my video from last week where it's like facebook and facebook and add uh tick tock creatives 2022 that convert or how to plan them out that convert i literally give you a storyboard template where you can actually plan out creatives and you can actually shoot that back up into here with your actual planning of each creative so what should creators do all right let me tell you this you're gonna a few things here where you can break this down to two groups you have your scenes so this is like unboxing the product in the kitchen um using the product in a well lit place uh grabbing the product out of the mailbox so that's a scene now points to hit on okay these are the specific and this is what i recommend it so you have your scenes you want them to do what what do you want them to do you want them to film in the house you want to film at the gym do you want them to film in your car like where do you want them to film at that's what a scene is okay this scene right here you're watching right now i'm in my office filming a youtube video okay points to hit on these are the specific points on your product that you want them to hit on do not expect the creator to go sit down and read your mind of what points to hit on if you want them to say hey i recommend everyone trying this product then make sure you sit put in the points to hit on hey everyone trying this product this is the most perfect gift for my husband again because i'm a female right here talking about a perfect gift for couples there we go points to hit on okay so basically i'm giving them scenes that they need to film and then i'm also giving them points to hit on i find this works best for me because i'm not giving them a word by word script i'm just saying hey these are the scenes we would like and these are the points i want you to hit on and you can even put like you know the above does not need in order so that way they can have some level of storytelling aspect that they have their own ideas and bring to the product and give you a more of that organic feeling so that's what i like to do um makes it super easy for me once you start working for creative or creator for a little period of time you can reach back out to them and say hey we love that video you done could you shoot just like three or four more videos and just have fun with it okay so you can give them a little bit more of that creative freedom stuff like that and then also too since i'm creating three videos right here i can put in each i can put like notes right here and i can put in each video do something different for the intro to get our attention there you go perfect all right now this is technical requirements look i don't need to go through here like obviously you know like this is all like the specific requirements video length like that's something you should hit on so if you want a 30 second long video or a five minute long video i like to tell people no longer than three to five minutes because um are no longer than like 60 seconds like 60 seconds to three minutes that's a good one right there because we we can do this is it kind of forces the creator to say a little bit more about our product and we can use our video editor to kind of go around and change things up technical requirements uh no music add it so that way they don't really add any music to it because if they add some music to we find some creators will do this every now and then where they'll add music to it like that's big right there let's see uh no music at it and put that right there another thing too please make sure to talk about the points um every now and then we'll get a creator that like maybe doesn't speak english and we'll say all these points right here and um and basically like they'll just do like text overlays so make sure you talk about all the points no text overlays things like that and also too there's a specific language you need make sure you put that must speak english so what creators should avoid look there's a few examples right here you know like different things you can read through it figure those out um for me i barely put anything right here but i'll put like just you know just a selfie it's not allowed so again you put whatever you want i find that uh less is more starting off so just put a few like barely key things and once you start to notice the same thing happening over and over with your product start to add those as either a technical requirement or uh something that they should avoid references so if you actually go ahead save uh ad example like this if you save it and then um you know actually upload it back or upload it here that way they can actually utilize this as a reference um for their ad so yeah now that's basically it and then basically from there you can like send off everything you know basically everything's good to go and you can send to review something else that's really cool about here is that you can add one more creative assets so you can add other creative assets to this batch like creative asset number two right here and i can basically film out another thing so let's say i want images um and it's for stories say i want three images four images and i can add more stuff to that order so i can have one particular person shoot three vertical videos four photos and then maybe another vertical video so i can have them do a big batch of content with it but again then my price need to be a little bit higher because there's more work on their uh side right there so yeah so this is basically in central here and i want to show you all what happens after you submit your brief so after you submit your brief right here i already submit this for another client stuff like that these are some clients right here i've already worked with or some um you know people i've already worked with but basically you'll get a kind of this process right here where you can go through every single one so you can go through your few you creators right here and i'm not going to go through all of them just because i don't want to expose people's addresses and stuff like that um and you can basically like click on hire right here and then you have this open text tool to where you can even chat with these creators right now which is really cool so you can chat with a creative creator about ideas he or she has before even hiring them which is really cool you can also view their profile and again you can see some of their content stuff like that on instagram all that fun stuff right here well unfortunately this one's not found but you click on their instagram and it's it's 90 90 of all the creators have their instagrams linked where you can see some of their stuff um you can also see some of the stuff that i guess they have like uploaded to incent right here in terms of content they've done um you can also see some reviews for the creator things like that audience what their audience is like if you're going to use them as an influencer so yeah so it's really cool very very very powerful tool um again we switched over from billow to instant just one due to the quality we want to choose our creators we want to basically choose our creators uh we also want more control of talking with the creator and creating longer partnerships so like billow if we found a creator that worked really well uh it was very difficult or impossible i think to even like utilize them again maybe i just want to shoot him a message and say hey i want to use you again i couldn't do that below maybe i want a few selfies with a product couldn't do that maybe i want multiple different videos couldn't do that now granted below is a lot faster you're still going to see about two to three week turnaround time so from the moment i fill out a brief and send it off it's going to take about two to three weeks before i get that because think about you have about a week to pick out creators you have a week to send a product you have a week for the creators to shoot the product and then your third end of the third week is when you start to get that content back so just be worried about that right there so but yeah other than that i absolutely love incense yes it is more expensive so i definitely recommend um you know for agencies that pumping out a lot of ugc production especially brands that are doing at least 25k off again there's no there's no like if you can afford it you can afford it there's no criteria in terms of like actually getting on board but highly recommend this to really pump up your content production pump up your content production stuff like that you get more creatives that you can utilize and ads more ads more ad creatives faster you'll find a winner faster you find a winner faster you can scale up your brand so long story short we love this we charge our clients as an extra package for this so we do this for our clients but we charge them for a full extra package so we don't actually go ahead and like you know um put this in our service fee we have a separate package that we charge clients for ugc production on a monthly basis essentially like that and that also includes our editing team editing things like that so yeah guys really hope you all enjoyed this video make
