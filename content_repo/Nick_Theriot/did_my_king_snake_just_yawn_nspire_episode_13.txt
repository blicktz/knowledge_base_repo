I finally facing it all Fearless Buddy you want to say hi to the vlog. hey there buddy ahhh Ari? Hey girl Whoaaa You need a bath what is going on guys welcome back to the channel uh today is currently sunday about to start off this morning with two scoops of iso surge this is a completely new brand never used our protein before uh but it's mint chocolate chip and i've been craving this protein for months now so finally found me some i'm gonna put two scoops in there and i'll start off that maybe with like a bagel or something like that but today is our one week weigh-in so let's see we are currently down 154.2 so this is my also my lowest weigh-in so far uh so now we got we're officially nine pounds away from this diet to be in and we still got like 10 weeks to go so taking it slow still cleaning it up had chick-fil-a yesterday so definitely not completely there yet and uh yes and i'm gonna go ahead and start editing actually yesterday's vlog we'll jump into that now so phoenix is currently in shed right now you can see him up in there and i want to kind of just mist out the cage um i'm not gonna feed him today just because he's been like this for the past few days he's pal as it goes so because he's in shed i wanted to kind of just kind of mist on the cage put a little water in it um just lightly just to help with humidity and stuff and also keep everything moist for him um help him out a little bit i don't have a spray bottle so somebody just poked a hole in a water bottle just lightly mist the cage a little bit just just to get some humidity i don't really soak it but just get some uh kind of humidity and stuff keeping it nice and moist for him but otherwise everything else looking good there you go he's coming out there you go you can see how milky his eyes are and because they're so milky that's how you know that's another sign too they're in shed also his whole box look he's yawning that is so cool i finally got him a yawn on camera that is crazy looks like he's licking the water off the wood so i do have to say this protein powder super freaking good it tastes exactly what i want it i was like a mint chocolate chip currently right now i am just chilling in bed watching it's a movie called code 8 i have no clue what it is about it just started it but uh sundays in reality is like the first sunday actually vlog i don't really do anything i edit the vlog in the morning and sundays are usually my only day i let myself completely chill out i may do a little bit of work i'm trying to catch up on some reading and stuff i did just update my like weekly check-in see you guys can see that boom red is today my red on the west one i took today i am currently two pounds down since my since last sunday so that's good like i said we got this is the end of week 11 so we got 10 more weeks to go to lose 10 pounds so i lost two pounds this weekend i really didn't even try so we're just going to continue to do what i can optimize my diet and uh i'm really just trying to lose slow just maybe a pound a week very slow maybe even three quarters of a pound i know the last month i'm really going to tie it deep push my cardio higher still eating maintenance calories with 20 minutes cardio a day so nothing crazy and uh yeah that's kind of like update on the diet right now chill day it's been a little while now kind of rested up watched a movie and i just finished cooking actually got some ground beef cooked up i just used outside cooked on a propane burner got some onions bell peppers some mushrooms in there that was about to be bad i was about to go all the way over there um and also got some chicken i could just finish cooking up too and then some nice bell peppers not bell peppers yeah oh wow brussels sprouts we got some nice brussels sprouts in the oven too i know the lens is all fogged up right now but uh and then we got some rice so try to stay on our diet for the next few days all right now we got roughly probably 250 300 grams of white rice uh some brussels sprouts and roughly about five to six ounces of chicken right there i didn't wait i just kind of eyed it just because i'm really hungry and uh i'm really severely down with carbs but here we go this is meal number two for today so i didn't really film much pretty much the rest of the day i just i chilled i took a bath a margarita yeah i need to start treating this diet more seriously and i know it's a consistent work in progress i've never had this issue before where i had like to work on the diet it's just like day one focus boom but i think just now it's just so much different there's been a lot of things going on even though i've been home it still just feels like there's been a lot going on and uh really it's just my discipline my discipline isn't there right now on the diet and i need to straighten that up and i need to focus on that this week i am making progress which is good i lost two pounds last week even just today i had a low weigh-in after eating not necessarily shit the past few days but kind of just gauging different things where i was eating so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video i don't really do much on sunday so it really wasn't much to vlog our document and uh yeah well uh i have a little bit
