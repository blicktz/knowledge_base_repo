This 3D Dismonochrome one is absolutely insane. It tastes it's probably one of my favorite flavors of 3D by far and I thought that was gonna be hard to beat the green one because that one was really good. So we are headed to the shop today we got a very busy day and I'm gonna take you guys with me let's go.

All right it's been a few hours now since y'all seen that last clip of me leaving my house and stuff I pretty much got to the office and since I got to the office I've been pretty busy catching up on work and I want to show you guys something real quick so I like the very first thing I came in and did was do all my following up and stuff with agency prospects inside like ActiveCampaign. I freaking love ActiveCampaign just due to the organization and stuff I can make a whole video on this another day but something really really cool to show you guys is how I'm incorporating like the Fibonacci sequence in my follow-up and like to be honest guys there's no perfect timing to follow up with people in terms of like hey follow up with them every day every other day I like to kind of keep it random and I needed a way to kind of structure that randomness in a sense so I'm using the Fibonacci sequence in terms of like hey one day follow-up two days later three days later five days eight days etc so highly recommend checking that out. Yo this coronavirus shit is really getting wild check this shit out this is I'm literally just trolling through it's like our local news area all K-12 public schools closed through April 13th guys recording of this video today is March 13th that is absolutely insane as a whole month holy shit this is this will be the end of the world this will be we're gonna be turning into the Cloverfield pandemic when all those aliens and the guys are just running around with a camera this will be me so hope you guys are enjoying the videos make sure you drop a like every like you'll drop a person gets cured of coronavirus all right boys that new Call of Duty Warzone just dropped so it's Friday it's at the office it's slow so you know who's about to get that Merc which is me I'm about to be horrible so I brought this PlayStation to the small PlayStation I brought to the shop about three four months ago and this is the very first time I'm actually playing it and I'm thankful for the guys for putting it updating for me major update we're all trash in this game mode wasn't just me pulling it in pulling it in but DJ DJ looks like an honorary member of Cajun studs now I look professional salesperson look look on Monday everybody's gonna have to wear this all right so we're gonna get DJ's car pulled in so Patchman can finish it so I can finally wash my car we're headed to Carson coffee tomorrow me and DJ we're trying to get the cars ready for tomorrow it's my turn now let's get this car clean here we go let's do a start up you guys real quick quick little before how bad this thing is it's really not that better but fortunately I gotta pick I gotta clean it today guys are busy so let's see probably honestly won't do too much filming so there's really no place to put a camera but I'll show you guys some after footage of it but just got the car finished hope you enjoyed that little bit of b-roll definitely not a full detail or anything but it's a quick basic hand wash getting ready for cars and coffee tomorrow so hope you guys enjoyed it we are gonna head out now all right guys I totally drove past the gym and straight to Taco Bell I was freaking starving I barely ate today and had like one meal just like some chicken and some rice and they're really like carbs and fats and stuff but I'm at super one right now and it's freaking crazy right now with everyone with this coronavirus shit and everything and look I am here just to get a special gift for someone in my life right now that's been you know putting a smile on my face and everything and I want to kind of show a little appreciation just a little something never really did anything for her yet since we've been started talking like almost two months ago and I want to do a little something so I'm here at super one hopefully they have some flowers that's what I'm hoping to get if not then I'm have to figure out something else so let's go check out what they got and see if there's anything left I mean I know the toilet paper is gone so people might be trying to wipe their ass with like flowers now so we'll see one was not happening literally walked in and all of the lines were at least 20 30 people deep each full of that that's just full of stuff like people are literally acting like it's the end of the world right now and I was not about that so we gotta figure out a plan B you know I really don't enjoy cleaning my car but when I come outside and I just see this amazing gloss it just makes it so much better like worth it like check look at that shot right there bam all right guys we're at Walgreens and this is round two of trying to attempt of getting something some type of gift or something like that let's see what we can go get all right so I got an idea I'm totally right by Lowe's so I think I'm gonna run in to see if I can grab one of those like potted plants so I look you have no clue what I'm looking for but we'll see we'll find something I know when I see it I'm gonna know what to get all right I think I found something the move right here we got these they look a hell lot better in person all right it's because the vlog will want to know how'd you like the flowers loved it I loved them love them all right guys sushi masa or sushi is the move tonight it's nine nine o'clock and they close at 10 30 so we're hoping to harp and go in order a few rolls and get out we're assholes so when your girlfriend orders one roll shut up and then I order four all to myself the amazing thing about this place if you're never been I don't know if there's like in other places they have sushi masa but you pay one price and it's all you can eat sushi with a appetizer and dessert all included and a drink the best place ever and the sushi is pop for all you can eat trust not what you see broken spirit try and move me find no place sushi masa hit as always and in fact I'm actually going to end the video right here because we got an early morning tomorrow we're going to cars and coffee and we got a big day planned tomorrow so we'll see you guys tomorrow haha
