I'm finally facing it all, fearless What's going on bros? Welcome back to the vlog Currently right now smashing out a work session I actually ended up getting up today at 7 o'clock this morning And just trying to optimize my schedule now So I know that's something when I'm excited about When I do move into my apartment I'm kind of fine-tuning my schedule a lot better So I'm trying to get in the rhythm of it now But simply start off at 7 o'clock Jumped right into a cold shower, did my meditation 8 o'clock, started my work block And I'm doing an 8 to 2 o'clock work block No food, completely fasted Just to keep me not tired, focused I get way more focused on a fasted stomach Versus when I'm full of carbs and stuff, I'm not as focused But right now I am going fucking insane Because they are currently re-going the roof right now on our house So you can, I don't know if y'all can see that at all Let me fix that They are re-going the roof and that's all just trash and stuff Taking off the old roof And I'm going, I'm going absolutely insane right now Even with the Bose Quiet Comforts It is no match for their hammers and no guns, etc. And all the shit they're taking off the roof All the old shingles and stuff So this has been a very frustrating morning Especially when I hopped in a Zoom call this morning With a very high-end client I say high-end client You know, they sell They're a luxury brand in New York That sells suits for women And yeah, it was not fun With all my calls today so far Hey, here's a lot of bang in the background I know, I know, I know It's all in your end, not mine Joking So yeah, so right now I did have a few calls I just had a team call real quick Running, working on the ads This first six hours work block I purely wanted just for Terry Go Solutions So that way I can grow my agency Do things for my agency and stuff And now, kind of starting to fizzle out a little bit Kind of get all the big tasks out the way Now I'm starting to work on the little tasks Little things I can do inside the agency Yeah, we'll hit up a workout in a bit I don't know what I'm going to do with workouts today I think back It'll be a nice little back day today And we'll try to stay on our diet So, let's Alrighty guys, welcome to today's back workout I'm going to apologize now Because I am a little like congested Or just like, yeah From allergies and stuff But yeah, this isn't a long back workout at all First thing I did was start off with some lat pulldown Or pushdowns With just some bands And what it is Is I have a pull-up bar Which you'll see in the third exercise And I have the bands just kind of suspended from it So that way I can kind of have me like a pulldown machine I do have to say Doing pulldowns like that Or pushdowns like that Was very complicated I don't know I just I feel like I don't get the same type of Movement Like as if I'm using a V-bar At a gym Or a straight bar at a gym Or like a rope To do lat pushdowns So Next movement I went into Is a single arm lat pulldown And I couldn't get Like right under The pull-up bar Because it just The band was way too loose So I couldn't really Actually do the movement correctly So what I did was I backed up Further away from the bar And leaned over So that way I can still kind of get that The movement like I want And then it puts a lot more Tension on the band So that way I can feel like I can do a little bit more Weight instead And I did switch over to my black band Because the black band Does have a lot more tension on it And it's a little stronger So that way like I said Just really get that movement So and this is a really good movement Right here I love starting off my workout With either this movement Or the lat pushdowns So I do that for every single back day And I spot like favorite two exercises Just keep my lats activated And a little bit of my upper back Activated as well Now next movement right here In fact you can actually see a lot better Or more clear of a picture Of the you know How the bands are just kind of suspended From the pull-up bar Super easy setup Nothing complicated Just be careful with the pull-up bar you have That doesn't like break it Or you know Come undone And fling at your face Or something But yeah I just want an upright row And then I'm After about ten of those I do an underhand reverse grip row I guess what you call it And yeah And this felt really good It's just activating that upper mid back Hitting the lats And yeah And you'll notice I like to do a lot of these band movements first Because now we're going to go ahead And jump into A pull-up And pull-up for me This is like My heavier weight Right now Because It's just I don't know I don't really have anything else heavy But uh So yeah Once I get my back Nice and loosened up Activated Got a good pump in there And then went straight to pull-ups And then after that I went into A nice little dumbbell row Single arm Dumbbell row Something super simple You could probably try to do this With bands At home Possibly You know Maybe Put the band Down somewhere Step on it And do a pull-up I mean a row So Best of luck For you If you have that And yeah And then The last movement Right here We're gonna jump into Is A reverse fly I really love Going towards the end of the workout Doing these Because it really just helps Hit that Like mid-back For me Mid-upper back And yeah And that was pretty much The whole workout Nothing super complicated Nothing I guess you could say It's a little bit more On the easier side But I guess For at home Did a pretty good job So I hope you guys enjoyed This little workout Hope you guys enjoyed This back workout I know this video Was very short today But I just wanted to jump Straight into A back day today Focused purely On that topic Today Didn't really have
