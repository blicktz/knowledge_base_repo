What is going on beautiful people of YouTube welcome today's vlog I don't really know where we're gonna start at but in my room right now about to crush out a work block probably do a four-hour work block and if you don't know about my work blocks I do 45 minutes on 15 minute breaks breaks just whatever I want to do during that period of time and 45 minutes on of intense activity and focus got some stuff to catch up on with the digital agency working on a few ad creatives launching new ad creatives for one particular client and as well as we have some sales actions some follow-ups and stuff to do as well as a few new prospects on the LinkedIn work block essentials is the 3d glass of water Bose headphones we get the MacBook Pro all right so first 45 minutes is done so now I'm gonna do is our already went do is grabbing our glass of water so I can maintain my water intake and now I'm actually gonna hop in bed and do a little bit of reading like I said like a 15 minute break personally we prefer to like have a chair to read in but obviously look at the size of my room this is the working space I got I don't have a place to really put a chair and I bet it's the next thing and I like to just kind of like change up where I'm sitting at so that way because some people are like why I'm just reading chair well you know what I like to switch up get a different place and also kind of helps like refresh the mind and your little 15 minute work block or 15 minute breaks and I would give this work session probably like a six out of ten because I think it could kind of distract it and end it like two hours early all right everything is perfect well that phone what let's go get let's go play let's go play let's go fix this up real quick there we go now they can see you ready ready ready go get it real quick there we go what what you want so I gotta do like him oh now you can hang from it and see if uh no it supports up to a thousand pounds well not the beans but there we go now I just have to clip it on when it gets in and this is good I probably have stuff all over my face good you're good awesome so guess who just totally got here and brought us some amazing iced coffee me this is jet coffee if you guys never had that it's absolutely amazing what you got you got the I got cloud nine and then I got you a jet fuel I'm about to be wired so it's actually been a few hours now um you know since Kennedy actually saw that last clip Kennedy came over we pretty much just chilled watched a few movies and had some coffee and stuff and relaxed with the family and stuff but it's actually like 11 o'clock right now and I'm actually kind of like planning tomorrow and kind of putting a schedule together kind of like routine just because I'm doing a lot more work from home now and I want to have like a routine that keeps me moving so that way I don't feel I don't get lazy I don't just feel kind of I don't know just getting happy to be at home and just unproductive and stuff I want to have something I can follow that keeps me on track of what I'm trying to go after so let me show you guys what I've been working on so here's kind of the sketch I'll put together um eight o'clock wake up you know shower run meditate boom boom work block work block work block boom boom boom boom boom boom and uh yeah and it kind of incorporates everything in there as you can see um I want to try to get eight hours of sleep so that's why I have that boom 12 o'clock at a time so yeah so I'm gonna try to like fill this in together and like I actually had some notes for tomorrow so I can like come in and hit it hard and yeah guys I just uh I feel right now that I have an opportunity it's um today they announced more closures for businesses and stuff and to be honest guys like this doesn't sound very fucked up but I like the idea of just staying home all the extractions are limited like I can't go eat at a restaurant so I can't go blow money I'm literally just at home stuck working my business and I want to maximize this I'm I'm calling it right now a fucking opportunity because you can have two perspectives on it you can have this one perspective of oh my god the government's shit they're making us stay home they can't control us all this negative emotion anger builds up I can't pay my bills blah blah blah blah and like rants on Facebook or take a deep breath relax assess this next 30 days maybe maybe even 60 days however long assess what you got in front of you do you want to go these next 60 days and just have watched Netflix this whole time or would you rather focus on with the resources you have at hand and maximize what you can do with those resources for me it's time for me it's staying home and working on my online business to me it's all these distractions eliminated so I can purely focus on this online business for me it's an opportunity and as fucked up as that sounds I'm going to take advantage of it because in life that's all what I've always done I've always taken advantage of what the opportunities I have in front of me I've always seen everything as opportunities it's called an abundance mindset figure out how to adapt to that but try to think abundantly never think of a scarcity mindset because the more scarcity of a mindset you have you're going to lose more in your life or if you have abundance mindset you're going to attract more in your life so I don't know that's just my perspective and that's how I'm handling this whole situation so I've been maximizing it you know I've built up this I start running I've never been a runner I've been enjoying it I've been boxing more um you know I've been just really focused on my business and I'm trying to maximize that time maximize the opportunity and see where things can take me but yeah I'm in this box here today and I don't know I feel like the vlogs are going to change a lot now because I want to the whole reason why I started this vlogging thing was for me to document my journey as a young entrepreneur because I have no clue where I'm going to go but I want to be able to look back in 10 years and see what I came from essentially something we all wish we could do and that's why I'm starting this vlog because I want to be able to go in 10 years look back at these videos and be like wow I've came a long way or maybe opposite maybe I take a total huge downhill I want you guys to be able to come with me I want to grow together I don't want these vlogs to ever seem like haha this is me this is what I'm doing this is you can't do this etc I want this to be hey we're on a journey together whether it's you doing just trying to get through school whether it's you trying to get a job promotion whether it's you just trying to get fit I want us to be together working towards becoming better selves because that's all that's about thank you guys for watching and I'll see you tomorrow
