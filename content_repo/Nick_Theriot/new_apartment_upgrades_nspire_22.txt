I'm finally facing it all Fearless What's up guys? Welcome back to the car Come on now Come on now Let's get what we came for Let's get what we came for Let's get what we came for Let's get what we came for Let's get what we came for Yo, what's up guys? Welcome back to the vlog Currently right now I'm about to hop into a consulting call And this particular person has already done a consulting call with me We've gotten some results and stuff And now I'm hopping back on another call with them This time I'm actually going to try to push on them a little bit more To actually become a client of ours because We've gotten results in the first call with free knowledge And now he wants to continue coming back for more knowledge So I'm not going to let that happen for too much longer But now I want to start kind of pushing him into Hey, let's hop in a consulting package Let's hop into a consulting deal And we'll continue to help you out And then like have a bad day and then scale it back down Usually what you do is you want to just kind of tweak a few of those creatives and stuff Because you're constantly scaling like doing this It's hard for Facebook Facebook likes consistency So it's hard for it to you know kind of like Okay one day I'll optimize for $100 a day And then it'll take about three days before it to fully optimize for that $100 a day And if on the second day it's performing bad then you drop it again On that third day I never had time to fully optimize for that budget And I could throw off and play around with the budget Or if there was the results I'm going to get out of the meeting Letting that zoom recording convert So that way I can send it over to the person I'm meeting with But I just kind of put a deal together on the spot I guess you could say This particular person like I said they've already had a free call with me This call will hop on the other one Dude they just got so much stuff that they need to work on with the retargeting side Of the Facebook ads and everything And basically just started But again just hammering them with value and information and stuff Showing them the prompts they need to situate And they're just like yo What would it cost me just to let you do this for me?

And I pretty much put a deal together I was like look I don't do this often I wish I really don't But you know I put a deal together I was like hey I'll charge you a fifth of what I normally charge To the end of the month So regardless of when you start it'll be to the end of the month The longer you wait Obviously the more time that you're going to lose to accept my author One flat fee It's a really promising ad account So I'm willing to charge a lot less Just to get this ad account running and rolling and stuff So that way I can start getting results ASAP So and scaled up and they become really good client And probably do the same exact thing for another call I got it 6.30 today Where I'm literally just going to hit them with the same exact thing So check out the macros on these hash browns Zero grams of fat, 15 grams of carbs Absolutely insane Obviously all your fat comes from your cooking oil Which I don't really use too much for this type of thing Also using lean ground beef So really the only fats are going to come from the cheese and the eggs Check this out I got hash browns, ground beef, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers Two eggs just on top of everything And it's looking fine Alright so it's currently like 3 o'clock I'm about to start diving into some more work Send some video pictures, record some video pictures And we're going to do a 3 o'clock to 6.30 work block Or 3.30, yeah 3 o'clock to 7 o'clock work block So I do have a consulting call at 6.30 And then we'll leave and go chill with my girlfriend etc So pretty much the plan so far today Phoenix is also chilling in the tank Vibing Let's see if we can go Oh, hey dude How you doing? How you doing? How are you?

I'm chilling Good boy Video pictures Recorded and stuff I uploaded to YouTube And I am actually going to go try to run now I am not looking forward to this at all I feel so out of shape right now But we'll see how it happens I'll see you guys soon Guys, currently sitting back down I went run I didn't really film anything while running Took a bath And I don't have to say my run went pretty damn well I was able to like at least I don't know I did about a 30 minute run At least 10 out of the 20 Or 20 out of the 30 minutes I was running I had about 10 minutes of walking So just out of shape Getting there About to open a consulting call now Hopefully I can kind of maybe put something towards it To where You know, we can work out some other deal We can eventually close and work together So we'll see how that goes And yeah Otherwise sales are absolutely dominating today For one of my clients A thousand dollars spent $3,800 in sales So very profitable And just keeping things moving forward See you guys soon Different visuals Announcing the sale Hey we're running 20% off You know, until this date Again, that's why I like to keep it really sharp Because it increases scarcity Increases demand and everything So more people take action So if you're running it even for a month You know, less people will probably go after it But let's just say If I'm going for a four day window Create the creatives Get your nice visual Get your copywriting And I'll probably create about three or four ads And then Then I'll come there and put it together And then what I'll do is I'll create a bunch of audiences I'll create a CBO campaign Of like $100 a day And I'll do website visitors 30 day Website visitors 60 day Website visitors 180 days To everyone And then I'll So I'll create like 10 to 15 different ad sets All with different ranges You know, past purchases 180 days Past purchases 30 days So I'm targeting a lot of people That are technically warm Good morning guys Currently about to hop into a sales call This morning I went to the chiropractor And also took care of a few other errands Visited guys to shop Now I'm about to go ahead And write down my goals real quick A few notes And then hopping into the sales call I've got about 10 minutes left This is a sock clothing brand Which is not normally my forte But we're checking it out And see if we can help this guy out anyway Okay And so my primary goals have been to just for customer engagement Um Uh You know, stay fresh, stay active Um Now I say it doesn't convert We have more success during event driven sort of things Like So Guys So Sales calls over Um Wasn't bad But it's just It was a good sales call Really cool guy Good business It's just Not a right fit for my agency at the moment And I'm still building that muscle To be able to just turn down those deals Or turn down those type of clients Um He will be a good fit Just not right now If that makes sense Uh He just has a few things to do on his business Before we could really help him with our strategy Um Basically He laid out everything he tried I dug into his previous marketing and stuff He's worked with a few agencies I'm like okay cool Um They multiple different ones All the different strategies and stuff And he had problems So I'm like okay Multiple agencies couldn't give him results And obviously he's have more problems with the style of his business And how it is So I gave him my proposition of how we could fix that Change that around So now all I gotta do is wait until he makes those changes If he does And then Which he was already thinking about doing And then we could really get into his business And start helping him with scale So if that makes sense for you guys But now I need to do something that Not looking forward to it I need to clean my bathroom for the first time ever At the new apartment Um But I'm gonna jump in back here To you guys I think we're gonna cook a crab meat omelette In a few minutes I'm gonna show you guys how we do that Filling accomplished right now Just cleaned up the bathroom Uh Did have one little casualty right here With the bleach Lesson learned for next time And just finished
