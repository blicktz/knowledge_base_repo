Hey what is going on guys Nick here welcome back to the channel I wanted to bring a special video today regarding my business template I used to track all my expenses in business and take profit and expenses taxes everything created a video for financial success a few weeks ago with the golden income manager of how do I split my income up personal income income up and I want to show you guys today my business one I used to track all my business income that helps delegate tax money expenses profit and income profit and income is two different things so I wanted to tell you guys exactly how all this works now I follow the account or the structure called profit first by Mike my Calowicz I'm not saying I'm sure if I'm saying his name or right or wrong but basically Mike has a book called profit first that really goes under how to set this up and the reasons behind it and I basically just summed it up in an Excel document now he recommends in his book to set up four different accounts income profit taxes expenses and specifically taxes and profit being at a separate bank so you have four accounts on one bank and then another bank with two accounts profit and taxes so that way you never touch them at all and basically in a sense is you deposit your money and it's split up he recommends 35% 1% for profit 20% for taxes and 44% for expenses now this is overall business income if you charge sales tax this taxes is not far sales tax so what you do is if you charge sales tax immediately put that in a different account and then the rest the leftover after the sales tax is where you deposit in here so um again I'm not a legal professional so anything I tell you regarding taxes today or any type of financial help like that I can't you know don't hold me accountable for that but this is all I said replicating what was in the book and showing you guys today how I personally do it so um he recommends 35% 1% 20% 44% and basically over time as you average even during the bad months the expenses you can lower them raise the income raise the profit and I'm gonna explain the difference between income and profit so the way profit works is you take 1% of all transactions for three months so one quarter and at the end of the quarter you take 50% of that profit that's stored up in that account and you you take it with you as a bonus and the other 50% you leave into that account and at the end of the year you take more or use it to kind of pay off some stuff so profit is just a little bonus at the end so income is your your income so just because you know your business owner you know you don't go unpaid you got to be paid accountable so it's kind of like your set pay and taxes is 20% of all taxes all of income that goes straight into a business account and this is to cover any of your you know your basically taxes for your workers for your your personal taxes self-employment taxes pretty much taxes in general besides sales tax that's directly associated with the income you make and expenses at 44% so let me kind of explain so I I I do digital marketing work I work with digital marketing clients specifically with Facebook ads I do some click funnels active campaign all that good stuff so let's just say today is the 4th 918 I sign on our actually today's the 5th damn so this is my deposit tab so I'll come in right here I'll come in right here and I'll just type in you know Facebook ads or is what I sold and I signed on a client at 1500 boom so there you go I can come right here the income I can take that home deposit that that's my money profit $15 one in it because like says 15 it's 1% taxes that's $300 basically just saved up for taxes that will not touch until the end of the third quarter when I file for my quarterly taxes and expenses so come right here to expenses and let's say for instance you know nine five eighteen transaction description let's say oh I I gotta get click funnels which is $97 a month you know I need to get I need to pay my workers to write some ad copy or I need to outsource some ad copy some of some ad copy you know 50 bucks you know maybe I need to pay one of my one of my workers for their two weeks so you know employee pay and I can like write their name 300 boom and as you can see right here it's automatically updating in the overall section right here so that's pretty much what this document does it allows you to kind of track all this he recommends opening up the bank accounts if for some reason you can't do that my bank is really hard to do that I can do it don't get me wrong and you know I need to quit being a little bitch and just do it but at the same time it's a way to work and get it action now without you know having to open up those bank accounts right away so I really like this tool a lot and then right here this date of charge there's amount and I count right here in fact actually I need to clear this right here date of charge so like let's see on the fifth you know you always know that you get a charge with active campaign I know I spelled that wrong and that's $49 a month and obviously I didn't clear that real quick because obviously I know it's in the expensive account because business really all you have is expenses so this is where I list all my expenses they do not I repeat do not auto update all this is is basically writing down the date of charge the what for what and the amount on a sticky note and stick it on the side of your computer that's as useless that's as useful as it is this all this is just to look at it and see as your reminder um so yeah guys that's pretty much the basic and sense of it I really recommend going get profit first reading it before you kind of use this but you can start using it now I just this is the basic percentages he puts in a book your business may need may need to be different your business may need you know you could probably pull in more income and you might need to raise a little taxes a little higher and lower your expenses you need to just a lot for yourself but this is the average numbers he uses that can work for just about any business he states in his book so they work for my business hope they work for yours you know if not you know some stuffs off then go ahead read the book just properly the book is a very quick book you can get through I read on audible you know it took me like a day I think it's like an eight-hour book six six hours somewhere on that it's very short so definitely recommend it out and I think also they have like sections to work you just kind of skip through to specific so guys this excel template be down in the description if you want to check it out or if I'm in post this in a monthly mastermind and stuff and you know you can download it there too guys thanks for watching have a great day
