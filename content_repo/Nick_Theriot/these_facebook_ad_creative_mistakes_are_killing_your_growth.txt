So the other day I did my coaching call with my students and this particular call I decided to go ahead and do a live script writing with my students. I gave my students 10 minutes to basically go ahead and write a script and basically we reviewed the script after and identified three key things that I saw as a common mistake they were all making and I wanted to show you guys today because I see this as well in a lot of audits I do for brands spending literally even hundreds of thousands of dollars a month students and you know like just in general people that are stuck scaling can't get the performance they want can't find any new winning ads what are the main creative mistakes that they're making with their Facebook ads and again you know these are things that once we fix we're able to help brand scouts from 380 grand to about 1.8 million per month in revenue 130k it's about 1.1 million dollars in revenue this brand right here so these are all things that we've helped brands fix and saw the benefits of it so number one and this is probably the most important one is that it's not specific to who the ad is for so you really need to understand your customer avatar when you're filming a creative right so you know like let's say for example like an energy drink so there's a lot of different customer avatars for an energy drink let's be a little bit more better let's do pre-workout just make it things simpler pre-workout is for people who are about to take a workout but the problem here is like that's somewhat specific let's see if we can get a little bit better we can showcase someone going to CrossFit so we can do you know guy taking it then going to a CrossFit gym boom it's being very specific who is for guys who do CrossFit can even be specific to the girls girls who do CrossFit same thing we can look at like runners few people that lift weights and everything like that we can be specific and we can film content specifically around who this product is for and some people they don't it's just like pre-workout boom for people who into fitness right it's like the fuck be specific who the product is for segment to those groups and a lot of people fear that the segmentation will like halt their sales and it's actually false the segmentation will improve their sales because they're like oh that product is for me better identity like identification across your marketplace which is going to make me like oh shit like this is product is for me I value it more versus a product that's marketed to just everyone in general right there also to it problems symptoms people have depending on the type of market you're trying to enter or stage of market awareness that's also going to differentiate you know like you need to be specific in that case right there another case I've seen of this is the types of benefits you're talking about and like desires you're talking about is not applicable to based off where someone is in their stage of sophistication so like let's say for example if I wanted to get people to buy for me to run their Facebook ads as an agency I don't want to go after people who are doing like hey make more money with this right I want to go after people who are already running Facebook ads and stuff they already know about Facebook ads and I want to show them how we can improve their ad hit rate with our system emotion baiting and with that that's going to be a lot more specific to who we're talking to versus the money one and we're actually going to get more qualified people into our funnel so a couple key things right there this one right here is also another good ad that we've ran for one of our clients you can see right here the hook this is my girlies who need a girl's night soon we're being very specific to a specific type of person we're not just being in general this is a fun product it's a fun night activity we called out a specific type of people that was the hook this ad did well I think it's been a couple hundred thousand dollars for this business profitably so be specific who the product is or the at the hook is for and then also to rest of the ad needs to reflect so this whole ad right here talks about girls night the benefits of using it for girls night showing girls night scenery we're not just calling that out and showing irrelevant visuals next one is using words like game changer life changing I hate this so much and and the reason why I hate that is because anything you call out people need to visualize so you know like let's say for example pre-workout and stuff like that let's say we go back to hey I start using this pre-workout it's been a game changer I can't visualize what game changer is but hey ever since I start using this pre-workout I've been able to crank out three to four extra reps every set of my workout I've been able to push myself past those limits of where I'm normally at like failure ads you can visualize that you can't visualize game changer game changers too vague right there so I like to be more specific with my outcomes while also still being what I would say compliant with Facebook ads and the reason why I say being compliant with Facebook ads is because you can't say like hey lose 30 pounds in 14 days you can say like lose 30 pounds but you can't say a time range right there or you can say like lose weight you can visualize that but hey this particular product's been a game changer to my weight loss it's like why well because this has been a game changer to my weight loss or this has allowed me to easily lose weight due to the fact that I don't have to use a diet that's why I was a game changer so just ask yourself when you say game changer why is it a game changer and then use that instead versus saying things like game changer or life changing I hate that so much that way people can visualize that better people can visualize it better then guess what they're more likely to purchase because they actually see how that's applicable to them and then next thing is that it only shows one example of a desire being achieved so this particular case right here it's like if I take pre-workouts my desire is for more energy going to the gym I want to showcase as many different ways of me having energy in the gym so like you know typical person would be like I started taking this pre-workout it got me a lot more energy going into my workouts it's amazing purchase now that's what a lot of y'all scripts look like so from here it's opening up our mind the way we think about this so if I start taking this pre-workout my desire is more energy so I want to see how more energy is going to affect the whole workout so you know it affects my mood like I have more energy so I'm going to the gym I have a happier mood and as I'm starting my first set I feel alive I feel awake so that's two examples right there number three you know I I can get a way better pump during my workout due to the you know the beta alene in it for example I'm also able to push myself harder show some visuals of them like you know repping out maybe some bicep curls and everything like that and and you can also even showcase some visuals of like maybe them sweating while doing an intense exercise right there about six different examples right there of that desire being achieved with that perfect workouts what do people visualize as that perfect workout what do people visualize this as like having a lot of energy going to work out what are all the different examples we need to showcase them in one ad so it's a key thing right there we're showcasing all this in one ad so hey I found this amazing pre-workout like 10 different examples it's amazing by now versus an ad that just shows hey I found this new pre-workout gives me a lot of energy by now that's one example so poor show more examples of that desire being achieved for that specific customer avatar it's also the key thing there it needs to be for that customer avatar so we talked about you know people who go to the gym for like bodybuilding people who go to the gym for crossfit people who go to the gym for running those different types of customer avatars are gonna have very unique benefits they get from more energy from a pre-workout we want to showcase that in the creative so these are the main things that I've noticed that I think I personally haven't seen anyone else talk about on youtube so hopefully this helps you guys out with improving your creatives to help out with you know breaking past those
