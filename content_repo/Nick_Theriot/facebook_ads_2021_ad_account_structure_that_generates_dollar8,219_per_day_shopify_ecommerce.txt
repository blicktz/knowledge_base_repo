what's up and welcome back to my channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I want to bring you guys a new video where I'm going to show you guys the exact campaign structure we used in 2020 that generated my clients over three million dollars in revenue with Facebook ads this came out to around a little over eighty two hundred dollars per day if we like average it out throughout the whole year and I want to show you guys the exact structure the audiences and everything you need to run this structure I've made a few videos now kind of like hinting at it and this video is going to go exactly into how to set it up and what you need to know to set this up inside the Facebook Ads manager so before we get started make sure that like button and hit that subscribe button for almost daily videos Facebook ads marketing videos that's geared towards helping e-com business owners succeed with their business okay so in my most recent video I talk about the kind of like Facebook ads funnel for 2021 best funnel to use in terms of top of funnel middle funnel bottom of funnel and PPS which is your past purchases and I got a lot of comments asking how exactly to set this up and I've also discussed this in another video where I do like a three extra RAS case study of how we took over an ad account so today I wanted to actually discuss how to set this up inside the Facebook ads manager in particularly how it looks like so the old way of setting up an ad account may look something like this and there's a lot of different variations I see when I'm looking at accounts and I'm auditing accounts for businesses clients my consulting clients etc I see a lot of variations and here's just one example people might have like a CBO campaign and literally the title the campaign is like green shirt cold audiences if they're running like ads for clothing brand then they might like label their ad set new ad set literally I've seen it hundreds of times where it literally to name it's just new ad set new ad like they don't even name the ad set itself but then sometimes we get a little bit more sophisticated audiences and ad account experts and stuff like that where they'll actually name the particular ad sets you know exactly the audience they're going after and then you know have some random name for the ad and they may have a few different audiences few different ad sets inside their campaign they may be running CBO on a few and this randomly have like an AB or CBO can like throwing around that account so just there's really no like common consistency in the account it's all just kind of throwing out random things they've tested and tried with multiple different YouTube people just a lot of variations and that's why in this video I want to show you guys a way better to set things up and how to actually limit that's going to limit your amount of time you'll be spending inside the ads manager and then on top of that you're gonna be able to focus on more important things like audiences new audiences to test and creatives which are huge key so messy ad accounts particular ad accounts with no organization they lead to two things you have a lot of audience overlap which is gonna lead to higher ad costs you should be start bidding to get yourself so that's a really common one and then you mean chasing your own tail so you're gonna be constantly focused on new audiences new account structures like the next account structure the next audience we test the next campaign we create something better and which what happens is you consistently keep reusing the same ad over and over the same ad copy same offer same like creative and you know you might find one winning one just keep you reusing that you're never testing new ads new copywriting all that stuff so um and the big key is because you have no system you just keep creating new stuff reusing stuff something dies out you reuse it you know but audience dies out you reuse the creative and you just keep doing this there's no system no structure no nothing like that and this is what keeps a like intermediate buyer intermediate and an advanced ad ads buyer advanced because an advanced person has a system in which they do everything whereas intermediate just keeps there trying new things they have no systems they have no consistency they just keep throwing things at the wall whatever sticks they keep on that's a big difference between intermediate and advanced so a new account structure we need something that minimizes audience overlap so we're not bidding you know like multiple campaigns sharing the same audience we need a clear naming and organization system so that way of how we name campaigns ad sets and ads and then we need a clear way to test new audiences and new creatives as we put them in the funnel and as we start spending more money on them and then also too we need something to prove and that's works you know we don't want to go sit there and like try to reinvent the wheel what is working that's the account structure we need so the account structure i'm gonna show you guys today is the one we used in this particular video right here um achieving 3x for us in 30 days where we actually show you um the like structure we used for this ad account where we literally took an ad account from 0.45 ro s spend about 2700 dollars a month and we scaled up that account to getting a three over three extra turn on ad spend and spending near a thousand dollars a day so really powerful it allows us to scale quick works really well so pay attention because we're getting started so the top of funnel campaign for success this is huge so how we set this up is we create three different campaigns so the bold right here is the campaign the next one's the ad set and that's the ad so we create three different campaigns all purchase conversion campaigns so you select that little conversions and then all of them we optimize for purchases even if it's a brand new ad account with zero dollars and spin optimize for purchases so we're gonna start off with that now starting off with the creative testing campaign we're gonna take our winning audiences and we're gonna create you know a single interest or single lookalike ad sets and we're gonna create a few of those and we're gonna launch those at five to ten dollars per day abo and we're gonna test our creatives our new ads we create we're gonna run them through here before we put them into our scaling campaign so that way we understand that these creatives are proven we want to make sure we're running a proven creative before we start scaling it because we don't want to spend a bunch of money on a creative we know does not work so that's our creative testing campaign then our audience testing campaign we want to run about twenty to forty dollars per day again abo and this is per ad set right here this is not total so audience campaign we want to have proven creatives in new audiences tests so new lookalikes new interests to test because right here there's two different variables there's the audience and then there's the creative so we need to test a creative we don't want to use an audience that's not proven so we must use a um proven audience to test a unproven creative and to test a proven audience we must use air to test the audience we must use a proven creative that makes sense now when it all works we have a audience that works and a creative works then we can move it into our scaling campaign which starts off at minimum 100 per day some of your ad accounts some of you guys with small ad accounts that's not spending much you can do you can focus more and just like spending per day with your creative and audience testing and you never even get to scaling campaign um once you start spending more things are working then you can start doing the scaling do not rush to get to scaling because you're going to make purchases you're going to make a row ash right here i mean you can easily i like just one account right now for me had like 10 audiences i'm testing so we're spending 400 per day just on those 10 audiences we're testing so there's no reason to even jump in a scaling campaign just focus on getting working on testing the creatives testing the audience is finding those winners and leaving them running if it works same thing for scaling once you start getting some stuff that's working in these two toss them together in a scaling campaign put your proven audiences and put the proven creatives inside those proven audiences let that thing run start running at a hundred dollars per day and then you can follow my video on scaling of how to actually scale that up now the only audiences you want to include is interests or look likes in these when you're testing audiences and you want to make sure you're excluding 180 day instagram engagement 180 day facebook engagement 180 day purchases and 180 day website visitors from all of your ad sets in these particular campaigns so that way we're going after a completely cold audience we do not want to be going after any you know warm people we want completely cold people now middle funnel campaign for success um again middle funnel is huge so what you want to do is uh you want to set up you know middle funnel it's called reactivation because you're kind of like reactivating warm people um who maybe experienced the brand and just hasn't actually visited your website yet but your whole objective is to get cheap website traffic to your website so that can be named for your campaign abo five dollars plus a daily so depending on the size of your middle funnel audiences this will be different but again abo five dollars daily so you want to make sure you're doing five dollars per ad set so ad set number one is a 30 day engagement audience and website visitors so you want to target 30 day facebook and ig engagement 30 day website visitors and you want to make sure you exclude 30 day view content so website visitor versus a view content a website visitor just visit your website but did not view any products and view content as people who actively viewed a product so they're they're a little bit more different in like terms of market sophistication and you also want to exclude 30 day purchases so that way you have just warm people in this audience that are fresh 30 days and in order of what to put in these ad sets i have another video two again this video right here of exactly what you need to put inside those ad sets now ad set number two we're doing 30 to 180 days again engagement website visitors these people are warm who hasn't purchased from the brand who are very far off they're warm you know 30 to 180 days they're they're almost cold essentially they are way up the brand they heard a few months ago so we need to re-spark their attention and we want to include 180 day ig and facebook engagement 180 day website visitors we're going to exclude 30 day ig and facebook engagement 30 day website visitors and 180 day purchases and again that's just one campaign middle funnel reactivation now bomb a funnel campaign for success again we want to do abo five dollars a daily this one's only gonna have one ad set literally one ad set view content and add to carts we want to target the most warm people right now or hot people in the brand that's ready to buy and we want to provide them the proper content they need to make their purchase a well-educated purchase and a smart purchase so view content 14 days that's card 28 days and you want to exclude purchase 30 days so again these people are hot they're recently viewed the website they're in the market right now they interviewed content in the last two weeks already even added something to cart in the last 28 days now lastly your past buyer campaign so this is key because you have past buyers and you want to actively go ahead and um give them a purchase again so your seven days right here i said number one abo five dollars a day five dollars per ad set at least purchase seven days do some upsell video you want to give them a purchase more thank you for their purchase then ad set number two uh purchase 14 to 180 days so far out if your product takes like 30 days for them to get do a little further out but you want to make sure you're targeting people who already received their product all the way up to 180 days as far as far as you can go so if you know your product takes two months before they get it go 60 days it just depends on how long it takes for your product to get to them if it's like oh 11 days just do 14 days so let's have something crazy 90 90 of y'all be 14 days so you want to include purchases 180 days exclude purchase 14 days so these are previous buyers you need to understand what do you promote to previous buyers and again this video explains it all but this specific funnel right here has allowed us to scale rapidly for our clients it allows us to really understand of where content needs to be out for each funnel um we don't create any other campaigns outside of this uh we'll create one more campaign that's just a dummy campaign where we house all of our creatives so and then we'll do this we'll create creatives inside that campaign we always leave it off and we just copy the post id from those new creatives and put uh drop them into this campaign structure so that's that's it so we have one other campaign that's it uh when we do a sale especially if it's a massive sale then we'll go ahead and duplicate this whole structure and rerun it with like a new name like mof sale bof sale uh so that way we can have a lot of spin to those specific campaigns quickly um that's a big key especially when running some sales and stuff and lastly if you know you're probably wondering okay you only don't like one ad set how do you test creatives or what happens if you have like five creatives from bottom of funnel drop all those creatives in let facebook spins facebook's gonna start you know figuring out which creatives work best and what you can do is you can turn off the ones that are underperforming so um this allows us to minimize audience overlap it allows us to quickly get a look at that account it's you know we can quickly glance at what's performing where uh where we need to increase budgets at to improve results and it's structured accordingly to the best way to run facebook ads that's minimize audience overlap which is huge a lot of people are doing it allows us a clear overview allows everything just to flow smoothly and maximize budget performance so hope this guys hope this really helps y'all um again we spent over three million or we spent over a million dollars in 2020 made back over three million dollars in revenue for a three extra turn on ad spend for our clients in 2020. um we're gonna be using the same structure going to 2021 it's practically bulletproof so um it it's all about testing different variables and understanding how like only certain variables are tested one by one with either audience or a creative or just having one audience we're going after and just dropping in new creatives to you know maximize performance so hope you guys enjoyed this video um if you you are an e-com business owner and you're tired trying to watch youtube videos online
