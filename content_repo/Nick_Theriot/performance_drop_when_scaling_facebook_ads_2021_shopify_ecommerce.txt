yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel nick terrio here and today i have a new video going over audience fatigue how to identify it and what actions to take so with spending large amounts of money we tend to burn through audiences a lot quicker when you start spending a lot more ad spend and this is a real issue you face when you start to scale so it's important to be able to identify when this happens and be able to pivot or your results will suffer so in today's video i'm gonna go over exactly what to do how to identify it and how to overcome it before we start make sure you hit the like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every other day for the shopify business owner to help empower them with paid advertising and marketing so with that being said let's dive into the video so the first thing i want to do is dive into shopify and show you guys exactly how aggressively we're scaling this store i'll go ahead and i'll just refresh the screen just to make sure you know show you guys this is true this is this is real data right here this is for one of our clients in the custom metal decor niche this month so far we did 174 000 in revenue um we scaled up from literally a thousand two thousand dollars a day to start testing new audiences and create us for this special offer we launched for valentine's day to finally pull the trigger and scaling we pretty much have whatever budget we need and we have unlimited inventory so it's you know perfect conditions for scaling as long as we can fulfill on our end so what is the issue now is we're starting to see performance drop we started off around three extra turn ad spend and we started seeing a 2.8 then we started seeing a 2.7 now it's like okay something's going on we're at we're trying to spend more to make the 20k days that we're seeing last week so we know that hey was there just an issue with the market was there issue with facebook ads or was there actually something going on inside of our ad sets so let's dive into the ads manager we can see we spent 48 000 over the last seven days and we've been scaling very aggressively now let's go into our main scaling campaign right here you can see we spent 30 000 which is a lot and we even spent 15 000 on one particular ad set now guys i'm just going to say that is a lot of money for one ad set especially if you don't have a big audience this is going to burn through really quick um and like i said we're starting to see performance drop over the last seven days if we look at yesterday 2.14 but if we look at say last wednesday we're seeing like three extra turn on ad spend so we can agree on that this ad set is starting to drop in terms of performance so now it's what do we need to do so i created this little process to follow so the first thing you'll notice is called spread position rises which drops roas now the next thing you want to do is you want to wait three days wait three days after you start to see performance drop so we start to notice performance dropping on friday that's when our first day was below 3x then saturday and sunday saturday was a little worse than sunday sunday was okay and monday was barely a 3x so we're starting to see a little bit of a fluctuation and we needed to start digging deeper and figuring out is this just a few days of you know bad economy or is there something going on inside of the ad set that we're not aware of so make sure you wait those three days and then what you want to do is use the inspect tool so we go back over to our ad account the first thing you want to do is look at the last seven days of data and then you want to click on inspect on that particular ad set and then just unclick all these if they're clicked and just have cost per purchase and we can see in this little chart cost per purchase is starting to rise we know we need to be at about a 25 cost per purchase for this particular ad account to hit about a 3x return ad spend now if you look at this we also see this thing called first time impression ratio we're gonna click that on and you can see right here the green line's first time impression ratio and the blue line is cost per purchase so if we look at it we can see both of them start off pretty good first time impression ratio is solid and then all of a sudden on the 21st we see a 64 first time impression ratio and we also see cost per purchase rise now first time impression ratio is basically the amount of new people we are reaching the first time they see one of your ads and then we go another day or two and we see first impression ratio drop down to 46 cost per purchase rise up to forty dollars and then the next day 34 first time impression ratio it's 47 cost per purchase so long story short the less people less we are reaching every day the less the higher the cost per purchase which is that's that's pretty bad so let's go and unclick that and let's turn on auction overlap rate because this is the second thing i like to take a look at auction overlap is basically where we are competing against ourselves so if we have two like like say for example where you're targeting a view content 30 day audience one percent look alike and you're also targeting in another ad set of view content 30 day look like one percent audience so both the same exact audiences in two different ad sets we're basically competing against ourselves and as you can see our cost per purchase also is kind of rising as the auction overlap increases and then just the other day we kind of cleaned up a few of the ad sets that were overlapping but that still did not help at all of our cost per purchase and we can still see our first time impression ratio is still very low so you can clearly identify that hey even though auction overlap we fixed it up the first time pressure ratio is still low and still causing issues for us so let's go further we can also take another look auction competitions every advertiser in space that's currently targeting this audience as well and we can see that's pretty low too and you can even see when the auction competition is low which is perfect for scaling we're still seeing our cost of purchase very high so we definitely know that hey this audience is just burnt out and then lastly to put the icing on the cake our frequency is very high so we can see a 1.98 frequency and for a frequency of 2x near 2x on top of funnel to a cold audience it's just not what we're looking for we're looking for something smaller so so if we go back over we can confirm that the ftir is trending down and cpa is rising so the best solution is literally just duplicate that ad set and immediately start running some new audiences so let's say our first time impression ratio was not trending down so the next thing we'll do is we'll look at auction overlap if we had a very low auction overlap which is good then all we want all we want to do is test new creatives maybe the creative we were using it just was not meant for scale maybe the offer just wasn't good at scale so we just need to kind of rethink some things with creatives and offers now if the auction overlap was high all we need to do was turn off the overlapping ad sets and that will like most likely be the cause of our performance drop for that particular ad set alrighty guys i hope you all enjoyed this video this is something really fun to make and it's something that i know not everyone's going to have an issue with at the moment but once you start to scale this is something that you're going to be facing on a day-to-day basis and you need to be able to handle these conditions this is something that was a big part of my growth as a advertiser once you start spending multiple thousands of dollars a day so i hope you
