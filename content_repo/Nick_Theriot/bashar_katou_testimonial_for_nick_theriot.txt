What's up guys, Bashar Ketu here, 7-figure Amazon and BS seller from beautiful San Diego. Wanted to make this video to tell you guys about my experience with Nick. You see, having such amazing knowledge of selling on Amazon and making millions of dollars selling on Amazon gave me the motivation to tell others, teach others about what I was doing.

And I created the program, which I thought was a lot greater than anyone else in the market, and I even charged a lot cheaper. However, no one bought, and I was freaking devastated, right? I spent thousands on sales funnels, webinars, Facebook ads, but nothing worked.

Until I met Nick back in October of last year, he cleared my mind, you know, we set targets, and we began running my Facebook ads. Shortly after, I started seeing so much traffic being driven into my webinars that I had never seen in my life before. Not only were we driving such a massive traffic to my webinars, but also my email list grew and my following grew as well.

The most thing that I truly liked about Nick was that he's hungry, he's got the drive, And he will not stop at anything unless he achieves his goals. And if there was a huge save more, he Greece achieves his goals. Bye.
