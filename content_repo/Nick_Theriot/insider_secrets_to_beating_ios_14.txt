yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys where i'm actually going to showcase a little bit about what we're doing with ios 14.5 how we're handling it and how you can pretty much just step back and relax i'm gonna talk a little bit about my opinion on this whole thing i'm also going to showcase what we're doing and some stuff that you can take action on to where you can better handle your clients expectations what you can do in place to help your business and also to just sit back and relax because it's things will get better so with that being said before we get started make sure you hit the like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday just like this one so let's get started guys okay guys if you live under a rock then you probably wouldn't know that ios 14.5 came out and you know you basically are gonna lose a lot of your data we're currently at about a 30 percent rollout of ios 14.5 it's about may 9th may 8th when i record this video and and we're expected somewhere mid in of may to be about a 60 percent rollout of ioc ios 14.5 the adoption rate of how many people actually update their phone now due to early statistics we're seeing a five percent opt-in rate yes five percent opt-in rate of people actually allowing ios 14.5 and allowing facebook to track them yes that is just out of this world now that's crazy that's that's very bad but there's it's okay because we're going to get through this and i'm showcasing a few things with you all in this video of actually you know what you can do and how you can still track some stuff and look at attribution analytics and stuff and get some of that back but with all this going on you know not really going to not really putting my tinfoil hat on here but just the grand macro overlook and where's my head at where's my expectations at right now i truly believe that facebook will find a solution to this facebook almost all 90 percent of its revenue comes from advertisers and if with this new update crushes the performance of all 90 percent of those advertisers revenue then they're going to want to spend less and it's going to cripple facebook's revenue so this is a big problem for facebook i truly believe they will find a solution to this figure out a solution whether it might be something like hey let's start shifting over and doing more like on app payment options to where you could literally just see a product in an image tap on it just like they do already the tagging of products in instagram images or facebook images and utilizing instagram and facebook shops more and that way everything's on the app so where they can still track it it's not taking them outside the app so i truly believe that is one of the ways you know they just for an example that could potentially solve this issue right here and that way everything's on the app we're not using outside tracking or anything like that to where we can ethically still do that outside of ios 14.5 now again that's just putting my tinfoil hat on and making up different you know circumstances and different things like that that could be going on and also too i truly believe that apple is probably going to look at doing their own ads platform you know between having an apple you know desktop or laptop macbook airpods mouse keyboard all of this stuff apple has its own little ecosystem and i truly believe they're trying to really close it off and this is just another bite at the market share of advertising tracking data attribution there's already rumors that apple and has been proven that apple is coming out with their own attribution software why are they coming out with attribution software why are they going out there and showcasing apple advertising now that has already opted in once you update to ios 14.5 whereas facebook snapchat and all that is already opted out so that's just some key things right there to think about if you truly believe this is about privacy this is not about privacy at all apple has cornered the market in every single way and i truly believe they're just gearing up to make a big large shift and you know come up with their own ecosystem completely and of advertisers and stuff and you know their own like advertising platform etc that is also a good thing for advertisers because to fuel that system we're going to need advertisers and as an advertiser you will need you know you can still use the same tactics you use on facebook on apple's advertising platform so if that would happen we're still going to be okay so regardless of what happens we're going to be okay and how you look at this you can either look at it with a growth mindset or you can look at it as this is the worst thing ever i hate all this i'm suffering it depends on how you look at it and what glass you put on what pair of glasses you put on is how it's going to turn out so if you keep positioning this as the worst thing ever your facebook ads results will suffer your clients will leave you your business will slow down if you run an e-commerce business so you need to be able to look at this with an open mindset and with a growth mindset how can we grow from this and that's exactly what i'm going to show you right now so how are we handling this and how you can actually grow from this specific thing right here first off you need a third-party attribution software so like wicked reports which i can show you right here runs about five dollars a month but what's cool about it is is it gets past the att update so you probably heard a lot about high rose alex becker they also do this for our own personal preferences i prefer wicked reports but i will eventually do a video where it's comparing the two together i also do a video actually going through wicked reports and all the cool stuff about it but the cool thing about wicked reports is it gets past the att update if you go to your website they'll say it doesn't do anything for it and it's because here's the thing wicked reports is simply just showing where the sale came from what and all the way down to what ad so wicked reports connects to the facebook ads conversion like um the third party kind of integrations and stuff to where we can actually get all that data from facebook into wicked reports and wicked reports connects to all of your apps shopify etc and it simply just shows and tracks a person over time so say for example if someone clicked on your ad three months ago and just made a purchase today from an email that you sent out it'll attribute that cell to that ad they saw three months ago if you're looking at it on a last click basis if you're looking um or a first click basis if you're looking at it on a last click basis it'll attribute that cell to the email and then you can even see kind of like the middle holistical type of like approach for like the marketing side so you can see exactly where sales are coming from because for me all i care about is first click where we're spending the money at where are we getting those first few sales from so that's a big thing for me so you can actually see exactly where your sales are coming from um and all it's going to say is like you know facebook ads ad you know campaign top of funnel ad set purchase 30 days lla ad ad number five and i'll say ad number five three purchases that's all it's going to show and that way we can see over time we can still get those attribution so where a campaign might be unprofitable in the ads manager it's showing very profitable in wicked reports which will prevent us from turning that off and if we turn that off then obviously we're going to see a big decrease in sales so wicked reports is amazing i definitely just recommend just booking a demo call with them look at their webinar on their website and just going through it it is a little pricey you'll be looking to spend at least five hundred dollars per month on this specific so if you're spending at least 10 grand a month it's worth it um even five grand a month you know some people even as low as 3k a month depending on where your row ass is at and all that stuff something else too to look at is click magic which i haven't personally used yet but i've been seeing a lot of people talk about it very positively which does the same thing essentially but for a cheaper pricing i think like 75 a month you can get click magic for and does literally the same thing as wicked reports but i've definitely just go through it compared to figure out which one makes the most sense for you so you need a third party attribution software and it's going to help you out a lot with getting past the the loss of data because we could see anywhere from a 95 decrease in data that facebook is receiving due to the you know only five percent of people opting into tracking now another thing is on a one day click basis facebook can still track your highest event you set in your aggregated event measurement tool so for example if you someone opts out and makes a purchase on your website it's only going to allow one event to pass back to facebook on a one day click so if i view an ad today opt out of tracking and then make that purchase on that ad today or within a 24-hour time frame the highest event that i set in the ads manager will be sent back to the ads manager so if a highest event is purchased would i highly recommend for everyone watching this channel because they're e-commerce we're going to send that event back to the ads manager so that's a good thing but if you're selling very high ticket products where it may take a few days to go through the sale then that that'll be an issue but again it's based off attribution it's not based off retargeting so let's say for example if someone opts in doesn't make a sale you know it doesn't purchase within one day or seven days but makes a sale 30 days later because they see a retargeting ad that's a completely different story and i'll have a whole new video of how exactly the difference between attribution and retargeting time frames because some people are getting those confused together so also make sure you go through my channel have videos on this already this should already be done already but have your domain verified have your events measurement tool set up properly and then also to make sure you have server side tracking and again i have videos on those three things right there already it should have been done months ago now digging deeper into this what are we doing first off better creatives you need better creatives with ios 14.5 you want to be able to maximize your ability to convert traffic so just really investing in really digging deep into better creative better ad copy higher production creatives and craves are crushing it right now and staying up to date with that because it won't be just a simple post a picture of your product and get sales you're really gonna have to dig deeper into the marketing marketing tactics and psychology which i thrive on i'm a nerd for all that i love that stuff so so so very much so i'm um this is an opportunity for us to grow and expand on this particular area in our business is something i've been really focusing on next thing is more video content so the cool thing about that is if someone opts out of tracking you can still retarget them by video views because it's on facebook's platform itself so if we do more video content we can do kind of like a video funnel we lead with a top of funnel ad that we know that's converting at least some percentage of people so let's say for example we know you know 50 of our buyers are coming from that video right there and we're converting like a one extra oas because a lot of people are opting out um but we know a lot of people coming from that video then we can just spend more on that video and then we can also retarget that video by video watch percentage and then we can do a funnel so first video is more of like a you know introduction to the product second video is a reaction video to it then the third video is retargeting that second video doing an unboxing of that product then the fourth video is a retargeted ad of that third video doing more of a testimonial and really selling the key points of why you need this product so this is something that's super cool is doing like a video stacked sequences so there's a few videos on youtube about that look up just video view retargeting learn that key thing of how you can do video view retargeting and then from video view retargeting just start creating video funnels with a few different videos that address different key points of the sales process and handhold the buyer through the sales process from completely not aware of your product or anything like that to all the way aware and hey let's purchase so more video content has been super crucial to us and obviously just stay up to date stay up to date with things things are happening weekly this is a completely new environment this is a blue ocean it's not a red ocean anymore this is a completely blue ocean that we're all navigating through so make sure you're staying up to date things are happening on the week-to-week basis so staying up to date with everything as best as you can there's new strategies that are being released new different ways that's helping advertisers going through this ios 14.5 update so make sure you're staying up to date with weekly trends um if there's any high level groups i know for example for us it's ad leaks ad leaks a d l e a k s um look up that website it's by tim bird it's an amazing amazing group that we value a lot um and we're bringing a lot of really good value and insight from there uh first thing up to date if i was 14.5 now the last thing is build more lists and build more assets that you own so for example right now something that i've heard of a strategy to test is run a lot of lead ads to your ideal customers build up a big email list and then go back to the original building up email list and selling people your product through emails and and like that that way you have that huge email list of people potential buyers and stuff and then you can just use email marketing to build up your consumer base through that process right there another thing too is to also build out some facebook vip groups build out some groups or find a website to where you can have a group or host a group of people just literally just think of a facebook group and even facebook groups itself build out a group of all your ideal prospects customers etc so that way you have a really good spot to house people and literally just free marketing you literally just drop a post in there and a bunch of people will see it so these are a few things that we're doing to stay up to date with ios 14.5 how we're handling and stuff again i can maybe do another video more some of the retargeting and stuff and the attribution explained but these are all some very key points that i recommend you thinking about but a big thing for really this video is to click magic or wicked report and again i'll do some videos in those very soon so if you're an e-commerce business owner doing
