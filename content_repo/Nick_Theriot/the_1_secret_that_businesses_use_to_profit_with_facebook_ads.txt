Yo, what's up guys Nick here welcome back to the channel today We're gonna be going over why most business owners are failing with Facebook ads and what they completely get wrong every single time Let's jump in my computer. I'm gonna show you everything. Alright guys, we're in my computer now and it's blank and we're in another little drawing session so Bear with me, but look don't be first off.

I want to just start this right now Don't be this guy. Don't come there go on Facebook run your little FB ad There we go. That's my fancy ad and literally do this by now Don't be this guy, okay, if you're literally going on Facebook you literally run a Facebook ad you might do a very very basic you know interest targeting um Maybe a little bit of retargeting whatever and you literally run a you know ad straight to a buy now page Don't be this guy and you know, this also might be a service page right here Say if you're a local business you want to promote your services You'll literally run a Facebook ad that says hey, we're looking, you know, blah blah blah and Buy now Do you not be this person because you know what you're gonna spend a whole bunch of money and you're probably not if you're if you're running This you're probably not even properly split testing and doing all kinds of other interest targeting with Facebook so you're probably getting horrible By now like I mean, I'm sure you're probably just dumping money in and You know you're spending all this money and you might as well come there and just light it on fire Just burn it boom because you know what you're getting probably shit Um if you're doing amazing then I guess just dislike this video and move on but this is what most people doing with Facebook ads and They literally come there and then just cry about it, you know make Facebook ads videos of how much they suck and You know talk a bunch of shit on it and then they probably go and you know sort of like yelp or something so um, yeah, I don't care if yelp too much so Don't be those people don't be that business owner right there If you're using Facebook ads make sure you are properly using them and the big you know question is how how like, you know There's only so much you can do with Facebook ads How is there some other secret, you know super amazing targeting that's allowing businesses to make you know?

billions a year with Facebook ads So what's what's the deal with that? How is that happening? I'm gonna literally show you guys today the two-step, you know Campaign that everyone is running that allows them to make money and push people into their sales funnels that Turns them, you know billions and billions a year especially You know, I mean obviously very small local business.

It's not gonna make you billions, but it might make you a little bit more It'd be a lot more profitable and it to be a lot better for you first. It's just running, you know this big buy now thing that no one likes so Let me throw up a quick scenario. This is the thing I like to do every day with people and when I kind of talks about Facebook ads imagine if you're just walking down the street and and you know, this is you boom boom boom and Yeah, and someone literally comes up to you and like, you know is like yo Marry me.

Yeah, I know There we go um, you you would be very very creeped out um You know, you might might be like what what would you just say and They're like yo marry me and you're like what the no hell no, like I don't even know you. I don't know what and you're probably gonna walk away and very feeling like What the fuck just happened? That's what's gonna happen.

That's literally what's gonna happen right there and and every day you're running Facebook ads that literally say You know buy now um With no special type of you just literally your Facebook guy that says buy now Um, you're literally that's literally what you're saying marry me and because you know when people see you're out on Facebook They have no idea who you are and Because of that Um, you know, they're not gonna buy from you. They have no brand awareness for you They've never seen your brand and you literally just saying here give me 20 bucks and you're you know for internet marketing That's a huge commitment and that's literally the same equipment. I mean, you know, they're they're actually it's the same commitment as saying marry me um And you know, that's why your ads are doing absolutely poor so How do you do better with Facebook ads first off what I see?

People doing is you got to build the relationship. So um Obviously you do marry people but after you built a relationship with them. So how do you build a relationship?

You know you got to do your awareness And then some low-level commitment um I'm just LLC low-level commitment and uh, so you create some awareness then you get some low-level commitment and then you get that purchase or Let me see and go back So after you get some low-level commitment, you don't get purchase yet. Um, you get you build trust And then you come there and get that, you know purchase those dollars in the bank. So Um, that's kind of how like this is the basics of a sales funnel right here You know And this is what people are not implementing instead of doing this they literally this is what their sales funnel looks like Buy And that's not what you need to be doing.

That's not internet marketing. So, you know, this is not how internet marketing works in a sense Because you know that people have trust issues So this is what you need to be doing is what people everyone's doing. This is what the you know, one percent are doing And 99 percent are doing right here That's literally what's going on with internet marketing right now And no one knows how to I guess do this and they open oversimplify it And you know, they fell at it and then they just literally go back to this and it's bad So let me literally show you guys what to do.

So first thing i'm going to do is create brand awareness So literally awareness Um, this can be in the shape of a photo a video some facebook post, but it's literally just Or maybe like a featuring of your business Maybe like a blog article your business wrote on another competitors not a competitor's website, but another like authority website Um, there's many different ways But like for facebook awareness the best thing to do for awareness is literally just run a you know a video ad Um, and then you come there and you take this video ad and then you can retarget You can come there and retarget So that's your video ad you can retarget Um The like how many people who viewed it so you can come there and retarget like say 50 of the people 50 percent Um of the are you can retarget people who watched 50 percent Uh video viewers So obviously if they watch you know 50 of a video say a minute long Um, two minutes long that you're promoting on facebook for awareness of your brand So like literally, uh, maybe talk about your brand or maybe a product and you know showing the uses of a product I know a lot of econ products are doing amazing with this. So, um, i've been watching i've been seeing an ad going around lately It's the um, the punching bag that sits on your desk And they just did a minute to a minute long video. It's fun You know, it's fun kind of educating people on what the product does showing the product in action and stuff And literally just shows the punching bag on the desk, you know, very just some awareness and What they can do is, um, I know I haven't specifically been retargeted yet But what they can do is they come there and retarget people who watched a full video because if they watched a full video They're more inclined to buy Um, because they're aware of the product and two They I mean shows not interest if they're watching a full video 50% or more so in fact you can retarget full amount of people and specifically with facebook ads or facebook where people have low Attention rates if they watch a video for more than 30 seconds, they're pretty damn interested or pretty aware Um, and then that builds an audience for you.

So this creates a audience That is smaller and a hell lot better than say going target people who Work in the office with a buy now ad for a punch back on the desk So now you're you can literally target people for awareness Or create awareness campaign That promotes the product and then comes there and You know, you can get video views and stuff Which I recommend is the best it's the easiest and you create awareness for it And then you can come there and promote sure, you know buy now um Which I recommend doing is simple You don't want to buy now ad or you do maybe a coupon ad or you do something else related to your brand So I knew this is more like e-com related e-com, you know, you spend a little bit more money Trying to get people in your brain and stuff Uh, but say if your average business You know, you'd be focusing more on retargeting people with some type of email opt-in So if it's a high ticket product, you want to focus on getting leads in um Leads more leads you get the more money you make So you want to get up focus on getting leads in Uh, and then if you kind of do like maybe like quotes, so if it's a high ticket, you know offer you can do like quotes um, and basically what you do is, you know, you retarget people who are aware of your brand with some type of lead ad Or something like that So that's kind of how like it works in a sense I'm gonna kind of go further into it because I know this is kind of just short right here with the econ product So you retarget people and when you retarget those people you get your audience And with that audience, you know, you retarget them with other stuff because they're aware of your brand people who wear your brand better buyers And it's like the next best next best thing than someone who's cold so but um Let's see So say if you're a local business and you have like your services and stuff, you know, you can promote a service And then you know retarget that audience with like I said, you know get a free quote, you know Get a quote Call or you know get 25 off you know do a coupon um you get something something free um That's my free right there or like a downloadable good Yeah, that's horrible Yep, that's horrible So just something right there of that retargeting which gets you come there and this gets you right here This gets you emails Emails and that's what we want So we want to be able to retarget these people and then we want to be able to email them And when we email them, we literally can come there and email them day to day a very very simple email sequence it's literally just Every day kind of Send out a story and tie it into one of your products so What I mean by Russell brunson, he is amazing about this He kind of opened up the daily seinfield email list Idea he opened it up Basically, it's emailing your list every day once a day and you create some story or personally something that happens to you realistically With your attractive character and you come there and promote a story consistently or Create a story send it out and then every day something different So um You know like in his book.com secrets he was talking about how like one of his emails just one of them Was talking about how he's a wrestler or or like how he he hasn't wrestled since high school But he wants to do an event this weekend He comes there he gets our prepared and stuff all that stuff he does to prepare and he was like What does this have to do? You know with click funnels Of what he does and everything was it was the fact of how He was able to have so much time to do all this And still make you know he had some type of huge sales goal or something like that All because he does his internet marketing or things automated and stuff And then you know you can learn how to do it too by signing up for one's program so You know it you're entertaining your people with the stories and stuff and people prefer that over just kind of like Like hair here's a cell going on boom where every day you're sending a story And or something that happened or you know educate you people and they enjoy it And it keeps your email open rates higher and it also gets you more Sales And you see this is what people are getting wrong This is building an audience right here emailing them daily, you know and pushing people down Versus this right here if you're just running a facebook ad and getting by you're not getting any leads You're not having the ability to build your with your customers and build a relationship with them And are your potential customers and no one wants to buy and you just keep pumping pumping money into those facebook ads You're gonna spend a lot you can get discouraged and you're gonna say facebook guys do not work Whereas come there and create awareness for your brand You know or a product or a service and then come there and retarget those people And you create a custom audience and then you come there and put an ad out another ad for like get a quote You know get like 25 off your coupon or something like that um, you know, maybe Here's a free just like maybe a part of the service, you know free inspection um, you know free You know free shipping something like that or like a downloadable good which like a pdf, you know guide on How to fast track your process your progress with facebook ads something like that, you know pdf guide that educates and shows them something Um, the only thing is with all of this right here has to be something of value that people want to enter Or like want to do Um, basically what just does this enters them into your sales funnel and then you know You can start emailing them daily to get them to buy whatever you're promoting Or you know what a lot of people do is as soon as they get into their sales funnel, you know They'll send like initial email getting whatever they want, you know promoting their initial product and then they will come there and email them daily And what this does is this is going to make you a lot more money Because you get people in your system that can consistently purchase repurchase and purchase from you all from that awareness ab And it's gonna make you a lot more money over time And whereas again by now you're literally not doing anything You're just pumping a bunch of money being frustrated and quitting with facebook ads So this is what most business owners to not do with facebook ads and It's sucking farm and you know, there's other people too. It's not just business owners, you know other brands business companies They're doing and it's not equaling this and they get discouraged and they say facebook guys do not work Also one other thing facebook ads are not alone.

It's literally not just facebook ads You can do this with youtube ads and everything and facebook ads is merely just source of traffic And people do not realize that and they miss out on the other opportunities google adwords youtube ads and you know seo Influencer shout outs everything like that has offer as well. Thank you guys for watching. Have a good day
