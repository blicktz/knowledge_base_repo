yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio today i have an exciting new video for you guys today we're going to be going over some black friday creatives and kind of give you a guide of just a few things that i like i put together about 10 different creatives together for you guys to actually showcase with y'all again none of these are brands i own this is just basically screenshots of black friday black friday ads that i've seen i liked and this give you some inspiration for your black friday this year of what type of creatives to use and what's kind of working right now so that being said before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday and again excuse the look it's black friday um it's black friday month pretty much and we're extremely busy right now and i've just barely had a little time to record these videos uh so i want to go ahead and put together a few things for you guys so that being said let's hurry up and or let's dive into the video okay so like i said i got about 10 different creatives to showcase you guys on today's video so let's dive into these and i want to start off first with the vip list so i'm a huge fan of building a vip list before your black friday launch it just allows for more momentum a lot more hype more anticipation and everything it allows for a really epic big black friday because you build up all this big momentum before the event and then you have this massive release party so it works really well and i've found a few of those as well so i want to showcase what those may look like for you guys as well so this is from jellybee right here uh very straightforward it's it screams black friday vip lists or exclusive early access you know and then a sign up button very easy i again i have a screenshot of this from the ads library so i'm hoping they're targeting warm audiences because cold audiences are horrible for a vip list they know nothing about you they don't care about you or anything like that whereas a warm audience under knows you they love your brand and um they're more likely to sign for a vip list and actually participate in the event versus people that are cold so the only thing that's missing from here is that there's really no fear of missing out here because it's just exclusive early access black friday vip list they need to be able to sweeten this up a little bit more 24 hour early access up to 65 off site wide we will sell out like that right there is going to make this a lot more irresistible and make me really want to hit that sign up button which is going to draw up their overall cost per lead and the exact same thing for this right here so another one i have from rug legacy uh same exact thing just missing that okay early access what is that early access up to 24 hour you know 24 hour early access up to 65 off site wide uh we're gonna sell out you need to sign up like just increasing that fear of missing out it's really big right there we have another brand that is literally going to do a limited time t-shirt release because these this brand sells out everything they sell every time they do a launch they sell out they just have an amazing brand with very very very engaged customers and they're gonna they're gonna do a limited time t-shirt that is just gonna go crazy and they're gonna give the first 100 people who um purchase a black friday a free t-shirt and it's gonna go insane so like that's something cool we're doing right there as well it's kind of and i don't even know where i'm going with this now because that's for actual black friday day just back to the early access just different things like that to sweeten up the deal and send all the pretty cool one you'll notice right here everything screams black friday early access it it's just very straightforward and it's also showing off the collection of products so if you just showcase one product there's nothing wrong with that at all especially if it's your best seller and everything but we do recommend a few of them that showcase the collection a few of them that showcase your best sellers and then a few that are just kind of graphic style ads and these are kind of a mix between graphics and then also showing off the collection which is really good i like this this is exactly something i would create right here now moving away i actually do have another vip list one okay cool so this one right here is from zen luma i don't know if i'm saying that correctly uh again showing off that collection chakra stones oh god people who are into crystals or stones are gonna crush me in the comments but black friday cell shows the stones and everything get on the black friday vip list black friday cells are just around the corner be the first to know when it goes live again just i'm missing that further when is the event hey the event is the 24th it's exclusive to just people who sign up on the vip list up to 65 off site wide 24 hour early access we will sell out and you need to get on this list because we're going to sell out before the main event or something like that just really increasing that anticipation right there for me to actually hit that button because right here is pretty bland um it just it's missing that spice to it okay cool now actually moving into more black friday ads in terms of like and again the way i found this is by simply just going to facebook ads library searching a phrase and i searched black friday black friday sale black friday early access black friday vip list you can do this yourself and you can get a lot of inspiration or you can just watch this youtube video and just pick out the best ones that i plucked out because there is a lot of people that started black friday sales early in november and there's nothing wrong with that it's just not my forte i prefer to build a big launch event that happens where some brands just like to all right let's swap the creative out for black friday creative and start running it all month i don't personally like it as it kind of burns out very quickly so uh this one right here very straightforward as well i this is kind of again more of what we would run um i'm not going to focus on the copy for this as well i mean i might talk about a little bit but straightforward you see the product biggest sale of the year number one anti-cellulite booty mask in usa so showing some social proof and accreditation again it's just kind of making it look like it's accredited and stuff like that yeah really good the only thing i'm missing is maybe like a black friday right here or something like that maybe swapping out biggest sale of the year putting black friday and pushing this up a little bit i think that's the only thing i would do right there but i definitely would you know swap that biggest sale of the year for black friday sales event so it's more of just a consumer thing when they when they're looking for black friday deals and they see black friday they're more than likely to actually click on it versus just biggest sale of the year they're not used to seeing that and that's not what they're looking for and they're going to skip past it stop don't miss the biggest sale of the year get 24% off for black friday and then a few more things so that's great kind of talking a little bit about black friday but also to still kind of using your best performing ad copy a little bit looks like summer uh this is a pretty cool one right here for it looks like they're doing their different boots and stuff up to 80% off black friday um i'd make black friday just a little bit bigger because i feel like i just see black that's it and i just i feel like i'm missing the offer and the friday a little bit so that's the only thing right there uh but again they restate it in the headline cool um trend boots of the season exploring everything okay cool cool uh definitely missing some black friday in the ad copy a little bit but it's a pretty cool creative though overall oh okay cool so i did have another vip list in here so this is a really cool one right here because okay our black friday event's coming so i'm now to get details about how to access for the sale early first 1 000 artists will get a free gift so sign for early access and receive a free gift so this makes it really cool because it's it's giving you more of a reason why to sign up you get early access and a free gift so early access you can see it's just not enough anymore you actually have to do something else and again it's like early access versus sign for early access and receive a free gift for if your purchase so it's like you're just signing up and getting a free gift you're signing up and you get a free gift when you first purchase something like that so a really great way to offer again this is more of a um like probably a story ad right here just based off the uh the high resolution not a high resolution but the uh the dimensions on this as well another very straightforward ad and you'll notice a lot of the ads i've screenshot it are very straightforward because with black friday that's all we do it's it's very straightforward we'll typically launch some new creatives but we also typically come there and take some of our existing best performing creatives and just put these type of banners on it and it works really well and it looks like this what zugo bike did right here as they simply just added kind of like banner on it black friday starts now 100 off kept it very simple now fabetics men probably has one of the best or one of my favorite black friday creatives of 2021 i really love all their stuff and they really hit it hard literally on the first of november um they launched probably 30 40 different creatives around black friday specifically and they've been pushing it hard so i really like fab likes men um i do not like this ad just because they say they said like lulu but a third of the price i'm highly against you know any type of calling out your competition like that any advertisement because one uh these bigger brands have the proper legal team to do it but these smaller brands you know that are doing thirty thousand dollars a month fifty thousand dollars a month do not have the legal resources to be able to do that if and if that brand comes after them have the legal protection or they're just going to pretty much get shut down so do not call out your competitors in an ad uh that's probably one of the worst ways or one of the easiest ways to get sued or potentially get your store shut down or you know other people getting mad and stuff like that um i've worked with a brand before that i was literally doing like 5k a month want to call out some of these bigger brands i like that in ads and just it doesn't look great but again these bigger brands have the legal team and the lawyers to pull that off um and you know the ways to pull that off uh so uh don't do it just because these bigger brands did it so with that being said um again just a very straightforward ad though i really like the other half of that other really great of the concept uh black friday starts now i would make this just a little bit bigger or maybe even swap that with this up here just because i feel like the yellow on the phone is a little too small but the 70 off everything screams uh showing off the collection of products versus just one product and it works pretty good it looks like it works well looks like it works good because again don't have the analytics on this this is another kind of story ad right here uh black friday early access now this is just early access like hey this is like you know you can come and shop now you it's not a offer it's not a list building or anything like that it's just straightforward early access come purchase now 60 off now i really like this act because it just looks really cool um i really like how the the products you're dangling with the with the ribbon kind of through it like the stardust in the back like it just looks really cool so that's why i like it it's definitely gives me some christmas vibes as well between the cold the green and the red in there yeah really cool ad yeah i like it again black friday i would make this just a little bit bigger a little bit more bolder i feel like it's a little easy to kind of come off but then again it might kind of pull away your attention from that main product right there now this is my last ad um i honestly really like this ad i don't know why it's very easy so this ad right here black friday vip or the access now i'm not sure why they said vip or the access when i could easily just hit shop now and start um maybe this was meant for retargeting ad for their vip list maybe uh but very straightforward again just a simple product very nice background everything like that and color scheme all that looks good so um yeah just a very appealing ad that really caught my attention black friday early access uh yeah straightforward so really hope you guys enjoyed these creatives again this is just things i've screenshot online that kind of captured my attention use these to create your own black friday creatives or kind of give you a guide to what to create secondly we recommend creating about seven to ten different black friday ads try to go for a lot of different uh colors a lot of different like showing off different products and stuff like that because when black friday hits you need to have all that prepared for black friday because when black friday hits you're going to start spending a lot and you start burning through creative fast because you're retargeting a lot of people a good portion of black friday is just retargeting people you've acquired throughout the year and if you start retargeting all those people and a creative starts fatiguing and you have to start swapping things out and not having those prepped will lead to just a bad black friday because you're going to need new creative and you won't have it you have to get your creative team to create it it might take a few days and you just you won't have enough time to get in for black friday so we recommend creating about anywhere from five to ten creatives for black friday cyber monday the more spend the more creatives you need so i really hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you hit that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday and friday if you're an ecom
