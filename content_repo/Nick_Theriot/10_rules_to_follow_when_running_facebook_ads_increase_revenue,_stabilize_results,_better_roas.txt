yo what is going on guys welcome back to the channel Nick terrio here and today I want to bring you guys a new video of 10 rules you can follow to better manage your at Facebook ad campaigns make you more money essentially become a better overall effective Facebook ads advertiser I follow these rules on a day-to-day basis and these rules itself have allowed me to make over 2.3 million dollars in business revenue for my clients I work with on a day-to-day basis over the last 10 months so jumping right into this video here we go so rule number one is when I'm creating a new campaign specifically to a cold audience I will always go ahead and set up a CBO campaign optimized for purchases so CBO which is campaign budget optimization I must select the conversions thing and then I'll go ahead and offer all my ad sets I will make sure they are optimized for purchases reason behind this is even if you have no data history on you know who purchased from you going for purchases is very effective because Facebook actually has a directory of people classified under the purchase conversion so they list standard people who are on Facebook every day as someone likely to purchase and when you optimize for purchases you are going to feed your ads out in front of those people rule number two is when I'm creating a cold audience campaign I will always go ahead and fill it up with 10 ad sets at $100 a day especially again CBO optimized for purchases and in those 10 ad sets they're all they're all gonna have the same four creatives and each one of those creatives will go after a different persona so a persona essentially someone that's kind of like a demographic that would purchase from you so essentially a chicken breast at a store but one persona could be a mom going to the store to buy a chicken breast to cook a nice meal for a family a second persona will be a bodybuilder going to a store to purchase a chicken breast for the extra protein they both have different buyer motives and two different types of people so what you want to do is you want to create about three to four different buyer personas for your product some of your products may be harder some of your products you may have to go more of go after more of the motives and that's okay but essentially you want to call out three to four different people you know that would likely to purchase your product and then that's going to get you better results because you'll be directly speaking to your consumer and I will use the same exact creative essentially the the video or the photo for all ten of those ad sets for all four of those creatives so same ad pretty much for everything and then what I'll do is I'll beef up that ad as we go down the line just again different ad copy for each one of those creatives if that makes sense rule number three is once I set a campaign live I will not touch it for three days Facebook has a 72 hour rule for when you launch a campaign you let it optimize for 72 hours this would give you the best results in the long run I see too many people launch a campaign one day the next day cut it off because it wasn't profitable but if they would just let it run another two days they would see way better results because it takes about 72 hours before Facebook to fully fine-tune your creatives your audiences to your you know to get your results essentially rule number four is after your three days essentially what you want to do is you want to dive into your campaign you had set up and then you want to turn off all the unprofitable ads and unprofitable ad sets then what you want to do is you want to focus your attention on the winning audiences creating more audiences similar to those and then also to creating more ads similar to the ones that did well so that way you could find ways to improve them and increase the ROAS and you know purchases the pulling power all that stuff for those profitable ads then if you have no profitable ad sets they're all unprofitable what you want to do is you want to focus your time and attention on the audience I mean you want to focus your time and attention on the creative itself that's the ad copy and the ad you know that the creative and try to see what you can do to improve it rule number five is you never want to make a change to a already running ad set too many people I see I'll give them a few tips and I'll go ahead and try to make that change to already running ad set the problem with this is the way Facebook works is when you target an audience so like let's say you have an ad set with an audience size of one million people that ad set will only optimize to about a hundred thousand people it only optimizes to a small pool of that people and when you go make a significant change to an ad set so let's say you go ahead and change the you know budget by extreme you know 10 times it if you're doing abo maybe you are going ahead and changing all of the targeting in it maybe you are adding in some exclusions to that audience you know you're really changing that ad set what you're doing is essentially is going to re-optimize and there's a high chance it won't optimize that same audience you were already you know targeting or that it Facebook has locked down onto and what's going to do is it's going to throw off your results so you can have a profitable ad set make a few changes to it and the next day it becomes unprofitable and there's no like you wait for a few more days and still never becomes profitable again that's just due to the audience pool would lock down to rule number six is when you're scaling campaigns whether it's a cbo campaign or an abo campaign where you're scaling the ad set level budgets never scale it by more than 20 percent daily i've tested many different ones you know scaling 40 every other day scaling by 100 for cbo campaigns only um every other day and uh 20 percent is a minute change it's small but uh over time it's going to allow you to have more consistent results because even with a cbo campaign if you scale it up say by 100 every other day um or every day and let's say you get a higher budget you know a thousand two three thousand dollars a day when you make that scale um you know doubling the budget essentially it's such a drastic change it's going to throw off the ad sets the ad sets will go back into learning and re-optimizing and again you'll have a high chance you'll go ahead and um losing that audience pool you were originally targeting and you might see your campaign just suffer for a few days before it pops back up same thing with ad set level budget optimization uh you scale too aggressively you risk throwing off your ad sets you risk getting out your pool of audience that was profitable um and you have problems i see too many people trying to scale too quickly uh specifically even though retargeting campaigns so um take your time of scaling because if you do it wrong you will screw up your ad account and you will be regretting it because then you have to re-kind of do a lot of shit and it's not fun rule number seven is going back to how much you should be spending per day uh this one's specifically going over your total budget so let's say you have a total budget of a thousand dollars a day you want to spend seven hundred dollars on cold audience campaigns and three hundred dollars a day on retargeting campaigns so that's a 70 30 split and i do this with any level of budget the reason behind it is because you know you focus on all that prospecting and stuff and then out of those percentage of people that take out actually take actions on your website uh 30 spent on retargeting some people i'll see they'll spend you know a hundred dollars a day on cold audience and a hundred dollars a day on retargeting and their retargeting sucks and i'm like look just decrease the budget on retargeting they spend less retargeting their os pops back up on the retargeting side and they push a little bit more to our cold audience and all of a sudden they see some really good results and that's just because they just need to reallocate their budgets rule number eight is going back to abo campaigns so an abo camp where you change the budget at the ad set level so i still recommend abo campaigns for retargeting the reason behind it is if you're someone like me who runs a lot of different audiences uh inside retargeting and likes to kind do a customer journey with them so like from one to three days they get this one specific ad from three to four days they get another specific ad from five to seven days they get another ad uh what a cbo campaign will do is they'll come there and they'll it'll just find the best audience and just push one ad to them and that's not what i want i want to set up a sequence of ads that go out to their timelines over over time so they can build more trust and you know build more awareness with our brand essentially and with a cbo campaign you can't do that an abo campaign you can as it would get a smooth split of budget between all those uh different time periods and it works really well so if you're actually curious about my retargeting strategy uh you click the link in this or you can search up this video right here uh i go over all the like retargeting methods i do and you know time frames and stuff i go out there and it's super super valuable rule number nine going back to retargeting is actually segmenting your retargeting audiences don't be the person that retargets people as a whole like all of your website visitors regardless of what action they took on your website all of your social engagement you know everyone that's engaged to your brand plus website visitors break down your retargeting audiences it should be split by social engagement these are people who engage with your instagram page engage with your facebook page um then your website visitors these are people who just visit to your website but then not purchase or add to cart from you then you should have your add to cart audience these are people who add to cart but they're not purchase and then there is the purchase audience which you can do for repeat buyers again each one requires a different approach what information do they need to get them to the next step in the funnel rule number 10 is spend less time in the ads manager this is one of the first things i've learned when i started investing into higher level education when it came to facebook ads is actually spend less time i've noticed a lot of these ad experts they spend hardly any time in the ads manager don't get confused with not doing anything just spend a little less time pull yourself back from and focus on other aspects of your business inside the ads manager i'll see people make like five different changes for a single campaign in one day then the next day wake up look at that campaign don't see it profitable they make five more changes and then they repeat the following day and just keep doing this on all their campaigns in their ad account they're spending multiple hours a day figuring out trying to figure out what's going on and essentially what they're doing is they're not letting it optimize they're not getting results because they're not letting it optimize and they're just staying at a low row as and they're just freaking out that's essentially what's happening and that's why i'm saying pull yourself back limit yourself to one change per campaign every 48 hours so if you have five campaigns on then you get five changes every 48 hours for one change per campaign if that makes sense and this could be simply introducing a new audience this could be introducing a new creative uh some new ad copy uh you know just working with some exclusions and stuff um optimizing some ads this could just just be different things like that and this will give you help you pull back a little bit because now you have a rule of what you can do um also too it will give facebook more time to optimize and get results for you again facebook needs time to optimize if you don't give it that time you're not going to get results lastly if you're
