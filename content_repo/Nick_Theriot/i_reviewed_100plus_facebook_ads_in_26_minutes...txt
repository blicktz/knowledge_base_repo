yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio i have an exciting new video for you guys where i'm actually going to share with y'all a bunch of ads that i've screenshotted over the last six months this is something new i want to start doing once a month um so like this is the may 21 may 2021 photo dump of all of the ads i've screenshotted in may but i haven't done one since like september october last year so i'm actually going to show you guys all the ads i've screenshotted from november to may so it's gonna be a long video so reacting to a whole bunch of ads and hopefully you can use this i know my team will be using this as well to take some inspiration for some of our ads and advertising campaigns again this is just me on my phone screenshotting ads doing a little bit of ad research on people this is something that any one of you guys can do by using the facebook ad library inside facebook ads so sit back relax this will be a video just to chill we're gonna look at some advertising make this nice and chill and maybe my editor can make this kind of cool chillax plus a plate of food out because guys we're in for a real treat with this video make sure that like button hit that subscribe button for new videos every monday wednesday friday and let's get started so wow black friday so this was the last ad right here i reacted to in the last video so now we're flashing it back to november 22nd of 2020 and today is may 29th so this will be the may 2021 photo dump plus the last five six months on top of that and then from now on you'll start expecting just like the june photo dump and it'll be just june's ads now again these are ads i screenshot it these are ads i just found online and stuff really enjoyed they're in my folder that's it i'm sharing with you guys something any one of you guys can do and hopefully we can learn from some of these other brands so getting started cuts right here so their clothing brand and stuff um just simply effective advertising right here black friday sell tailored fit fit retention wrinkle free four-way stretch show it's addressing different pain points different benefits for the product 30 off site-wide shows the product black friday sell it screams at you at the time of black friday you want to be able to scream at these brands at these people that's watching the advertising it's also likely a retargeting ad so how do you follow them so it's also retargeting yes they don't have to do much on the selling aspect of their clothing really good just straight foam mattress black friday sell 50 off i'm not sure if this is a retargeting ad or not but black friday usually spends a lot more money on uh retargeting ads so could be a potential retargeting ad but again just simple straight to the point if this wasn't a retargeting ad they could do a lot better at selling the mattress but again black friday there's a lot of noise we want to be simple quick and effective with our um you know offers and stuff like this same thing right here simple quick effective six percent off everything same literally the same theme i'm not gonna go too deep in this now this one's really cool what i like about this one is because one i first off it caught my attention while scrolling through my camera roll to get all these put together because it's like kind of angled a little bit weird so like it cuts through noise you flip and boom boom boom boom boom boom and boom it kind of just a pattern interrupt works really well and then two look how it shows a lot of variety of products that makes it seem like there's a lot more stuff on this website a lot of really cool things and it's 50 off everything so there's it actually grabs my attention by showing off a lot of their different products i would say it's cool but because they have so many different like tiers you forget about what is like what percentage is off so you know i i'm not a fan at all of multi-tier discount or like discounts for different products or like in a promo like this because there's so much going on i'm gonna forget exactly what's on uh discount by the time we get on their website same thing simple quick effective shows off the product shows off the brand now ad world conference if you have not seen one of their ad worlds ecom ad world ad world the variety of different ad world conferences if you have not seen any of their advertising is probably the best creatives i've ever seen in my life they show they do a lot of 2d graphics like this that just pops out very well and they do some really cool advertising which with our campaigns is like six months before they do an event they'll start doing you know discounted tiers so like six months ago it was like under 100 bucks and actually i can attest that this is true that their tickets were 750 at the time of the event because i did try to buy a late ticket it was 750 bucks for this event really cool again showing off a variety of new products this all the all new elite plus joggers can clearly reimagine for ultimate comfort perfect for all seasons so you guys asked a lot about what type of ad copy to write for clothing brands here's an angle right here showing off the variety of new products that's hit the uh store and then perfect for all seasons cool experience premium basics but you built just one of those cool ads showing off a variety um or like hitting just like it's kind of like one of those weird like you know unique products just a quick little piece of ad copy we also stack bacon it ties into what the uh you know this body stackers union right here um aim small miss small so just right here's kind of like unique advertising simple quick effective this one has me a little all over the place and actually i don't think it had any like likes or comments on it so actually it could have been pretty bad again simple quick effective simple quick effective simple quick effective like literally free sales events it's just straight simple quick effective for all of these now this is so again the multi-tier discounts just suck just literally do 30 offside wide keep it simple that looks good love it this one right here i think this is not actually this is actually a retargeting ad so what happens is it's it's using the catalog cells and it's showing off a variety of products take off 50 off all your favorite home decors use coupon code so it's just retargeting people that was really good um this is really cool some really good user-generated content with song finch where it actually allows you to record personalize like song and send it over to a loved one and they did a lot of really good uh user-generated content people actually enjoying it because it's all emotional selling with this particular product really good again this is another clothing brand style ad 316 collection is like a christian based clothing brand and this is like one of their retargeting ads right here wake up dreamer future awaits your arrival future is ready to celebrate your future is calling saying 316 collection so literally great piece of ad copy very creative and actually personally know the agency that that ran the advertising for uh does run the advertising for this particular brand and i know they've crushed it's called them with some multiple six figures and it's a lot of very creative advertising they do but they also did scale up really really hard with one product so they had a very good product plus very good creative and ad copy and stuff and just really allowed for some really good success gotta keep up a good momentum we're already 10 minutes in and i only have 30 minutes of footage left so let's get this momentum going let's see let's just kind of scroll through i just want to keep going we're gonna see something unique really pops up to us oh there we go another 316 collection so it's this product right here that will be able to scale up very very hard again don't hide your light let it shine finish your now get 10 off of code blank so again just hitting you with a different perspective retargeting ad it's another retargeting ad right here okay so this one right here is actually really cool because this one with this particular creative i actually don't know snow at all so like this one was right here was like completely uh or it's actually honestly might have been a retargeting ad because i did visit them at the time but again once snow is christmas i should be in a line against today calling out that shipping in soon a few benefits let's finish the zero for sprinkling white smile not a retargeting ad from them cool so this is like a retargeting ad specifically people that know the brand just showing off new product alert this is a retargeting axe actually visit their website and then they hit me up with this testimonial ad right here really great way of showing off the production of this particular piece it's not just like some dropship product showing off production background showing off the product very easy i'm not gonna go through that it's an e-com now this is something i really enjoy with chamber media right here is that they're literally saying a deadline seven days all it takes to get an award-winning ad for your business get your video in seven days so obviously it's working very well just look at the views comments and stuff like that so it's likely working very well for them another way of clothing ad copy welcome in 22 welcome in 2021 something fabulous so this could be a very specific call to action to um you know the new year just be a new month to be a new season you can do these welcome type of ad copy works really well another type of retargeting ad gorgeous personalized room with custom names and address times so like it's specifically calling out specific action they can do with these things personalize your home with custom names they're saying gorgeous they're unique turn your house into home these high quality monograms colin wayne again so it's another type of thing right here where like it's limit time offered 30 35 off today only so it's a very very very hard aggressive ad simple quick effective another way of doing a sale end of the year sale end of the year you know really pushing it same thing come back and get that piece you want it retargeting back in stock so it's a great way of you know releasing a new product or getting that product back in stock and back in front of the people that maybe retargeting it cool so another yeah maybe retargeting ads also could be a warm great great retargeting ad this is a very very good piece of user-generated content it's showing the people enjoying that product together i got this from my wife janette we wrote all of our family members it's literally ad copy per you know pertains to the particular creative personalized canvas gift really cool great retargeting ad great just simple quick effective piece of ad copy only shirt worth wearing and like you can clearly see you know it's out and about it's not like just some plain white background that grabs your attention says a quick statement and that's it great curiosity factor kind of great curiosity factor as well also showing the the product off and it's very you know it's jewelry it's bright it's shining very attractive another retargeting ad from them again just retargeting at thousands of happy customers this is really cool so it's just a it's actually a tick tock ad a screenshot and it's literally just showing off these particular products valentine's day pre-order available now another retargeting ad from them again person using the whole you know smiling by the product it increases that social proof increases people liking this particular product so again a quick smirky kind of like comment flowers and chocolate won't last forever this valentine's day gift forever this valentine's day gift will so showing off whatever product thing when i was actually buying the desk i'm actually standing at right now i screenshot a lot of their stuff this is a retargeting ad people using a product loving it showing off different setups with it free shipping 30 free trial so acknowledging three key benefits of why you should purchase from them that's also another thing too when you're stating three reasons why you should buy this particular product literally keep it just on the three because it's quicker and easier for the people to memorize we actually replicated this ad right here did a ton of money but very simple just the founder holding the product can talk about the product very very straightforward works very well same exact specific thing right there same thing right here ending soon scarcity fear of missing out leveraging those key psychological factors the perfect valentine's day gift positioning the product in front of the consumer i mean these right here literally just 15 plus million ads managed 7x for us so leveraging a lot of case studies and social proof their services work gift getting careful and now this one was pretty weak honestly just nah doesn't really have any pizzazz to it again holding a product kind of reacting to the product looks good really unique product couple goals if you love if you love how your person feels in your arms but you can't cuddle at every moment give our matching couple bracelets to stay connected so really loving i think the only thing i would really change about this ad is have this one but i'll also test one where them like holding their hands side by side and their faces in it of like very lovey feeling really unique way showing like a person a model wearing the glasses showing the glasses look good great simple effective way putting the product down life-changing product i know learning around with the shave pluck every few days i think the only thing is with there's a few other different products in it it can sometimes take people's attention away and confuse people with product i'm talking about great way effective way to show off a cell the reason why though this is not the one thing i would add to this is there's no reason why there's a seller just say it's 57 off why though that's the key you gotta ask yourself every time you do a sale hitting a really strong um you know like commonality you you've spent enough money on your ads for your business and we don't want you to spend any more on an e-commerce store you'll want to see this best investment i've ever made now i don't even have to shave my skin is so smooth so now this is a great way of positioning product it's just showing a girl and then hold the product great effective way same thing going back to the uh you know the creative the person holding it same thing holding the product great great product shot showing off the detail of the product then our high quality unique collections now i know this is more of an um a retargeting ad so you don't have to say much to get sales from this just grabbing attention is your business using quickbooks so another effective way of grabbing your ideal audience's

get 50 off any two portal from facebook i i just don't understand two what though two portals do i get the tv and this like what all exactly two so i think that's something i'll just refine a little bit eight figure email sell strategies this is another way really hyping up econ world it's showing some some of the content that's going to be shot or the content that'll be released during this period of time it's showing some of that content and uh as like a pre hyping up people for hulu introducing our self-service ad platform advertised next to tv's biggest shows simple quick effective one of a kind custom made in the usa personalized monograms this is really cool 12 minute app so like it's showing a book 300 pages in a few days 300 pages in 12 minutes so it's kind of like a before and after and side by side split screen ads also i've been working really well too kind of like an introductory prospecting ad i know it's a prospecting ad because i never haven't shown any interest in his brand ever but just a little bit about like his story and teaches dog training so literally what caught my attention right here is brandon mcmillian teaches dog show teaches dog training i skim past all of this i'd even look at this i looked at teaches dog training and blank teaches dog training and honestly i scrolled past it a screenshot though just because it caught my attention shop the look this works really well too for clothing showing off a variety of different outfits and then also to create a dedicated offer a bundle with that outfit on your shopify store and doing a shop the look and you know grabbing that look of the model cool experimental thing though it's by athlete i feel like they've been really revamping their advertising team really cool the most versatile shirt of 2021 showing off a few different products i think if i'm going to show off the most versatile shirt 2021 i also want to see a variety of different uses with it so maybe working going out going to the gym like wherever more wear this shirt to be the most versatile doesn't really establish that this is work leisure zoom office vacation again three specific key benefits and key points they're establishing because they know people are going to forget review just showing off some stuff they're getting now one thing about this is one i've never actually been like met with this brand before i have no clue where they're selling here a lot of different products so that's a very key problem very cool user-driven content from rose skin co some user-driven content kinda just going over like the app comfort now literally a key point key benefit they're really pushing comfort now with their clothing also looks really comfortable that's also another thing too you need to be able to back up the statement you're making through your creative i really no interest that's just because it's not mine how to never shave again so user-driven content leveraging a key point or key interest of their ideal audience new versus pro just kind of showing off some of their products i don't even know honestly i don't even know what this is like i don't know if if noob is means like this like i don't know if this is a design service because i've never engaged this brand but like maybe it's a design service because it's like noob super hoodie but pro looks a lot more advanced 98 lifetime so lifetime is usually for like an app or something really good customer testimonials for boom by sending joseph using a product using the content all that good stuff um this is actually one of our brands right here we're leveraging someone enjoying the product and stuff perfect gift perfect father's day gifts it's hard to find unless of course it's a personalized gift so we're still optimizing this campaign a little bit we're still testing a few different key pieces of advertising like ad copy and everything but i can tell you right now the reason why this campaign didn't work that the greatest is because this ad copy is a little bit hard to like tongue tie this is an app don't have the full video of it retargeting ad thinking of essence vault fragrances weird thing of you as well great retargeting ad great user journey content simple quick effective simple quick effective three key points again three key points very very common lately with all these ads factor of invention image drawings the best bite calling out a specific love for these particular things get 10 off simple quick effective three key points lots of users generated content when these ads i screenshotted them because they're video so but they're also very uh they're user-generated content based so people are using and using the particular product same thing here showing off the product some users are in the content right here and then yeah some more like reviews and stuff of these and again showing off the use of that particular product it's not just you know going ahead and you know posting like a white background cool again three key points super soft and stretchy adjustable head support breathable fabric your cards about to expire at home laser hair removal 100 off really really good product you versus them you better sleep cooler sleep better hair better skin them toss this whole thing out showing like an old nasty pillowcase and this could also be like us versus them like competitor reviews and competitor stuff like this been very very common lately it's been working very well across all brands this is just i don't know how i feel about it it's because it's i'm sure there's gonna a lot of weird you know comments on it you can only imagine because it's like a 19 year old flex with a bunch of money i'm sure the comments are just glorious on it but again usage generated content are you getting tired of low likes and views so establishing a key pain point no cookies no problem so establishing a key pain point or a key trend in the market right now that people are facing now this one i didn't really know about because honestly i didn't even realize this would have drank at first i feel like this creative could be felt a little changed up a little bit more they sell quick simple and effective and then literally screenshot it this two day all new sugar sugar skulls literally just showing off new products guys i am one out after that but we made it we made it to the end of the video this is reacting to i think we're probably like 200 ads that i literally put together but i want to start doing one of these once a month and showing an archive of
