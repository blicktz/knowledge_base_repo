yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel Nick Terrio here and today I have a very important video for you obviously I haven't made much content about iOS 14 but I do have a very huge video in the works today I specifically want to release this video now because we just got a new alert from our Facebook rep that January 21st of 2021 they're gonna start implementing some iOS 14 updates and changes and that you need to make sure your domain is verified inside of your business manager so with that being said I want to quickly create a video for you obviously I don't know the full impact of which not having a verified domain will cause but Facebook is definitely strictly saying hey we highly recommend this and do this now because it will affect your results I don't know the impact but let's do it to be safe it's very simple and I'm gonna show you that in today's video before we get started make sure the like button and hit the subscribe button for new videos almost every day on this channel around Facebook ads ecommerce and Shopify let's get started okay guys so what you want to do is you want to go to business.facebook.com and click on the business account you use to run all of your ads so if you're an agency and this one of your clients your clients need to do this for themselves or you can do this for the client just make sure it's registered in their business account so for us we're using one of our like dummy accounts you know create a dummy business domain and stuff like that so we'll go ahead and use that for this particular video but again you want to make sure the client does it or if you yourself run all your ads and stuff you need to go to your business.facebook.com and you need to make sure you verify your domain so to do this we're gonna go right here to our business settings and then we're gonna go right here to brand safety domain and you can see right here this dummy account doesn't have any domains yet so we're gonna add a domain and I'm gonna use one of my old domains so you type in your one right here boom add domain and then give it a second maybe I have to load it there we go okay so as you can see right here it says verification pending so what you have to do is you have to upload a file to our your DNS settings or add a little text string to your DNS settings so what you need to do is where you registered your domain at where you purchase it whether it's GoDaddy Namecheap etc you need to go to that website and if you use an outside source to like manage your DNS like we do we use Cloudflare then you need to go to Cloudflare but 99% of y'all probably is gonna go straight to your your Namecheap GoDaddy or wherever else you might have bought your domain from so we're gonna go right here sorry DNS right here again it's just an example what it looks like so we need to add a record so for us it's a text record we're gonna add an at as the host field and then we need to copy this right here so we're gonna copy the clipboard add record again it's a text record so it's just something like a text file we're gonna just put an at and content place that and I'm gonna save there we go that's it that's all we had to do and then I'm gonna click on verify simple as that but yeah guys that's very simple to register domain and highly recommend doing this ASAP doing this right now because we don't know the full effects but Facebook is very like pushing it hard from an outside perspective and just kind of looking at it as a whole brand verification something that we've noticed has been a lot like verified domains has always performed better in terms of unverified accounts and then on top of that is Facebook trust is his domain so we see less like add disruptions random ad account it's getting shut down stuff like that so we do see benefits of having your verified domain and correct me if I'm wrong it's worth the full five minutes it takes to verify it highly recommend doing this right now because you could see a possible negative effect of not doing this past January 21st of 2021 and like said we don't know the full effects of what iOS 14 is gonna do in terms of not having a verified domain but if Facebook is telling you do this do it now get it done it helps out with your brand over already and if it's gonna help out minimize the effects of iOS 14 it's worth doing this right now so that
