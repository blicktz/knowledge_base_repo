so we watched a new f1 movie last night the girl i'm seeing and i don't know if y'all are into f1 or whatnot but i love cars i've been around cars my whole life throwing my ball with my dog but uh yeah oh that was terrible anyway love the new f1 movie brad pitt and a couple of the other actors i'm not really a big movie guy that knows all the actors and stuff like that but really solid movie and it got me thinking because there's one key thing in this particular movie that they said and it was put down your head and dry and i think that's where so many people mess up who were wanting to be successful in life where they start focusing on the things that comes with success and they don't focus on the thing that actually creates success example so many people are focused on the lamborghini but they're not focused on what it takes to get a lamborghini and this is a huge mistake that i was making back in my early days when i was trying to actually go out there and become quote-unquote successful and quote-unquote make more money and you know all of those things to break free from the rat race and it's funny because all of the things that these big gurus told me online of like hey you have to do a three-hour morning routine you have to write down 50 different goals every morning you have to do a cold plunge all of these things that was going to make me quote-unquote successful actually never did anything in the sense of making me successful or helping me make more money all that did was create more distraction and it took me a long time to figure that out before i start to see success or start to see results and i would literally sit down i think every sunday i like to sit down and just kind of like review my thoughts and spend time but like a pen and paper just thinking and stuff and i would just like write down these new crazy morning routines and all these crazy things that i you know i need to think bigger i need to think about more cars i need to think about buying and a pit house now also miami when like i was still making nothing like i think i was making maybe 500 a month from facebook ads with my one client at the time that i had and i was never thinking about the actual thing that creates success i wasn't putting my head down and just driving i was thinking about all of these other things that quote-unquote is what you need to do to be successful but they were all wrong none of it actually worked in the sense of helping me make more money but once i actually put my head and down and just started driving and ignoring everything i stopped focusing on making money i stopped focusing on lamborghinis i stopped focusing on views on youtube and i just started focusing on driving is when i actually started to you know get the big benjamins right here and the way i did that was by understanding mastery first mastery is where you pick a particular skill set and focus and obsess on that skill set until you achieve mastering with it and when you focus on that skill set and getting better with that skill set it creates all of these byproducts which byproducts is a result of your action if i go ahead walk down the street and punch someone the byproduct of that is i'm probably gonna get arrested and go to jail so the same thing here with success you have to understand that the action itself is what you want to focus on mastery with when you focus on mastery with that particular action byproducts of you being really good at that action is the success those byproducts is the lamborghini it's the penthouse in miami it's being able to travel multiple times a year so like for me in my particular example right here i was right here at zero and i wanted to get to 100 and for me to get there let's actually zoom in on this real quick for me to get there i need to achieve mastery okay but with what what was the thing i was going to master to get to here which would create all of these byproducts which is money cars girls houses like all of that all right how do i get there what do i need to master to get there now for me it was facebook ads that is what i chose to master right there and i know if i got really good at that it would help me get here okay why because it helps people make money right i know people are willing to spend more money on things that make them money whereas things that people that doesn't get an roi makes it's less of a reason why i would spend money in that for example i have mentors that i spend thousands of dollars a month on why because when i pay them a couple thousand dollars for one call guess what happens i make more money as a result of that thing so if i give them more money i make more money now from that let's just say for example you know like this mic right here like don't get me wrong it makes me a lot of money because you get tied to like my youtube channel and stuff like that but the amount of money it makes from this mic to compared to choosing my iphone it's significantly just very small difference and also too majority of the market doesn't know how to make money with this so realistically 100 200 at most is all you can charge for this even though you'll spend hundreds of hours using that mic whereas you hop on a call with me and i help you fix a problem in your business with your facebook advertising and what's going to happen you're going to likely spend a lot more money on me because hey you pay nick a thousand dollars yes that's a thousand dollars that's a lot of money for one call but then in that one call i help you tweak something with your creatives and all of a sudden you go from 30k a month to 100k 200 000 a month in revenue the roi on there is fucking amazing so people are willing to pay you more when you make them more money so for me that's why i chose mastering facebook ads and the same rules that i'm going to show you guys here in a second for mastery of how to achieve mastery and stuff those things can be applied to anything i apply that to dating i apply that to boxing and weight lifting and even my like relationship with god and stuff like that i apply all of that to other areas of my life as well so it's not just facebook ads that i've applied that in my life and also i'm gonna be very clear here when you are doing mastery quote-unquote mastery is putting your head down and driving that was a big part of the movie last night where you know they focused on that part right there where it's just like putting your head down and driving they they were spending time reviewing the footage from like other races and stuff they were spit time in the simulator just countless like 100 times going over and over and over and over over the same little corner just trying to cut off a fraction of a second around that corner right there and those are the things that professionals and like high-end people that's been practicing for years at a specific task to achieve mastery that's the types of reps they become obsessive with to get to that next level yes it's very minor but those fractions of a second literally is the difference of millions of dollars in terms of how much they get paid on a year-to-year basis and that's the same thing when you become obsessive over something in the sense of hey i want to become mastery with facebook ads in the beginning like if you've never ran facebook ads before i could sit down and show you okay here's how to set up a campaign it's like oh my god you showed me how to set up a campaign this is amazing like that was a huge leap from something very very very small that doesn't take hundreds of reps to really showcase like pretty much anyone can watch two or three videos on how to set up a facebook ads campaign and then boom like they're a wizard in that sense so same thing goes here for mastery it's where as you put in more reps and as you do more of something you have to do very very small little tweaks to be able to get to that next level so for example if i'm sitting down on a call people pay me thousands of dollars to offer one call with them because they're accessing not just here's how to set up a campaign real quick nick it's they're accessing 10 years of running facebook ads my trained eyes i've seen thousands of ads and also too i've seen hundreds of ads that's been profitable and it's worked and they're access they're accessing all of that information right there just to shave off one little two three little words on an ad that all sudden doubles in revenue because now we're talking to the customer slightly better in terms of human psychology so now that you know hey you basically just need to blind everything out and you need to focus on mastery of one skill set that's going to create byproducts of the success you want and if you lock in and focus on that it creates the outcomes you want so now it's how do you reverse engineer that and what are the daily habits that you need to do to be able to achieve that that's also the other thing you have to look at is when you reverse engineer something it needs to be tangible goals so like if i want to lose let's just say 30 pounds over the course of 90 days i can't just say like all right i have a goal of losing 30 pounds in 90 days i have a goal of setting you know of losing 30 pounds in 90 days and i just keep saying this myself like that doesn't do anything there's nothing actionable about that and that's what i hate so fucking much about 95 of the like here's my million dollar morning routine i write on a notepad right when i wake up i want a lamborghini i want to live in a penthouse in miami and like don't get me wrong it's cool to think about those things there's nothing wrong at all there's a lot of things like i specifically want that are materialistic and like like i want other houses i want an inventor i want like these other things in my life it's not the fact that you're setting a goal to achieve that thing in terms of like a car or setting a goal to buy a house it's you're looking at it from the wrong perspective is i want to set goals that if i achieve this thing these things just happen i want to set a goal that if i help let's just say for example 50 entrepreneurs hit seven figures muffin revenue that okay if i hit if i help 50 people make a million dollars a month i'm probably gonna be making like two three million dollars a year and i can easily afford a lamborghini i can easily afford the house i want so then it's breaking down is what does your day-to-day look like what do you specifically have to do each every single day that's setting the habits next now for me specifically i've like studied i'm obsessive over like professionals in terms of like professional athletes specifically like football players and i'm from america so like it's like the actual football you throw and stuff not like you kick and shit like that but i like to obsess over that i like to obsess over like f1 professional drivers and stuff and i found three similarities between all of them that if done every day it becomes impossible not to master a skill set all right so let's just go right down number one number one is going to be learn okay every day you're setting some time to learn not about anything i i can't stand this this shit where it's like hey i want to learn more about facebook ads and every day they set a goal to learn and then like one of their learn blocks they use which is like how to read a book on like how to pick up girls it's like the fuck are you doing like if you're going to set a goal every day to read and learn you want to specifically set that goal of learning around the thing you want to learn or around the skill set that you want to improve so like for me when i work with my boxing coach i'm putting intention about learning with someone who's done it already been there where i want to go and they're helping me cut down my time by showing me the things i need to learn so first thing is just learning specifically around the skill set you want to achieve and you want to do now the next one is going to be review right so we see this all the time with like football coaches where like after a game they will literally go pick up their ipad the ipad already has the whole all the game footage from you know their specific gameplay everything where they can sit down watch the whole game review it and they can ask themselves three specific questions what went right what went wrong what can i improve if you take every chance you get to actually apply your skill sets and ask yourself those three questions every time in your post game review if it's running facebook ads that's literally every facebook ad you launch spend time breaking down that ad after you launch it what went right what went wrong what can i improve on regardless if it was profitable regardless if it sucked and tanked just like specifically asking yourself hey what went right what went wrong what can i improve if you do that you'll consistently get better through actions now the last one right here is just simply practice right you get better when you put the reps in now the reason why i have to say it like that is because there's so many people that just sit at home and they like to sit there and overthink everything and they never take action if you never take action what do how do you know what you need to improve because if you don't take action failure can't occur mistakes can't occur and you just stay in the same position but when you take action and you allow those mistakes to happen when you allow imperfect action to take place you get feedback feedback feedback is the mistakes i don't look at mistakes as any anything wrong that's just simply data back to me of what i can optimize on we as humans have this this thing where we have to attach failure and we have to attach ego to the numbers i remove all that and it's literally just numbers that i'm getting back then i can just ask myself okay i put the reps in here's the numbers now let's just go simply do our review session if we learn how to review then we can understand what we need to go learn and fix on so when we practice it allows us to review and if we review it allows us what we need to learn which then allows us to go practice what we learn and it's just this never-ending cycle between them that consistently allow you to grow and become a better person and make more because you are mastering and when i actually look at the day-to-day skill set in the sense of what are my habits that i need to do regardless of what you are doing in life whether you're trying to become a better facebook ads marketer when you try to you know learn how to do boxing whether you're trying to learn how to start running or you know you're trying to learn how to how to get a girlfriend for example all three of these things will allow you to master any skill set you want and depending on the skill set you master will create that byproduct of the cars the houses the girls the money all of those good things so you focus on mastery of a skill set that creates the byproduct of which you want this is where you now have to start understanding what skill set do you want to master so the biggest thing for me when i first think about what skill set i want to master is outcomes if i think in outcomes first it'll allow me to understand okay hey what do i want to achieve in life for me i love cars that's why i have this iris right here and i got the c8 right here not to be flash or anything like that but this is things i wanted in my life so i knew i had to understand that okay hey whatever skill set i master i need to be able to scale that and monetize that to be able to afford enough like make enough money to be able to afford things like this so when you think about your outcomes first this is where it's like the life you want to live or you know maybe the outcome is being shredded with six-pack abs maybe it's you know being a professional boxer like whatever that outcome is that's the first thing you have to understand once you understand that outcome then that's where you start doing just basically the research right there especially too if it's like making money and stuff like that that's also where it's like going down and like you know running the numbers basically so like if your outcome for example is a ford a lamborghini for example like this little artist that i'm in right now like you know this thing is going to run you about three four thousand dollars a month and a monthly payment and everything you need to be able to make enough money to where you can comfortably afford a note like that so then it's like okay cool well i know if i need to make enough money to be able to afford that thing what type of jobs or what type of business or what type of skill set can i do to be able to get there and be able to afford that so like you know you may need to be able to comfortably make about 50 60k a month to be able to afford that comfortably now from there you're just starting to understand okay cool what type of things can allow me to make 50 60k a month in income once you understand that then that's what you can reverse engineer of how do you get that in terms of the actions so all right hey i need to make 50 60k a month all right well what type of jobs pay that you know well there's probably not many jobs you can pay that unless you go to like maybe i don't know maybe a doctor for example that can go and do that so okay hey maybe a doctor doesn't afford a lamborghini or the type of money i need for a lamborghini what type of entrepreneur businesses i could start that allow me to make 50 60k a month and you know also too the other thing is how much money how much time you want to work so maybe i want only work like five six hours a day what type of businesses can i start and do that five six hours a day i can make 50 60k a month versus having to work you know 20 hours a day in the heat like for construction for example where i got my start was actually landscaping i used to get paid ten dollars an hour as a landscaper before i found facebook ads and started doing facebook ads online for people so another thing you also have to look at is how fast you want to achieve it right so like maybe you only want to work a couple hours a day on this business so cool i can go do real estate for example but real estate like can take a substantially long period of time between getting your first down payment buying a couple houses and stuff like it may take you 10 15 20 years before you're making 50 60k a month on autopilot just depending on who you are and stuff so speed of which you can have success in that business model and make the income that you want to make is also going to you know basically kind of control what types of business models i'm going to do as well that's why i chose facebook ads i knew that i could scale brands pretty fast if i have the right skill set with facebook ads and stuff and i've seen hundreds of people do it not just me like hundreds of people have scaled branch really fast with facebook ads and start making the type of money that i want to make so now that you know the thing that you want to do and oh well nick how do i find the thing i want to do well you kind of know your search criteria now this is where you just honestly leverage things like youtube for example uh youtube's a great place just to search and consume a ton of free content from a lot of different experts and stuff like that outside of youtube you also have just like networking groups and stuff but to be fair for me it was just always youtube that's just where i got the most valuable from information from in terms of like understanding different ways to make money online and like all of those good things right there so i would just technically just leverage youtube right there once you understand okay hey this is the thing i want to do now this is the thing that can make me i don't know 100k a month for example 50k a month 10k a month whatever your objective is then okay cool what are my daily habits practice review learn now what do i need to specifically learn to start making 100k a month for example with facebook ads what do i need to start doing on a day-to-day basis to be able to practice facebook ads that might be like writing headlines that might be creating creatives setting up a campaign and stuff like that then just going review the things i did and understanding what went right what went wrong and what can i improve from there and just start doing that on a day-to-day basis and you'll start to advance you don't necessarily need to spend eight hours ten hours a day doing this but just starting off in the beginning spending two three hours a day executing on these things and then being able to start to see the compound interest basically start to take an effect which compound interest all that is just simply when you do a thing every single day you don't immediately see the result but over a 30-day window you see a significant difference so like i'm a big fan of increasing facebook ad spend by 20 a day so if i go from a hundred dollars a day on day one 20 a day like sucks for the first couple of days it seems very slow very like uh can please go faster but if you look at on a 30-day window it's like 20 something thousand dollars a day in ad spend by just simply increasing it by 20 a day now the last thing is your rate of which you learn and how to cut down your time to success by leveraging your learning resources what a lot of people don't understand is that books are amazing to learn like you get a ton of amazing information from a book the reason why people are not successful with just reading books is because they don't apply things you only retain 10 10 to 30 of things when you read a book one time so if you want to like fully retain all the information you have to read it five to ten times and then actually be cognizant about mastering everything taught in that book over and over and over and that's how you can literally go buy a 20 30 book and it'd be life-changing when you actually apply things but the reality is is that people don't do that they buy a 20 30 book they read it once they feel good they cross the book off their yearly book thing but then they actually don't take any action at all they just literally sit there and all right what's the next book i can read and they don't apply anything from the book they just read one of the books that actually made a huge impact in my life is breakthrough advertising the only book i recommend for copywriting and marketing if you want to become a better facebook advertiser and stuff and i read that book kid you not about 15 times over the course of two years and i focused mastering every single lesson writing dozens of ads for everything i've learned in that book then i went ahead and started using that to improve my facebook ads because again i set out for mastering on facebook ads and then when i set up for mastering some of the skill sets that require to be successful with facebook ads guess what i made more money i made my clients more money i helped thousands of people on my youtube channel make more money by breaking down all those lessons all my videos and everything then i went ahead and i created a coaching group where i actually coach and actively mentor people on a maximum basis on how to apply those same lessons helping them cut down the time it takes for them to do it versus having to read a book you know a couple times over the course of two years now i'm not saying you necessarily have to read a book or anything like that i'm just simply saying that like a lot of people overly like you know think books suck and that they have to pay for a mentor right away and that's completely false what i like to look at it is that there's different mechanisms to learn and get better at a skill set like when i was first learning boxing i was just simply watching free content on youtube and then going to apply it myself at the gym at the you know the commercial gym it wasn't even anything like a proper boxing gym but then at that time or at that time i was making a lot of mistakes i just didn't know but i was still learning a lot by just watching content online then i went to a boxing gym and started working with a boxing coach in boxing classes and stuff and that increased the rate of which i was learning then i wanted to even go faster and faster was working one-on-one with a coach once i started working one-on-one with a coach for boxing i was cutting down my time to learn the skill set significantly so you have to look at like this your investment into learning the skill set has different levels of speed of which you actually go ahead and be successful at that thing so like for example i could just read books on advertising and it'll take me let's just say five years to be successful at facebook ads or i could go hire someone right out the gate that's already successful that's already in the position i want to be in that's the key thing that's where a lot of people up at with hiring mentors they hire mentors that never did the thing and it's not successful because of the thing they just oh hey they talk about making 10k a month but they don't actually make 10k a month so you hire a mentor that's already been there and done that and that will show you what you need to do to be successful with that thing and that cuts down your time significantly in terms of learning so there's books there's courses there's group mentorships and there's private mentorships or like a one-on-one mentorship each level you're gonna be paying different levels to which you know like to for the cost of right like you can go buy a 20 book versus me going by an hour of a time with someone who does seven figures a year like that's gonna cost like a thousand dollars at least for that right there so you have to think about it yes they have different rates for each one but each one has a different speed of which you'll learn right like i don't want to go read a book for you know let's just say eight to ten hours straight to learn this one specific problem i may have in my business whereas i just hop on a call pay someone a thousand dollars boom i hop on a call with that person and then like i learned exactly what i need to do in 10 minutes so i cut down my time significantly of what it takes for me to achieve that thing but my investment also goes up so you either have a lot of time which just means like hey you don't have a lot of money but you have a lot of time then you just leverage a fuckload of free content on faith on youtube and like you know books and stuff or you have a lot of money but little time then you pay mentors and stuff like that so like for me personally i mentor over 70 something people in my marketing group where i specifically show people how to become a better marketer to scale their facebook ads faster because i'm showing them with 10 years of experience of scaling brands and stuff whereas like maybe they don't have the money can't afford that that's why i have my free content on youtube which is like hey like this is amazing this is super valuable and i give it away all free like that because the people i get in my mentorship and the people that come into my agency and stuff these specific people they wanted me my personal opinion my personal like one-on-one with them so that's why they pay me that so that's why i'm not free to give it all away for free but yeah so that's pretty much it that's how to be successful at anything i think the only other things i didn't touch on was being intentional discipline and patience so discipline is being able to do a thing for a severely long time whether you want to do that thing or not and just do it repeatedly for a very long time with no results that's discipline you're want to lose 30 pounds in 90 days you're willing to track your macros hit the gym every day and like do cardio every day for 90 days the first 40 days you probably won't see any results like very very little results and you're not even be like i don't want to do this so being able to do something for a long time without seeing results that's where discipline comes from me now the next one is patience this also kind of goes back to the discipline side where it's just being patient and being okay that everyone has a different speed of which they achieve success for me it took 10 years took 10 years from the data side to become an entrepreneur to the day that oh shit i became a millionaire took 10 years of actively running businesses trying dozens of businesses to eventually finding my key my secret and then being able to focus all them on that business what i'm doing right now i've been all in on for the last uh i mean i ran my first facebook out in 2016 so i've been all in on that for nine years the first year was figuring the out of what i wanted to focus on then i spent nine years focusing on that thing doing exactly what i showed you in this video today now the next thing is intentional and being intentional with your actions so intentional is where like it's almost just being conscious about what you're doing on a day-to-day basis and is this the right things to do so you know if i'm being intentional with my time i'm not going to sit down and scroll on instagram reels for an hour like i'm going to try to learn something i'm going to try to you know work on a new ad or something like that when i'm working on that new ad i'm going to be intentional about doing the right things within that ad to create a good ad i'm not just going to throw up anything random and that's what a lot of people make a mistake at with facebook ads that they just throw up random that they think of and they're not intentional with the research understanding their customer and then taking action from there so you also need to apply those three what i call personality traits to it and if you take everything in this video plus those customer personality traits i guarantee you will be successful at anything in life whether it's health wealth or love and whatever outcome you want and whatever skill set you want to master and those have been the biggest things that's helped me along my journey i hope it helps you if you enjoyed this video hit the like button
