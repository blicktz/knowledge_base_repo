It's actually quite interesting to come back 10 years later because last time I came I was literally broke had nothing to my name and then now being able to come back and like all right you know staying at the five-star hotel and we're able to reposition this product now instead of stressing anxiety to a fun girl sign activity and we were able to scale from 150k a month to capping out at 1.8 million dollars in revenue. In the beginning when you have no experience you don't know what good marketing looks like you don't know what good creatives look like that's where quantity is going to be your friend so we were getting the bigger creators bigger names to go and create content for us with messaging we already knew work so it wasn't really a risk anymore. A new persona which was college girls college girls do like these girls nights and then as far as sophistication was pretty low just because no one else was really advertising girls nights honestly doing nothing for 72 hours is what solves 90% of the case that's just letting it run for another 72 hours after it starts tanking just it almost always corrects itself.

back and like all right you know staying at the five-star hotel being able to uber black everywhere eat at all the restaurants you wanted it's just like it's kind of interesting because at that time

very much my pleasure hope you enjoy it I'll buy you a drink after this Nick texted me he's like yo you do cigars I'm like nope but it looks like a vibe all right may have to change that yeah I know right but dude let's let's talk Facebook right I want to know what what do you see different from the six-figure advertisers seven-figure advertisers and the eight-figure advertisers what what are the main key differences you see I think for a six-figure advertiser you know and I say six figures let's just be very clear here is this in terms of spending six figures a month or just you're doing six figures a month in revenue I would say ad spend ad spend so you're spending a hundred thousand dollars versus a million dollars a month versus ten million dollars a month so specifically from 100k a month 100k a month you know you can have like one or two good winning ads you're probably advertising one product and that's about it you know I'd say a lot of drop shippers can easily get there anyone in ecom can easily get there spend about 100k a month realistically that's three thousand dollars a day in ad spend yeah nothing too crazy from there now going to seven figures a month and ad spend this is something that's been about 100k a month realistically that's three thousand dollars a day in ad spend yeah nothing too crazy from there now going to seven figures a month and ad spend this is something that I'll typically see is that from the creative side you have multiple different winning creatives you're you know every week testing new creatives you're testing new landing pages as well so you're not just doing creatives you're doing landing pages typically between six to seven figures I see a lot more people start venturing into landing pages this be like advertorials listicles pre-sale pages right there and the other thing I'll typically see with seven figures a month and ad spend is that the type of creatives they're investing into you're not really going and paying a creator 100 200 for a video right back when working with icon Amsterdam back in 2021 part of helping them scale from 300k a month to 2 million dollars a month in revenue was that the creators they worked with were creators that no no one else was willing to pay just simply due to the fact of like oh shit hey that's a thousand dollars for a creator create one video for me but these types of creators we were working with no one was willing to work with them because of how expensive they were so we were getting the bigger creators bigger names to go and create content for us with messaging we already knew worked so it wasn't really a risk anymore we already knew the messaging worked let's throw a thousand dollars for a creator that substantially has more social influence to just go recreate the same video we already know works but now with a high-end creator that everyone knows and loves and even though they're not putting the ad on their particular page people are still seeing them in our ads and people who are in that particular niche they know already know and love that particular person that's good so that's a big thing with like the seven figure advertisers um so you said creative output correct right um offer and landing page output correct and then the type of influencers and ugc creators that they're actually using as ads yeah okay those are big yeah and how important is to create a system for those things this is where i see a lot of people i would say more six figure advertisers have a solid system in place but this will be typically people who are in that particular actually go way further back like people that are spending maybe 500 a day maybe even a thousand dollars a day this is where they'll constantly go in that like up and down where like they'll test a few creatives find a winning creative then fall flat after like two or three weeks when that creative fatigues so then they'll keep going on that wave and eventually today realize oh hey i just need to be consistent with new creatives every week and that system right there will allow you to consistently output new creatives so we can test every week typically what i would say advertisers are spending anywhere between six figures to seven figures a month they're probably roughly testing anywhere between 20 to 40 unique creatives every single week nice inside of the account is it the amount of creatives that's important or is it quality what would you say is more important quantity or quality quality by far okay and there will be a lot of people that debate that i think as you get more as you have more ad spin and as you have more experience and as you develop a good eye for creative that's where quality like is where you need to go in the beginning when you have no experience you don't know what good marketing looks like you don't know what good creatives look like that's where quantity is going to be your friend so typically when i get like students and stuff like that and i start coaching people i will go hard with them on quantity to develop their skill sets then i'm like okay now let's actually pull back on the quantity and put more more intentional and quality but in the beginning if you put too much intention on quality it's just gonna be paralysis analysis and you'll spend months trying to build one creative yeah now how does someone build that eye for quality what is because say you know people are now they have a winning creative right they've tested 30 creatives they found that one two or three creatives that are you know this is this has a good cpa how do they then understand okay this is the angle i have to go after or this is the style i have to go after how do they create that eye for quality based on looking at these big pool of creatives what's the process look like for that so in the beginning stages you don't really know like yeah you don't really have an eye for it so you just kind of know all right hey this ugc video worked for me or this testimonial worked for me let me go create thousands more testimonial videos or thousands more of unboxing videos and they're like oh no this is it none of it worked for me none of it worked for me none of it worked for me and it's like why and it's like that's because you got to dig deeper into the actual like psychology of the ad itself every ad starts off by showcasing a desire which is like what people want and then from there introducing the mechanism your product which helps them achieve that particular desire right there in the marketplace so once you start to understand the marketing fundamentals through the quantity and then you start to see that ad ad for that brand i see them showing the desire introducing the mechanism and then like providing some other questions and objections and stuff like that then you start can see all these different patterns across social media through some of the top performing just even like organic posts and stuff like that so once you start to understand that and you start to actually understand the key building blocks of creatives that's where i start to see quality start to shoot up a lot that goes in that creative right there now this is where you start emphasizing on the quality aspect which for me quality is actually coming from a hypothesis based off your market research so if i go do research and i see that 90 percent of people are buying this product due to its teeth whitening and then i see this other 10 percent market of people that are buying it for teeth sensitivity and then i see that's a large enough market right there by running some creative specifically calling out teeth sensitivity and then introducing our product as a mechanism to solve it right there so like that right there is a good hypothesis versus hey i saw that brand do a photo ad i'm gonna test a photo ad yeah like what that's broad that's too broad gotcha so how often in the and we see this all the time people talk about okay you have to go out after the right angles right it's like like you you said the the the example of the teeth whining right there's so many ways to advertise it and and you see a lot of health products today you can use it for this or for this where we can target it towards this type of demographic or that time that demographic how often are you testing different angles versus going all in at one angle at what point you just say okay like this is this is how our brand is going to be known and we're kind of like going this way versus like okay let me try different ways of advertising this product that's a really good question so for me i like to look at it as like an angle it's just different ways to say the same thing right so for me the thing i have to say to convert you is going to be built upon basically desire persona market awareness mark sophistication that's going to create my messaging right there then angles it's just different ways to say that same messaging uh three ways to run facebook ads versus how to run facebook ads versus unique facebook ads strategy to scale all pretty much the same thing but just different ways to say the same thing right and then we can replicate that across ugc whether it's testimonials unboxings um you know like demos stuff like that so for me what i'll do is it kind of depends where we're at with a product where like they're testing tons of different angles around a desire and like messaging they've already put together and they're just like they're capped at a certain level of revenue so for us to go and just test more of the same thing would just be pointless it'd be a waste of time waste of money so for us to go create that big jump that we want we need to go and discover new messaging so we did this with one particular brand where they were marketing a paint by numbers thing and they were stuck at 150k a month and they were testing stress and anxiety for six months straight took a look at all their creatives their creatives look good so i was like i knew if we just keep putting pressure on stress and anxiety it just wouldn't make sense because they were stuck at that level for so many months so for us what we did is we went discover new messaging which actually came out to a whole new desire which was the fun of paint by numbers cool a new persona which was college girls so um college girls do like these girls nights and then uh as far as sophistication was pretty low just because no one else was really advertising the girls night so we're kind of going up like a stage one right there right so we found this new messaging of having fun for girls i love that and we're able to reposition this product now instead of stressing anxiety to a fun girls night activity and we were able to scale from 150k a month to capping out at 1.8 million dollars in revenue oh my gosh that's wild and that was all just because we had to shift our focus now what a lot of things that's interesting about this is that that client was doing everything right they had the right facebook ad account structure they had the right creative testing approach they were doing everything correctly they're testing 10 50 new creatives a week the only thing they weren't doing correctly was that they kept drilling in the same messaging that they've already tested every angle around and it wasn't producing any net new winning ads so now it wasn't the action that was incorrect it was the thought process around the action we had to turn around and go re-approach a different persona wow that's that's unique yeah did you did you see like a bunch of just like college girls buying the product then pretty much because you were like that was your persona yeah were you worried about the fact that college girls may not have the money to buy a product like that i mean possibly yeah but like these girls like this product itself is only like 30 40 bucks and girls were already spending that like group of girls on like bottles of wine and stuff for the girls night so how do you know your persona is not too small that's a good question i think for me what i like to do is just go on youtube type in girls night go on tiktok see how many views it has yeah yeah if it's massive enough then you're like okay this is this is big enough for us to go after yeah now if i go search like left-handed brain surgeon uh like medical device there might be a few videos of like two three views yeah it's like yeah no one's searching for that um another really cool tool is google trends yeah it's also really cool i just did this for uh teeth whitening versus teeth sensitivity okay versus enamel erosion versus i forgot what the other one was and like teeth sensitivity and um um teeth whitening had extremely high searches whereas like enamel erosion at like nothing interesting how would you say someone can advertise using what we just talked about a product and i'll give an example let's say one of the most saturated dropstream products in history the apps app stimulator right i'm sure it's going to come back and someone's going to do a million dollars a month with that thing right it just happens products come and go all the time what's a possible different angle or persona that they can use for that product and it's the ab simulator stimulator it's like one of those you know those things you put on your abs and then just like shakes it and then it gives you abs without going to the gym okay so really good question so for me first thing i would look at is what's called an unaware market unaware market these are the people that this is your largest possible market you can go after this is people that do not have a currently have a desire they don't want anything right now they don't have a problem so that means they're not struggling with anything right now and they have no clue about your product and they can care less about your so that is the best best like the unaware market is the best way to go for a saturated product got it because you're you're targeting everyone for a saturated product got it so an unaware market there's two key ways to open up an unaware market one is what a big win so this is why we see so many gurus in the facebook ads niche promote bought a lamborghini bought a rolex we saw dan lock did this really well years ago i saw tai lopez did that really well with us here in my garage a big win lamborghini you got my attention now because that's a universally accepted win that people will recognize that are young and you know somewhat i'm not even say entrepreneurs but just young and want the money right so there's unaware market and then there's the big win and then a hidden fear hidden fear is going to be more like everyone has a universally accepted hidden fear of losing money everyone has a universally accepted hidden fear of like death and disease and stuff like that so the first thing i want to do is open up an unaware market is tell a story starting off of one of those two things right there and this is where i also have to kind of look at okay like ab simulator for example one i wouldn't want to go after anyone that's in the gym niche already because anyone with like a little bit of gym knowledge would just look at that and laugh at that yeah so the first thing i want to kind of look at okay people maybe who sit at a desk all day or maybe like older people just because like i don't know like they fall for a lot of things and also too they're probably not in the gym right right um so that and then the next thing i'd start looking at is what type of story can i tell around either a hidden fear or a big win right there so maybe for example if we're going after people that are sitting at a desk all day maybe they're gamers twitch streamers maybe they don't have the best health advice or you know health practices currently right now in their life and we tell some type of story about like getting their dream girl or something like that and then going into um you know from on uh basically where they're at now to getting that dream girl all of all this was because you know they were overweight and it's preventing them from attracting the girls they want but you know they didn't have the time every day to work out and they didn't have the best lifestyle and then going into how this ab stimulator helped them change it shed the weight while they played call of duty all day at their desk and now they have the dream girl they want etc right i love that what do you say like as a ugc creator to get like one of the big streamers to record something like that yeah okay i mean to be honest something right there is i would use one of the little ai ugc creators first um i would test with that first just to validate that particular hypothesis and then i would just do some simple like little like probably pictures and some of them i would generate with chat gpt and some of them i would just kind of like um get a creator to take and then just have a ai ugc person just basically do a commentary over that slideshow we've seen a lot of these on instagram i'm not sure if you've ever seen them before hilarious where it's like um i used to date a saudi arabian billionaire here's all the weird things uh he made me do everything those convert they convert but they're not ftc compliant okay so if you do decide to run those you are putting yourself getting sued by the ftc interesting but facebook allows people around those yeah yeah we uh we did test them at one point that's hilarious so but yeah we quickly turned them off i was just curious so we did we ran one for a very short period of time they do convert but like i said you do put yourself at a risk of getting sued by the ftc because okay um it's not necessarily this uh the story it's the people that are leveraging fake authority so we we will typically see the ones that convert the best are gonna be the ones that say like let's start off with hey my dad was the highest paid brain surgeon in the usa here's like everything he made me do every day or like hey um you know my step mom was the highest paid gynecologist it's when you leverage authority like that that's where it uh puts you into the position of getting sued by the ftc that's crazy wow dude i have to show i have to pull something up real quick because this reminds me of uh something i saw on instagram i was scrolling one day instagram one of the main ways i love to do research on what i should be doing inside my e-commerce businesses and like in social media overall is i just scroll on instagram sometimes the best and you're like this got 2 million views this got 10 million views and you're like why right so i wanted to show you something because when i saw this i was shocked that people are actually going crazy viral using ai like all ai and it's so fake but at the same time like it gets people because it looks so real at the same time and and some of them are really messed up but let me show you this i'm gonna try to pull pull it up on the screen as well but um here take a look at this so this is like uh they put like a grandma let me try to oh my god yeah it's crazy so they get let me show you some viral videos that they had look at this oh 363 000 views ready and i'm not asking for money other than maybe a comment authorities told me to shut down my small church because i can't afford the rent at the moment then my wife and i decided to make pieces plushies to try and keep our church crazy 47 000 likes so those are good but yes those are the types of ads right there that you can get sued for yeah and someone we all know there was an organic drop who ripped that product and went crazy with it yeah um but no i love that i love that a lot that is a great example right there of like a hidden fear right there you know it's it's it's telling that emotional story right there because you were completely unaware at first when you saw that but then when you saw that you see this story of like someone basically going like you know possibly going broke right there and like that's something everyone can universally just like hey like i i feel you i feel your pain right now i don't know what you're exactly you're going through but i just know that's got to be bad yeah and then going to the solution uh the unaware problem and then solution hey just buy this for me like that's yeah it's clever crazy it's crazy how uh this guy milked that product people are doing this all the time they're they're using i mean you know we have to tell people unethical things too you know what i mean because it's out there like i'm saying we would do it but you know you just need to be aware of it because you know i had some people come to me and like as one particular student come to me just with like all of these fake doctors and their ads and stuff like that and like literally even saying like hey i was a i was a brain surgeon for the last five years here's the things i recommend it's like the problem is is that there's no one educating on these people of like hey yeah like you may convert with that don't get me wrong but if you get a lawsuit with the ftc like they can literally sue you for every dollar you've had you've made in the last five years not including profit your actual shopify revenue not profit on that shopify yeah you gotta be careful so it's uh yeah let's talk about ai a little bit right let's do it so ai is it a whole hype or is it actually working now and if so how how are you implementing ai works really well okay so my favorite thing to do with ai it's first off with ai like there's a lot of noise in this space yeah um let's clear out the noise what what is noise first one if you go on like money twitter for example or marketing twitter or whatever you call it there's someone every day tweeting i just did this with ai and and this just was a game changer in ai then the next day this is a game changing ai thing like every day there's something new and i know i have like a team member on my team who's very notorious for this where he'll go and he'll like bookmark all that and then go sit down and read through that and then he'll just like brain brain fuck him basically like he's just like i don't know what to do now like analysis paralysis i literally hate twitter for that reason yes so what i love with ai is number one you can't force ai into everything you do like i was talking to a team member the other day they spent an hour trying to like automate a two minute task with ai and i was just like bro task took you two minutes why are you so focused on ai like just do that do yourself but focus on the task that takes you two or three hours and then where can you leverage ai to speed that process okay so for me for example um my current ai process right now is i still love doing manual research uh to understand my market and the reason why is that is because one i think research is just one of the most like highest paid actions you could possibly do as a business owner whether it's you know you writing ads whether it's you uh doing the research to find new products or just doing more research for like upsells and landing pages and stuff like that like just manual research is the highest paid action you could possibly do now what i like to do is take that research so let's say i'm looking at teeth whitening for example right now and i go spend a bunch of time understanding the teeth whitening market the different types of people in the teeth whitening market what they want what they desire like all of those things putting that in a doc right there and then also creating a doc um for like my product and here's everything about my product all the features how it works the instructions of how to use it all of those good things and then i'll take both of those docs and upload that to chat gpt okay and then i'll tell chat gpt hey you're only allowed to use these two docs moving forward now i just built myself a copywriter for my business right that can write all my ads and that way where a lot of people make the mistake is they go to chat gpt and say hey like you know write me an ad whereas now i'm giving chat gpt the only two information it needs and then now i can be like hey um chat gpt as direct response copywriter i like to use dan kennedy he's just very good and chat gpt knows this work pretty well um write me 10 headlines for my product and then it'll only use that research and only use your product doc that you gave it and it'll write pretty damn good headlines and then from there i'll pick like all right hey this headline i really like this headline then i'll tell chat gpt as a instagram influencer with over a million followers please write me um like a instagram real script with this and it'll push out some really good um ad creative just from that right there like that'll 10 extra game that's incredible have you ever tried taking your top ads the transcription of it and then asking chat gpt to create variations yeah yeah yeah so um i'll do that that's another really good one uh usually what i'll like to do is i'll pull like okay here's the main desire from that things like maybe it's around teeth sensitivity um inside of teeth sensitivity we're targeting this person and like talking about these key things in that winning script now go create me 10 completely unique scripts around that um another thing i like to do is uh i'll basically just go to chat gpt and say hey i want you to exaggerate this um i don't know if you've ever seen those videos on instagram reels where it's like uh chat gpt give me a picture of a marketer then it's like a picture of a marketer then be like chat gpt he's not marketing hard enough make him market harder and it's like three screens now on his desk and then like you just keep going up to the point where it's like he's not marketing enough steel he needs to know the whole world he does marketing and it's like i feel like exaggerated things do well up for ads well it's it's the thing with ads is uh you know mr b uh said this the reason why he has so much success is because everything he creates things people's never seen before right the best ads are the ad angles no one's ever seen before or the visuals no one ever seen before you got to do something different to get them to stop scrolling that's marketing yeah and that's the problem with a lot of people when they start stealing ads from other people oh hey like you know my buddy was running this product i just stole all of his creatives and it's not working for me it's like well yeah no shit he's he's already running it you're just ripping the same creatives and showing the same thing the same people of course they're going to go with the other person so you always get such an important lesson i think that like if someone does an equal job to other people that are already doing it you're you're not going to get the results you want because you are doing the same thing as them yeah right and and i see this also in the drop shipping game a lot right i've been the game of e-commerce and drop shipping for the last seven years right in the game of drop shipping ripping is like notorious and what we're starting to realize right now and really over the last few years and throughout the stores are actually successful is that we did something different and better than what people were doing already with that product whether it's better creatives or a better landing page and offer it's got to be one of the two yeah and i think the um the better creatives is probably gonna be the easiest one right because like you could have the same offer right and i think the problem with the better offer is that people just think okay how do i make it cheaper and it's like you're just gonna race to the bottom if you just keep going how to make a better offer now if you make a better offer that offers more value there you go even at a higher price point like people are willing to pay more with you if you have more value in terms of what you give them that works really well for an offer but i think from creatives there's three key things you can do to um ethically steal your competitors ads um is take their ads and do one of these three things number one simply just going ahead and taking exactly what they have now but film in a higher quality setup so like i said with icon amsterdam when we were scaling them back in 2021 it was literally the same creatives as everyone else was running but we worked with higher paid creators to make higher levels of production which in consumers eyes made us look a lot more trustworthy we weren't recreating the wheel we weren't recreating the messaging we were just showing higher levels of messaging at what point do you do that like do you do that for the test that was right entry level wow yeah and that was because that's how we were differentiating ourselves from everyone else so you go build higher level creatives with the actual same amount of like same messaging and everything but just um higher amounts of like money you invest so it's a little bit more risky yeah i think for like entry level drop shippers um but for people that are more advanced it's an easy risk that's they're willing to take for those people who have like you know they don't have too much money to invest into like crazy different video shoots or whatnot let's what's like your message for them where they can't go and do like a huge video shoot or whatever right like to to spend 10k or 5k on them so in this situation this case right here this is where you want to go and look at different personas so like for example um i'll use like built clothing as an example real quick uh they first started off with i would say just like people everyday like workers um you know and they were kind of focusing more on like the new business casual that is their messaging but then now they're starting to promote a lot more of like people going golf in their pants and it's like why is because so many people started going after the market of like of you know everyday casual and everyone started spouting up the same type of pants that it made it super competitive so if you can go open up a whole new market of people that no one's advertised to before you can still have very low level creatives and still crush it that's the same thing when a girls night ad that i was talking about a couple minutes ago because no one else was advertising to girls night and you know maybe had a few like random products here and there but nothing like really successful so we were able to call out a whole new market of people that no one was running ads to had very low level creatives pushing out to this market i think our first batch of creatives we spent 200 on total to get those filmed and it was just a couple girls using our product sipping on wine nice that was it and immediately helped scale the account because no one else was advertising it so during our research it's how do we go find the sub niches within a niche so another great example is gym shark they did this because you know they had like under armor reebok nike at the time but no one was on that sub market of just people going to the gym then gym shark came around then all these other brands sprouted and if you look at the top people in those markets now it's gym shark but then you have these sub markets of people like alphalete young la um anaka power all of these are calling out sub people within the gym niche so this is where um it's called stage five market sophistication and it's just simply take an already existing desire weight loss and go after a sub market weight loss for dads weight loss for um you know the college athletes or athletes who are trying to make it for the college team uh weight loss for postpartum moms you go after sub groups of people and in that way it creates a blue market if you read uh i think it's blue ocean strategy yeah you always want to be creating blue blue ocean markets within your ads and stuff even if it's a smaller market you get a smaller market but you get the whole market or you go after a big market where you get nothing and that's where a lot of people make a mistake at so that's that's way number two to replicate your competitors ads they're all going after dads you're going to go after um maybe new dads for example or like a sub niche of that southern dads city dads and then that just creates that new market for you that's so big i i love this because this is things that nobody talks about coming back to your offers but to the offers for a second so here's a hack that big companies use that people don't even know about but it works every single time like when i bought you that gift so there's two different options right either just the cologne okay or you can get the cologne set for just a little bit more and then in my head i was like oh yeah that's a no-brainer like it was it was it wasn't even that much more for the cologne set so we tested this on our website we actually offered two different items and the second item was way more valuable right it's like okay you get the burger fries and a soda for 12 or you just get the burger for 10. 12 bucks for a burger fries and soda versus 10.

of course i'm gonna go for this hole but you probably wouldn't have bought the burger fries and soda if it was there alone right so it's like okay how can you make like two different options because people love options especially if one overweighs the other one by far that easily helped us increase our conversion rate in one of our e-commerce businesses that was break even boom we put that in jing jing jing jing jing right because we we gave them another option with a ton of free gifts and we had like a free we had gifts that were like free like we had a ebook on on health on this and that right and and chachi bt made it for us so we made like a really nice ebook cover right from chachi bt make me an ebook cover on uh how to get a six pack in the next 90 days or something you know and then and then you put that as a free gift if you if you buy the second option for just a little bit more and people are like oh that's a no-brainer and you offer them this free gift and that free gift and and that's how you can easily increase your offers and and big companies are doing this all the time so i i realized that when we study big companies and what you were saying about gymshark and all these companies that you dissect at a bigger level you look at them and you're like wow like they're doing this and this and this for many of these companies we can actually implement it in our day-to-day business right so i i realize and and both as marketers we know this how important it is to analyze what are the big companies doing what are their competitors doing what can we learn from them what can we what can we learn not to do right um how often are you kind of like just doing market research in a whole or competitor research or are you just like focus on okay how do i scale this brand how how often are you taking a step back and looking at everything in a whole i think research for me is a day-to-day thing and then for me it's setting that objective for that research so some research sessions it may look like hey i need to go analyze a full market other research sessions might just be like hey i need to go figure out a aov booster for this brand let me go just look at a few variety of brands just kind of see what kind of common aov boosters people are doing now and then seeing what i can toss in for like a couple ideas i can get from my brand cool it may even be like a whole research session around like like i said we're working on this product right now where it's like teeth sensitivity teeth whitening so like i just did a whole research session for me to better understand enamel erosion so market research itself it's gonna be different every day but as long as you have an objective going into it that's what makes it a win or a loss you know if you set the goal of hey i want to go review 10 advertorials today through research kind of see like what people are doing and stuff like that and then you end up just scrolling on tiktok the old time like that's a loss for me oh it happens all the time yeah i like that you like set yourself a goal from the research don't don't just do mindless research is what you're saying i love that but i want to go into landing pages for just a second once someone starts split testing or trying different landing pages like you said um and we can go into like what type of landing pages you've seen working at what point someone said someone do that and when does it become a distraction that's a good question so for me like when i'm scaling facebook ads my like kind of outtake on scaling is just rapid breaking down of bottlenecks in your business as you start spending more you'll hit that plateau and some people will break past that plateau and some people just sit at it for months and then either fall back down usually what happens so for me it's like as soon as we hit that plateau i want to immediately see what's the bottleneck here fix that bottleneck and then scale so like say for example if we're going to landing page testing we have two particular clients right now where they have phenomenal creatives they're getting 70 cent 80 cent clicks on their creatives and like their creatives um usually if you're getting a really good cost per click on your creatives and a terrible conversion rate my first question is okay is our creative speaking to the right audience you know if you're trying to sell like weight loss products and then your ad creatives is showing um you know some type of person with no clothes on it's like yeah no wonder why you're getting so cheap clicks but if we're like specifically communicating our messaging correctly in the ad and then we're driving traffic to a landing page and it's like hey like we're getting 70 cent 80 cent clicks which to be fair like the average like really good cost per click on facebook is a dollar yeah you get a dollar cost per click on facebook that's solid right there is solid yeah so for me it's like all right our creatives are good and i can see that by cost per click now let's go look at the landing page itself and it's like all right landing page right now like i think the shopify like global average like taking every single shopify store and just taking the collective average i think it's two percent um so for me it's like okay like maybe we're at like a 1.5 right now and or maybe we're at four percent maybe we're at a really high shopify conversion rate but we're still not profitable then it's like okay hey well we're testing a ton of creatives we've never tested any landing pages yes we have a good conversion rate but what if we just put a little intention and focus on testing a few landing pages like that would be a lot more logical than testing a hundred more creatives when nothing is improving things wow um and then for me i kind of like to jump around between two main landing page types which is advertorials and listicles there is some other landing page types like pre-sell pages which for me pre-sell page is just like all of them are pre-sell pages but for me it's just more of like a longer form sales page and then you have uh vsls which vsls are also really cool i really like vsls um but for most people advertorials and listicles those can be the main two that we initially go to and they're also the quickest um and easiest to kind of set up and launch whereas like a vsl you have to go get filmed and all that stuff like that what converts the best have you seen you know it depends um typically more like products that are a lot more technical um like for your ab stimulator for example like that would probably be more of like an advertorial but let's just say if i was selling like shoes for example simple i would go for like a listicle because it's more of not necessarily like they need to understand the mechanism better it's just more like let's give them a little bit more information so like for listicles for example um it might be like three reasons why x product or three reasons why people love x product like as simple as that and it's just like reason number one reason two reason number three where just like all like the three main buying benefits of our product then they click there and then they go to the the product page okay yeah yeah you can you can use like funnelish for example and you can like build everything out on that page okay but honestly i just prefer sending people to your shopify page yeah um and then i'll just duplicate that ad in that campaign and just change the url you can use some fancy like split testing software like convert.com what i often find is with like software like that is that it's so complicated to like get a new landing page test up that it de-incentivizes me from actually taking that particular action so i like to just look at speed yeah um so as fast as possible for me to go and get something set up and launch that's all i care about right there so that's a new page and launch do you do you find that like when you do these advertorials and stuff it like kind of distracts you from like okay scaling the brand or are you like okay this is needed before we can scale well so for me it's like i'm only going to start testing that if we hit a plateau got it so it's like you're scaling everything's good you're just going to keep pushing the budget keep pushing everything works right well i change it yeah yeah if everything works why am i going to go do these unnecessary things i'm just going to go keep pushing budget up and call it a day yeah make my life easy you don't ever say like okay it could be better because that could be it's yes yeah to be fair but let's address that once we hit that plateau right because reality is it's like always be better yeah yeah i mean that'll just drive people crazy yeah i'm going to push budget as hard as possible until we hit that plateau now let's address that plateau with what we need to do yeah and that might be new creatives that might be a new landing page or the last one so i look at cpc cvr and then aov the last one will be aov so let's say we tested a bunch of landing pages we test a bunch of creatives and we just cannot beat creatives or landing pages what pressure can we put on the aov and then it's like and that's where i see a lot of people like just completely just not focus on you know that it's the biggest thing by the way highest person the person with the highest margin always wins yep always wins i actually gave a whole keynote on this because we were talking about fulfillment and like the fact that if you lower your cost of goods then you have bigger margins right and then if you can get deals with the supplier to ship let's say two or three of them or include let's say you know another item in there because the shipping is cheaper at that point because it's in one package how much are you saving so all these metrics can help you really just like save money have higher margins have a higher aov because you can add more items to your store um this is this is by far something that i see so many people overlooking and i'm glad you're touching on it yeah it's uh it's and it's a easy thing too right like if you're testing hundreds of creatives and landing pages and stuff like that and spending a ton of your time like you know freaking out over like you know just these little things and creatives it's like hey just take a step back look at your full funnel like your creatives are good your landing page is good now let's go hit on that aov side and then what can we do to just increase the value right there that people are spending the amount of money people are spending with us um and obviously we can go into like little things like bundles you know exactly like what you said earlier that's a phenomenal way um i also love post-purchase upsells so good as well easy money um especially too it's cool thing about post-purchase upsells is that like if you start tweaking too much on the product page and stuff sometimes you can actually negatively impact things whereas post-purchase upsells like cool you already got their money now have your fun sell a crab out of them yeah and i think uh another thing i like to do for post-purchase upsells i like to try two of them i like to try one that's double the price of the aov so if they just spent 60 with this i want to show them 120 product and then i also want to do a down sell of half the aov good so it'd be like 120 product and a 30 product nice and i've seen that work extremely well too that's so good yeah i have one brand that we we literally are making an extra 12 per visitor on the post-purchase upsell and like that literally adding so much more profit because like if you don't have post-purchase or you know your aov is like let's say 50 adding a post-purchase you could get to 60 or 70 like that that could be some people's profit on their store right depending on your margins um what's working for us is very similar we're offering the same product but a buy one get one free of that product it's something that people want multiple of so it's like hey you just bought this product do you want the same product at the same price but two versus one i just bought that product for one of them for the same price yeah so we have a huge conversion rate on that and then we also have like a down sell on a similar product but the product works with that product so like for example let's say ab simulator they have like the butt stimulator you know what i mean i like that i like that though that's it goes a lot i think the problem a lot of people have at aov is that they're just like all right cool well they need to buy more so then it's like well i'm gonna give them my same product but two of them now when they purchase two and then it's like it goes to like in card upsell like i'm just gonna give them more of my product and then it's like post-purchase upsell it's like more of my product so it's just like just keep jamming the same product in their face over and over and over they already did the research on that product yeah and they like it obviously if it's a product that people like do not want more of like like how many of the same exact pair of shoe are you gonna get you know what i mean like if you're selling let's say shoes and the guy already bought two it's like buy the same one okay if you have different colors okay i see that but it's like buy the same color again i don't know but it's like if it's a product that you know people are buying multiple of or it's like hey you just bought two t-shirts you know get another two t-shirts for the price of one t-shirts is something you know people switch out every day it would make sense so i guess it just put yourself in your customer's head is extremely important i know that you're known for and i and i love the structure how it's like one cbo okay you just keep it very clean your ad accounts are clean i think people respect that because that's literally the best way to go it's like keep it clean let the creatives do the work let the creatives do the targeting facebook's really smart right let's i want to touch on the strategy a little bit more okay what are the biggest levers that you focus on to really scale an ad account from doing a thousand dollars a day to twenty thousand dollars per day what does that look like so obviously you have the part one which is what we just talked about the bottlenecks which is your cpc cvr aov that's going to be the biggest three levers right there now obviously if we're looking at the cpc for example cost per click obviously number one just having the right ad account structure i like doing one cbo it's one cbo per product or product category so like for example if i'm running a clothing brand with um you know jackets t-shirts and pants i'll do a you know one campaign for all the t-shirts one campaign for all the uh shirts and one campaign for all the pants um and then i'll do one campaign per country okay um i always like to scale in one country first before going out to other countries um and then the last one is one campaign per like let's just say for example i have a clothing brand and then i have a um women's division and a men's division then i'll do like a women's campaign and a men's campaign okay um if it's a gender neutral product then i'm just one campaign i don't need to have separate genders in that case um next thing for me is in terms of that campaign structure cbo campaign now it's pretty much advantage everything um i think it's called an advantage sales campaign but it's not the original asc where you couldn't have more than one ad set now it's the new asc which like you can create multiple ad sets in that asc campaign so the targeting is asc pretty much everything is ac but you can pretty much make as many ad sets as you correct okay yeah and then for me just from a simplicity and like organizational perspective i like launching a new ad set every time i launch new creatives um there's some people that like to just have one ad set launch everything all the creatives in there and then like they'll create a new ad set when they hit that 50 um ad limit right there but for me i just keep it simple i go create a batch of ads and then i'll just go launch a new ad set with that batch of ads and let it run so each batch new asset correct yeah so like it's very common for me to have a campaign with like we have this one account we've been running ads for them for three years now they have like over 300 ad sets in that one campaign but we only have like i think nine or ten live currently right now yeah but that's just been over time of testing turning off testing turning off having a few winners at scale a few of them we turn off when do you turn them off i usually turn them off if on the last seven day window um they're hurting performance i'm going to turn them off and then um unless it's like a high spender high spenders i rarely turn off um and if i do want to turn them off because i have a feeling they're hurting overall performance i'll turn them off cl 72 hours go if performance gets better cool leave it off performance gets worse i'll turn it back on make it easy right there right does that drive you crazy sometimes like oh it's getting a lot of spend but it's not doing well do i turn it off do i turn it it just depends on where we're at okay so um let's say for example like just collectively performance has shifted down over the last couple days and that was a high spender but like collectively the whole account we're starting to see higher cpas then it's like i could technically turn it off right but every time i've been in that situation it just makes performance severely worse so i'd rather be at like a 10 20 percent um inefficiency versus like turning those things off and i'll see like a 90 to 80 percent inefficiency inside of the account right there especially if something is a high performer right it's like okay facebook's spending money to it for a reason and it's like okay like just be careful turning the high spenders off i always seen that too it's like okay could sometimes they have bad days you know everyone has bad days i mean ais don't usually have bad days they're just ais but like still ads randomly have bad days i've seen like sometimes the bad days like we missed a few comments that were really horrendous on our ads and like we go there and like oh shoot we hide those or like we reply to them and it's like okay the it jumps back up in sales and it's like oh shoot like it's good we call it that i've been using like an ai uh auto comment uh nice generator nice so that's been cool kind of like training it and then like within 30 seconds of a comment and go apply dude that's awesome yeah it really helps we we don't do too much with the comments most of like all of our clients we tell them they're responsible for the comments yeah but yeah every now and then we will have a thing like that where like someone leaves a bad comment on it and then like that comment will get a few likes and yeah we'll start seeing if you know deficiencies and stuff in our account um to be honest like 90 of like ad accounts that just start tanking honestly doing nothing for 72 hours is what solves 90 of the case that's just letting it run for another 72 hours after it starts tanking just it almost always corrects itself why is that i i think one is that people people think facebook is linear people think facebook is just money in money out when the reality is there's humans on the other side of that there's humans on their side of when you see a thousand clicks on your ad that's a thousand unique people that click to your website and we'll especially see that like for example we just had memorial day in the usa we just had father's day like a week or a week ago and then like almost a month ago we had mother's day and every time there's a holiday we'll typically see about two to three days before the holiday performance dip and then two to three days after the holiday performance will slowly pick back up and it's like oh well why then it's like okay well let's go analyze consumer behavior during that time people are putting money now to take their mom out for mother's day they're putting money towards mother's day gifts they're clicking on your ad but they're putting it off to the side because they rather put money to other things and then guess what after mother's day they feel broke they feel like they just spent a ton of money they hold back on that money and then slowly people start buying again so crazy so it's like some of it's just understanding like consumer behavior right in the sense of like what's the macro happening right now and during that time the best thing to do is just nothing don't touch your account just let it roll because all those impressions you're generating go smoke a cigar exactly exactly yeah i love that that's really good and i think that uh this has been really helpful for people for sure hopefully watching another side let us know in the comments below um and nick it's been a pleasure man this was really good we're gonna we're gonna go it's eat some dinner and uh look you guys are all advertisers if you stayed to the very end of this podcast by the way then like you are going to crush it whether it's you know with with your own agency or your e-commerce brand because this wasn't like beginner stuff this is high level if you understood what we talked about today and you implement it i think it'd be really really cool to to have someone in that chair that said i listened to this podcast right last thing to touch on here um let's talk about fulfillment for a second right because that's what commerce is all about what what do you see like across the board in terms of fulfillment and and challenges people are having it having with fulfillment and uh like why why is it important yeah i mean that's a good thing to talk about i mean number one like i'm gonna say this from an agency perspective because we don't really deal with fulfillment at all right so i only hear about it from clients but i'm not actually in the like weaves and helping clients with fulfillment and stuff but i i guess the biggest things from like an agency perspective like we benefit a ton when fulfillment costs are lower so like for example we have some clients with like really terrible margins on their product and it's like if they just got a better fulfillment price like that would just take their current results right now and maybe they're at a 10 margin right now their current results like literally nothing will have to change in the ad account and they'll make an extra like 10 percent of a month in profit um so fulfillment cost is huge um i think fulfillment in terms of like um with all the tariffs happening right now like we actually lost a client just recently because of tariffs because um literally where they were getting their product made and everything like that they already had very slim margins and now they were having like to literally almost a 2x increase in product costs and due to like all the tariffs or anything like that like it was just it made their business financially unfeasible to continue moving forward so they're closed right now until they find a new fulfillment center that can actually make these particular um that's actually pants they were doing well i guess we i guess commercis has got to hop in there and help them yeah that's crazy wow yeah and and i think that we should also talk about other countries right how often do you like do you have where you unlock a new country because someone is able to ship from a 3pl in china big that's huge right there i think that's all of our like biggest success stories was like all right we got a brand up to like 400 500 km off in just usa and then now let's just take those winning messaging and winning ads and go start and translate everything and then go into a whole new country and that unlocks just it's so easy because it's like you already have winning creatives translate them for that country and then boom you just unlock another 500 km off of your business wow that's crazy guys if you are an e-commerce seller and you own an e-commerce brand or you're an agency owner and you need fulfillment for your e-commerce whoa let me do that again guys if you are an e-commerce seller that is currently scaling and you need fulfillment whether it's cheaper cost of goods or you need to unlock other countries united united kingdom canada australia germany these are top countries we've seen big e-commerce sellers unlock or you need better quotes on your current manufacturing or your shipping whether using a china 3pl or a usa 3pl go to immersive.co for a free quote nick it's been a absolute pleasure for you coming on here dropping the game and i hope that you guys enjoy this podcast and uh look forward to uh having dinner with you and i appreciate it you guys thank you very much see you guys
