what is going on guys welcome back to the channel Nick Theriot here and today I have an exciting new video where we're gonna dive into how exactly I scale my Facebook ad campaigns how specifically took in one campaign from $100 a day in ad spend over $500 a day at a 3x or near 3x return in ad spend so before we hop in this video make sure you hit that subscribe button and that like button because this content spots to be extremely valuable for you if you're stuck trying to figure out how to scale campaigns maybe you scale a campaign it dies out and stuff like that this video be for you okay guys so like I said scaling a campaign can be very difficult for some I feel like some people can just scale without with ease and some people can't but I think the biggest thing with scaling is managing expectations managing emotions and to being able to stay consistent with it because it's not something that you just put on the put in the background you have to really be active inside the ad account and really work towards that's gonna be a goal as your priority to scale account there's a lot of energy that goes into that so with that being said today I want to show you guys a few tips and tricks at least some common mistakes I've noticed with you know some my consulting clients of how they're scaling their campaigns and how I keep it simple and which allows me to basically keep doing it over and over and like I said it's it's a work in progress you have to be active doing it every single day to hit those big numbers so with that being said I'm gonna show you one account real quick this is one particular account that I've showed recently in the case study video we launched this specific scaling campaign on the 1st of December or 2nd of December 2020 and we launched at $100 today first day was complete blowout you know we literally get one out to cart and then if we look at yesterday's data we spent literally $339 3.1 grow as you know thousand dollars in sales so it's since we've launched it's become very profitable and we've we've also scaled it up quite a bit so let me show you guys the lifetime on this particular ad set our particular campaign and we're literally $5,800 spent $15,000 in revenue break-even ROAS is like 1.6 1.8 this is a top of funnel so top of funnel if we can just break even that's that's the goal and we're doing well past that so how do we scale it what is the rules we follow and you know how can you do that yourself so I'll put this together this is scaling Facebook ads scaling to if we would top of funnel Facebook ads this is the old way this is probably the way that you're doing it this is the way you might be familiar with it so you set up a new campaign set the budget to $100 whether it's CBO or ABO and then you know you launch it and let's say the first day it blows up you know three extra turn on ad spend or maybe the second day and you're like whoa I'm doing amazing let's blow this up let's really scale so you increase the budget by $200 and that's like a $300 daily budget and like the next day the performance sucks you're like whoa what's going on here just wasted you know 200 bucks and then a few more days go by like okay what is going on it converted really well now it's dying out so you lower the budget and results don't work you know it doesn't help um so you just turn it off and you set up a new campaign and you let it run for a few days and you literally just repeat fellas again and then you're like what is going on Facebook ads are a scam you start crying on the internet well I guess you didn't cry on the internet because you're on this video and I'm here to help you out so um that's probably the traditional way and trust me I've been there before um that's kind of what I'm seeing my consulting clients that's what they're doing there's increasing the budget random intervals and it's chaotic the current way I'm scaling Facebook ads in 2021 and the way I recommend for you guys is you launch a new ad set or a new campaign you know whether you're on cbo campaign budget optimization or abo um depending on you um I'd use both so it just kind of depends as a whole nother video but uh let's say you don't own cbo or abo uh what you want to do is you want to launch to launch the campaign or ad set run it for three days do not touch it do not do anything um after those three days if your kpis are being hit your key performance indicators ads cards landing page views sales all that stuff is looking good all you want to do is increase the budget by 20 that is it I know that doesn't sound like a lot especially if you start off a campaign or or ad set at ten dollars a day um you know maybe a hundred dollars a day or a thousand dollars a day it's a little bit more but if you're starting off with a little bit 20 ain't much and the specific reason why that's the case is because when you set up a new ad set or set up a new campaign at a certain budget you're telling Facebook hey I want you to optimize this budget hundred dollars and Facebook is going to do whatever it can to spend that hundred dollars in the best way it can to get you the most bang for your buck so you're gonna let it run for a few days it's gonna optimize it's gonna get you some results and stuff like whoa it's crushing it and then you go and increase the budget by a thousand dollars you know blow it out of the park and like results suffer you're like what is going on why is it and that's because Facebook didn't optimize for a thousand dollars or it didn't optimize for three hundred dollars it optimized for a hundred dollars and you just going ahead and increasing the budget and blowing it out it's like if you go to the gym you go to the gym you put 150 pounds on back squat and you do a set you're like hey this is comfortable I can do this it's good and then you increase the weight you know you wouldn't go to you know you wouldn't put 245s on you know 90 pounds um on top of that 150 now you're at 240 you wouldn't do that because you do that and you're like oh my gosh it's extremely heavy I can't do this you would increase it by a little bit you probably add some tens maybe some fives and you just increase the budget by maybe 10 to 15 percent and that's the same thing with Facebook ads when you put a large budget on a particular ad set or campaign from what it was originally optimized for it's exactly like just going to the gym doing a set that was good for you and then dramatically increasing the weight and it's too difficult for you that's the same thing with Facebook so that's why we do a 20 percent rule and we do it 20 percent every day and trust me when you do it every single day you get to numbers like this and literally just yesterday you know it's working I'm gonna show you the last seven days we scaled up from a hundred dollars a day which would be about seven hundred dollars spent um all the way up to five hundred and four dollars daily and we're maintaining ROAS we're maintaining calls per purchase and having again if I look at the lifetime and yeah so it's works um now let's say if you need to spin a little bit you need to scale up a little more aggressively so what you do is you simply duplicate the campaign or duplicate the ad set at a higher budget now the key error is just because you duplicate it a higher budget doesn't mean it's necessarily going to work so you know so say if you're optimizing a hundred dollars a day that adds that that campaign whatever it might be and you're like okay it's getting a few sales let's go to a thousand dollars a day your ads your audience might not be proven enough to withstand a thousand dollars a day so you could do is what I like to do is double the budget so if I'm at a hundred dollars a day I'll duplicate that campaign at two hundred dollars a day then let that run for a few days if it's profitable I'll duplicate that campaign or ad set to four hundred dollars a day now duplicate it to eight hundred duplicate it to sixteen hundred duplicate it to thirty two hundred duplicate it to sixty four hundred and so on so I've done this for Father's Day last year where I need to really scale the campaign quickly I started duplicating the budgets and that really worked out well because what you're doing is where you're duplicating a campaign you're duplicating an ad set you're taking a proven campaign you're taking a proven ad set you're duplicating it at a double to two x budget of what original was set at and you're duplicating something that's already working really well and when you're duplicating it all you're doing is changing a budget for two times what you're currently optimized at and that's been the quickest way I've been able to scale accounts that I need to scale quickly but also to the biggest key is when you're doing this you need to make sure you have a comfortable enough budget that you could run for at least three days so like if you're running at a hundred dollars a day you don't have three extra turn on a campaign or ad set and you want to duplicate it to two hundred dollars a day you need to make sure that when you duplicate it that you can withstand three days worth of losses so I know that might sound different so it might sound confusing so you want to duplicate that hundred dollar a day ad set to two hundred dollars a day make sure you can run that ad set or that campaign for at least three days and lose every single day before you duplicate it now the next thing is making sure when you're making decisions whether to kill a campaign or kill an ad set you're doing it on a long enough time range if you're doing it day to day you're way too close you need to look at the bigger picture so in this particular campaign we were running let's look at jan december 2nd that's when we start running the campaign we spent a hundred dollars made no sales december 3rd oh look we made our first sale you know two or three sales and then we started making some more and again it's not like the greatest ROAS up look we had a day you know first few days ROAS wasn't the greatest wasn't really getting much sales and stuff like that and it was turned off for some reason that day um so you need to make sure you're running it for a few days before you just turn it off um and you need to make sure you have some longevity on the campaign to make some decisions and stuff because if you're selling if you're waiting like day to day to make certain decisions you're too close to it you're not looking at the bigger picture it's like looking at the minute chart on a stock trading chart to make the decisions on investments for year to year way too close of it you need to back out what is your ROAS look on a three-day window a seven-day window in a lifetime day window um so for this particular account we notice on a seven day and a three-day where the like for example you know um yesterday we had a 3.10 ROAS 339 spent thousand dollars in revenue last night when i went to bed we were at like a 1.2 ROAS we have a very heavy delayed attribution for this account with this particular product and due to that the day-to-day is very hard and i need to look at the three seven and lifetime to really just to figure out if i should kill an ad set or kill the campaign so biggest key piece of advice let things run longer and if you're going to let things run longer that's when you want to make sure that you're at budgets you're comfortable with so don't try to rush into these higher budgets higher budgets or more they require more stress they take more emotions out of you you have more stuff you have to learn to to manage these so stay comfortable those lower budgets don't try to rush this if you rush this you you go all the way back to ground zero and you got a research process over again of you know creating new ad set starting off a low budget scaling it up then oh wait oh scaled up too quickly now you broke it now you're going back now take your time and that's going to get you the best results take your time let things run longer than longer than you expect you know instead of starting on a day-to-day to kill the nats that are killer campaign do maybe three day if you're traditionally doing a three day do a seven day look back at your account look at some of the ads and ads that you've killed and then looking back at the delayed attribution and seeing okay wait wait wait you know those weren't profitable yesterday but now today they're profitable but i killed them why did i kill them okay because you know i was only running it for day two days before i decided to kill them or not so that's a big key right there um learn all that um now another key thing is when you're making when you're waiting a little bit longer waiting a little bit longer look at your soft stats your at the cart your landing page view your cost per landing page view your click-through rate your cpm if those are completely blown out the water in terms of like extremely high just out of the ordinary turn them off you know turn that set off turn the campaign off early but if those are good and just the raw ass really ain't there yet keep it running let it run longer and trust me guys you follow these two rules uh 2021 you're going to be very profitable in terms of how you scale ads it's a discipline it's emotion management it's not getting tied to the results and getting tied to the money um you really have to look at this from a just zero emotions logical standpoint when you're scaling campaign so hope you guys enjoyed this video um this is something that's worked really well for me and i know it'd be very impactful for you guys um you know instead of being like crazy all over like looking like some higher frequency just a nice stable line and uh slowly scaling up and because over time those consistent scaling over over over and over it's just gonna keep pushing those revenues up every single day and it's gonna get you better results you're gonna scale um and things can be very blissful so hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you the like button hit that
