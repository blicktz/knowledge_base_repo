yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is nick terrio and today i have an exciting new video for you guys i'm actually going to show you all how i cut some ads and ad sets and decide which winners i want to run with so this won't be like a super detailed video but at least give you a little bit of insight of how i make my decisions with cutting ads that's cutting ads and which ones i want to scale inside of the ads manager so before we get started make sure you hit that like button and hit that subscribe button if you need to channel for new videos every other day just like this one let's get started guys so in the ads range right now i'm running this campaign um i've only been running it for a day and a half so it's a little too early to cut it but i it's a very proven account proven structure and everything like that so i kind of understand what i need to cut and i've i've seen some early successes with a few ad sets so i'm going to make this video for you guys just going to show you guys exactly what you know what's going on so uh this would be perfect for people who have a brand new ad account maybe even some people that want to restructure the ad account in each proven way so uh this is kind of like how things are set up so let's go inside the ad account just got all the campaigns filtered down just this one right here where we're testing some uh some new audiences and new creators for a spring sale usually i'll either test audiences or test creatives i'll never do both of them at once but because i'm trying to move very aggressively with this sale i'm just going to go ahead and just run them all together so i got a uh tofu campaign which is top of funnel you know website conversions abo some optimizing for purchases website conversions all that good stuff and on the top level you see right here it shows 279 spent two purchases 0.49 roas breakeven or us 1.9 so we're definitely below the breakeven or us um with 136 dollars in revenue now i did launch it a few days ago so i'm gonna do the lifetime value and we're about 1.14 so the typical person would just look at this and be like hey this campaign is not profitable let me just go ahead and turn it off but that's not the case again this is a creative and audience testing campaign we're simply utilizing this campaign to gather evidence of what's working what's not working that's all we're trying to figure out here and you need to be able to spend that money on it you can't just launch this campaign and expect it to be good so we did launch it about two days ago so let's see yeah it's like wednesday today's friday so i recommend three full days so 72 hours before you make any adjustments right now i'm at the 48 hour marks i'd actually run this campaign for another day but there's a few reasons why i'm cutting a little early one i just want to make this video for you guys two there's a few hot ones in here that i really want to leverage asap and because i'm doing this aggressively but i do not recommend this guys this is an account that's had millions of dollars of ad spend so we know exactly really quick but if you're new if you only spend a few hundred dollars in your account you know anything below a few hundred thousand dollars i would not recommend doing it this quick i recommend waiting the full three days before you make any adjustments to it so let's get into the actual campaign and diagnose this and see what's going on so you can see right here i have 13 ad sets all at forty dollars a day so like i said when you're testing creatives and testing audiences i recommend abo so if you're testing creatives do proven audiences if you're testing audiences use proven creatives but i ran this campaign as if i was starting completely from scratch because you know if you're starting from scratch you don't have proven creatives and if you're starting from scratch you don't prove an audience so you really just gotta throw a bunch of stuff together and when you throw a bunch of stuff together you're gonna see a lower ass on the campaign initially starting out because some stuff's gonna work some stuff won't and you gotta understand what works and what doesn't and be able to make decisions based off that data so let's just say for example three full days went by 72 hours went by what i recommend for you guys is running ad sets at at least ten dollars a day and also to at least ten ad sets so try to go for a hundred dollars a day from beginning if you can't do five ad sets and test different audiences of lookalikes maybe if you don't have anything there's no social engagement nothing brand new business then test more interests instead of engagement audiences and website visitors and stuff like that so test interests go broad go narrow test a few different variations and that's what we did right here we just put a few things together this particular product is more of a like lovey product you know it's an infinity heart sign people you know kind of like purchase it put their names on stuff together so it's a pretty hot topic also to just a side note i'm also getting a ton of sales now in the ads manager but it's not being shown up in ads manager but but we're getting the sales because it's all on shopify so this is also a little bit skewed we just been noticing that problem with facebook ads in the last week or so so but yeah this is all the data from the few days we've ran it and you can see there's a lot going on but the most importantly is identifying first off what got sales that's the first thing so what got cells that's all we want to know what got sales what didn't so three days went by three full days have gone by what has worked for us and we do see a few things that's worked we're not looking for breakeven we're not looking for under breakeven we just want to know what works and obviously we know that this one doesn't work this one doesn't work this one this one or this one these just didn't work we spent 75 now this is also another thing i like to spend at least two to three times my aov so three days have gone by have i spent at least two or three times my aov during that time period no let's keep it running so remember this so my aov is 115 so i want to spend at least two to three hundred dollars per ad set but again i understand some of you guys not in that position to spend that much on a chance of it being profitable so sometimes you have to make decisions quick and that's what i'm hopefully going to do in this video so at least three full days 72 hours from the time your ads go live so you'll launch all the ads but they might not go live for another 12 hours so you want to make sure you actually base your decisions and stuff off the 72 hours after your ads have gone live so um again let's turn off this one right here too so i'm just gonna go to edit turn off and you can see right here we got a variety of different things we have some stuff that's unprofitable some that's profitable we do kind of kind of see a common thing birthday gifts engaged shoppers friends of newlyweds and engaged this product we work really great for them um but even broad just completely open has worked really well for us now all of these ad sets are composed of one interest or one look-alike we're not testing compounded look audiences yet or compounded ad such a you know of a stack of look likes or stack of interest in it yet and then we're also excluding all warm stuff engagement social engagement website visitors and previous purchases so now that we've got a pretty good accurate thing of what's working what i want to do is really see what creative has been getting all these sales is it kind of a variety or not so let's click all of these and i want to go to ads for eight ad sets what is the common theme what is getting us the results because you can see right here you know we got 35 spent on this particular ad right here and it's not doing well some of these ad sets have a 1.3 1.4 return on ad spend but then you look at the creatives and it's because you know some of these other creators got like 15 11 dollars 10 dollars just there's three creatives per asset by the way and it just it didn't work so you can see right here so what creatives can we turn off you know how can we further optimize that and and that's what we can see right here so you can see what creators really got the the good the 2.6 2x 2.54 3.58 this one right here got 35x return on ad spend now obviously it's only been four dollars spent on this particular creative so once we start spending probably 100 bucks it's probably gonna go down to like a 2x 3x right there oh which is kind of the account average for this particular account so now what i'm doing right now is i want to look at some of these soft stats so the soft stats is like the unique outbound click through eight so 0.94 0.7 we're looking for a one percent on top of funnel if we're not getting a one percent and getting good raw ass we're still gonna run with it we're not getting a good rise and we're not getting you know under one percent click-through rate then obviously we need to test some new creatives and if it's not the creatives we're gonna need to change some new audiences so we are getting one percent on some of these creatives so i can understand that it might be just more of the audience itself and then now too i'm looking at like the cost per unique landing page you you know i've got one right here for 57 cents and that's yeah that's the one right there at 35x unique at the cart this product has an aov of a hundred dollars and we're getting unique at the cart's around 15 to 11 that looks pretty good right there um again you need to compare that to some your aov the stats in your account all that stuff to really understand um you know what's profitable you know what's kind of like a good range to go for so yeah so we kind of understand what's going on this creative right here is working extremely well uh these right here so i'm gonna leave those running but some of these are like borderline not doing good and that might just be the audience and stuff we can really see right here the ad set right here is purchased 30 days we can see right there engaged shoppers and we can see right there friends of newlyweds so let's go back to our ad sets engaged shoppers purchased 30 days and friends of newlyweds these are working super well so let's go right here and let's do those three right there um so yeah those are working good but you can see on the outside we have 1.69 1.97 2.15 and the realistically the problem is is is the ad spend wasn't spent properly between those so our robots was high on one with like a five dollar ad spend and like the ad spend went all to like one other creative because we have three creatives in each one so those look really good what i would do with these three right here because i'm trying to go aggressively because after the three days are up i want to take the the three best performing ones and duplicate them to cbo so i would take these three ad sets right here just literally click duplicate you know and it'll be like a new campaign i'd create a top of funnel scaling campaign and i would make sure that let's go to ask for three ad sets i would make sure that we just duplicate these ads into those ad sets so we have three ad sets and one ad in each one and that's the best performance right there and those are kind of like our best performers overall in this particular uh campaign so that's that's really what i would do and like this one right here you know we got one cell on it it's a 0.77 uh you know i'll turn that off just particularly because it's low row ass but also too i want to check in here okay so yeah the ad performed severely you know bad so i'm actually gonna turn off that ad and i can either let this run a little bit longer to test that audience so we did get a pretty good you know impression we're still getting like a 1.86 ctr in this bottom one right here so understand that this creative is kind of kind of getting to people and stuff but i'm just gonna let this run for another three days really and i i just want to wait another three days and start killing some more bad stuff so let's say three days go by this one's underperforming let's just turn it off you know this one's underperforming right here let's see this website visitor one let's just turn it off so i would wait another three days and turn off some more stuff i'm not going to increase the budget and i'm not going to lower the budget i'm leaving the budget preset right here but before i make a decision of turning something off i'm gonna check the creatives first and see if there's maybe just a creative they got all the spin so that's what i would do i duplicate the best performing ass uh best performing variables best performing ad sets and best performing creatives into a scaling campaign cbo at 100 bucks a day and start from there so that's kind of what i do when i jump into this account and take a look and this is kind of just a quick touch on it but that's kind of overview of everything so hope you guys enjoyed this video if you're spending at least a thousand dollars a day and left up on a call with me to discuss how we can you know help you with your
