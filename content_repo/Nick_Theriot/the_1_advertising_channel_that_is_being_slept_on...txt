yo what's going on guys welcome back to the channel my name is Nick Theriot and today I have an exciting new video for you guys look I haven't been completely honest with you guys there's actually another route I've been taking to generate the success I've had with e-commerce and it's probably one of the most slept on services and advertisements in 2020 it's very low competition some really great CPMs and it just blows away any other type of advertising right now and it's actually I'm coming clean I don't really run Facebook ads this is exactly what I do so before we get started make sure the like button and hit that subscribe button for future videos on this slept on advertising service let's jump into it guys so like I said I haven't been completely honest with you guys and there's actually been another advertising revenue or Avenue I've been going with and it's the real secret behind all of my success with Facebook ads e-commerce and everything it's just it's absolutely amazing great CPMs it doesn't have to do the best targeting options and stuff like that but it's just it's really great so let me share with you guys exactly what we've been doing it is called newspaper advertising yes newspaper advertising for e-commerce in 2000 well actually 2021 that we're in right now and it's it's just it's amazing it's super slept on because everyone's going one route I decided to go back you know everyone's moving forward I decided to go back in the past live in the past and we're diving into newspaper advertising so let me show you guys a few things so what is the barrier of entry for newspaper advertising so first things first is you need to have a great product I mean that's obviously that's a timeless piece right there but with newspaper advertising you need to have a great product and you need to find a great copywriter someone that can really craft the right offer and really tile that in so you can find a few copywriters online and stuff and when you find this copywriter you want to reach out to them you know talk to them a little bit about the product and stuff and then I'll let them start writing the ad copy now it'll usually take about 20 to 30 days to get your ad copy back but trust me it takes time it takes time for the copywriter to really get into it really finalize really dig deep because with newspaper advertising it's you pay it once and after you pay it once you're really not going to know what your results will be for another month to two months because there's really no tracking there's no data analytic dashboard like we have with facebook ads and stuff but that's okay that's totally what makes it great because you know we just pay it and we know it's going to work because it's newspaper people read the newspaper all the time and because they read the newspaper and your product being in the newspaper it increases that social proof and the reason you know like they have a greater reason because people think it's it's you know trust it because it's in newspapers so once you find your copywriter you know go through everything go to your product show them the features the benefits and stuff like that it even works really well if you send your product to your copywriter because when you send them to copy the product itself they really get to know it and they really really really can write better ad copy around it so now once you get your ad copy you probably spend a few thousand dollars on your piece of ad copy and it also too kind of depends if you want a full page spread where like the whole page of the newspaper is just your product or if you want like a quarter like there's different sizes so it really just depends on you know what you really want so it could be anywhere from a few thousand to you know probably somewhere in the five to six figures for your piece of ad copy so but trust me it's going to be good so once you get that done you actually need to purchase the newspaper slot and like i said you got to really determine you know what size you want so for example something like the washington post a very popular newspaper for a full page advertisement runs somewhere around 163 000 usd so for something smaller you could be looking at something around 2700 so it really just depends on how big and you know how hard you want to go with this so you can spend a few you know five four to five figures on your copy you're going to spend obviously hundreds of thousands of dollars on getting your product development launch and all that stuff like that and now you're going to spend another five to six figures on the actual newspaper itself so actually putting it and getting printed inside of the newspaper now once you actually get all this finally approved and stuff it's probably around two months from the moment you decide to actually go around this route but it's okay patience is perfection the longer you wait the more you can perfect everything and the greater results you can have so once you get this started you want to go ahead and send it out blast it out and wait probably another two to three weeks before you get the full data back because with newspaper you know you get circulated through not everyone just immediately reads it some people might pick it up later down the time there's just you know a variety of different factors uh so it may take a few weeks before you really start seeing impact because someone has to read it then after they read it they can't just click online order they have to actually go ahead and maybe go to the store or maybe you can go order online and maybe just take a little time and delay because you can't really just like you know jump out and remind them but it's okay it's newspaper everyone keeps on their town their table counter and um you know they'll likely go ahead and uh you know pick it up later you know rumor about your product and stuff like that but another key thing kind of missed early on is also to you need to understand the stage of awareness and the market sophistication of your product so if you did do all this and let's say for example you went too technical about your product assuming that everyone knows about your product you know you might have hit or you know had a big miss but if you know everyone knows about your product and you want to you know you have a really great level of market sophistication you could leverage in with more some testimonials and stuff do kind of like retarget people assuming that your products already in the you know certain stage of awareness and stuff like that so about two to three months in is when you're really going to be able to gauge the success of your newspaper advertisement and again you can't really tell by these data and analytics and stuff these nice dashboards we have an ads manager but it's totally okay because you know like i said newspaper works great why not let's go for it so once you get all that put in together you can really gauge the success of the program really all you can do is kind of gauge by how much you spend on it and how much you got in sales and really hope for the best and then if you noticed a bump in sales then you're more likely to go ahead and do another one now if you truly think if if now if i haven't sold you yet on this newspaper advertising then that's totally okay because this is completely an april falls video for you guys but i really want to go into exactly how newspaper advertising was and how the greats that i study i study a lot of copywriting experts you know eugene shartz gary halbert david ogley all these really great copywriting experts and that's where they started back in the newspaper advertising time before television you know maybe some radio and stuff and it was a lot of newspaper and what i just ran you through was the original process to create an ad and get it out there first off it was a lot higher of a barrier of entry because one it costs a lot more with facebook ads i can simply go create a campaign and start off at five dollars a day anyone with a credit card and a facebook account go set that up literally within 30 minutes there's no approval process with facebook ads i can create an ad account immediately there's no approval no nothing like that i don't have to wait for verification i can literally just go create a facebook account link a card to it and start running ads for as little as five dollars per day even less dollar a day and i can start pushing advertising within 30 minutes whereas a newspaper ad i'd probably spend anywhere from five to six figures before i actually had an ad that was ready to be launched and it would take anywhere from 30 to 60 days because once you got the you know like once you have your product ready you got some product photography a little bit of it you have to reach out to an advertising firm which a lot a lot of the stuff they did was just copywriting copywriting and maybe taking a little bit few photos and stuff because newspaper all the newspapers is copy and having a great you know advert in the newspaper so they might kind of you know create a little something like that and then also to you know the landing page and stuff and all that stuff they don't really have much of that they had some instances a you know like a you know website for people to go to but that wasn't really till the very late 1990s to early 2000s where they really started shifted to that a lot of it was just like here's this great product that best buy has now in their store come get it here's this new product kit in the market find it at your local dollar tree like it was it was all more just driving people to stores to purchase products and it's very hard to track that you know it's you can really just see that hey we launched that newspaper adverts in say for example louisiana or california and we've seen a big bump in sales for our particular product in california i guess it worked it was really hard to track that so you didn't have all that analytics and stuff so you know you had to spend a lot of money on a copywriter you had to spend a lot of money on the newspaper ad itself because it was the really only form of advertising now there's tons of different medians which allows people to really go broad and go through multiple different channels so it kind of lowers cpms a little bit you know cost per entry and again there's no really huge barrier of entry and you know one is the timing so we're in a really great era right now you know i i think that a lot of people are complaining about the ios 14 update they're complaining about these ios facebook ads accountants gets vans and stuff like that but with all that we're still in an amazing amazing time for advertising it is something that i just absolutely love it's beautiful and you know with that being said you got to take it in you got to be thankful for everything you know how things have improved so i know for me one thing that has not changed was copywriting and market psychology so you know really understand human psychology really understand like copywriting and how people have desires motives all this stuff grabbing attention creating desire and a reason to take action now once you understand that you you it it empowers you because it's not facebook ads anymore you can transition over to tiktok you can transition over snapchat you can transition to the next stage the next median of advertising quickly because you understand the core principles of what drives advertising you know facebook ads is merely a tool you know you can go spend a few thousand dollars learn the tool effectively but what truly gathers and what truly creates success of advertising is the psychology behind it so if you go ahead and spend a few thousand dollars you know on facebook ads tool learn it top to bottom but you just know the tactical side and you don't know any strategic side of the branding product fit all that good stuff all the stuff that's timeless you know that's going through newspaper radio television banners print ads uh flyers facebook ads snapchat ads tiktok google all these advertising principles have remained the same over and over and over you know so once you understand those core principles then you can transition to going to any tool and kicking butt on those tools because you understand the core principles of paid advertising and really advertising in general so that's why i'm happy to announce i will be starting a course i will be selling a course i know i know i know i did not want to go this route at all but i get hundreds of dms every single week asking me hey how can you help me with my brand i you know i apply to work with your agency but your agency just you know we we only accept people as spending at least a thousand dollars a day and paid advertising so we get a lot of people per week that message us and wants to help them and to be honest charging for a few hours of consulting calls only works to an extent but if you're starting from beginning it's just not worth paying me a thousands of dollars for consulting calls for me to teach you how to run facebook ads so in the sometime mid to end of q2 i will be launching a course um it'll be called elegant ecom it's something i've already put in production and i'm truly working my butt off too one this is going to be for e-commerce entrepreneurs this will not be for someone who wants to run facebook ads this is someone who's an e-com you know heart business owner that's trying to crush it in the e-commerce area they run a shopify store they need to drop shipping or they're going ahead and have a physical product and stuff so i will be pushing that right there and we're going to teach them facebook ads the marketing the psychology the principles everything they need to succeed inside of e-commerce literally teaching you everything we've learned from spending over a million dollars in the last 12 months on paid advertising and generating over four million dollars back in revenue all the structural shifts we had to make them in clients businesses
