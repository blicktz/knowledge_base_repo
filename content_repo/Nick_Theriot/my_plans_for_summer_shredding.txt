Yo what's up guys welcome back to the channel today it's currently an afternoon right now about to hit up a workout just took a scoop of the ghost legend Welsh's grape I know we actually like I think we bought a bottle right as this pandemic was happening so I've really never got to use it so I just dry scooped one and we're about to hit up a nice little shoulder day and we're actually gonna start this video with the shoulder day so also a quick update Phoenix is doing amazing I love you for all the support on yesterday's video he's enjoying his little habitat got creative for him he's very shy at the camera that took some pictures of him earlier and he definitely does not like the camera but my Western Digital hard drive came in it's the one ordered in Monday's video it's finally here I am transferring over all of the footage I got guys I've only been doing these daily vlogs I think like two weeks now and we've already like filled up over a terabyte of storage shooting 4k for this whole memory card a 64 gigabyte card and I'm averaging about 80 to 70 gigabytes per video all said and done my time is recorded render etc and upload to YouTube so I definitely got the four terabyte hard drive to help up with that but yeah so guys let's hop into a shoulder day now we're gonna do one sour strip for the extra pump extra gains so leave a like on this video for the gains welcome to today's commentary guys it feels pretty cool to actually do one of these because I feel like it adds like a different dynamic to the videos and it's always pretty cool so I got a nice little shoulder day I'm working on right now I started off doing a few kind of just like exercises with like the bands kind of stretch out and yeah just a typical shoulder day I think shoulder days are pretty easy as long as you have a few dumbbells at home to do and this workout went really well I'm actually really sore today and I did this workout yesterday and we're pretty good so right now I guess I just want to kind of like let you guys into my head right now of what I am not really struggling with but just kind of my thoughts and stuff right now April 4th is this Saturday today's April 1st is Wednesday April 4th is this Saturday and my original plans before this whole like coronavirus everything was April 4th I was going to release a really big just sick video I was gonna get a whole bunch of footage together make this amazing just like introduction video to my series and April 6th which is the Monday I was gonna start my diet and basically just 90 days of videos 90 days 90 videos putting out content every day but also a super transparent look into my life around business growing my business and dieting and everything just to really get you guys into what everything I'm doing and that was my original plans and since the gyms are closed now since we're pretty much just limited to our house and I guess maybe just lack of overall motivation it's really been kind of getting down to me of like hey you know do I still want to continue to do this or not necessarily do I still can do continue to do this because I originally I said alright why I'm doing it anymore I'm gonna continue daily vlogging like I'm doing now but now it's like I think I do want to do it to give me something to do and also at the same time to be like hey look we're in a fucking coronavirus you know we're in a pandemic right now we're supposed to be staying home and stuff and yes I'm doing all that but at the same time I'm still maximizing and becoming resourceful with what I have right now so also to it's just kind of like a good thing to like not necessarily show off but to inspire other people to maximize your current environment right now and that's something that's also my head I think I could really make this series worthwhile if I really push through and did something like that so that's something that right now I'm kind of debating the only reason why I guess I do not want to start it is just because a financially it's a little bit more draining but also to I mean I spent like $16 at chick-fil-a in this video which about to see now that's literally like two to three days worth of food in prep so I don't know I think really it's maybe I'm just not ready yet to commit to that commitment yet and I think that's something that I need right now in my life to really just push hard work hard set an example and allow you guys to come with me and actually get to see everything I do on a day-to-day basis of growing business getting shredded it and to be honest guys look I'm looking at this footage right now I'm just like oh I'm disgusted with myself and I'm more disgusted with myself is because I weigh a hundred and fifty six pounds right now two weeks ago I weighed 162 and I looked way better at 162 actually looked leaner at 162 and now I'm way less and look worse so now I'm like freaking out too so but that's my current ideas right now and I can't I'm debating bouncing back whether I want to start if I do we're going all in and we're gonna do something great so hope you guys enjoy this little shoulder workout hope you took some inspiration I am logging all my workouts and I will be releasing a workout routine very soon I just want to at least do them all first to make sure they're worthwhile and for I give you guys anything and put my main behind anything else so let's hop right back into the video hey guys finished working out currently heading to Kennedy's and before that I just splattered all over my face before that I am going to go to chick-fil-a picks up some food and something I haven't did in a while is wipe down and here my car come there in hope for the best hopefully there's any germs here so the common surfaces shift knob there we go and all all right it's just kind of like right here all right hopefully that kills anything that might be around also check this out got a kitty little gift well actually we went to her house Saturday and we hung up some of these lights in a room and she only got enough to do like three like two-thirds of her room so this is the last third right here and she was very bummed out about it and stuff and she doesn't have Amazon Prime so I'm like you know what let me uh let me hook her up so we're gonna go get this to work oh I'm about to tear it all up at chick-fil-a right now stuck between whether you get healthy or not you want the regular or deluxe? uh the deluxe and what's your drink? uh lemonade that is it thank you thank you a bag of bees I got my flowers life's a chew up diamond
