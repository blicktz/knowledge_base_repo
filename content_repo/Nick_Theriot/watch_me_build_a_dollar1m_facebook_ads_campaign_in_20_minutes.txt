today we'll be building a 1 million dollar facebook ads campaign gotten a lot of questions of the type of campaigns i use inside of my facebook ad account with that being said today we'll be kind of breaking down some of the clients we've done helped scale to million dollars plus inside of their campaigns and exactly the setup that we leverage so just looking at a few accounts right here it's an account right here that didn't quite spend a million dollars but did over 2.4 million dollars in this one specific campaign it's another account right here that literally spent over 2 million dollars with 5 million dollars in revenue for this specific client and in this client right here we actually did 6.6 million dollars in spin over the last three years in this one campaign right here so three different accounts all different niches even different industries this one's legion relative to some of these other ones right here that are more e-com specifically yeah long story short they all use the same structure and today we're actually going to hop in that account today and build out that campaign just for reference we're basically going to be creating a advantage sales campaign how we set up the ad sets and then how do we set up the ads inside of that campaign structure so that being said let's go ahead and build it out all right so now we're going to hop inside of the facebook ad account we're going to go ahead and hit create inside of create we're going to click on sales campaign you can do your sales campaign or lead campaign it just kind of depends on what specifically you're optimizing for but long story short this is going to be exactly the same for sales and leads this would be exactly the same for whether you do a local service business or if you're an e-commerce business that's scaling for the whole country so we're going to click on click sales campaign here because we want to optimize for purchases i always like to go ahead and add in my agency initials right here doesn't really matter whether you do it or not i like to do it and then i'm just going to call this let's just say we're going to push ads for ebook and then maybe this will be our usa campaign boom wc just means website conversions means i'm optimizing for website conversions we're gonna be optimizing for website purchases today which means that it's a sending traffic to a website and the conversion happened on the website now we'll also type in cbo because we're going to be doing a cbo campaign yeah scroll down click on advanced catalog ads we're going to turn those off not necessarily not against advantage plus catalog ads i've just never been able to scale an account purely on those and right here where it says budget we want to make sure we select campaign budget there's ad set budget or campaign budget i like to do campaign budget some people like to do ad set budget neither one is technically wrong i've just had far greater success with campaign budget and it's the one that i use 100 of the time now for our daily budget i always tell people start off with a daily budget that you can afford to lose for 30 days without being emotionally tied to that budget so for me i'm gonna start off on 100 a day because that gives me time to make the campaign profitable it gives me time to test new creatives it gives me time to test different offers it gives me time to test new landing pages whereas if you just test something for like a day and turn it off you don't give yourself the opportunity to go ahead and be able to make those tests and adjustments now here we have audience segment reporting this is pretty easy to set up so if you just click on edit inside of advertising your settings right here these are the audience segments which is pretty cool because you actually go inside of the accounts and see a breakdown of these for me personally engaged audience i like website visitors 30 days and existing customers is purchase 180 days if you don't have these like uh already set up then just create a custom audience website boom boom website visitors and i'll just say create or if you want to do purchases i'll do purchases and i'll do 180 days boom and create audiences so those are pretty cool i like to set those up uh we don't have any special ad categories for this specific product so it'll be good now i'm gonna call this 101 um that's how i like to start off my basically like my naming conventions for my new creative test because i do different creatives per ad set here i like to type in things like male plus female if i'm targeting both male plus female then i'll go ahead and i will type in boom boom boom i'll go and type in the age i'm just gonna do 21 plus maybe i even do 18 plus to be fair here doesn't really uh just kind of depends on who you're targeting now i do broad targeting which means i don't set any audiences for the accounts this is now called advantage plus audience so whether you call it broad or whatever it doesn't matter to be fair i'm gonna call it broad i like to type in ap next just means automatic placements and then i'm optimizing for purchases so that's my naming structure and then basically each batch of creatives has a different number to it so maybe 102 maybe 105 maybe 150 135 all right so just for reference right there and then if i ever want to test like ages i'll just change this age if i ever want to test like a specific placement like reels for example only then i would just type in reels only and then male plus female maybe i want to do just male or just female i'll just have an m or an f right there now website right here is going to be selected and then i want to maximize number of conversions gives you a few different options here maximize value of conversions or number of conversions i always like number of conversions that's just simply what i've seen the most success with now you want to go ahead and select your pixel and then next thing you want to do is select the conversion event this is going to be purchases because we're optimizing for sales there should be absolutely zero reason in 2025 you're optimizing something for other than purchases it should like there's still people out there to believe you need to add to cards or initiate checkouts that's all false everything should be optimized for purchases or if i'm running a legion campaign i'm optimizing for leads now here we'll get budget strategy ad set spending limits i do like to add a 10 minimum spin on my ad set to be fair now if you're rocking like a 20 a day budget then it just means you can only launch up to two ad sets at a time in the terms of like if you're testing multiple assets but that's just something you have to keep in mind start date i just like to set this for midnight and there we go cool now end date i never set that and then here we'll go to our audience here we have advantage plus on which is awesome um here you can go ahead and exclude if you want to like you know like exclude what i call um like existing customers and stuff i don't do it i just i mean i do do it for some accounts some some accounts we have 30 days some accounts we have 180 days all my media buyers haven't like collectively set the same audience yet so that's why some of my youtube videos you see 30 some youtube videos you see 180 some are still testing it and stuff to be fair like we just see zero difference if we exclude customers versus not excluding customers if we exclude 30 day versus 180 days so like every now and then like just being very transparent we'll forget to uh set an exclusion is it the end of the world no is it something like you have to do now no i've just seen such a little difference in it that just doesn't matter to me so yeah i'll do purchase 30 days for this i i would say purchase 30 days is my favorite if you're going to exclude anyone because if you have a product that people love then people are going to talk good about your product on the comments of the ads after 30 days and it helps out a lot with um lower in cpm helping the performance of that particular ad like all of those good things right there now i'm not going to click on further the limit reach of your ads because there's no reason why like i got my location united states if i wanted to target like i don't know let's just say i wanted to advertise to houston texas because i have like you know specific like local business then here like i would just type in houston texas and just select my like location as service because this particular example right here i'm just type i'm just targeting united states there's no reason why i need to do that um so yeah so i say so if your local business you just go down to a city level and if you're targeting a whole country then cool you just type in that country now i personally like to do one country per campaign there's nothing wrong if you already have multiple countries in a campaign but for me i like to scale up a business to 100 200k a month in one country first then i'll just create separate campaigns and launch new stores for those other countries same pixel same out account just translated creatives and translated store and those stores are in the proper currency relative to that particular country right there so there we go placements advantage plus i'm not worried about those as well i would say the only other question some of y'all might have is like okay well what if i wanted to target specifically men or specifically women to be fair here i'm leaving all of this default male plus female the only thing only time i'm gonna ever change this is like let's say for example we're selling women's lingerie for example and 98 of the year we target exclusively women now the other two percent of the year may be valentine's day and christmas and we want to specifically target guys with the intentions of buying their wife or girlfriend lingerie as a gift for valentine's day or christmas and that particular example right there i would go ahead create a new campaign specifically only targeting men and because i know the history of that ad account is specifically for women i'll then go ahead and make sure we're only targeting men because i know it's going to be biased towards women already so in that case i would further limit the reach of the ads which that's okay ignore all facebook's warnings and i'm gonna go ahead and just literally come here but yeah so i'm just gonna come in here gender and then men only in that very specific scenario now 99 of the time i'm just gonna leave it as this and the only time i'm gonna target something more specific is if we need to break it out because targeting both is causing a issue on the business itself if it's not causing an issue the way it is i'm just going to let that roll even if i just want to target women only so for example if i'm selling women's lingerie i'm still going to target male plus female and leave it like this because i'm gonna let facebook do the work there because it'll probably be like 99 women and like a few men that are buying for gifts and like random stuff like that now if i'm selling women's lingerie i'm getting a fuckload of men clicking on it because it's women in lingerie in the ads they're not buying they're just clicking on it which to facebook if you're getting a lot of clicks that's to them makes them want to spend more on an ad if they want to spend more on an ad or if they start spending more on an ad it's going to start taking more ad spin starts taking more ad spin and it's a bunch of men just clicking on the fucking pictures because it's women in lingerie and they're not buying then that's going to be an issue to the business so then i would just simply go ahead come in here do that exact same thing and just deselect men that's it all i would do now let's go next here we'll just go ahead make sure you select your identity almost like my account boom let's see cool now they have these threads profiles which is pretty cool yeah here i'm just going to go down i'm going to go and click manual upload sometimes this is selected i'm just going click manual upload though i'm gonna do single image or video i have been doing more single image or video versus flexible lately or actually i've been doing flexible but what i'm doing is i'm uploading two copies inside of it so here i'll go ahead and do one flexible for three different ads so here we got our flexible ad we're gonna add our media we'll upload our images i just like the three images for y'all for today i like to do one image and pretty much one different like visual difference in between them and again that's like majority of the cases there will be some cases where i'm gonna have the same image and just test a bunch of headlines on it that doesn't matter i'm just giving you all different examples but like this is the majority example right here where they all have the same hook on it and they just have a different picture that's perfectly fine that's what i do 90 of the time there's the other 10 of the time where i might have this just like this and it'd be three different photos or even 10 different photos and each one has a different visual or different hook on it now in this case i'm doing one flexible i'm doing three flexible ads per ad set but each have a different photo this is just so that way i can go and see what creative is winning another way to do this is also just do a single immature video this is so you can actually see what body copy or primary text works too as well so boom to be fair i'm testing both right now really just personal preference right there we have like you know a bunch of images we want to test and we want to know performance specific for each one we'll do a single image and if we want to know like specifically what primary text is working then we'll do a single image but uh for the most part we're doing flexible with two body copies two headlines and we're doing three flexible ads per ad set each one with a different image uh so that way we know what image specifically works right there but yeah so let's just go back and set this up let's just go so flexible add media add images i'm gonna add this in right here primary text this will be you know primary text one this will be well i'll say existing winning primary text and then new primary text boom and then this will be existing winning headline and then boom new headline here just add in your headline or your primary url i'm just gonna drop in my inner circle stuff boom i'm gonna turn off advantage plus creative optimizations it just learn more shop now really just depends i'm sending people directly to like a listicle or product page or if i'm like very direct in the ad like here's the product to sell like for this type of product right here this would just simply just be like a learn more type of thing yeah and then this would be 101-1 there we go i'm gonna hit ctrl d or command d if you're on um mac i'm just gonna literally change the image here now i'm gonna hit ctrl d again come in here literally go and change the image there we go sweet now last thing url parameters if i'm on triple l or high roast whatever i'll add those in just a particular example i'm not so i'm just going to hit review and publish i'm gonna go ahead and hit publish so campaign's published now we can see it's scheduled but let's say i want to test a couple other ads all i'll do is just duplicate this ad set duplicate original setup i'll just come in here i'll literally just go in like deselect all of these and just hit delete to where it's just one i'll go to edit and let's just say there's some videos we want to test so i got some videos for y'all today videos i pretty much just go ahead and basically do the same voiceover same script same everything the only difference is is each one has most nights we'd eat sit on the couch so most nights we'd sit on the crouch or scroll you can see right there if we go to this one most nights we'd eat sit on the couch so literally says the same thing has the same caption same everything the only difference is the visual hook is different this one was like some food this one is looks like maybe a woman in the kitchen and then this one is most nights we've set a food right here so i'll literally just go ahead and upload those videos i'm just going to select three random videos for y'all today just make this a little bit quicker for me boom and what i'll do is that would be like 102-1 command d duplicate i load in the second video boom duplicate and i load in the third video right there and i'll just make sure that says 102 now boom and then i'll literally just go and hit publish as well let me get rid of this save a draft review and publish now as far as like working this campaign and stuff it's pretty straightforward i'll add anywhere between one to five new ad sets a week with three new creatives in it sometimes i'll add more creatives to it like you know for example as one client right now we already found a winning creative and i just created like six to eight iterations of new creatives around that winning messaging right there and i just launched them all in as a new ad set for it so we actually had six to like seven ads in here versus just three but like 90 of the time i'm just doing three and then when i'm finding like fresh new winning messaging and i'm doing iterations and variations i might upload like i might go sit down create like 10 new iterations around that image and then upload all 10 at once in that ad set and i'm always creating a new ad set every time i load in new ads i'm creating new ad sets i don't know why people believe that i'm going in and adding in existing ads like new ads to an existing ad set it's completely false you don't need to do that i just create a new ad set every time and each number like 102 103 104 i like to create a google sheet inside where i will literally go and basically just record a couple key things for like each one you know and this would be like batch number boom so that would be like 101 and then basically right here this is where i'll do like you know what like stage it's at is it testing is it creating in creation mode right now boom and i'll basically go ahead and put the hook that we're going to use or not to hook the launch date and then i'll put the creative hook desire awareness sophistication hypothesis hypothesis is basically like why the are we creating this why do we believe this specific image or video is going to improve performance and yeah and i basically just go ahead and create a google sheet like this i have one that unfortunately i only give out to my inner circle students so if you want to join the inner circle link below or give you access to a ton of these different sheets and stuff so i basically just do that and then each week i basically go ahead and have a dedicated day where i upload anywhere between zero to five new ad sets i'm okay with more than five as well i don't like necessarily say you have to only do five that's just kind of like the general thing that i've just seen with my own thing it's somewhere between zero and five there's some weeks we don't upload anything because like we may go and spend three weeks working on a huge batch of creatives and we just simply don't have anything to launch this week whereas most of the time it's like anywhere between zero to five new ad sets with anywhere between three to ten new ads we have with inside that ad set right there and all i'm doing right here is last seven days i'm looking to last seven days and i'm turning anything off that's impacting overall performance negatively and anything that's just not taking significant spin with good performance good performance for me is that we look at the highest spending ad we ideally want to be a below or cpa than that particular ad right there inside of the ad account itself so turning things off that's not gaining spin with good cpa uh turning things off that's just not getting good cpa and then also to lastly if something takes overall spin with a really bad cost per purchase and hurting the business i'm also turning that off too i'm not waiting seven days that's something i'll turn off like literally within 24 48 hours right there and as far as scaling this campaign like it's very very straightforward for scaling this campaign it's literally just going ahead boom boom boom just do that i'm just coming right here to the budget i'm just increasing that by 20 a day i'm keeping it very simple small inches forward so that way i don't blow the budget and throw a huge budget below the account and then give up because i'm a little that's what most of y'all do to be fair there's so many people i've talked to where it's like they start scaling they triple the budget because they get too excited they blow their account and as they blow their account like they literally blow all their money because they set aside for this and then they cry about it online it's like no i just 20 increase over time if i increase this budget 20 a day for 30 days it comes out to like 21 000 so it's not like it's slow by any means but yeah so that's it and the way we're able to do numbers like this 700k 2 million dollars in spin 6 million dollars to spin is because we sit here and we do this boring work for a very long time and we trust the process and we don't get grasses greener on the other side like if i would go and oh maybe i need to test abo because everyone on twitter saying abo maybe i need to test bid caps because everyone's telling me bid caps on twitter like if you're constantly in that mindset right there that's what slows you down so much more when i finally just said everyone and just focused on the thing i know works and made sense and just blocked everyone out that's when i've seen significant better success with facebook ads and be able to build up campaigns like this but it's the constant grass is greener on the other side oh abo oh he's doing cost caps so he's doing bid caps i need to do that i need to do that i need to do that and you're constantly throwing this account and basically like doing these big swings in the account every week versus just telling everyone to off and just focusing on your account and just focusing on creatives landing pages offers and upsells and having a really great product that's how you build up campaigns like this and that's where so many people get stuck at so if you want to commit to that and you want someone to handhold you on their creatives the landing pages the offer the upsell and actually fixing things that actually move the business forward to building campaigns that spend six million two million over seven hundred thousand dollars right here then click link below to have nick terrio mentor you
