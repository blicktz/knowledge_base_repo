today we'll be going over the five stages of market sophistication this is basically one of the strategies we leverage to always stay one step ahead of competitors this is going to be like a combat tested strategy for those who are running facebook ads and always want to be able to consistently keep adapting and upgrading your ads to where it's always like your one step ahead of competitors to make your ads the obvious choice which allows you to stand out and consistently scale your facebook ads and it's literally the exact strategy we leverage behind all of the accounts that we use in combination with desire and awareness to be able to help scale facebook ads to 30k days with that being said let's dive into the video so if you've been on the channel for a while you already kind of know this game right here but the first thing i like to access which box you're picking and reality is it's very difficult to pick any of these boxes because they all say the same thing but when i transition over to the next slide and we kind of go into this particular one right here where it's lose 18 pounds in four weeks it's very obvious which one to pick why because this one stands out and then if we go to the next slide and everyone starts saying the same thing well guess what it becomes easy again to pick this one because it stands out from the rest and this is exactly what happens with market sophistication because right now your ads look like this you're copying everyone else you're doing the same thing as everyone else and you're just one of the many blue boxes so when you do something different you stand out but how do you do different how do you make different ads and like yeah like there's different creative types and stuff like that but you're still ultimately saying the same thing at the end of the day so for us market sophistication allows you to alter the message that you're using to consistently stay one step ahead and there's five unique strategies we leverage and at each individual stage there's a different strategy to deploy to be able to consistently stand out in a way that makes sense so with that being said let's go over those five stages here and then i also have a ton of examples for you guys today as well going over these five stages so stage number one you just simply want to state the claim now stating the claim is just what does the product do or the benefit the problem the desire etc so lose weight remove anxiety de bloat this example right here how to scale facebook ads just base level state the claim now stage two we exaggerate the claim and when you exaggerate the claim it's just where you make the claim bigger than all your other people so everyone else is saying how to scale facebook ads i'm saying how to scale facebook ads to 10k days i want to exaggerate it a little bit more than everyone else so that's all i'm doing here you can do size or speed that's the two main ways so how to scale facebook ads overnight how to scale facebook ads to 10k days now here introduce a new mechanism so this is just basically a new opportunity a new way to achieve what they want so they still want to learn how to scale facebook ads but they've already tried a variety of strategies and nothing has worked so far for them so in this case here we have to introduce a new way a new opportunity to scale facebook ads here ai strategy to scale facebook ads to 10k days on autopilot we introduce a new way a new how to be able to scale facebook ads and if you notice we specifically say this in the beginning then we call out the desire why because this is just part of how we grab people's attention to offer and promise this new way that they want to learn about now at stage four we do the same thing it's the same mechanism ai strategy but better than we originally had so here low cost ai strategy to scale facebook ads to 10k days now here stage number five identity and here we just simply want to talk about how to scale facebook ads for econ brands right why do i say that is because now instead of just going after in general how to scale facebook ads we want to go after a particular identity a sub niche that makes up that facebook ads marketplace and we stand out because now it's hey they're not just selling facebook ads for anyone they're scaling facebook ads for one specific individual now let's go over some examples i have two complete different examples i have examples from the book breakthrough advertising but i'll also have a bunch of examples i screenshot it from just various different ad libraries i think we've made actually one of them variety of ads in here but just to show you also too like how this is applied to facebook ads as well so number one is just state the claim so from breakthrough advertising here they're just talking about basically losing ugly fat they're just staying the base claim here now here's an ad i found for anxiety the day i've said goodbye to anxiety they just state the claim in the creative that's it now here this is another static ad from facebook all they do is calling out hey are you feeling anxious they're just stating the claim now here's another one overwhelmed before boarding a flight are they saying anything about the speed are they saying anything about the size are they introducing a new mechanism any of that no they're just stating the claim that's it and then this one right here goes into the product itself and the benefits it gets here's another one literally just stating the claim goodbye anxiety now here they're not necessarily stating a claim but they're also to just calling out the people that like hey do you have acne scars dark spots and pigmentation they're calling these people out introducing a solution so they're still just stating a claim in a way and then go into the product so still a stage one now here's another one this one right here is just calling out turkey neck basically and then like showing them before and after and then going into you know kind of solution here here's another example the exact same product now here base claim bad skin year let's change that and then boom boom boom now one other thing i want to talk about with like stage one is that this can be applied to anything it's not just facebook ads it's anything when it comes down to organic content as well you're just like one upping people basically here it can be applied to realistically anything as well that deals with headlines and copy and content ideas itself now number two we're going to exaggerate the claim so here instead of losing weight they just said like i'm 61 pounds lighter never hungry a minute so i actually disagree with this this is actually and i'm not saying that like the author's wrong or anything but i just don't like this headline right here because we're not still saying lose fat or lose weight they're saying i'm 61 pounds lighter so we're just kind of calling out a number right it's not necessarily wrong here at all just the way i look at it is i look at it that you're still saying the same claim so you're still saying lose fat you're just exaggerating so like in this particular case would be like lose 30 pounds in 30 days right the first one's just lose weight the second one would be you know lose 61 pounds so technically basically about the same from dad bod to walking around shirtless in 14 days we're just calling out from dad bod to walk around shirtless in 14 days this also technically could almost be a stage 5 headline as well here say goodbye to imperfections in just 15 minutes a day just simply call it the fact that like hey you know it just takes 15 minutes a day we're exaggerating the claim now only had two of these i didn't have a ton for these but let's keep moving forward i have a ton for stage three and here we're just basically introducing a new mechanism which is a new opportunity again people still have the same desire they've just failed with other ways to achieve that desire so now they're still looking for something weight loss skinny shots so these skinny shots is the new mechanism here this is actually an ad we created help the client do over 200k in a single month viral new laser treatment vanishes acne in 30 minutes new laser treatment the feature vanishes acne what people desire now here is the next one weight loss your way healthy you starts at a dollar a day with nooms complete program here to be fair it's not necessarily that we're introducing a new mechanism it's just leading to the idea of a new mechanism with nooms complete program and then also too we're also implying weight loss your way like it reminds me of the like i think it's burger king have it your way where it's like they've tried other weight loss solutions now this one is specific to their needs and stuff like that so the way it's worded is alluding to the idea of a new mechanism drug-free alternative for stress and anxiety so we're calling out a new mechanism based off what people want like they're already taking things for stress and anxiety but they hate the fact that like they have to use these drugs and stuff so this is just promising a drug-free alternative here they're literally calling out a bunch of other mechanisms their son tried for acne and then here it's just the fact that this one made it go on in seven days now i love this one a lot top cardiologist love handles driving you crazy this alpine drink burns 14 pounds so authority angle calling out desire love handles driving you crazy and then introducing that new mechanism this alpine drank burns for 14 pounds i love this this would be really good to send to like an avatar right here now non-surgical neck lift why is this important because non-surgical means that like they are already looking at neck lifts and like improving their neck but they just don't want to do surgery so here non-surgical neck lift introducing new mechanism now we're going to move over to stage four this is where we just simply go ahead we take an already existing mechanism on the marketplace and just make it better so more benefits more features more durable make it faster cheaper there's a lot of different ways you can improve on so here weight loss medication for as low as zero dollars people already know there's a variety of different like weight loss meds and stuff like that and then here they're just looking for one that's cheap non-toxic activewear there's already a lot of activewear on the market this is just non-toxic so it's made with a different material that's it here this is not just regular leggings these actually sculpt and lift your butt woman's ankle leggings now i i just find that just it's not necessarily like i to be fair i've just never seen this desire before but basically they just took an already existing mark leggings and just trimmed it up a little bit to be a little higher cut now this one's pretty cool this one's specifically called seamless and i like that they name the leggings seamless because a lot of girls don't like the seams on the front part of the legs and the back side of the legs from activewear and they just simply remove those seams right there make it look better now stage five this is a fairly easy one this is where we literally just go ahead and instead of going after just weight loss in general for example we go after a sub demographic of people so like here weight loss program for seniors here this one right here is menopausal weight loss plans so we're specifically going after people who are menopausal which technically would just be women here we took leggings and lost it we like this particular brand took leggings and then they just simply made them for pregnant women this is also another thing i just have to drive in and like scream at clothing brand owners because clothing brand owners just think that like their clothing can't apply to anything of like direct response that's completely false so in this case right here this is a great example where literally people just went in and you know made leggings for a sub identity of women which are pregnant women so instead of saying it you show it with clothing and you use these sophistication stages to actually build clothing specific to each stage now i like this one this is not your typical one you see often the most impatient woman tried this and now i like this because it's not necessarily saying like a physical characteristic you can see like pregnant women they're calling out women based off the characteristics their their identity characteristics so like impatient here's another one high achieving women take this so they're calling out sub women by how they identify themselves i really like this a lot now how do i find my sophistication nick well pretty easy one just write down your base claim you know lose weight how to scale facebook ads you know lose the love handles get rid of the dad bod just write that down first then from here you're going to go to the facebook ads library and then what you want to do is you want to search that claim up on the facebook ads library and then what you want to do is you want to exclude the last 30 to 90 days to see what ads have been running the longest so if we come over here boom let's go to library and then we search something like stops cravings all right i'm also going to type in a stop cravings to see if it makes any big difference okay so stops cravings right so there's over 200 ads for stops cravings okay so what i would do here is come in the filter and i would do from the time period i would actually go back on the to section so this actually excludes like if i go to like november 5th or august 5th we would actually exclude the last 30 days there's only 14 ads running now if i go and exclude a little bit further let's just say july 5th for example there's three ads running so these three ads have been running since july 5th these are solid winning ads for us now what i would be looking at here is okay hey this is kind of the claims that's working for this marketplace then here we want to write down those claims right and then we just simply want to go like take those claims and we want to review them and look at the sophistication stage that's currently working right now now again sophistication is about competing with people so if we go in and literally say hey everyone's at a stage one i need to write a stage one claim no if everyone's at a stage one you need to go to a stage two if everyone's at a stage two you need to go to stage three so sophistication is always about being one step ahead and basically it gives you that what i would say strategy on what you have to do next so if i would go search something that no one's advertising to right like we certainly did stops cravings and there's plenty of people that i was advertising to it just for fun i'll search lose weight and we'll see like how many thousands of people 34 000 people are marketing to that so there's a ton of people advertising to that but if i search something that like literally goes ahead and no one has then cool i'm just at a stage one i can say the base claim and that's it but if basically there is other people advertising to that claim all the same product and you have the same product so for example if i'm like um you know for example back in the day right like when i was starting my facebook ads agency everyone was saying we'll scare your facebook ads we'll scare your facebook ads we'll scare your facebook ads so then i was like hey we'll help you get a three extra rest with facebook ads because i realized everyone who like failed with facebook ad agencies and i was just another facebook ads agency promoting the same thing i was like i need something that differentiates out myself i need to call out a larger claim there so that's what i was able to do there now let's say i didn't necessarily could do a larger claim claim right and i go to a market where there's a variety of different mechanisms on the marketplace so uh let's say facebook ad space for example there's a lot of different mechanisms there's a lot of different strategies and structures and stuff like that so like for me to be able to compete i have to have that unique mechanism right so here if your product is a new mechanism no one else is promoting for that claim but there's other mechanisms being pushed out to it then you're going to want to promote yours as a new mechanism so if you're the only one selling facebook ads and everyone else is selling google ads tiktok ads all that stuff like i can push my facebook ads as a new mechanism now if everyone's pushing facebook ads i need to go develop a whole new facebook ad strategy to compete in the space that's why some of my youtube my youtube channel took off because i realized that hey pretty much everyone in the space is doing the same thing but when you lock in on strategy like single cbo campaign and teaching marketing fundamentals like i do now i'm introducing a new mechanism a new belief that i can create for people that they can achieve success with facebook ads it just comes down to these things that they haven't mastered yet now from here let's say there is a variety of different mechanisms in the marketplace it's definitely a stage three but we don't have something new you know we want to introduce women's leggings but we don't necessarily have like a totally new type of leggings that's reinvents the will so we know we just have to have a better pair of leggings than other leggings in the marketplace so here we'll just show what makes your mechanism better so like if we go back to this case right here or like this case right here we just need to show what makes our mechanism better and then from here if we don't have a better mechanism right like let's say for example ours you'll still look exactly like this after putting on the leggings then you want to go to a stage five and here you just want to pick a sub niche to promote it that's it so instead of going after just women in general who weight lift i could go after women who play pickleball i could go after sorority girls who are active i could go after women who literally just want to look pretty in the mirror when they put these leggings on but they do not want to work out at all so i could just go pick out different sub niches of people and advertise these leggings just for them now the key thing with a stage five is that you have to make sure that the ad creatives the copy the whole website the whole everything is branded specifically to that stage five sub niche you want to go after you cannot use a generalized product page to open up a stage five you will not work and same thing for all these other stages right like stage one's gonna be a lot more educational whereas like stage four for example is gonna be a lot more focused on what makes your product better than all the other leggings on the marketplace so just keep all of that in mind when you are running ads for these different sophistication stages now last thing test and see what works if you don't know exactly what stage you're at then test a couple different stages and see what works best for you so with that being said guys hope you all
