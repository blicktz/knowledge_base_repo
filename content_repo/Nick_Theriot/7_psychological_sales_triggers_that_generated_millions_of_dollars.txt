Hey, what's going guys? Welcome back to the channel. My name is Nick Theriault.

Today, I have an exciting new video for you guys. Today, I want to talk about seven powerful psychological triggers that have made me millions of dollars or my clients millions of dollars. Just full transparency right there.

That is for clients that we work with, with like marketing psychology. I'm gonna show you guys seven powerful psychological triggers. And like I said, they've done amazing work for us.

And you got to be careful with them because if you use these for wrong purposes, you know, hey, not responsible for that at all. But use it for the right purposes and make you a lot of money. And they're really powerful.

So with that being said, before we get started, hit that like button, hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. My apologies, last week, I think only uploaded Tuesday and Thursday. So completely against what I normally say, but it was a crazy week.

We've been scaling up the agency and working with some really amazing brands. So we've been very, very like in tune with that. So that comes first before YouTube.

But anyway, I'm back and got a lot of videos creating today for you guys. So excited for that. So let's dive in the video and start talking about these really cool psychological triggers.

So these psychological triggers are more things that we can use to kind of hype people up and really focus on those things that kind of get them to, oh shit, I need to buy now. Like I can't wait a while. I need to buy now.

And a lot of people like, oh, we'll just run a 20% off discount code. I'm like, yeah, that's great. But we're going to show some other cool stuff.

So the first psychological trigger that I really like to use is fear of missing out. This is a really big one right here. And this would be the way you paint the picture in terms of it's a really cool event that's happening.

And you essentially like, hey, we're going to sell out. You need to buy now, essentially. This is a pretty low, like low, you know, budget one, but it works really well.

A fear of missing out. How can you increase the pain and the fear of missing out for this event? Maybe it's a product drop.

Maybe it's ad they see. And they said that, hey, we're about to sell out of this particular product. You need to purchase now if you want it.

Cause like once we sell out, that's it. There's no more ever coming back. Um, so that's very big right there.

So fear of missing out. That's a big one. Now the next one anticipation.

Okay. So anticipation is how we basically get people squirming in their seats about to drop a product. Okay.

And you'll, you'll kind of notice some of these, that these psychological triggers we're going to discuss in this particular, um, video is going to actually be related to my like seven figure launch strategy video or my launch strategy video. That's either going to be coming out soon, or that has came out already. And, uh, some of these you can kind of layer in there as well.

So anticipation and anticipation right here is basically countdown timer. So you'll see this a lot on, um, I know like fashion Nova did a pretty good job for this, but I'll see this on other websites. It's funny.

Cause I'm always bringing up fashion, I don't shop for them at all. No reason to at all, but they just, they have some cool stuff with marketing and, uh, at checkout, it'd be like, Hey, your order expires in like nine minutes, essentially. So, um, and it's like a countdown timer going down.

So this also works well. I know back in like the early years of drop shipping, a lot of people are putting these countdown timers on every page and it can look scammy and spammy. So like use this with caution, essentially like that.

So that's a big one. Uh, when we're about to do a product drop, we'll always do like a 24 hours out. Email and a bunch of ads like that.

You could also do it in a way. Um, we'll do, uh, like, like the opposite. So like you can anticipate and make people excited for an event, but you can also do the anticipation of a closing out for a sale.

So before we close a sellout, um, we'll do like tonight at 12 o'clock, we're closing this, the store down, or we taking the sell off. Let's say it's Valentine's day right now. It's like our Valentine's day sale or Valentine's day.

It's 14 days, but, um, you know, it's, we're kind of running some Valentine's day sales right now. Uh, what we'll do is, is that Valentine's day, Hey, happy Valentine's day tonight at 12 o'clock. We're cutting ourselves.

There's a lot of chances to get anything you want. Um, it's kind of going against the fear of missing out, but also to the anticipation of the countdown, um, for, um, you know, Hey, you got 12 hours left. If you want to buy something, buy it now.

So that works really well. So there's two ways you can do that. Um, yeah, works really well.

So next one, scarcity, scarcity is a big one and scarcity is basically, Hey, we only have a few of these. There's 25 of these particular pair of pants or 25 pairs of the shirt. Uh, don't have much.

So if you want to buy it, you got to be there within the first five minutes of us dropping. Cause we will sell out. Um, kind of use a few of those right there.

Uh, fear of missing out and scarcity together. Last time we put this shirt on the market, we sold out in three hours. So you can also state the prior history of something selling out.

If, uh, if you, if you're constantly having to restock an item, that's always selling out. Then when you put that on and back on the market and send an email blast and our Facebook ads ads, talk about the fact that, Hey, last time we dropped this product, it sold out in three hours. So you need to be like there quick.

So we will sell out fast. So scarcity is a big one. It's basically just having a few available and a big demand for it.

And that increases that scarcity right there. So next one is novelty and guys, uh, just want to kind of like interrupt and say something real quick. Um, we'll be covering seven of these, but some of them are layered together and some of them can be kind of combined.

And also too, you can use a few of them throughout the duration of an event, a sales event, um, or like your evergreen campaign, things like that. Um, you know, you'll notice I'll kind of layer some together in this, in this video. Um, and there's also a lot of different ways to use them.

So, you know, they might not be a clear way at the second, but as you start to kind of get yourself familiar with these, you can, you can start finding new ways to implement it in your business. So number four is novelty novelty. Uh, and this could also be kind of related to scarcity as well, but it's more of the fact that it's a limited addition item.

So this is an item that you bring to your store, you sell a hundred of and you never bring back. So there's a way to where you can use novelty and scarcity together because what you can do is you can go ahead and say, Hey, um, here's a shirt that we just dropped. There's only a hundred of them available.

You can buy it and it's a limited edition run for never bringing it back to the store. Well, you sell that a hundred and an hour, you do amazing sales. And then guess what?

Six months later you decide, Hey, I want to drop that shirt again. I know we told them we wouldn't drop it again, but it was an amazing. I want to bring it back to the store.

You bring it back and then you can state in your scarcity. Hey, last time we dropped this shirt, it's all out in three hours. So if you want to purchase, you better purchase in the first hour, essentially.

So that's the way it's where you can use both. But novelty is more of that first time dropping a product. We're only making 500 of these.

We're only, you know, it's a limited edition run. Um, it's the first time a product's ever exposed to a store and you're talking in the language of the fact that it's never coming back again. You're only doing this once.

Okay. So that's novelty right there. Now, number five, exclusiveness.

And this is basically, basically is how do we make people feel exclusive? So like VIP, things like that. So how can they be a part of something that makes them feel exclusive?

Okay. So we may do like every time we do a product launch or a big sale, we'll drive traffic to a, like a landing page to get basically people to the VIP club. Essentially they'll opt in and get part of VIP literally just all I do is opt in.

That's it. And what we'll do is for those people right there, we'll give them some type of bonus for being exclusive. Okay.

So sign up to the VIP list, get one hour early access to the website. And guess what? Now I can go brag on to our friends.

Hey, that, you know, that big brand right there. Well, I'm getting one hour early access. It's nothing like it's nothing special at all.

They didn't pay for it. The brand doesn't own, like doesn't even talk to them or anything like that. Um, it's just the fact that they sent it early access list.

Okay. So we'll do that a lot. Um, there's other ways you can implement exclusiveness, just making people feel exclusive, making people feel in that way.

Um, a Facebook group as well, works really well, makes it feel exclusive, like things like that, that gives people, uh, you know, a little bit better care. Um, you know, if I, if I basically said, Hey, I'm all for mentoring to like five people and you get my favorite, my private phone number, and I'll put you in a group text with other people and you'll get actual questions, not group text. You feel very exclusive than my other students who pay me on a monthly call basis and they can only email me essentially.

So you're just giving people something at some level that makes them feel separated from the crowd, but positioned in a higher authority and higher status level. So you're, you're basically giving people a higher level of status, perceived status in their mind, essentially. So that's what exclusiveness really wants to focus on curiosity.

So this is number six, curiosity, um, curiosity killed the cat every single time. And this is just how we basically sometimes can be very vague with certain things, um, in a way that gives people curious to click on something, enter to unlock, sign up to see. Uh, so like there's different things like that.

Um, just curious, George is what you want to appeal to. So really no direct way to show you exactly how to implement that. But this, this also works really well too, for our email marketing campaigns, where we're getting people to sign up for a specific like landing page or product page and stuff like that, you know, show a product photo, enter to unlocked or sign up to see this new product that we're dropping.

Uh, well now they're curious to click on this landing page now, sign up, and then they get to see this new product. So curious right there, George, essentially is what you want to go after. Now, number seven, this is social proof.

And this is basically in a way, um, it's just probably not like the best terminology to use for this particular one. I almost like to look at this as like a fear of missing out on the other subsequent of fear of missing out, um, or even scarcity as well. So it's probably not the best way I've emulated this to you guys, articulate this one to you guys.

Um, but social proof in a way, this is really, really powerful right here. And it's clearly stating the fact that you don't have enough inventory for people to purchase. And again, this is why scarcity or fear of missing out actually worked better for this, uh, better terminology for this one right here.

Um, but let's say this. So let's say for example, I only have 500 shirts. Okay.

It was limited edition run of shirts. Never come back to the store. There's like 500 of them.

And we've accumulated 3000 emails on our like waiting lists. Well, what we'll do is, is we'll actually clearly articulate that to our customers through Facebook ads and through, um, our email campaigns, our hype building campaigns. Hey, there's 3000 of you guys on our list and there's only 500 shirts.

So you need to be there in the first hour. If you want a shirt, we're going to sell out and we're never coming back on the website again. So what I'm basically doing is I'm increasing that fear of missing out.

And I'm also driving the fact of the scarcity as well. So again, it's why it could be kind of flared into one of those other ones as well. So, Hey, maybe it's only six psychological triggers kind of lied to guys about the seven.

So, but that is powerful right there. And, um, you know, Hey, I'm opening up a mentor shop spot. There's over 500 of you that watch every single one of my videos, every single one of my videos get 500 views.

I'm not 24 hours. I'm opening up a mentor spot and I'm only going to pick five people. So if you want to get on it, like you got to get there quick and you click blink below.

Yeah. So like, that's another way to, of how you can basically use that social proof aspect. So I find don't really lie too much about this.

Uh, you gotta be somewhat level of transparency right here to try not to lie. You know, if you're posting stuff about Facebook, like if you're posting stuff about a big drop and no one's commenting or anything like that on any of your posts, because no one knows about you and you're doing a poor job at it. And you say, Oh, we have over 10,000 people.

And people are like, you don't even have any comments on any of your posts, like on Instagram or your Facebook guys or anything like that. Like how can it be 10,000 people? So it's another thing to look at too as well.

Um, but yeah, really powerful. So really hope you guys enjoyed this video. This again, this is seven psychological triggers.

You guys can drip out through product launches, sales events, and you can try to drip it out in your evergreen. The problem with your evergreen campaigns is that that's what they're for. They're evergreen.

It's supposed to run year round. And if you're constantly running something that's like, Hey, we're closing down in 48 hours and you scale that up, eventually it's going to get repetitive. And you're going to reach so many people that are like, Hey, just people have been lying.

Cause there's that has been running flies two months. So try to, um, be somewhat, um, you know, again, use these for the good, use these to your advantage. Don't lie.

Don't manipulate your customers with them. Like try to be very, uh, you know, authentic with these and guess what it's going to, it's going to do 10 fold because people have higher level of trust that you've used them correctly. Um, and you properly kind of flare them out through your campaigns.

Now, if you are looking for more or hands on approach, I am tinkering around that around with the idea of basically taking all my YouTube videos and kind of putting, putting them in a step-by-step course, just re emulating them in a step-by-step course to where you can either watch all my videos, try to piece it all together, or just have this nice little course that kind of step-by-step of how exactly we get results for clients.
