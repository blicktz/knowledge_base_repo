Is testing new Facebook ads simply just not working for you? You keep launching new creative tests and just quite frankly, you keep ending up in the same rut that you've always been in with poor performance with Facebook ads. Well, today I'll be going over kind of my experience with that, what we've done to basically get out of that kind of like, you know, rut in that case.

So, and if you're curious why I'm currently with you teaching these types of things, well, my name is Nick Therrio. I run a Facebook ads agency. Also, I coach and, you know, mentor a couple students and stuff like that.

Done over $70 million in online revenue for clients with Facebook ads and pretty much share everything to you guys. Literally like completely transparent of exactly what we're doing inside of our agency. Yeah.

So before we get started, hit the like button, hit the subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and let's dive into the video. So you're testing Facebook ads, you're in a rut, performance is down, and you just can't quite seem, or you can't quite seem to get like anything new to convert on Facebook. Look, we've all been there.

I'm in there right now with a few accounts. I've been there like with like over the years, dozens of times, like it's normal. Like first off, I'll just remind you, like it's normal.

Everyone goes through it. Some accounts are harder to crack than other accounts. And quite frankly, we're not perfect here.

All we can do is keep building ads that are based off marketing fundamentals, based off market research, that give us the highest possible chance of performing in the account. And through my experience of being there, I've been able to limit the amount of time now we are in there, in that particular rut. Like when we get in that rut, we're getting out of it significantly faster now than before.

We still experience, that's what I'm saying, like we still experience that rut here and there, but we're getting out of it significantly faster. And ultimately, I want to share with you guys what we found to help us out with that. And quite frankly, the biggest thing for us, and I'm going to start off at high level, and then we'll kind of go a little bit deeper into like tangible practical advice and stuff like that, is testing drastically new things.

So when we get in a rut, you have to understand why you're in a rut. And it's because you're consistently giving Facebook bad inputs. You keep giving Facebook bad assets.

Your creatives, your copy, you're not communicating and connecting with your consumer. There's reasons why those assets are not converting is because they're not great. And you have to remember that on the other side of that ad is a person that's clicking on it.

So likely it is just people are not liking those ads. And if you keep doing that over and over, you're going to get in a rut and you're getting into a longer period of time of bad performance. So if you keep making the same mistake over and over and over and over, ultimately, the objective to be is to take a step back.

If you want a different result, you need to try something drastically different. So this is where I really challenged my team. And even my thinking is like, Hey, if we've been doing this and this, and we've been getting this, then what can we do differently?

Now, this is where we've had a few accounts really take off because we changed up our original objective and kind of our viewpoint of where we're going. And then we completely changed the assets that were giving Facebook, which allowed us to change and like pretty much take off these accounts. We've had one account go from $1,000 a day to $5,000 a day.

We've had one account go from $1,000 a day to $15,000 a day. We've had another account. We've scaled from $17,000 a month to $300,000 per month.

We've had just numerous of other accounts with really amazing success with Facebook. And throughout that period of time, we've gotten into plenty of ruts along the way as we were scaling up. It's just kind of part of the process.

So I want to really open you guys of what we do. Okay. So first thing is that you have to understand that every ad you create, there's a lot of variables within it.

That's why like I get so upset when people are like, Nick, this photo or video work better. I'm like, there's about a hundred different variables. That's going to impact the performance of that video or that photo.

So to me, even say if photo or video works better, it's, it's ignorance in a way. Like it just, it does not make sense. So for me, for example, I might be able to create stunning videos and I can get a video out the park every single time.

Whereas you, you might be terrible at creating videos, but create amazing photos. Photos might work amazing for you. And you're going to have a heavy bias of saying photos work amazing.

Videos do not on Facebook. And then I might have a heavy bias saying, because I've seen it. I've through my own eyes, the videos work better because I can create amazing videos.

Now all of a sudden I have a bias of videos working better. I don't look at it like that at all. All I see is desires across your market.

And how are we appealing to those different desires across your market? So that's number one. If you're taking notes right now, now it's time to start writing down notes.

Every ad consists of a desire, a desire to make more money, a desire to scale your Facebook ads, a desire for creatives that convert, a desire to write captivating copy that sells your product, a desire for a product that you can scale to 10 K a day, a desire to lose weight, a desire to get a girlfriend, a desire to approach that girl you've been looking at all week, a desire to, I don't know, get a Husky. Highly recommend it. I want to sit right here.

Amazing dogs. So there's different desires across your market. If you really pay attention to your market research, you will notice these statements of people, I want this, I want that, I want this, that.

So, so, you know, whatever it's the, I want statements across your market. I want to make a million dollars. I want a Husky.

I want creative second bird. That's people's desires across your marketplace. And you cannot create desire.

You cannot create desire at all, but you can channel desire onto your product. You can be like, Hey, you have the desire to make a million dollars. That's amazing.

Well, let me show you this product because this product right here is a make money online course. And it shows you how to start a course online. That's going to help you make a million dollars.

A million dollars is only selling people. I don't know, whatever it is, like a hundred dollars. No, not a hundred dollars.

They're like, I think it's $250. It's $250 today, like $300 today. You sell this product $300 today.

You know, so, and so, and so like, and then you, you take their desire and you introduce your product to solve that desire. So that's desire. So when I look at ads, I see desires across these ads.

And when I see an ad, the first thing I think of is what desires is appealing to. Now the next stage or like the other variable in your ad is market awareness. Here's the second thing to write down market awareness.

I've got plenty of YouTube videos on this. Now we're, uh, we're doing a, uh, you know, we're, we're launching this new supplement brand right now. So I've been heavy, deep into research for the supplement brand and market awareness.

I'm trying to think of the easiest way to explain it to you guys. It's where are they at in the process of discovering your product in a way. So for example, there's five stages.

There's unaware, there's problem aware, there's solution aware, there's product aware, and there's aware. Aware is the smallest one. This is where a lot of marketers sit at, you know, 20% off my product today.

That's an aware market. It's the smallest possible market. And it's gonna be the smallest market of sales for your business.

But then unaware, these are people that you're convincing to them that they have a problem. Then you're educating them about the problem. Then you're introducing the solution.

So you're taking them through a few different mental hurdles. So for example, you know, maybe like for an unaware market, you, let's see, unaware market, you have resentment. So unaware market, you open up either resentment, big win, like the biggest ones.

So like maybe you have a resentment of every day of how long it takes you to, um, edit your ad account or like optimize your ad account. Well, that's unaware. Now a problem aware market is someone who is currently having bad performance with Facebook ads.

So like right now you're a problem aware market that I just opened up with this title. And now I'm introducing the solution to you guys today. So problem aware market and solution aware market.

So problem aware market, I'm struggling with Facebook ads are like performances down and stuff like that. Well, then a solution aware market would be the solution to that problem or that desire. So, Oh, you're struggling with Facebook ads and everything.

Well, it's because you're not creative testing. You need to be creative testing to improve your Facebook ad performance. So now I'm like, Oh, problem aware.

Here's a problem. You're experiencing bad Facebook performance. Whole solution is, you know, like creative testing.

So if I were to create one ad for unaware, Hey, you have, you know, do you hate, like, do you literally hate having a sit down for like 30 minutes every day and like optimize your ad account? This is a sign that your ad account is too complex and complex ad accounts lead to terrible Facebook ad performance because you have a lot of campaigns competing against each other. Now due to that, you want to introduce account simplification.

So that'll be the solution account simplification. So you need to introduce account simplification. We do this by setting up one campaign in the account and your product aware one campaign in the account and you do this, this, and this, there you go.

So that's kind of going somewhere from unaware to product aware, solution aware, stuff like that. Now, if I were to create a problem where I add, Hey, you know, is your campaign performance terrible right now? Likely it's due to you having too many campaigns in the account.

One way to fix this is by account simplification and introducing the one campaign strategy. Now solution aware one campaign strategy lowers Facebook cost per result by 50%. That's it.

Cause you're solution aware. You want what the product does, but you don't know what the product is. So that's market awareness, different stages of market awareness.

It's different markets. Markets, you have to, you have to keep in mind that each stage of market awareness is like millions of people in each stage. And you're changing up the stage to appeal to different types of people.

So now we have a drastically different desire changes the results, drastically different market awareness changes the result. Just to give you guys heads up real quick. Uh, we were last year, we were, we're still are, uh, but we spent $4.5 million.

So it was one, uh, lead generation accounts. And about halfway through the year, we got stuck out like just a bad CPL, bad cost per result. We went through the rut like everyone has.

And then we took a step back and I was like, Hey, we need to open up an unaware market. We've been spending the last six months and about $3 million in a problem where market, can we open up an unaware market? And what would that do to the business?

And we opened up an unknown market and it tremendously improved CPL. And, um, now we have like unaware ads, prom, where ads solution, where ads, product, where ads and aware ads all within our main ad set in our main CBO campaign, uh, for the OGs who watch this channel and understand how I structure my account. So desires, different desires will produce radically different results.

Uh, different stages of market awareness will produce radically different results as well. And then the next thing I'm gonna cover, cause I would say I really want to dive into market sophistication, but that's like a whole nother, uh, I don't know. I, you guys are OGs though.

I love you guys who are watching this video. So I'll, I'll dive into it for a quick second. Um, market sophistication is a very tough one though.

I will be honest with you guys. And this is positioning the product in a way. Um, and a lot of you guys with e-com that are gonna really struggle with this cause market sophistication is more of a different positioning of the product.

So for example, if I create the ad with the intentions of like, I'm gonna sell you Facebook ads and I go and show you, here's how to set up a Facebook ads campaign. Here's how to do this and this and this. Like you guys wouldn't follow this channel if it was all beginner shit, because there's plenty of YouTube channels that teach beginner.

I understand that entered a high level of market sophistication in the marketplace for YouTube channels. So I only talk about advanced stuff to separate my channel from everyone else because I'm trying to differentiate myself. And so market sophistication in a way is like your unique kind of selling your unique advantage in the marketplace.

And then you have identity, which is like the persona, but it's identity. So it's who's the person you are appealing to the persona and really digging deeper into their identity and, um, you know, make sure you have the right one. Uh, there's been plenty of times where we have the wrong identity in the ad the whole time.

And all we did was change the identity and that substantially increased performance because now people actually resonating with the ads significantly better. Uh, so that's another thing to look at too, is identity. And then lastly, it's just your visuals, your, your visuals.

And again, like everything that we talked about beginning of this video, all of that is going to dictate your visual. So if you're going after a solution aware market and you want to open up, Hey, you know, five or 50% decrease in your CPA with account simplification, then I'll show like a CPA, like a cost per acquisition, literally cut in half and then like show in half. Well, if I want to open up a problem where market, if struggling with Facebook ads, question mark, I'll show like a 1.1 row ads on the screen.

So like there'll be different visuals for each of these desires and market awareness levels, mark sophistication identities and stuff like that. So a lot of this stuff is going to drive your visuals here. So just want fully transparent on that.

So that's all things I'll look at. That's all things that we've tested drastically different. And as allowed us to drastically improve performance for a lot of our accounts.

Now, the key thing here is that you need to keep a record. Now I'm going to turn to my screen right here. I'm going to show you guys something.

This is a Google sheet that quite frankly, I'm not going to give you guys. I'm so sorry. I give you guys so much value that I just, this is the one thing I'm kind of keeping to myself for a little bit and I'm only giving it to my inner circle students, which, you know, mentoring below in the description.

And this particular sheet right here is kind of like our research doc. We go through a lot of stuff, mass desires, features, the benefits, customer avatar, like our identity and all that stuff. Mechanization, not going to cover that.

It's a whole nother video, but you want to keep a doc or Google sheet of all the things you test, because if you can understand everything you test, what's going to eventually happen now is now you can start to draw conclusions. So if I test, you know, the persona of tech savvy individuals and like last five concepts it blows and I try different desires, benefits, positioning on it, angles, stuff like that. And it sucks.

Then maybe we need to change the persona because that all these ads that keep failing is the persona that's, you know, like the same. So we like to log our persona, you know, our identity, our desire, what's the desire we're going after across the market. What's the benefit that achieves that desire?

That's also a big thing as well. Our positioning. So like our market awareness and stuff like that put in there.

And then the angle, this is more of just like the, put this, the headline pattern. So like three reasons why TikTok, maybe buy this. Uh, we have about 30 something in here that, uh, we've gotten, um, like from over the years of like, like advertising and stuff like that.

And the book breakthrough advertising, uh, we pulled all those headline patterns. That's been, you know, literally around since like the 1960s. That's still applies to the day.

And now when we create this ad, we know that this ad needs to appeal to this persona, this desire, this benefit, this positioning, this headline pattern. And due to that, and I'm actually gonna say hook pattern. So it's me, the, the fricking thing that goes across the screen.

So now we can log the results. Hey, was it a winning ad found or because we do everything CBO with DCTs, did that poor spin and great CPA or did that poor spin, poor CPA or did that great spin and poor CPA. So we can figure out what those results were.

And then from there, we can make adjustments based off that for our next batches. Cause again, we want to try to do things drastically different for in a rut. So this has allowed us to kind of stay out of that rut and to be constantly thinking out what's going to improve performance the most.

And also to what's working across the count and what's not. So that's been also something that's been super, super, uh, powerful for us. And again, if you want that doc, it's only available for inner circle students right now.

Uh, just cause I spent a lot of time putting this, get this together, like six, seven months, putting that together. And, um, you know, just trying to keep it exclusive right now. So, um, again, you can create something simple in your Google sheets as well too, if you want, like it's nothing super advanced, uh, but trying to keep it for myself right now.

So yeah, guys. So really hope this video helps you guys out. Uh, kind of give you guys a lot of just me being in that spot and what I've done and what I still do this today to get out of those ruts.

And, uh, it's tremendously helpless a lot. Um, also to just keep in mind, like when you're testing ads about one to two or about two out of 10 ad concepts take off for a business. So we know about 20% of the ads you test take off and that's, that's for advanced marketers, like really good marketers and stuff like that.

That's across like me and my buddies who like own other eight and nine figure agencies or eight, seven, eight figure agencies and stuff like that. Uh, what is working for them? Our average and stuff like that.

We hit about 20% hit rate on ads. So if you know, we hit about 20% hit rate on ads and maybe you're still struggling with marketing fundamentals, like maybe you're only getting like a 5% hit rate for ads. So also too, did you even test enough yet before it's like, Hey, we're in a rut.

So just something else too, to look at, um, and spend a lot of time market research is market research is going to drive desires. Market research will drive a market awareness and stuff like that. So it's been a lot of time market awareness, like a minimum of an hour a day until you're profitable again.

So yeah, guys, really hope this video was valuable to you guys. Hit the like button, hit that subscribe button for new videos every Monday, Wednesday, Friday. And I'll talk to you guys later.

Peace out.
