Yo, what's going on guys Nick here welcome back to the channel today I want to talk about campaign budget optimization aka CBO as we all know it early 2020 Facebook announced they won't start rolling over more accounts to primary CBO and the reason why I say just more accounts not all accounts because Facebook has been so finicky with this update they announced it back in I think like 2018 2019 they were supposedly in September 2019 gonna roll all accounts over CBO and they just did not do anything with that fact the only thing they did was if your account ran primary CBO campaigns they automatically switched you over but they want to start pushing a little bit more pressure now and rolling over more accounts so this video I want to talk to you guys about CBO and a few strategies that we're currently using the CBO is actually very effective if you know how to use it properly with campaign budget optimization the science behind it and why it was rolled out is Facebook believes they can control your budget better at a campaign level than you controlling your budget at an ad set level and delegating where that budget should go in each audience and now at first I was very skeptical about that because I felt like Facebook's one all in control campaign budget optimization has been very effective for me I really gave it a test the past over the past seven days had this new client sign-on we've been struggling with their ads and we finally got this winning product and now we were able to make it even better using CBO campaign so what I did was I simply put in a CBO campaign I was able to quickly take that budget from $100 a day to $1,000 a day on the CBO campaign and not ruin the results because we all know when we're scaling these ad set level budgets it's very hard to scale up really high very quickly without breaking it and crushing your results over the past week I was able to take this store from up three to four hundred dollars a day and scale it up to about forty five hundred dollars a day in revenue primary topic of this video is the strategies we're currently using and how you can implement those in your campaigns so guys let's jump right into it so let's start off at the top of funnel you'll have about two to three different options of what type of audiences you can use number one is just a bunch of single-interest audiences the second one is a bunch of look-alike audiences based off prior data from the Facebook pixel and lastly is a customer file look-alike audience based off customers data previously so you'll have one of those three different options for your top of funnel CBO campaign you simply want to go ahead and create a CBO campaign daily budget is gonna be very different for everyone I tend to work with clients that have a big budget so I can afford to always start off about a hundred two hundred dollars a day even for a test campaign but I understand some of you guys do not have that type of ad spend available simply what you want to do is you want to do a bit of math if you're gonna test about five or six different look-alike audiences or you know ten different interest audiences you simply want to allocate about twenty dollars a day per audience you test let's say you're gonna test five different single interest audiences you want to make sure you multiply that by twenty dollars and you'll have a hundred dollars a day if you only have a forty dollar a day budget I literally limit you down just to two interests so you want to go ahead and create a CBO how to create a conversion campaign campaign budget optimization turn it on load in your daily budget so for me let's say two hundred dollars a day so I want to test ten single interest audiences and then what you want to do is you want to create that ad set call the ad set whatever audience you're targeting that's just for organizational purposes and load in all your data are all your targeting options and under budget and scheduling you should see see more options click on see more options and you can actually change the budget of how it's feeding out to that particular ad set and you want to make sure you put a minimum ad spin of ten dollars so now you got your first ad set created which you want to do now is to load in the creatives I always recommend about doing about four to five different creatives in your CBO campaign if you've never in ads before you want to maybe do about four or five different angles in the ads maybe if it's a new account or maybe if it's a new client do four to five different angles to test see what works best for that brand but if you're very confident and you know what type of angles works for a brand load in four different type of variations of that of that particular angle of how to target people in the creative section then simply what you want to do is you want to duplicate that ad set after your creative is finished so that way you'll have ten different ad sets or five or three depending on how many people how many different audiences you want to test starting out you want to duplicate that ad set however many times and then load in all of your other targeting for those other ad sets and all you want to do is just edit that ad set that you duplicate it boom change the name and then change the audience you want to target your creative should already be in there because like I said you're just duplicating it so now you get those ad sets duplicated and the campaign is live you want to run this campaign for three days that is my rule for all new campaigns I run it for three days a solid 72 hours from the moment it goes live so that way Facebook can properly optimize that campaign test those audiences and then I can go back inside that campaign and figure out which ones are profitable which ones are break even which ones I just need a kill and I'll usually always keep three audiences live I never go below three audiences in a CBO campaign I'll also look at the creatives I honestly do not even turn off the creatives I like to always keep about four to five creatives per audience doing well because if I'm scaling pretty aggressively you know from a hundred dollars a day to a thousand dollars a day and people get burnt out on a particular creative Facebook's gonna cycle those other creatives in front of them test different creatives if the results are going bad I do not want to risk on my budget being in one creative and it just going to shit that day so I like to kind of keep those creatives in there I generally come there maybe cycle in a new creative every now and then by simply sitting create drop a new creative in maybe turn off an old one the next thing to talk about is how do I scale it so there's two different ways you can scale a CBO campaign you can simply duplicate that whole campaign as number one this is popular one I'm not really a fan of it I like to just scale that budget up there's people out there who are simply raising that budget by a hundred percent every day and getting amazing results I did something very similar when I raised up this budget for this particular campaign from a hundred dollars a day to a thousand dollars a day like a hundred dollars a day to two hundred fifty dollars today it's a five hundred dollars a day to seven hundred fifty dollars a day so not a quite full hundred percent then seven thousand dollars a day so you're gonna have to kind of have a feel for the campaign so if you can try a hundred percent I'm not gonna lie when you scale a campaign the next 24 hours like let's say if I scale the campaign today tomorrow the results gonna be alright you know they won't be too great because you know Facebook is has to kind of reoptimize that new budget but the following day is always when it's really booming and doing really well that's something I've noticed as well so you can do I would never recommend more than a hundred percent for us like you know scaling up the CBO campaign you can do around 50 percent every 48 hours or a hundred percent every 48 hours but honestly I would not recommend daily raising up a budget so the next stage is middle funnel for CBO for us and just to kind of define what we call middle funnel it may not be the textbook definition but it's just basically just our warm audiences this is the people who interact with our Facebook page Instagram page website but I haven't really taken any significant action just simply interacted or warm they're aware of the brand and we'll load in three different audiences or four different audiences you know website visitors past 30 days people engaged to Facebook page past 30 days people engaged with the Instagram page past 30 days that's three different audiences right there and again depending on the budget depending on the size of our top of funnel you know for spending a thousand dollars a day on the top of funnel we can easily start off at $100 a day on a middle of funnel campaign so our middle of funnel campaign will use a few different types of creatives in these ad sets really the hottest one is just simply common there and taking existing post line is posting on Instagram and Facebook on a day-to-day basis and linking it to the Shopify product page so let's say you know they take a picture and you know we don't have a lot of clothing clients so let's say they have like a black shirt you know they take a picture hey this new black shirt plain basic tea now you know it just went up live here's the link boom they'll get a lot of organic comments and stuff on that and what those will come there will load in that as a creative in our middle funnel so in this campaign we'll have four to five different products per ad set but all the same products for all assets you have to update it pretty frequently in terms of the ad creatives and stuff just because your risk higher chance of ad fatigue I can't tell you exactly the time frame you got to update these creatives it's simply gonna have to have a feel for it if you start to notice a big decline how they're performing they start going pretty good they do pretty good for quite a few days and also you see a big decrease and they're not coming back up then you want to update those creatives and stuff so now for the bottom of funnel campaign what I'll do is I'll load in four different audiences and the creatives again same creators for all of them and like said it's just more engaging content stuff that's gonna build trust with people who had high intent to buy with the brand and again these audiences we're gonna target or add to cart three days but didn't purchase add to cart seven days but didn't purchase check out initiated three days but didn't purchase check out initiated seven days but didn't purchase and I said I'll load in the same creatives for all of them these types of creatives will be like customer selfies with the product boxing videos just different things that can target the motives and beliefs of these buyers that can get them to buy and complete their purchase you know whatever limiting belief that prevented them from buying or maybe they need a little bit more of a motive to fix that problem in their life so that's pretty much everything of what we're currently doing for CBO right now I'm very excited for this update because like I said it's worked well for us over the past month two months of us finally started testing it inside my agency with my clients I'm very excited for this feature and I talked a lot about a lot of information
