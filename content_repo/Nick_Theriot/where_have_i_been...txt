patience That is a wrap Hello there friend Currently back home, sipping my smoothie I need to hurry up and take care of the clothes, shower and stuff And we'll see you guys in a few, after I get ready to go to Sushimasa I think last week I was in pretty bad mental space I felt like, I don't know, it was just like anxiety Like it just felt like, ugh, like weight on my chest Someone just sitting on my chest with just everything going on Between news and media and stuff, all the, everything that's going around that Then also too, there's just the business and everything The vlog, just a lot It was just overwhelming me And I had to literally kind of pull back for a second To kind of reevaluate everything Because that's essentially what I do If I'm feeling bad If I'm, you know, things not going the way I need it to go I pull back, I bust out my handy dandy notebook And I do a lot of writing And just thinking out, working out the problems In my life on paper itself So, so a lot going on And with the agency itself I kind of ran into this issue Where I wasn't really taking on Or wasn't, you know, I had a sales process issue It's just the issue that's been struggling with my agency for a while And that's the selling side I have two six figure clients Both of, both of those clients scaled up to six figures a month I brought on two new clients One actually had to refund his first month of work Due to me just not being much of the results This particular client Amazing client and stuff Just my strategies and stuff Just will not work for his business So, refund his payment So that was kind of like a big hit to me But also too, like it felt good doing it Because I know that it's going to pay itself back in the long run So, the agency kind of hit last week And also too, trying to refine my sales process Selling, like I said, is a big thing That's been a problem with my agency And for me, I've been getting a lot of leads from YouTube itself From videos like this So, a big weight on me was Okay, I really like where the vlog is going But at the same time Just start uploading more Facebook ads content More marketing content More content going around clothing brands and stuff Because I truly feel a lot more Like I'm following my purpose in life When I upload those type of stuff Whereas the vlog is just something kind of fun Kind of cool I just, I feel like I'm going nowhere with it In the sense of an actual purpose and accomplishment Is purely a hobby And then the vlog at the same time Is cutting into my work hours Which I'm going to get into the next little thing we'll talk about So, right now I'm trying to work on a system and stuff To automate the sales Automate leads and stuff Appointment booking and stuff like that for my agency As well as one of my older sales reps Since it's quarantine He kind of went kind of in the dark for a while He's back in action So I'm working on creating a full course for him And kind of refining our sales pipeline But that's a lot of stuff that's been going on with the agency But then the vlog It's like I said It's right now where I'm trying to bring myself As this Facebook ads expert In the clothing niche Specifically in like the streetwear niche and stuff And then also to try to create like some YouTube content as well So I will be coming and taking a turn a little bit with the YouTube content I'm going to do some vlogs But it's going to be like when I have something going on Because guys I sit down at my computer all day I go to the gym Come back Maybe I can record maybe a workout or two a month Or maybe one workout a week Where I still want to vlog certain things Certain accomplishments And as things go by But not every day you're going to see tremendous progress That's worth to be shown to the public So there's a lot of behind the scenes stuff That's just little accomplishments everyday For me an accomplishment today was landing a call with a really cool brand So cool But what am I vlogging about that? Am I going to make a whole vlog around Hey just landed a cool call And then you know What am I going to do with that? So that's definitely an issue But I do want to keep the vlog up I just want to make it more centered around cool stuff that's happening Versus just me trying to pour something out And at the same time I want to also incorporate more Facebook ads and marketing content Because the vlog actually goes into my work time on my agency And like I said that's something else I'm going to go into next I feel like last week and the weeks before Really ever since I moved into my apartment I feel like my work ethic kind of actually went down a little bit I feel like that leveled up in life And now I just got comfortable Comfortable where I'm at And that's usually something that's typically going to happen So you're going to level up in life You're going to see a little bit of a drawdown And the reason you're going to see that drawdown Is because you got comfortable with that new level And you stopped putting in the work that got you to that level So you're going to have a little bit of a drawdown And then as soon as you start realizing that drawdown You're going to start feeling that immense pressure and everything That immense just You know I hate where I'm at I love where I'm at Don't take it wrong But just like Okay shit Something you know Stuff's starting to go south a little bit So you need to push and you know Get back on the throttle to get to that next level So essentially that's kind of where I'm at right now Kind of let my workout have to go down Just you know I'm working four hours a day Two hours at that four hours a day I'm working on YouTube content The other two hours I'm managing a few ads For about an hour and a half And I have 30 minutes To kind of fuck around with a few emails And then boom I'm not reaching out to people I'm not saying cool video bitches out I'm not reaching out I'm following people etc Agency's not growing And I'm completely reliant on You know some YouTube videos from a while back To give me leads So that needs to be changed So essentially this week Starting yesterday I kind of doubled down on my schedule Waking up early again Woke up this morning at 6 o'clock Tomorrow I'll be waking up at 5.50 Just because I need about 10 extra more minutes Went straight to the gym Got my workout in early Came home Cold shower Meditated And then finally 8 and then 9 o'clock From 9 o'clock to 5 p.m.
