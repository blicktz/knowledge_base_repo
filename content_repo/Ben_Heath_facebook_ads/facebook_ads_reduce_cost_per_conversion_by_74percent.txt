Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to get better results from Facebook ads and specifically I'm going to show you how to reduce your cost per conversion by 74% with just one tip. I know it sounds too good to be true that you could just make one change to your Facebook ad campaigns and see a 74% decrease in your cost per conversion but it isn't. I'm going to show you exactly how in just a minute.

Now before I get into that I just want to quickly ask for you to smash a like on this video, hit that like button and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already that really helps me out. Okay so how are we going to get a 74% reduction in cost per conversion by making just one change right? That's what I'm going to show you how to do in this video.

So I'm in an example Facebook ad account right now. I'm going to create an example account and get to the point at which you can make this one change. If you aren't familiar with how to get into ads manager, how to get into a Facebook ad account, just when you're in your Facebook profile there'll be a little black downwards arrow in the top right hand side.

Click on that in the drop down menu there'll be manage adverts, create adverts, manage ads, create ads, something like that. Click on that you should be brought through to something that looks very very similar to what I'm looking at right now which is Facebook's ads manager. Okay so there are no campaigns in here yet as I said because it's an example Facebook ad account.

So let's go ahead and call this example Facebook campaign and now I'm not going to focus on any of the other details because this video is about one specific change, one tip that can make all the difference to how your Facebook ad campaigns perform and as I said reduce your cost per conversion by an enormous amount and that is your campaign objective. Now you see that when you create an example Facebook ad campaign the default objective is traffic and traffic is designed to get as much traffic as possible. You know what it's the name of the objective really gives away what it's designed to do.

So if you run a Facebook ad campaign with the traffic objective Facebook will put your ads in front of the clickiest people, the people that are most likely to click on your ads on Facebook, Instagram, come through to your website, your landing page, wherever it is that you're sending people. Okay if you were to change that campaign objective from the default from traffic to conversions which if you know my you know if you've been following my stuff for a while you know that I'm a huge fan of using the conversions objective this can have an absolutely enormous difference in the results that you see when you run your Facebook ad campaigns. So by changing to conversions and you need to have the Facebook pixel installed on your website your landing page in order to use the conversion objective and you need to set up event code to let Facebook know exactly what a conversion looks like as in when someone reaches the thank you page they're a conversion and and I've got a video that shows you exactly how to set up the Facebook pixel all that stuff so check out the video description of this video you're watching right now there will be a link in there to another video showing you exactly how to set up the Facebook pixel if you haven't done so already but if you change your campaign objective to conversions Facebook will optimize your campaign for conversions so instead of with the traffic objective Facebook putting your ads in front of the people that are most likely to click which you know is useful we all want more website traffic but probably what you really want at the end of the day is a conversion it's a lead it's a purchase it's the the action that generates revenue for your business or for your clients business if you're running ad campaigns for clients and that is to get them to convert so instead of Facebook finding the clickiest people like they do with traffic they will find the people that are most likely to convert so let's say you're advertising to an audience of a million people well there may be 50 000 people in that audience that are most likely to convert by using the conversions objective Facebook is able to work out exactly who those people are and they're able to optimize for those people and it's not just you know the conversion objective a lot of people will say things like well if I'm what if I'm retargeting should I use reach instead of conversions because I know they're the people I want to be advertising to and I want to reach as many of them as possible I would say no I would say go with conversions still because there's more to the conversions objective than just working out who within your target audience is most likely to purchase or become a lead but basically most likely to convert it also does things like um what time of day are they most likely to convert you know people might click on your ads a lot if you use a tracking objective in let's say the morning before work perhaps they don't convert they're not going to go through the whole process because they're busy rushing around they just looked at their phone whilst having breakfast etc etc maybe they're much more likely to convert let's say 6 p.m to 9 p.m when they've got more time and they're at home okay well if you use the conversion objective facebook is going to work that out and deliver your ads during times of day that you are more likely to see conversions they're also going to optimize for things like placements so if you're seeing you know within your ad account you can see that there are more conversions coming from instagram stories or from facebook feeds facebook is going to direct your budget so that they spend more of your budget and deliver more of your ad impressions on placement options that are converting well so the conversion objective um helps facebook optimize your campaigns on so many different levels to get you conversions and that is why on average and i spoke to my facebook rep um very very recently about this and i knew this was the case i knew the conversions produce much better results than traffic but i had no idea the extent to which it did this but on on average conversions reduces cost per conversion by 74 in comparison to traffic so if you run two identical campaigns whether it's you know campaign that's designed to sell products for your e-commerce store or it's a campaign designed to generate leads for you know service-based business if you run a traffic campaign alongside a conversions campaign then you will see a 74 reduction in cost per conversion with the conversions campaign versus traffic campaign i mean that is absolutely enormous that's talking about taking your cost per lead from let's say 20 to five dollars you know or your cost per purchase from um a hundred dollars to twenty dollars uh no from a hundred dollars to twenty six dollars and we're talking about enormous differences absolutely enormous differences so when i see a lot of people say um postings in my group or answer you know my facebook group or answer post questions comments on my youtube channel they'll say things like i'm generating tons of clicks but people aren't purchasing and nearly always i would say to them you're using the traffic objective aren't you using the traffic objective you need to be using the conversions objective okay now there's lots of people and i'm sure lots of people watching this video will be aware that the conversions objective is the better option they probably weren't aware that it can produce a 74 reduction in cost per conversion on average which is just absolutely phenomenal i ran this experiment it must have been two two and a half years ago and i think we saw a 40 reduction in cost per purchase from the conversions objective versus traffic now the average is up to 74 and that's because facebook's platform is improving all the time there's tons of very very smart engineers at facebook that are trying to improve their machine learning process and get it to be more efficient and more effective because they know that's going to make our campaigns as facebook advertisers more effective and that's going to convince us to spend more money on the platforms they're very much incentivized to get us the best results possible and that's what they're doing by improving their machine learning and that's why the difference you're seeing between traffic and conversions is so huge but anyway my original point where i was going with that was that a lot of people are aware that the convergence objective is more important than traffic and where you want to be but they are under the misconception that you cannot run a conversions campaign with a brand new ad account or if you're going to be generating less than 50 conversions a week now if there's anything i achieve in the facebook advertising space it's that i want to convince people that you can run a conversions campaign with a brand new ad account with a brand new pixel and you can also run a conversions campaign very successfully if you're generating less than 50 conversions a week yes facebook would like more than 50 conversions a week in order to be able to optimize the campaign fully but here's the thing a partially optimized conversions campaign that's generating say 10 15 conversions a week is going to outperform a traffic campaign that is fully optimized because as we said the difference between traffic and conversions is 74 an absolutely enormous difference between the two and so you know let's say your partially optimized conversion campaign doesn't quite generate a 74 reduction in cost per conversion versus traffic perhaps it's a 50 or a 45 reduction in cost per conversion versus traffic but that's still absolutely huge a 50 reduction means you're paying half as much in terms of your cost per purchase cross per lead etc so with brand new ad accounts with no pixel history no campaigns running um even with small budgets if you want conversions if that's what you really want go ahead and use the conversions objective we do it all the time and then when you're optimizing for a conversion event go for the conversion event you want don't go for add to cart or initiate checkout or view content or one of the higher level ones because you think you need more conversions just go for purchase or go for lead or go for the end conversion the action that you want people to take facebook's machine learning is getting more and more and more sophisticated to the point where you really want to benefit from putting facebook on your side and just telling them hey facebook this is exactly what i want i want conversions this is what a conversion looks like please go out and get me some conversions so um really i mean you know this whole video has been around this this one tip and i i sort of thought about it talking to my facebook rep the other day and thinking you know isn't this insane that 74 reduction in cost per conversion i mean that could be the difference between you not being able to run a facebook ad campaign profitably and you being able to spend a million dollars a year on facebook ads very profitably and scale a multi-million dollar a year business i mean that is absolutely huge so please please use the conversion objective the only extra step you need to take is to install the facebook pixel as i said i've got a video for that it'll be in the video description so go ahead and check that out now before you go a couple of free facebook advertising related resources that i want to quickly talk about the first is my facebook group so

your revenue now in this webinar i've broken down basically three sales funnels that we use for our clients all the time we generated millions of dollars using these sales funnels they're very much tried and tested um and i've broken these down into their component parts i sort of explained right if you've got this type of business you want to use this sales funnel and this sales funnel has these three steps here's how you implement them and if you've got this type of business you want to use this sales funnel this one's got two steps and this how you implement them so no matter what sort of business you have you know e-commerce service digital etc etc i strongly recommend you check out this webinar again completely free there'll be another link to it in the video description it's about 70 minutes long would so strongly recommend you go through this i think one of the biggest mistakes i see people make when it comes to facebook advertising other of course than using the traffic objective or the engagement objective or something like that instead of conversions which we now know is a huge mistake but other than that it's using the wrong sales funnel you know if you use a sales funnel that works really well for um a thousand dollar courses but you sell a 20 e-commerce product or you sell a 50 000 service it's not going to work you need the right sales funnel for your business so that's what this webinar is all about completely free check it out the link is in the video description if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up smash smash that like button
