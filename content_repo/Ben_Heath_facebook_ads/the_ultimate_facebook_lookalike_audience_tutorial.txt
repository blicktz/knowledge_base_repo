Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and this video is going to be the ultimate Facebook lookalike audience tutorial. I'm going to show you exactly how to create lookalike audiences, all different types of lookalike audiences, how to set them up properly, how to get the most out of them because Facebook lookalike audiences really are an amazing feature. It's one of the best things about Facebook advertising.

When we're running Facebook ad campaigns for our clients, we're always using lookalike audiences and they very consistently deliver the best results when it comes to cold audience targeting on Facebook. So if you're looking to get great results from Facebook, you absolutely want to be using lookalike audiences and this video is going to show you how you do that and how to get the most out of them. Now just quickly before I get into the steps, for those of you that aren't aware thinking what is a lookalike audience, a lookalike audience consists of a group of people that are very very similar to another group of people.

So I'll give you an example. So let's say for example you've got a thousand people on an email list. You could upload that email list to Facebook and that then becomes your source audience for your lookalike.

You then create a lookalike audience based off that source audience, based off your email list and what Facebook will do is they will work out who within your target location is most like the people on your email list. And this is a fantastic targeting option because the people that are very similar to people on your email list are highly likely to buy, become leads, etc, etc. Okay and there are lots of different types of lookalike audiences but you see the sort of thing I'm talking about.

If you can advertise to people that are very similar to the people that you've already done business with, well then your targeting is very very accurate and as a result very very effective. So as I said we use them all the time, you absolutely want to be using them in your Facebook ad campaigns and this video is going to show you how to create them, how to get the most out of them. Okay with that said let's get into it.

So I'm in an example ad account right now, I'm in ads manager and to create a lookalike audience or any sort sort of custom audience you need to first click on these three little lines up here in ads manager or you know if you see squares instead there are various different formats. But what you want to do is you want to select audiences and I said your window might look slightly different just make sure you find it. Okay so now that we're in audiences you can see there's various audiences that have been created as I said this is an example ad account for me to create these sorts of videos.

Ignore all this stuff here, there's nothing you need to worry about right now, you may have things in there if you've played around with this before you may have nothing, either way is absolutely fine. Now when I talk about different types of lookalike audiences there are lookalike audience settings, I'm going to get to those a little bit later, but when I'm talking about types of lookalike audiences what I'm referring to the different types of source audience. Okay now if you create a lookalike audience based off of previous customers that is very different to a lookalike audience based off people that have watched a video of yours on Facebook.

Okay and the source audience contains very different people which means the lookalike audience is going to contain different people and the results that you get advertising to those different lookalike audiences are going to be quite different in a lot of cases. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how to create a number of different lookalike audiences and I'm also going to rank them. Okay so I'm going to start with what I feel are the most effective lookalike audiences because as I said not all lookalike audiences are created equal.

A lookalike audience based off previous customers is usually much much more effective than a lookalike audience based off of video viewers because you want to target people that are very similar to people that have worked with you before and bought from you before as opposed to someone who has just watched a video of yours on Facebook. Buying something from you is a much much larger commitment and a much greater signifier that they're a good prospect and you want to advertise to people just like them. Okay so with that said let's get started.

So what you want to do is you want to click create audience and to create a lookalike we first need to create a custom audience. So custom audiences I've got a tutorial on custom audiences I'll include that in the video description below but it refers to basically groups of people that have interacted with your business before that know you. So custom audiences can be things like an email list, website visitors, people who've interacted with you on Facebook, all sorts of different things.

So let's assume that we're going to start with the most effective lookalike audience and that's one based off of previous customers. So I'm going to go here and select customer list. Now this process is fairly straightforward you can see Facebook's just telling you here about the various identifiers that people are going to match.

I'll explain more about that in a second but you can just go ahead and click next. Now depending on how your customer list is constructed you may or may not have customer values. So for example if you've got all your customers stored on a on an excel document for example and one of the columns assigns a value, a sales value.

You know this customer bought $400 worth, this customer bought $240 worth, that sort of thing. If that's the case great you can include that information in the list that you upload to Facebook and Facebook will weight those that have spent more with you more heavily. Okay which is a really good thing because not only do you want to advertise to a lookalike audience that contains people that are similar to your previous customers but why not have that weighted towards the higher value customers and therefore the higher value prospects.

It's an absolute no-brainer but I appreciate not everyone's going to have that so I'm going to select no. If you do select yes all you need to do is let Facebook know when you upload your list which column is the value column. Fairly straightforward.

So I'm going to click no and I'm going to click next. Now I need to upload the file or I can select this option and simply copy and paste in data and it really depends on you know your specific setup how you've got your data in there. Okay so I'm obviously not going to copy and paste in actual data into here and I can't do that for privacy reasons.

What I've actually done is I've just prepared a little csv file that I'm going to upload to demonstrate this example email list pop it in there. Then you just need to give your audience a name so you can see it's automatically put it in as example email list. I mean technically this is supposed to be a customer list because that's the most effective Facebook lookalike audience so I've gone with I'll rename it example customer list and then I click next.

Now what you need to do is you need to map the identifier. So you basically need to tell Facebook okay this column in this document refers to email addresses. This column refers to first name.

This column refers to phone number. Now the most important identifier to match is email address because that's what Facebook uses to basically correlate your um what the data on your list with someone's actual Facebook account because that's how they're going to be able to identify who that person is both for retargeting in a custom audience sense but also for then creating a lookalike audience from Facebook basically needs to take your data and email list and work out who is on there you know which Facebook users are these people so email address is the most common one but the more identifiers you can match the better so you can see they've automatically mapped email and action needed here so I could tell that there's Ben so I could say that that's a first name okay so and if you depending on how much information you have on your list you want to go through all the identifiers and match as many as possible the more you can match the better chance Facebook has of working out who the particular person is and the higher your match rate the more people be in your source audience your custom audience and that will make your lookalike audience that much more accurate okay so now I'm just going to click upload and create and that is something that uh Facebook is going to usually take I don't know 20 30 minutes to populate if you've got a larger list sometimes it would do it immediately but for the time being I'm going to move on and create a lookalike audience based off of the custom audience so now I'm going to click create a lookalike you see Facebook presents you with this window straight away customer list has information set it gets loaded so we've created the custom audience created the source audience and now we can select create a lookalike audience and you can see that our source here look select your lookalike source is example customer list and now we're creating our lookalike and lookalikes are very very simple really the the the more challenging part is probably in creating the custom audience in the first place but what we need to do is work out which locations we want to target and then the size of the audience so the locations is usually fairly straightforward what countries do you advertise in okay so for example if I wanted to advertise in the United Kingdom which is obviously where I'm based then I could put that in there if I wanted to target the US I could enter that as an option etc etc now one thing I'll quickly mention because I get this question quite a lot is if you're a local business because Facebook wouldn't for example doesn't allow you to enter small locations like it does in an ad set level in a campaign at this level but that's absolutely fine you can create a for example countrywide lookalike audience across the UK and then at the ad set level add in your location targeting criteria and then Facebook will only target people that are in this lookalike audience and also within your specific location so let's say you know if you were just wanting to advertise around a particular city let's say Birmingham in the UK for example that's your area of operation that's where you want to advertise but you want to take advantage of a lookalike audience that's how you do it you create a lookalike audience nationwide and then at the ad set level you get more specific with your location targeting and it acts as an and function people targeted need to be in your lookalike audience and within that target location okay then you need to select your audience size now this will depend on where you're advertising so for most businesses getting started in a country like the UK a one percent is absolutely fine because one percent refers to the one percent of Facebook users in this country that are most like my source audience so for example we've uploaded an example customer list who are the one percent of Facebook users in the UK that are most similar to the people on my example customer list okay does that make sense so a lookalike audience in the UK a one percent lookalike audience will always have about 450 000 people because there are roughly 45 million Facebook users in the UK in the US there's about 250 million Facebook and Instagram users in the US therefore a one percent lookalike audience is going to contain about 2.5 million people so the percentage that you select very much depends on the size of the location in which you're advertising so in a country like the UK 450 for most businesses is absolutely large enough to get started for most businesses in the US a one percent lookalike audience is absolutely fine as well you can go with 2.5 million not a problem if you're advertising to a country with a much smaller population so let's say like New Zealand or Ireland or something then you're going to want a larger percentage lookalike because you want your audience to be larger likewise if you're going to be advertising on a localized basis um so let's say go back to my example of the area around Birmingham it would be very important to not select one percent but to go with something closer to ten percent because if it's 4.5 million across the entire country when I then get really specific and just go with the Birmingham area that might come down to half a million for example okay so look local audiences or smaller countries you want a larger percentage otherwise getting started with something like a one percent is absolutely fine I've actually created a whole video about Facebook audience size and so I'll include a link to that in the video description below so if you're wondering how big should my audiences be etc etc I'd recommend checking that out that will clear up a lot of things for you but as I said for most people absolutely fine with a one percent in most countries okay let's go ahead and click create lookalike and it's telling us that our source audience is too small you need to have at least a hundred people in the same country and I knew it was going to do that and I wanted that to come up because that's an important thing for you to be aware of when you are creating Facebook lookalike audiences now we just created a dummy list with one person in so this clearly isn't going to work and in order to create a lookalike audience as Facebook is saying here you need a source audience so your base your customer list etc needs to have at least 100 people in it in the same country so let's say you're getting started a lookalike audience based off of previous customers is probably not something you can use right now and that's okay everyone has to start without that obviously but once you have 100 customers definitely come in and create this lookalike audience and I'm going to show you in a minute there are other lookalike audiences on Facebook that you'll be able to use quicker because you rack up 100 in in one individual country a lot faster than purchases okay but I'm going to um close this down because Facebook is not going to let me do it with that example customer list but all you would do is just click create audience and then your audience is ready right let's also take a look at a few other um types of lookalike audiences so we've started with so remember to create a lookalike you first need to create a custom audience so click create audience custom audience and we've already added in a customer list now I used customer list there but you could also use an email list so let's say for example you only have 50 people on a customer list people have actually bought but you might have 500 on an email list people have just opted in for a lead magnet or something like that well you can't create a lookalike audience yet from your customer list therefore you're going to have to create a lookalike audience from your email list for the time being the steps to do that are exactly what I just demonstrated it's exactly the same process so you just click customer list but instead of uploading a list of customers you just upload a list of email subscribers in exact same manner that I just did okay and all the email providers things like MailChimp by the way you can just export the csv um to then be able to upload straight into Facebook in fact MailChimp have a direct link so it's even easier but if you're using something else then you can um set that up very quickly and easily so that's basically one category you've got customer list email list and then we're going to move on to some others and by the way that's what how I would rank them so the absolute best performing lookalike audience is one based off previous customers the next one down so number two in terms of results is a lookalike audience based off of people on your email list and then number three is a lookalike audience based off of website visitors that's the next one I go to and how do you create one of those so obviously when you come in to create a custom audience you want to select website now in order to be able to do this you will need to have the Facebook pixel installed on your website so I'll include a link in the video description below to another video and that shows you exactly how to install the Facebook pixel on your website make sure all of that is set up but provided it is and people are visiting your website and Facebook's tracking it you can create lookalike audiences based off people that have visited your website which is again a pretty good lookalike audience to create not as good as off previous customers because someone who visits your website isn't as good a prospect as someone who has bought from you therefore advertising people that are similar to them isn't as good as advertising to people that are similar to people who have bought from you and but it's still a pretty good audience to start with okay so there are lots of things you can do um very specifically with website visitors for creating lookalike audiences so I'm going to start with the most simple so one thing I would recommend you start with particularly if you're getting started with this you don't have tons of website traffic it's just create the largest source audience possible right so you want to go ahead and select all website visitors in the last 180 days okay that's going to give you the largest source audience and remember where possible the larger the source audience the better because a larger source audience gives Facebook more data with which to create a very accurate lookalike audience so for example let's say we've got 300 website visitors versus 10 000 website visitors we create a lookalike audience based off of each group's chunks of those people the 10 000 is going to be a better performing source for a lookalike audience because Facebook just has a lot more data and they can draw conclusions and work out aha that type of person really likes this stuff let's have let's find people like that okay so because of that it's also good to be aware that lookalike audiences improve over time so the more people you add to your source audience the better your lookalike audience will perform so for most people getting started I would recommend keeping it simple and going with all website visitors in the last 180 days but you can be more specific so if for example um you had different product ranges on your website well one thing you could do is you could select people who visited specific web pages and you could enter in something specific so for example I could pop in you know my url which is my website leadgo.co.uk and I could pop in something like seo okay because we now offer seo services as a business so perhaps I just wanted to create a custom audience of people who visited the seo related web pages on our website and I wanted to create a lookalike audience out of those people because I want to specifically advertise seo services as opposed to our facebook advertising services so if you want to get more segmented you can absolutely do it when you select people who visited specific web pages just be careful with this url here so I've done url contain so for example I could literally just use seo and that will then include anyone that visits a page on a website that includes the word seo you can also do url equals if I wanted to put in a specific url to a specific page or a range of pages okay um but for what I've just described contains and seo will work absolutely fine now there are other things you can do here you can include more people exclude people so for example you can include people that have purchased um exclude people that have done other things you know perhaps visited your website a bunch but not done anything you can get very very creative with that I'm not going to get too bogged down in that for the purposes of this video because it's all about lookalike audiences that is covered in my custom audiences tutorial which is going to be in the video description as everybody mentioned so check that out so let's go back um so you could get more specific if we wanted to just advertise seo as I mentioned and there'll be lots of businesses that tick this sort of box I'm sure but let's say I just wanted to go with all website visitors because that's what I'd recommend starting with so I'm going to go ahead and call this something like all website visitors 180 okay I want to keep it very simple know exactly what this is and then I'm going to click create audience and you'll see that the same window will come up so I can then click create a lookalike I can enter in my source audience here um now this is a good thing to demonstrate Facebook have not automatically entered in the name of my source audience in there okay so I'm going to need to type it in um when I do so I try to go to type in all website visitors you will see that Facebook has value-based sources and other sources value-based sources is what I mentioned previously whereby you're creating a custom audience where the people in that custom audience are assigned a value so like the customer list where there's a column for sales per customer sales value per customer most of the time that's not going to be the case you need to select other sources then you can see I've got here all website visitors 180 I've obviously created this previously as a demonstration but you can see it there also 180 so I've popped that in specifically because Facebook didn't automatically upload it okay then countries or regions is exactly the same but let's just uh let's go ahead and make this one in the us and then we've got our one percent you can see yeah 2.4 million in the us then I click create audience and there we go now you can see over here that Facebook is populating my custom audience this all website visitors 180 and then it's also populating the the lookalike audience that's based off of that source audience so I said that's going to take 20 to 30 minutes something along those lines but is um you know absolutely fine don't worry about it just come back when you're ready and go ahead so that's another type of lookalike audience website visitors and there's all sorts of things you can create off that now in terms of using lookalike audiences to get great results those three are the ones that we use the vast majority of the time lookalike audience based off of previous customers lookalike audience based off of an email list and lookalike audience based off of website visitors now there are lookalike audiences that you can create aside from those three that um will work reasonably well and are good to get started with if you don't have any previous customers anyone new email list or any website visitors so I'll show you how to do those so again same process create lookalike audience create audience custom audience and we've already dealt with these two right we've done customer list and website and there's lots of things you can do within those two but we've sort of covered them broadly now there are lots of different options here I'm going to focus on the most uh commonly used because that's going to be most useful for most people video is one that's very commonly used so if I select video I can now create a custom audience based off people that have viewed a video of mine so I could for example so okay let's go through the steps so the first thing you need to do is select engagement okay you can create a custom audience for people who have watched three seconds of your video of more ten seconds um or these higher percentages you know people who've watched at least 95 now the way you need to work this out is that audience here people who have viewed at least three seconds if you've been running a video ad or something like that it's going to be the largest audience by far much larger than these other ones because you know loads of people have watched three seconds of your video but the negative to that is that just because someone's watched three seconds of your video doesn't mean that they're a good prospect and doesn't mean that you should create lookalike audiences based off of that prospect or those prospects because it doesn't mean they're interested in your stuff 95 is going to be the complete opposite those people are really into your stuff they are much better prospects with which to create a lookalike audience from but that audience is going to be much much smaller and you're probably going to need to run a video ad longer to be able to use that as a targeting option if you are wanting to get started with video which is not an option i use a huge amount but one to get started with if you're getting started i think about 25 is the sweet spot then you want to go and select choose videos and then simply scroll through your videos and select one that you know meets the the criteria you can even select them all you can go through and select every single video and be like i want to source audience to create contain people that watch any of my videos perhaps specific ones so for example i could be like ah i want anyone who's watched more than 25 of that video is probably really interested in my stuff therefore i'm going to use that one only and these are all untitled videos because they're their lives that i've done in my facebook group in case you were interested okay so i selected that one but as i said you could select one video lots of videos it's up to you then you need to choose how far into the past this works so is it people that have watched within the last 30 days within the last 365 days etc etc when it comes to creating custom audiences that are then going to be used as as source audiences to create look-alike audiences i'm a big fan of making the audiences as large as possible because that gives facebook more data with which to create a more accurate look-alike so 365 is the maximum and that's what i'm going to use so i could have for example here i could have video viewers uh 365 okay something very very simple like that and then click create audience and then you will see that the exact same process happens um so it says it's going to take 30 minutes no problem and they've actually given me a slightly different uh window here which is quite useful and quite interesting and but to create the look-alike audience now you want to select expand your audience and you can see we've been presented with the exact same uh options okay so we've got video viewers is our source for our look-alike we want to target the united states one percent is absolutely fine and we click create audience okay so that's how you do it with video viewers i'm sure you can sort of think through the applications you can see those populating a couple of other options one is you click create audience and custom audience is to do it based off of people who have interacted with you on either facebook or instagram so these are very very similar i'll show you instagram quickly so let's say that you've got a good instagram following okay you think that would be a good source audience with which to create a look-alike this would be particularly effective if you're advertising a lot on instagram well you come into this window here and then again you've got some various different options so you can have people that have visited your profile people who've engaged with a post or ad etc etc again same as before when it comes to creating a source audience for a look-alike i like my custom audiences to be as large as possible therefore i would recommend starting with anyone who engaged with your business as the source for your look-alike if you have tons of instagram followers yes you could select one of the other options but that's what i get started with and then again into the past i'm going to go 365 days okay so fairly fairly straightforward and then i just need to name this audience so i could call this probably instagram engages 365 create audience and then you can see create a look-alike exactly the same and let's do exactly the same keep everything consistent so it all makes sense okay and by the way what i just showed you is exactly the same with a facebook page engaged as well so i said instagram business profile and facebook page if i select facebook page look it's exactly the same options that you've got here okay i mean there's a few more options down here because the platform's slightly different but it works exactly the same okay so i'm just going to click back off there so those are two options you can create custom audiences based on people who've engaged with you on facebook create custom audiences based on people who've engaged with you on instagram and then use those to create uh look-alike audiences again not something that we use a lot video viewers based look-alike audiences and the instagram and facebook engages based look-alike audiences are definitely in a sort of second tranche below our top tier which is look-alikes based off of um customer list look-alikes based off of email address and look-alike based off of website visitors so be aware this is the next run down but as i've already said if you don't have previous customers if you don't have an email list if you don't have much website visitors but you have been doing some stuff on facebook and instagram advertising videos then this is a really good option to um to use and potentially focus on so the last type of facebook look-alike audience that i'm going to show you how to create in this video is one based off of lead forms so if i go ahead and select this option here so if you're running a lead generation campaign and a lead generation campaign is simply a facebook advertising campaign whereby when someone clicks on the ad instead of being taken through to your website or your landing page they are kept on facebook and they can enter in their details via a form on facebook become a lead and then you can follow up with them as a business now obviously with that campaign structure people are going to interact with your lead form they're going to open it they're going to submit it and you may want to create a custom audience out of people that have taken those actions and then create a look-alike audience based off of those people okay so um if you're running lead generation campaigns this is a great option to use a great way to uh create look-alike audiences based off people who have taken the action you want people to take and that's therefore going to help you with your future marketing efforts okay so just like with the other types of custom audiences that we've created there are various options here now the default is anyone who opened this form so that would refer to anyone who has clicked on the ad the form has come up but they didn't necessarily do anything with it you can be more specific and go with people who open but didn't submit which is not what we want in this scenario where we want to target people that are very similar to people who didn't submit the lead form that doesn't make sense but you can select here people who opened and submitted form now if you're going to go with this option as a source audience for a look-alike this is the option that i would select because yes you get a larger audience by selecting anyone who opened this form but with the people who opened and submitted for uh form option you're only including people in this source audience that have actually become a lead on facebook and targeting people that are very similar to people that have become a lead so basically a look-alike audience based off of this audience is a fantastic audience to target and that's one of the reasons why we will use this if we are running lead generation campaigns that use lead forms um as part of our facebook advertising strategy for a client so we're going to use the three in the top tier that i already mentioned and this one from time to time depending on the types of campaigns that we're running for a particular business okay so we're going to create this custom audience out of people who opened and submitted the form in the past 90 days which is the which is the maximum facebook will allow you unfortunately i would like to be able to use 180 or 365 but for privacy reasons um they've capped that at 90. nothing we can do but you do want to use the maximum time period particularly when selecting this option people who opened and submitted the form because as i've already mentioned that's a great base a great source audience with which to create a look-alike then you need to select the specific forms that you want to use so whatever it is that you've created you know when you create a lead form as part of a lead generation campaign you need to give that form a name i think we've got some example ones great in this account so if i select and click in yeah facebook ads free facebook ads for two weeks service providers something we experimented with at some point no doubt definitely not something we're running by the way guys now if you're uh if you're interested um so that anyone who interacted with that lead form fantastic now we want to call this something like lead form submitters uh 90 keep things consistent capital elephant something like lead form submitters create audience and that's creating the custom audience it's going to be our source for us to now create a look-alike audience and we're going to do the exact same as we have done before so let's go with the us let's target a one percent and let's click create audience fantastic and as you can see all those are still populating as we would expect so that's how you go about creating the custom audiences and then the look-alike audiences based off of those custom audiences within the audiences tab a very important part of uh facebook advertising of targeting as i said look-alike audience deliver the best results i'm just going to very quickly now show you how you go about actually targeting these look-alike audiences at the ad set level so just click on this little sort of matrix of buttons here and we want to jump back into ads manager okay so we're back now in our example ad account we've actually got an example campaign set up so let why not uh go into that click into that uh let's create a new ad set uh so i'm just going to very quickly pop in a new ad set in here a new example ad set in fact why don't we call this new look-alike ad set and then let's click save to draft and then in order to actually target your look-alike audience you want to scroll down don't worry about all the other settings i've got tons of videos on all of those if you're interested in any individual part of facebook ad campaign like conversion events where are we conversion events or optimization for ad delivery just literally search for those in youtube in my name and you will find a video on those um i want to scroll down to this section here so it's it's under the custom audiences section i know it's a bit confusing because custom audiences are technically your warm audiences then you create look-alike audiences from those but that's how facebook do it so you would then want to pop in one of your look-alike audiences so you can see we've got all you can actually see look-alike audience custom audience and let's say we wanted to target that last one we talked about the lead form submitters that we just created uh in the last 190 days remember it's not those people it's a look-alike audience based off of those people okay very important to be aware of that and you can see the potential reach on this side by the way is fewer than a thousand that's just because it hasn't populated yet once it's populated that'll have a lot more and that will be able to uh to run the campaign i would wait just out of interest to run the campaign uh if your audience is still populating make sure it populates first otherwise your results are likely to be poor or the campaign just simply won't run um in terms of other targeting options now obviously this is a us-based uh look-alike so we need to be targeting the us so that's very important so let's make sure i put in the right country in here wrong click so we want to put in the united states in there okay but other than that i would leave all these other targeting options completely open so i wouldn't set any age gender and definitely no interest targeting options or any detailed targeting options anything else you add in here the way it works is it'll narrow down your look-alike audience um and you just don't need it the whole point of a look-alike audience is you want to target people that are very similar to other groups of people like your previous customers if you go and say for example i only want to target people that are 40 to 60 well you could miss out on some 38 year olds that are very similar in very other ways to your ideal prospect and you don't want to miss out on those people so the look-alike audience will handle all this stuff for you if you were to go in and add any detailed targeting like interest or anything like that again it's going to act like an and function so people have to be in the look-alike and they have to be in that interest targeting option and you can bring your audience size down way too small i get quite a lot of comments from people saying i tried running a look-alike but it nothing happened it didn't deliver it didn't get any impressions and that's usually because they've added a look-alike and they've also added an interest targeting option and that's just made the audience too small because it's an and function okay or even you know multiple interest targeting things like that which is really going to um hurt the only thing you obviously want to do is make sure you've got the right target location so as we've already said if you want to advertise on a local basis you know let's go back to my previous example of birmingham here in the uk uh birmingham england 25 miles um obviously if that's your area of operation then that's where you want to advertise like don't don't advertise to the whole country if you only operate on a local basis um but just be aware that because we've narrowed this down significantly to just this size this area you're going to want a higher percentage look-alike audience to start with because that's going to bring your overall audience size down so usually when we're advertising for a local business and we are using look-alike audiences we're usually going to go with the maximum of 10 that's quite important that won't be the case if you're advertising in a local area but the population is still really big like we're advertising in in la or london for example well those are such big areas so many people in those areas that we can get away with let's say a five percent look-alike or something like that okay but um but yeah make sure you give look-alike audiences a go guys they really are very very powerful very very effective we use them all the time go through them in terms of the tiers that i mentioned you start with a look-alike based on previous customers then a look-alike based on your email list then look like based on your website visitors a look-alike based on lean lead form submitters look-alike based on video viewers look-alike based on instagram engages look-alike based on facebook page engages okay work your way through the list what's the highest one you have available start there um if you don't have previous customers fine email us don't have an email list website visitors etc etc hopefully understand how that works and when it comes to targeting in your ad set make sure you only include one look-alike audience per ad set don't include three different types of look-alike audiences because that gets very confusing when you're analyzing your data you know was it the look-alike audience based off my email list or my website visitors that delivered these great results if you separate them out into separate ad sets then you're likely to see uh much clearer data which will help you with future optimization decisions and bet better enable you to optimize your campaigns and make adjustments which make a big big difference to facebook advertising so hopefully
