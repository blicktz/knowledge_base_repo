Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about how I think coronavirus is going to affect Facebook advertising over the next few months. Now obviously everyone in every industry is sort of wondering how is coronavirus and the subsequent lockdowns that are taking place going to affect my business, going to affect my industry and I know there's a lot of you out there that'll be running Facebook ad campaigns, Instagram ad campaigns, thinking about advertising on Facebook that want to know how is this going to affect what I'm going to do. So that's what I'm going to cover in this video.

Before I get into that, I should quickly mention that at the end of this video I'm going to be talking about a couple of free resources that I think you're going to find very very interesting and going to be particularly useful during this time and something you can use during this time of uncertainty. So I strongly recommend you stick around to the end of the video for those. Now how is coronavirus going to affect Facebook advertising?

So the first thing I need to say is that no one knows 100% because you know this has never happened before Facebook advertising hasn't been around that long so it's somewhat unprecedented but I think we can we can make some fairly educated predictions around what's going to happen. Now while some industries are just really really going to suffer it really is all negative nothing's going to happen if you're you know involved in local events if you're involved in the travel industry restaurants something like that yeah you're really going to struggle you're almost certainly not going to be able to advertise over the next few months because you know particularly if you're a restaurant in a country that's on lockdown no one's even allowed to come visit and so there's obviously no point of advertising and unfortunately we have some clients in in in that in those categories they've stopped their advertising which makes complete sense that sucks for them as businesses it sucks for us as a Facebook Ads agency but that's just one of the other negative consequences of what's going on right now and obviously you know I do want to quickly mention that Facebook advertising is probably quite a small consideration in the greater scheme of things with everything that's going on but I think as business owners as marketers we need to think about the practicalities of how it does affect our our positions so for those industries yeah Facebook advertising is basically going to be a no-go for the next few months who knows how long that's going to last it's really unfortunate but that's just the way it is for other businesses and particularly I'm thinking here e-commerce businesses online businesses so and if you sell a software an app and any form of online entertainment you know you're content based this could be a really good time for you when it comes to Facebook advertising a really profitable time an opportunity to generate a number of customers and probably an opportunity you don't want to miss out on now why is that okay so what do we know we know that because of the virus it's going to be all these lockdowns so people are going to be stuck at home okay they're going to be stuck at home they're going to be bored they're going to be spending a lot of time on their phone on their computer on social media communicating with friends and family because you know they're not able to go see meet with them face to face so there's going to be a lot more ad impressions available and because people are bored they're going to want to buy products they're going to want to use software they're going to want to do the things they regularly do in life they're going to want to entertain themselves more than anything so putting ads in front of those people is likely to deliver great results because as I said there's going to be more ad impressions more people that are going to be spending time on the platform they're going to be bored so you know if you offer a relatively inexpensive e-commerce product fantastic they might want to buy that if it's something they can use at home or you know or enjoy then that might work really really well people are going to be having things delivered more and more as opposed to as opposed to going out and if you offer something a bit more expensive maybe that might be a little bit trickier you know if you are offering you know e-commerce products in the hundreds or thousands of dollars that might be a little bit tricky because people are going to be guarding their money a bit more but if you offer things in the in the lower price ranges like most e-commerce companies do and particularly software is anything technology based then people are still going to buy those those sorts of products they're going to be uh there's going to be a huge amount of demand for them now a lot of people may be worried that there's just going to be no consumer activity at all in terms of people aren't going to be buying anything because they're guarding their money they don't know what the future holds and i think for for a section of society anyone who does sort of freelance work who doesn't have a lot of savings that might be true they might be really guarding their money but i don't think that's going to be the true for the vast majority of people vast majority of people are going to be working for you know large corporations or at least you know businesses that aren't going to go bust they're going to be able to keep paying their salaries they're going to be working for government organizations which are obviously still going to be able to maintain salaries and their spending habits aren't likely to change all that much other than obviously they're saving money on all the things they're not doing um so again that gives them more disposable cash to spend on e-commerce products on entertainment on technology-based things that they can use at home so i think it's a good opportunity for those businesses the other big thing to take into consideration is that as i said all those local businesses are going to stop advertising so all those businesses like restaurants travel local events etc etc are going to stop advertising on facebook that reduces the amount of competition on the platform and should decrease the cost of facebook advertising so instead of it costing you let's say ten dollars to reach a thousand people it might end up costing you six dollars to reach a thousand people that could make a big big difference to the profitability of your facebook ad campaigns okay so i don't think that everyone should be really concerned right now about their their facebook advertising particularly if they are e-commerce based if they're technology based or something like that this could be a fantastic time for you facebook advertising is going to be cheaper your prospects are on facebook and instagram more than ever they're stuck at home they're bored if you can provide them with products entertainment software that you know they want this could be a really good time for you so i would i would keep that in mind and we're starting to see that difference so with some of our clients we're now starting to see a decrease in cpms which is leading to a decrease in cost per purchase obviously there are others that are going the other way like the ones that i mentioned the ones that industries are just really tough right now but there are i think going to be really big winners out of this and if your business fits the bill then um then that's something you should take advantage of so i've covered sort of e-commerce technology-based business the ones that can acquire customers right now what should other businesses be doing in terms of coaches consultants um b2b service providers companies like myself there's probably going to be a decreased activity in terms of generating new customers uh people are all uncertain right now i mean obviously this is changing so fast in two weeks time we might have a much better idea okay it sucks right now but this is all going to end by the end of may and therefore people will start planning for the future etc etc what i think you should be doing if you do want to keep active on facebook and instagram and this is what i'm going to be focusing on personally is audience building as i said same principles apply people are at home they are bored they perhaps haven't got as much work on as usual so they're going to be consuming lots of content so i'm going to be focusing a lot over the next couple of months on building my audiences producing a lot of content using the omnipresence content strategy to push that out to my warm audiences because i know my audience consists of a lot of business owners entrepreneurs and marketers that are wanting to get better results on facebook advertising and even if they're not advertising on facebook now now would be a fantastic time for them to consume my content for them to plan for the future for them to prepare facebook ad campaigns so that once this is all done which hopefully won't be too long and they can then push the button and acquire a load of customers and their business can grow people will start once the sort of initial panic is over and people adjust they will start planning and thinking for the future so if you're a coach consultant and anything on along those lines i think this is a great potential time for you to um you know to to to to almost take make it make a bit of a land grab in terms of your audience your warm audience and take the people that already maybe follow your stuff and really put a lot of great stuff in front of them um in order to to warm them up and i mentioned the beginning of this video you know it's along these lines that i've got a free resource for you i think it'd be really interesting and that's a free webinar called three killer facebook advertising strategies to double or more your revenue and in this webinar i demonstrate three strategies three different facebook advertising sales funnels that we use the facebook ads agency all the time we've um used these with our clients to generate seven plus figures on multiplication sometimes on a monthly basis and i'd really strongly recommend you go through this webinar and maybe that's the sort of thing that you you do during this coronavirus lockdown is maybe you go okay all that content i haven't had time to get to because things have been too busy maybe it's the perfect time to educate myself and go through through some things like this free webinar uh maybe it's time for me to build out that sales funnel that i've been meaning to get to for six months but i just haven't had the time that's just the sort of thing that i'm going to be doing and i'd recommend you guys do as well so the link to this free webinar will be in the video description it's around 60 70 minutes long i'd strongly recommend you check it out it'll be really really useful even if you don't go and implement the stuff in there depending on your business for a month or two and it really does make sense to go through it get access to that training and this is a perfect time to be going through content and educating yourself all these things that we just don't have time for in regular life now's the time to do them now's the time to build out that sales funnel to to create that um facebook ad campaign that that you know is going to deliver great results perhaps not at the moment but in the future so that's what i strongly recommend and um yeah depending on the type of business you have how is coronavirus going to affect you i've been through it in this video no one knows 100 that's what i guess but really look at the data okay really look at the data if you're an e-commerce business and you're running a facebook ad campaign monitor it closely if your cost per purchase is great fantastic keep advertising why would you stop provided you don't obviously have supply issues or anything like that why would you stop if that starts to increase check around is that just your campaigns or is that an industry trend i'll be releasing content about this as as it sort of develops and let you know what what we're seeing in terms of our clients campaign so you'll be able to know around that uh it may be that you need to scale things back but but be responsive to the data likewise if your results really improve if you're used to operating at a 20 cost per purchase and all of a sudden you're sort of seeing 12 10 cost per purchase and you have the cash to do it why not scale why not take advantage of this time um there's nothing wrong in doing so you're a business owner you want to maximize your um your profitability and things like that oh one thing i will quickly mention about coronavirus is facebook have quite rightly banned ads that are obviously trying to take advantage of people's fear so things like any ads for masks and other related things are completely banned don't try and do that that will get your facebook ad account disabled uh a lot of these people really are vultures it's not overly uh you know ethical what they're doing so i just wanted to quickly mention that in case you get any ideas around or i could quickly get in you know x y and z product buy a load of toilet roll and look to flog that high facebook are really cracking down on that so so be careful on that front another thing i want to quickly mention before the end of this video is my free facebook ads mastermind group again just the sort of time to get into content to develop some connections to educate yourself so that you can perform better going forward is when everything's on on going at a slower pace on lockdown right now so my free facebook ads mastermind group again
