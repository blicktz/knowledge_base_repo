Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to share with you eight keys to success with Facebook lead generation campaigns. Now Facebook lead generation campaigns have been around for a while. More and more people that advertise on Facebook are turning to them after the iOS 14 update so I thought it'd be a perfect time to publish a video talking all about how to get the best results possible with Facebook lead generation campaigns and that's what this video is going to be all about.

Before we're going to touch on a very very quickly ask for you to smash that like button and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already that would be much appreciated. Okay so I'm in an example Facebook ad account I've got sort of the campaign creation window up and I'm selected lead generation just so you're exactly sure what else I'm talking about. I'm not referring here to conversion campaigns where we're optimizing for leads which is of course a viable alternative often to a lead generation campaign.

Here we're talking specifically about the lead generation campaign objective where someone clicks on an ad on Facebook or Instagram and instead of being taken to a website or somewhere else they're kept in app and are presented with a lead form where they can submit information and become a lead. Okay so that's what we're talking about we're referring to lead generation campaigns you've probably seen the sort of thing I'm talking about a lot of people would have advertised using them and at least at least tested them out so that's what we're talking about here. With that said let's get into the these keys to success.

Okay so the first thing I would say is that when you're running a lead generation campaign you want to ask for people's phone number so most businesses are looking to generate leads are going to be service providers or perhaps bespoke product providers or there's some sort of interaction that you're likely to have with your prospects before they then go on to become a customer. Asking for a phone number is going to make it much much easier for you to contact people after they submit their information. One of the complaints a lot of people have about Facebook lead generation campaigns is that the quality is poor.

It's why people often go with conversion campaigns they say the quality is poor they submit their name email address I try and get in touch and no one ever responds. Well if you have someone's phone number you'll find it far easier to get in touch instead of just sending them an email that can easily end up in spam or just be ignored a phone call is far more likely to get someone's attention to get you talking to that person which is probably what you need to do in order to progress them to the next step. By the way I should have already mentioned this but I have videos on how to put together lead generation campaigns lead ad campaigns I have videos on how to create lead forms all that sort of stuff so I'll include links to those in the in the video description below for the how to's this is going to be very much on the on the what you want to be doing in those okay so we're going to start by asking for a phone number the second key to success is to follow up as quickly as you possibly can okay so if someone submits their information via one of your lead generation ads and you wait 48 hours to get in touch with them the chance that you will get in touch with that person and then go on to convert them to becoming a customer of yours is significantly less than if you're able to contact people within a few hours of them becoming a lead because you know it's very easy for someone to see a facebook instagram ad open it submit their details via a lead form and then forget all about it if you catch them whilst it's fresh and they're probably a bit excited about it and interested you're going to find it much much easier so I do think it is worth either you or someone from your company checking multiple times per day to see what leads have come through um and getting in touch via the phone primarily to get people talking to them progressing the process all that sort of stuff really will make a big big difference okay those are the first two right next one is to use a low barrier to entry offer so you don't want to run a lead generation campaign that's asking for someone to commit to a ten thousand dollar deposit on a fifty thousand dollar service you said you want to use things that are very easy for people to say yes to things like free surveys free quotes free consultations probably a lot of the sort of stuff that service-based businesses use anyway you know if you're a product provider or something like that just offer them the first step without having to make any monetary commitment and without having to make any significant time commitment free consultation is perfect oh yeah I can meet with those guys I can chat with them I can see what they're all about and see if I want to work with them it's not scary for your prospects to sign up for a free consultation or a free survey free whatever it is okay so that's what I would very much recommend doing low barrier to entry offers for your facebook lead generation campaigns okay key to success number four is to target a lookalike audience in one of your ad sets in your campaign you want to target a lookalike audience based on people who have already submitted lead forms now this is not a well firstly not many people are aware that you can create custom audiences out of people that submitted a lead form so anyone that has previously submitted a lead form once you've been running a campaign for a while and you have a hundred plus you can then take that custom audience and use it to create a lookalike audience so people that are very similar to people who submitted your lead form now what you're likely to see is that your cost per lead through your lead generation campaign is going to go down significantly if you've just been targeting interests you know behaviors all that other stuff that you have available on facebook because we know that lookalikes based on the people that have already taken the action you want new people to take often perform really well so you may be using them already but if not lookalike audience based off people they've submitted a lead form okay key success number five is similar to that one but it's to take that custom audience that you used as a source audience for your lookalike so the custom audience of people that have submitted a lead form and retarget them so there'll be lots of people that submit a lead form that you aren't able to get in touch with or you do get in touch with try and book an appointment something like that and they just they're busy they slip through the cracks you never hear from them again and it's easy just to go okay nothing doing we'll just leave them be but that's a waste opportunity you want to be retargeting those people specifically with a campaign to try and get them to resubmit re-become a lead i'm sure you've done this i do this all the time where you have an idea about a service that you'd like you find a website or you see an ad on facebook you click on it you submit your details they get in touch life gets busy you don't follow up um you just it just doesn't happen if you've got that same company getting in front of you again and again over the next weeks and months you're far more likely to go you know what actually i have got you know five minutes to quickly get this arranged let's let's do that now i've done that loads so make sure you're retargeting the people that have submitted a lead form but that haven't gone on to become a customer and you can do that by excluding um the people who have gone on to become a customer and again i've got videos on how to exclude audiences and things like that so so check those out via my uh via my youtube channel okay key to success at number six is to integrate your crm if you're if you're using one of course not everyone is but if you're using a crm and integrate that with facebook and you can be automatically notified every time a new lead is generated it's linked to the first ones i talked about where you want to be following up with people really quickly that can help most of the major crms integrate very easily with facebook just basically google whatever it is you're using um and facebook or facebook lead generation and it should should all pop up and it'll integrate in there all your data be passed in there so you don't have to get someone to do it manually um and it just makes the whole process a lot easier and you can get notified so you can follow up really quickly which we know is an important component of succeeding with facebook lead generation campaigns okay number seven is to try not over complicate what it is that you're offering in your facebook lead generation campaign and just focus on the one offer and make that super clear so if you're a service-based business and you offer a free consultation as your initial step just off free consultation don't try and pitch to full services yet don't complicate things um don't try and offer three or four different things in one ads it's one it's one of the things i've seen before and that's not great with any facebook advertising but particularly with lead generation campaigns you want the process to be simple to be straightforward you don't want someone to click through and then feel like oh am i signing up for this or am i signing up for that and confusion always leads to problems when it comes to optimizing an online sales funnel you want the process to be as simple and straightforward for people as possible um so focus on one thing one offer free consultation free survey whatever it happens to be for your business and make that super super obvious okay um yeah so you'd have free consultation in the headline but you wouldn't just have free consultation it needs to be wrapped around the service so you'd have free uh free roofing survey if you're a roofer free um kitchen design consultation you know that sort of thing and then finally number eight um less is often more for lead generation campaign uh the lead form process after someone clicks on your ads so there are all sorts of options within facebook where you can add in qualifying um stuff in there and ask bunch of questions and not just get phone number email address and name but also ask for tons of other stuff if you want as many leads as possible the best cost per lead you want to take all that stuff out you want to make it as easy and seamless for people to see your ad and go on to become a lead as possible the one caveat to that is if you're really trying to improve lead quality let's say you've run a facebook ad campaign a lead generation ad campaign and you're getting lots of leads but they're just poor quality well then maybe you want to add some stuff in add in some friction to the process which will then weed out the ones that are not as interested and leave you with the best quality ones but to get started with a lot of people want volume they want lower cost per lead i would recommend making it as easy um as possible taking a lot of that stuff out that's often where we will start at least and then if we have quality issues we'll look to add back in okay right so before i get into something i really think you'd be very interested in i'm just going to run through the eight keys to success with facebook lead generation campaigns okay so number one is to ask for a phone number make that a requirement number two is to follow up as quickly as possible preferably within a few hours number three is to use a low barrier to entry offer free consultation free survey stuff like that number four is to target a lookalike audience based on people who've already submitted a lead form number five is to retarget the people that have submitted your lead form but not actually gone on to convert number six is to integrate your crm with facebook makes your process a lot easier number seven is to offer one thing and make it really clear what that one offer is again free consultation free survey something like that and number eight is less is more you want to take out as much of the additional fluff that there is around lead generation campaigns like qualifying information extra questions unless you're specifically doing that to tackle a lead quality issue okay so if that's been
