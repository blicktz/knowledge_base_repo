Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to generate 30,000 Facebook group members. I'm going to show you how to build a Facebook group with more than 30,000 members. Now building a Facebook group is something that I recommend a lot of Facebook marketers, Facebook advertisers do because Facebook groups are one of the only places on Facebook where you still get a lot of organic reach.

You know if you're posting to your Facebook page it's very unlikely that many of your Facebook page likes. People that like your page are actually going to see what you're posting. Whereas if you have a Facebook group organic reach engagement is just so so much higher.

You can post about your products, your services, your content and it can really do fantastic things for your business. It has done absolutely fantastic things for your business. So my group is called the Facebook Ads Mastermind group.

I'll include a link in the video description so you go ahead and check it out and you can see that right now I have 29,188 members. Not quite 30,000 I know but at the rate that my group is growing I can assure you probably by the time that this video is edited and published it will be over 30,000. Hence the title of this video.

And as I said this does this group does fantastic fantastic things for business. I basically have 30,000 potential customers in my Facebook group. I'm the only one that's allowed to market to them.

I know they're interested in what I have to offer. They're interested in Facebook advertising because otherwise why would they be in a Facebook Ads Mastermind group. This is just an amazing community that does amazing things for my business.

If you can build something similar with the techniques I'm about to share it can do absolutely amazing things for your business as well. We get so much of our work through this group. So okay how do you go about building a Facebook group that has 30,000 members or even close to that sort of scale?

There's a few sort of techniques that I've developed and discovered along the way that have worked really well because I've done this by the way in in about 18 months just over 18 months. There's not been a huge amount of time to get this group to the level where it is where it's very very significant. So the first thing I would mention is that you can invite people that like your Facebook page to join your Facebook group and this is a technique I've talked about before and it's one that's that I've used a lot and it's very very important.

So you can see down here on the right hand side you can see okay so up here it says look Ben Heath this my group is linked to my page that's something that you need to do to be able to invite members you need to link your group to your page. I've got 123,000 people that like my Facebook page and you can see here that Facebook have this little section here that says suggested members so I can go ahead down this list and click invite member click click click click click. Now Facebook will let you do roughly 50 of those a day they'll let you invite roughly 50 people a day which is doesn't might not sound like a huge amount but 50 people a day adds up quite quickly and if the people that like your page are interested in whatever it is that you know industry you're in so for example the people like my page are interested in Facebook advertising otherwise they wouldn't have bothered to like my page in the first place okay so it's highly likely that they would also be interested in a Facebook group that's all about the same topic so provided your page and your group are very much linked this is a great strategy and if you can invite around 50 people a day that number of people in your group will just go up and up and up and quite quickly you could be looking at thousand two thousand people in your in your Facebook group.

Now one thing that I get asked about quite a lot with this feature is sometimes this feature will disappear and basically Facebook just limits how much you can actually use it so if you've been inviting lots and lots of members Facebook will just remove that when you can take a look at your Facebook group it that'll only be temporary it'll disappear for a day two maybe three and then it'll come back so it's nothing to worry about but just something to keep in mind is that that may well disappear the other thing to keep in mind is that to be able to use that technique you need to be interacting as your page over here on the left hand side not as your personal profile okay so you can click on this interacting as and I could change that to my personal profile for example but I want to interact as my page that's something you need to do to see your Facebook page likes as suggested options as opposed to your personal friends if you're interacting as your personal profile then you will see your friends down here okay so hopefully that makes sense if you don't have many Facebook page likes you might be thinking okay great well you've got 123,000 so of course you could do this but I've only got 200 that's fine what I'd recommend is you start by inviting the people that already like your page perfect place to start and then you can go about acquiring new Facebook page likes okay I actually recommend that for me I found that the best way to grow a Facebook group is not to advertise the group directly although we have done some of that it's to advertise my Facebook page generate a Facebook page like which is a lot easier to do a lot lower barrier to entry for people and then convert that person to a Facebook group member I've got a whole video tutorial that shows you exactly how to do that exactly how to grow a Facebook group using that method and so I'll include that in the video description make sure you go through that to sort of go through that process in a lot of detail I just want to quickly cover it as one of the best ways to grow a Facebook group here is to invite your Facebook page likes and I've just mentioned some things around that okay so that's number one number two is you want to make sure that you call your Facebook group something that is very obvious very relevant not only to your target market but also to Facebook's um I was going to say search algorithms but that's not really the right word sort of delivery algorithms I'll explain what I mean so obviously this is called a Facebook ads mastermind group if you're interested in Facebook advertising you know exactly what that's about okay that's going to be full of loads of other people that are advertising on Facebook helping each other out going back and forth etc etc okay so self-explanatory that's good but also because I've got the word Facebook ads in there it also means that when someone is searching for a group let's say they want to join a Facebook group they've just started Facebook advertising they don't know what they're doing they're thinking I want to connect with a community of like-minded people that can help me out they might go into Facebook groups into the search function up here and they might search for Facebook ads well my group is going to pop up it's more likely to pop up because I've got the word Facebook ads in the name now this is something that didn't really have any effect when I was growing my group when it was very small um because I wouldn't have ranked highly there'd be lots of other groups that were above mine but as my group has grown and as I've now got just shy of 30 000 members I now rank very highly and this is something that really helps my group grow fast so for example I'm using the invite technique to get it started and then organic growth and because of the size of my group has really helped it take off and that's why we're generating three four thousand new members every single month at the moment it's absolutely taking off which is um which is fantastic so that's something I would uh I would strongly recommend that you do is just make sure that you call your group something that is obvious to both you and that can be found by Facebook search the next thing is that your image up here really wants to sell your Facebook group okay really wants to sell the Facebook group when people are searching this is something they're going to see so it wants to be something that again gets the message across and emphasizes the benefit that your Facebook group has to offer so this is called the Facebook ads mastermind group I've got here don't be this guy a guy sort of you know he's really frustrated the idea is he's really frustrated with his Facebook ads they're not working properly he's going mad he's smashing his laptop he's so frustrated I'm saying don't be this guy instead save yourself years of trial and error by learning from the experiences of others that's what a mastermind is all about that's what this group is going to help people do so it really helps this image really helps sell what this group is all about the next point point number four is to really engage as the group owner a lot within your group okay I think this is really really important you don't want people to come into your group and just never engage never get involved never do anything so anyone that joins my group gets a welcome message okay so I can probably find the latest welcome message from today here we go welcome to my Facebook ads mastermind group and I give them access to a free resource get involved ask your questions and I tag all the people that have been involved in the last that have joined in the last 24 hours or however long it's been okay so that's that's the first thing every new person gets a welcome message which is really easy to do and Facebook have this little tool over here so I have eight new members in the last however long since I've published write a new post to welcome them so I click write post Facebook will automatically tag those people when I click write post in my welcome message something that really helps you also want to ask answer people's questions if they're asking questions answer them get involved leave comments one thing I like to do that I've started doing relatively recently I used to do this a lot more is these live trainings so I'm actually holding one as I'm recording this video I'm actually holding one this afternoon and it's a live training this is specifically for Facebook ads agency members in my group because there's a lot of people in my group that are agency members and I'm doing this all about the coronavirus stuff and you know what people should be doing agency wise with all this going on so I've got an image here and I'll be doing a live training this afternoon so I'm very much active in my group and I encourage activity and community because I think when it comes to you being found in Facebook as a Facebook group engagement rates and activity levels are really going to play a big big factor in that okay if Facebook can see that people are really loving your stuff they're really getting involved they're commenting they're sharing posts they're leaving comments etc etc and that's going to make a big big difference to how many new group members you get it's also going to make a difference in terms of how valuable your group members are to you if they barely know you from Adam then it's unlikely that they're going to actually go on to become customers but if you're in there doing live trainings communicating with people they know who you are they know you're an expert they're far more likely to work with you to buy your products buy your services etc one thing that I'd recommend doing when growing a Facebook group that we did fairly late on and I wish I'd have done it earlier was we turned on post approval okay so it's not just me that manages my group I have team members moderators that go through this but you can see one post needs approval anyone that joins that wants to post in my Facebook group my Facebook ads mastermind group their post has to be approved by me or one of my team members first and we did this because groups have a tendency to become very spammy if you don't okay so you have people just trying to sell stuff just trying to spam people and that can really put people off your group that can reduce the level of activity and again that's going to then impact on your ability to grow the group and to keep people engaged because if every time they come on your group there's just spam people pitching their products services that's going to turn people off it's not something you want so that's something I'd recommend you strongly recommend that you do and then finally another method that I've found really useful in growing my Facebook group and this will have more of an impact depending on what stage of business you're at is to make sure that anytime someone enters your world your online world or even your offline world make sure they know about your group and they're invited to join it okay so for example I'm just going to jump into an email autoresponder of mine whenever someone opts in for my five-part Facebook ad template which is a free lead magnet that I give away and you probably if you've watched my YouTube videos you may have seen me talk about it at the end saying go ahead and grab this free thing in my auto email responder that basically says hi welcome this is who I am I say this look hey and then first name my name is Ben Heath I'm the CEO of lead guru I want to take a second to say hello and welcome I also wanted to invite you to join my free Facebook ads mastermind group so anyone that joins my email list boom they get an email with a link to my group and I'm also selling the group here if you run Facebook ad campaigns for your company or work for an agency this group is the perfect place to get your questions answered go ahead and join it now and fire away with your Facebook advertising questions we're happy to help so I'm selling I'm not only saying look you're invited to it but here's why you should go ahead and make the effort to do so and that makes a big difference for me in growing my group because I have you know let's say two to three thousand people join my email list every month I mean it depends obviously if we run uh ad campaigns specifically for that then that's going to increase but sort of from my YouTube channel and other areas um people are going to opt in that that's roughly the rate at which my email list is growing right now well a lot of those people are going to jump over and become Facebook group members of mine so obviously you know you may not have as many people you may not be running any sort of lead backlinks but you could put it in the you know in the sort of contact information of your emails the footer of your emails you can put it on all sorts of places you could put a link to your group on your website there's all sorts of things you can do to promote your group and make sure it's not just a case of you're just doing the one thing but you've got it everywhere so anytime someone watches a video of yours on YouTube or connects with you on LinkedIn or checks out your website there's links to your group to get people in because as I said a Facebook group is such a fantastic um and and valuable resource um I strongly recommend doing that I think it's well worth the time it takes okay so hopefully that video's been useful before you go a couple of things I want to quickly mention the first is a free webinar that I've created called three killer Facebook advertising strategies to double or more your revenue and this webinar is really fantastic we've had thousands of people watch it the feedback has been amazing and in this webinar I break down three Facebook advertising strategies three different sales funnels that we use as a Facebook ads agency um these sales funnels are so tried and tested I mean we've generated more than a million dollars with every single one of them sometimes even on a monthly basis for clients that are operating with a high budget so they're very much tried and tested they work fantastically well and I've got three different strategies because you need different strategies for different businesses so if you're selling if you're an e-commerce business you need a different strategy to if you're selling info products to if you're selling um real you know face-to-face services okay so you can go through that webinar and you can work out exactly what strategy you should be using for your products and services specifically which is such an important key to Facebook advertising success I mean if you um you know it doesn't matter how specific your targeting is how engaging your ad creative is if you're not using the right strategy for your business there's no one size fits all then your Facebook ad campaigns will not work so go ahead and check that out completely free it's about 60 70 minutes long and I think you'll find it well well well worth the time okay that's the
