Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to sell affiliate products with Facebook ads. Now before I get into it, I just want to quickly ask you to smash that like button and subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay, now you've done that, so affiliate marketing and Facebook advertising.

A lot of people like the idea of both of those things. Affiliate marketing has obvious advantages in terms of you don't have to invest in research and development to create your own product, you don't have to order a load of stock in, you don't have to develop expertise to provide a service, you can get someone else to handle all of that for you if you can sell other people's products and services as an affiliate and generate a commission on every sale generated. And then of course you've got the Facebook advertising side of things.

Most people in the digital marketing space are well aware of the power of Facebook and Instagram ads and how effective it can be in terms of generating sales and generating income for you as an affiliate marketer. So they put the two together and they just sort of crack on. But there's things you do want to do and things you don't want to do when it comes to affiliate marketing and selling affiliate products through Facebook ads.

And that's what I'm going to cover in this video. I'm not sort of going to talk about some of the other aspects of affiliate marketing like finding great affiliate offers. You're probably familiar with Clickbank and other examples and there's lots of other resources on that.

I just want to talk about the do's and don'ts in this video when it comes to selling affiliate products with Facebook ads. So I'm in an example Facebook ad account here and I've got an example affiliate ad campaign in a draft mode just to sort of demonstrate this. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly skip ahead to the ad and then I'll come back and I'll show you why in a second.

So I'm just going to highlight this and edit it and come in here. Now where most people start when it comes to affiliate marketing of Facebook ads is they found an affiliate product they want to sell. They're all super excited.

They go ahead and create a campaign and they scroll down to the link section and once of course they've applied to become an affiliate been accepted etc they pop their affiliate link in there. And when they do that Facebook pops up with all sorts of warning messages and things basically saying you can't do that. Now that's not strictly to you can put direct affiliate links in a Facebook ad and there are ways around it but it's not what I would recommend doing.

With selling affiliate products and Facebook advertising I do not think the best approach is to try and directly sell the products and services. I think it's much better to have an intermediary step and in that intermediary step be building your audience as an affiliate marketer. Now where a lot of people go wrong with affiliate marketing particularly in conjunction with Facebook advertising is they don't treat it like a real business right.

They just try and sort of have a quick overnight success quickly throw something up hope it works hope it generates a profit and move on something else. And as I've talked about a lot of my Facebook advertising videos you don't want that approach to Facebook advertising whether you're selling your products and services or affiliate products you need to have I would say a more mature approach a longer term approach and treat it like a real business. If you are just trying to generate a quick sale for an affiliate product take your commission and hope that that commission exceeds the cost of advertising it's going to be very very difficult for you to scale and maintain a consistently profitable business with that approach.

You're not capturing the majority of the value that comes from that transaction between you and the customer. Yes of course you're getting commission in terms of on the sale but I would argue that the real value in that first transaction with a customer is the fact that you have generated a customer for a business. Now it's not your business necessarily but you have generated a customer business you have developed that relationship and the value is in that audience right.

The 30, 40, 50 percent commission whatever it is is great and that's nice to have but the real value is in building the audience that you can then sell affiliate products to and generate 30, 40, 50 percent commissions again and again and again. So instead of directly looking to sell your affiliate products and services I think it's much much better to focus on audience building and I've got a couple of free resources that I'm going to direct you to all about that they will be included in the description of this video there'll be links to other videos. The first one is about how to build an email list right so very very long video exactly how to go about building an email list and I think if you're looking to do if you're wanting to be serious about affiliate marketing with Facebook ads which is a perfectly viable strategy guys I mean we've worked with companies that do this exclusively very big very successful companies they do this exclusively so it can work very well but I think building an email list is a fantastic step to take not only you're going to get past any issues Facebook might have about your landing pages and sorry but yeah about the links that you're putting in directly sending people to an affiliate offer which often they don't like but so you're getting around that issue but you're also as I said building your audience now you can have a very simple structure whereby you know let's say I'm advertising a lead magnet because I'm going to use that to build an email list it's to do with whatever industry I'm going to focus on it's highly related to the products and services I want to sell as an affiliate I advertise the lead magnet get people to come opt in for the lead magnet join my email list by doing so then on the thank you page people are taken to after they join the email list that could be a video of you basically a sales page something that's then trying to sell the affiliate product or service that you're offering that then links people through to that landing page so you've only got you know for most consumers a couple of minutes extra even if that for them to go to your landing page opt in for your lead magnet go to the thank you page and then click through to the affiliate offer sales page anyway so the the delay is very very short you're also building your relationship with that audience and you're your recommendation is going to carry more weight because they've taken an action with you you know they've downloaded your lead magnet they've decided that you have information that's valuable to them um you become more of an authority figure when you then make the recommendation so your conversion rate is going to go up when people go through to the uh to the affiliate sales page but also as I said you have the follow-on uh abilities so if they don't go ahead and purchase right there and then you can uh hit them with an email autoresponder you can have a three-day five-day email autoresponder sequence that encourages those people to go ahead and purchase the affiliate offer that's a huge huge advantage um to building an email to building an email list building an audience as opposed to trying to directly make the sale with the um by sending people directly through to an affiliate sales page okay so that's one really big way I would go about building an audience something I strongly strongly recommend for affiliate marketers um the long-term ROI on that approach as opposed over the direct approach is so much better as I said because if you get someone on your email list you might be able to sell five different affiliate products to them over the next year 18 months something like that huge difference the other audience I strongly recommend people build and I said there'll be a a video in the description below a link in the description below to a video all about how to do this and that's building a Facebook group so these are two when I think about audience building with Facebook ads these are two areas I've got I've got my email list I've got my Facebook group put a lot of time and effort into those personally I've got over 30 000 people on an email list I have over 40 000 people in my Facebook group and they are amazing communities such a revenue generator both of those things for my businesses and I think a Facebook group is another great way to do it so I've got a whole video about how you go about building a Facebook group again you can use similar um strategies to get people to an affiliate offer so for example once you drive new members into your Facebook group you generate new members you can set you can use a welcome post that welcomes all group name all new group members to the group and in that welcome post you could include an affiliate link or put it in the comments below in that welcome post you could say oh thank you for joining this group all about Facebook advertising this is what this community does I think you're going to find it really valuable oh and by the way I strongly recommend that you buy this product or service because it's fantastic these are the sorts of things you can do with a Facebook group just like you can with an email list you can put in next steps and of course just like with a Facebook group as with an email list if you want to sell future affiliate offers particularly if any of the companies that you're an affiliate for which most do run any sort of time promotions or sales from time to time you can go back to this group you know this in my case a Facebook group and you know you'll be able to put that in front of these people generate revenue you know it's something they're interested in so instead of just trying to be quite scatter brained in terms of your affiliate marketing try and pick an offer try and sorry try and pick an industry find offers within that industry that you would buy yourself that you like and then focus on building audiences around those and then look to market your affiliate offers to those people one thing I want to mention when it comes to Facebook ads and affiliate marketing is that obviously you can't usually install your Facebook pixel to be able to track conversions within your Facebook ad account when you're directly sending people um to an affiliate uh sales page okay it's just not going to work I mean every now and then you'll come across some that will allow you to do that they'll create like unique uh sales pages but most of the time that's not going to be possible now the company will usually provide you with affiliate data in the back end so you'll be able to see how many sales you're generating but your Facebook ad campaign can't optimize for that specific purchase which means you can't really run a conversions campaign because there's no conversion event for them to optimize for whereas if you go with one of the you know let's for example take the email list building approach you could run a conversions campaign that optimizes for people joining your email list okay that allows you to run a conversions campaign conversion campaigns in general perform much much better than traffic campaigns and that's another advantage to building an email to building an audience first and then looking to sell your affiliate products and services to that audience as opposed to doing it directly is the campaign structure okay hopefully that's been useful just for you go a couple of things i want to quickly mention the first is a free webinar called three killer facebook
