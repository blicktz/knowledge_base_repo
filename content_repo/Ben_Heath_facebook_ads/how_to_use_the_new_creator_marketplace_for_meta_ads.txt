The single most underrated Facebook ads and Instagram ad strategy is to use influencers in your ad creative. I've worked on multiple campaigns for both big and small businesses where a single influencer has improved return on ad spend so much that it has completely changed the business. And the good news is, it is now so much easier for businesses to find and work with influencers on their meta ads because meta has released a free to use creator marketplace.

I'm super excited about this and in this video I'm going to show you how it works and why you want to jump on this ASAP. So let me show you what I'm talking about. Now I'm in meta business suite which is how you access to create a marketplace.

And once you're in meta business suite if you just go over to the menu on the left hand side you can select create a marketplace and you come through to this page here. Now I'm in a place here to click on get started and go through the process. You might have a step before this which is where you need to request access to the creator marketplace first.

I've had to do that sort of in order to be able to prep and then record this video and that can take a little bit of time. So that might be one extra step but just click the button it's fairly self-explanatory and then you should come through to a place like this. So in terms of what the creator marketplace is designed to do what meta are telling us they say that it's designed to help brands discover and collaborate with creators on Instagram for branded content and partnership ads.

Now you can also do this when using it as ads part of your Facebook ads not just Instagram specific but the whole creator landscape is very Instagram heavy. It's what people think of and they've sort of branded it as Instagram marketplace because that's where the the data is. You'll understand as we go through it but I just wanted to say we can use this on our Instagram ads and our Facebook ads as well.

Now just a quick few things about getting access to this if you do need to request access and what you need in order to be able to actually go ahead and use this. You need to have a professional Instagram account not just a regular Instagram account or that Instagram account needs to be connected to a Facebook page. I know most of you watching my stuff will have professional Instagram accounts because you're looking to run ads and you will have it connected to a Facebook page for your business because you're looking to run ads.

So that's unlikely to be an issue and I should also say it's not eligible for all brands yet. So there will be some people that meet those criteria try to get access can't quite do it but I have heard from meta that they are looking to roll this out make it much more widely available. They basically started by testing it with just larger brands but because it's worked well so far they're looking to roll it out and make it available to other types of advertisers.

So that's why I'm now making a video on it because we can use this and I think it's going to make the job of using influencers in meta ads a lot lot easier as you'll see as we go through this. And I'm a huge fan of using influencers in your Facebook and Instagram ads like I've talked about that on many videos. It can be such a big game changer.

I've seen so many examples where a business has say a 2x return on ad spend and by using an influencer in their ad same offer same product same service maybe even same style the ad then performs at a 6x for us because having the influence of someone that is recognizable within your industry in the ad creative is one of the best scroll stoppers. It's going to stop people just scrolling right past your ad and go oh you know I know this person what were they up to oh they're talking about this thing great I might go ahead and purchase or become a lead or whatever it is that you're wanting to get from your advertising. So really big fan of using influencers this is going to make it a lot easier.

Anyway let's jump back into the creative marketplace let's go through the process. I'm going to go ahead and click on get started once you've got access you will be able to do the same thing and we've got a little window here and that's popped up where meta is letting us know what this is going to help us do discover connect collaborate with creators all in one place find creators con campaigns all that sort of stuff and then you come through to a page that looks like this this is what the creator marketplace looks like. Now the first thing you probably want to go about doing is finding creators that you might want to partner with that you might want to act as influencers within your meta ads.

So there's a number of different ways to go about finding creators defaults through to the to the search page and you can search in here you can search for specific user names if you want to you know you know of people that you want to see if they're in here and be able to contact you can search based on hashtags and keywords you can see that metas come up with some suggestions based on my stuff so it's got facebook ads expert e-commerce advertiser meta ads manager like it's worked out what I talk about in my content and therefore made some recommendations of what I can search for you can see if you don't add anything into the search then meta will just default to ones that it thinks are appropriate for you so for example down here we've got chase chappell over here so a known name within like meta ad space that makes total sense that that would be someone that pops up and other options these are going to be relevant as well when it comes to the search you can filter so you can filter you know by country follower sizes interest age gender a number of different options to really narrow down and work out who you might want to to work with we've also got this recommendations tab which is really interesting so in the recommendations and the different creators are broken down sort of by category so we've got creators who've partnered with brands like you we've got creators with and that's great because those people might be more susceptible to offers and reach outs because this is something they're doing whereas others maybe not so much uh creators with high performing reels of course you want people to and then there's if you go through this i won't go through more but if you go through this is other categories and different types of things as well and you've got lists i'll come back to later we've got interested creators now i'm not going to have anything in here uh i expect this to be much more important for larger brands or as the creative marketplace gets more and more popular and there's more creators and more businesses using it i think there's going to be more and more creators saying oh i'd really love to work with such and such brand to promote your products promote your services well if you are in a position where you have a big enough brand you're a known name to get that that could be great because those creators are probably going to be open to lower offers because they really want to work with you and they're probably really keen to promote your products or services maybe they use those anyway and that's why they want to to promote them so if you are big enough to get some stuff in here could be a really good deal previous partnerships you can track all your stuff i'll talk about later you've also got um follows and tags which i think is really interesting so here we've got like creators that follow me for example um so it might be that this might be a great place to look to find people that are already into your stuff already into what you talk about what what it is that you advertise might be a great place to go in and find people and contact them and then tags as well um again if you're someone if this is going to vary business to business some business get a lot of tags and and there's going to be a lot of interest in a bit of creators you can specifically reach out to um others like mine do not get as much um but i've got a bunch of people in here that follow which is great so you can have a play about with this have a good look for creators try and find options that are appropriate for your business my typical advice with working with influencers to um feature in your ads to basically create your ad creative for you is start on the smaller side start with the more niche ones the ones that have smaller followings that aren't going to cost as much to get them to agree to that and then once that works you can always look to scale up from there to reinvest spend more money get those bigger names and the results do tend to follow the larger the following as long as it is niche specific that's very important that tends to translate into better results um but then it starts more you can always scale up from there now in assessing which creators you might want to work with um meta gives us loads of great information as part of this creator marketplace so if i just bounce back out to search um and i'm just going to click on the top option here so if i just go ahead and click on this creator profile josh the dad trepreneur um we can see all sorts of really useful info right so we've got total followers we've got accounts engaged in the last 30 days accounts reach this is really useful information because i think a lot of influencer marketing and working with influencers is done purely based on follow accounts but if you've been in the industry a while you'll know that some people can have massive followings that they've built up over a long time or perhaps they used to be much better at getting followers but they don't have much engagement anymore perhaps what they talk about there's less interest for or they just got a bit lazy with their content and they just don't have as much influence as they used to so looking at accounts engaged and accounts reached um is really really handy we've got previews of recent posts we've got some like tags for what um this business is or this this creator is like into and what what you know whether or not it might be appropriate for you and we can see you know graphs over time so that's set to like 30 days but we could customize it and go with different time periods uh we can look at their audience demographics and this is engaged audience demographics really interesting so we've got age ranges we've got country locations uh cities and then we've got this bit down here with um creators that are similar to this one we're looking at which is really handy because if you find one that you think oh that's good um i think this could be a good option it just saves you time and effort just going down and having a look at ones that it's almost like a lookalike audience but for creators right okay so a couple of other things i want to mention whilst we're here is that we can create lists out of creators let's say we think this creator is great talks about the right stuff etc etc we can go ahead and click on um save to list i can go into saved that's going to make it easy for managing the lists of people you might want to to reach out to um this guy's certainly getting some uh some free advertising here and then we've got some previous partnerships so once you've been doing this a while i'll show you how to create campaigns and how that all works later on um you can keep track of them in here which will be nice and handy and one thing to mention about this by the way is that if you're struggling potentially to find some creators um maybe you can't find ones that are appropriate to what it is that you want to do although i would be surprised in the playing that i've done with this like i've found loads of options uh more than i was expecting but obviously as this becomes more and more popular and as it's used more there's going to be more creators on here more you'll be able to get in touch with um it'll be easier to reach out like the whole process is going to get easier as this becomes more and more of a known commodity and a and a thing that people do both as businesses and as creators in a second i'm going to show you how to create a campaign and then invite creators to it from within the creator marketplace but first i want to show you a quick clip from a talk i gave recently that explains why you should just hire my agency to run your ads for you hire my agency to run your meta ads for you why do that i said at the beginning spent more than 150 million that's a very conservative number i always like any number claims i give to be like absolutely bulletproof averaged over 4x roas again that's conservative that ad spend generating more than 600 million in revenue clients all around the world all sorts of niches i am the only meta megaphone partner in the uk um which is because of my personal brand i have special access with meta and they give me access to things early special access so that if things go wrong with ad accounts which if you've been running facebook and instagram ads you will know that is absolutely the case and we're able to get that resolved with an email which is a big advantage and we're an agency partner um lots of agencies will tell you that they're agency partners there's different levels to that game we're in the top level there's only 50 in the uk and of those 50 we actually have the most number of clients and that leads me to make the somewhat bold claim but i would honestly stand by it that i've got the best meta as agency in the uk i pitch my team against any in the uk and be surprised they come out on top honestly i pitch my guys against any meta ads agency in the world and be surprised if they didn't come out on top which i know is punchy but there we go so once you've found some creators that you want to work with if we just jump back to where we were previously we'll go back to this top suggested option you can just reach out and contact them so you just click on the little contact button send them a message and now one of the good things about the messages that come through from the creator marketplace is that on the when the creator is looking at their meta business suite their inbox in there which is typically where i'd recommend you handle incoming messages on facebook and instagram but also check through comments on your ads to be able to delete the bad ones respond to the good ones or ones have questions it's within the inbox within meta business suite um there will be a separate folder created specifically for messages to do with the creator marketplace so if a creator has large followings they have lots of inbound loads of people messaging them lots of comments it could easily get lost in there whereas because it has a separate folder it's going to be much easier and for them to keep track of and then easier for you as well because you'll have the same thing um to keep to keep a track of uh when it is coming to communicate with those people and trying to get creators to uh create stuff for you so you can just send them a message through there there is i'm just going to go ahead and discard that there is however another way to go about um asking creators to work with you and that's to create a campaign so i'm going to click on get started in campaign you can see that we're going to walk through a campaign setup creation process now this is different to an ad campaign that you would create in ads manager because it is designed to be a campaign that helps you find and work with creators so there are some differences but i'm going to walk you through this right so you go ahead and click on campaigns get started uh first thing you want to do is select goal right so it says here just as just to give meta some more information most businesses i think watching my stuff most watch my stuff it's going to be increased sales would probably be the most likely option then we've got this next section here which is visibility so we've got two options here the default is discoverable by creators or we've got invite only so it's basically this campaign that we're creating here where we're saying we want this work done uh we want the creative produced by by creators um do we want creators just to be able to find that in the creator marketplace or do we want to just specifically go with invite only and invite um certain people so i'm going to walk through both because i think there are there are pros and cons to both and it depends on your business which one you want to use um do you want as as many people as possible to potentially see this and have lots of different options to work with or do you want to keep it more targeted and more specific that's going to depend on the size of your brand and how much incoming you're likely to get what your budget is and your experience with um working with influencers in general all that sort of stuff so i'm going to go with discoverable by creators and then and then walk through the invite only option we've got fixed offer here so creators will see the content and compensation details aren't open to negotiation and you won't be able to publish them um the default for this is turned off i'd probably recommend turning it off um if you do turn it on then you're going to fix what you're willing to pay for what the tricky part about that is you're probably going to be in a scenario where different creators are worth different amounts to your brand so you would be willing to pay a larger influencer more money for them to produce say a video ad reviewing your product than a smaller one because when you run those as ad campaigns they're likely to perform better they have more influence so that's another reason why i typically turn it off and meta recommends that but just wanted to quickly mention that that's an option then you want to go ahead and click next and then we add some details and this is stuff that um creators will be able to see so they can understand what it is that we're looking to do so you might have for example like product uh demonstration videos uh entering your brand name so that people who recognize it would know and that's going to be beneficial then description you could say like uh looking for two uh real style videos reviewing our product then you might want to add in a bit more information explain the product explain what it does explain the benefits you want people to uh to mention but you do need to add something into the description normally we would build this out further and then we've got cover image so you can see that meta is wanting us to add an image that sort of reflects the campaign's visual style this could be of your brand this could be of your product itself this could be a demonstration of what's been done previously just something that's going to help make it obvious what it is right so if i go ahead and click on add image um i'm just going to go ahead and add one in um there's a little bit of a joke fun image that we typically use me sat in my uh my son's little toy car you'd obviously want to add something in that was a little bit more on brand i'm just doing this for demonstration purposes then we go ahead and click next and then we have some this is discoverable option remember so we have some extra options here so creators filter which creators will be able to see this campaign everyone or do you just want female just want male creators that's going to depend obviously um on your business is there an age range that you want to to add in like what sort of creators you're looking for you think okay well all our customers are uh you know 50 plus therefore we don't want a 20 year old creator to be able to um uh be involved in this process that just wouldn't make sense or maybe vice versa you could request uh require certain follower amounts these are optional and then we've got target audiences is a bit different to this top section in the creator themselves this is their audience um which typically follows but not 100 not always so do you want their audience to be female male predominantly um do you want there to be an age range associated with their uh audience countries this could be a really valuable one you're like okay yeah i really really want to work with influencers that are in the us or the uk if that's where you're based i don't want them worldwide or maybe it's different maybe you don't care it's going to be up to uh to your business really interesting seeing here so approximately 679 000 creators to be able to see this campaign you can see how many creators are already um involved in this and then we've got this content section so this is where you are telling creators what it is that you're actually looking for like what do you want as a business now i've already mentioned this but the creator marketplace was made with instagram in mind and that doesn't mean you can't run the creatives that could be produced here as facebook ads i know most people watch my stuff they're into this for the instagram ads for the facebook ad specifically and but just keep that in mind when you're saying do you want stories you want posts you want reels i mean most of the time i would say reels is likely to be the more appropriate option to then run as ads elsewhere i mean of course you can do it with these other creative types and you can have ads on instagram stories and facebook stories and and and post that feature on the feeds but just something to think through this is built with like organic instagram content in mind but that doesn't mean that you know you can't then take these creatives and run them as ads right so i could say like oh i'm looking for two reels as an example that's what i'm looking for as part of this campaign and you could change that up content details so there's more information in here this is optional but normally you want to add this like okay i want one product demonstration video um where you're actually using the thing i want another video that's talking about um our brand values and why they decided to start purchasing our products because of abc right you know you can add that detail in here register interest by so like this is helping you plan the content like when do i need people to have told me what it is they want um okay i need it by the end of may for example uh date range to boost the content right so this is letting creators know your timeline for the work so that's register interest by so when they need to yes i do want i am interested in this and this is going to be a little bit different so when's is actually going to be run okay this is going to be run for the month of july for example might be something that we're looking to do all right next how much are you going to pay for this right um so okay we want two reels let's say i'm willing to pay a thousand dollars as an example like i said recommendations typically start small look to scale up um with work with larger creators i'm going to say etc etc and because you are making this discoverable this in this example this is going to be more difficult when it comes to those conversations later on because some creators are going to be like well that's not enough for me and you kind of go yeah but i'd pay more for you it's coming back to why i recommend you go with invite only but i want to demonstrate this um as well now this next part is really really important ad boost permission so request permission to boost content into ads this is basically the whole point for my audience as primarily advertisers this is the important part you absolutely want to turn this on so you're saying look i'll pay you a thousand dollars to create me two reels that are going to be featuring my product but i also want to be able to run this as an ad i'm willing to pay an extra five hundred dollars for that and creators will normally want a little bit extra now that is a great deal because it doesn't take any extra time for them but if you can run it as an ad you get to put this creative in front of people for weeks months maybe even years if it performs well enough like a much longer time period so basically you get much more leverage from the money that you're investing here and that's one of the problems with traditional instagram as traditional influence in marketing is that you're saying just post it on your stuff and it goes out and their audience small percentage of them see it for 24 hours probably 48 hours at most right very short-lived whereas if you're running it as an ad then you can um be much more purposeful get much more out of it and then you've got this free product section this is quite interesting um something that's often done if you're going to work with a creator or an influencer um for like a product review you're going to most likely send them some products and you might say you can keep them for free or maybe even have additional products you send them for free if it's something really expensive you might not want to do that but that can just be an added extra on top of the compensation for the actual work and on top of any compensation extra for being able to boost this into uh to ads is you can go ahead and turn on free products and then make a note on what they get and what the free products are and all that sort of thing um and you can also make notes down here on the payments like you'll be paid after a certain time period or whatever it is that you want to do okay then we can go ahead and click next and then we just review and we can go ahead and click publish and put this out into the world i'm actually going to go ahead and click cancel on that because i don't want that to become a real thing and then what i'm going to do is just quickly show the difference if we go through with invite only and how that changes things oh i need a campaign goal increase sales invite only so we've got the campaign name so let's do the same thing product demonstration uh videos and then we put the brand name and then say like what do we say like two reels is what we're after add an image in like we did before so we've got this is all the same setup as what i showed previously we've got the same thing in terms of content details we've got like two reels is what i want and then we've got we can add in content details here um interesting people don't there's no like apply when they need to register interest by because we're gonna this is invite only so we're gonna reach out okay uh let's say i don't know what did we say before last day of july i think to publish this thing uh then go ahead and click next and we've got the same info in here so what did we say we said a thousand for the reels uh we need the ad permission definitely definitely need that the extra 500 yes i'm gonna get some free products and then save and then we're all good to go you don't need to review it and put it out into the world and you also don't need to have that creator um like criteria people need to meet because it's going to be invite only so we can go ahead and then click save and then we can go about um inviting i'm gonna go ahead and cancel that because again i don't actually want to put that in there and then once you have created that campaign particularly if it's invite only if we go back to search and go back to this creator here we can then click invite to campaign right now i don't actually have any campaigns up but if you did you just create that campaign select it and then that would send this creator specifically that campaign so they could see instead of just sending them a message they could see exactly what's included in that right they could see oh okay it's for this much work this much compensation it's this brand and they can quickly and easily decide whether or not that's something they want to do and then from within that campaigns tab you can keep a track of your campaigns and you can see which creators you've messaged about it and communicate from within there specifically about that campaign as opposed to going through that folder within your inbox within meta business suite where it's going to have all the creators that you're talking to just another little thing to to note now another thing that's really important for you to understand about this create create a marketplace and the campaigns you create in here is that meta doesn't deal with any of the payments like that's directly between you as the business and the creator that you want to create um the content for you for and so yeah you need to pay them directly all the negotiations handled directly this is just a free tool that met has provided to make it much easier for people for businesses who want to use influencers want to use creators in their ads or to promote their stuff organically to be able to connect um and it's going to make it easier for creators to find businesses and i think this is a fantastic tool i've been talking about this as a strategy for a very long time it can work so well i've seen it happen so many times and this is going to make it a lot lot easier you also have the benefit when you're reaching out through the creator marketplace of not running into the potential issues of it being a scam to be perfectly honest like i get emails all the time for people wanting to sponsor my videos or get me to post about their products and services and some are legitimate and i have sponsored some videos and things like that because of it um but some of them are you dig a little bit further and you're like oh okay they're just trying to scam me here um which you have to be really careful for so this sort of sidesteps all of that and that will be something that the creators you want to work with are likely aware of if you go through here then um you know it's going to all be a lot easier okay so once you've done this and you've gone through this process and you have gotten some creators to produce some content for you i would get them to post it on their socials organically which is kind of what the creative marketplace is set up for like that makes a load of sense but then also get those uh permissions to run that creative as an ad and that's the more valuable thing for you as an advertiser there are two ways you can go about doing it you can use partnership ads which is what i'm going to show you in a second and what i would recommend or you can just get those creative assets upload them to your ads manager and run them through your own ad account um as you've traditionally would a normal ad now the upside to that second option where you just get the creative assets that the videos typically could be image as well but the videos from the the creator and upload them to your ads manager and run them as ads is that you have full control then you don't need to worry about um anyone else being involved or potentially there being an issue with permissions to be able to run that you can just run it from your own account it'll come from your instagram profile from your facebook page um as as like what it's coming from as a traditional ad would but it's just going to feature that person um in the ad creative itself that's going to help stop the scroll that's going to help engage people within your target audience that much better which then makes it more like to get the click makes it more like to get the conversion so that's absolutely fine way to go about doing it and we've done that in many scenarios it is if you can do it typically better to use partnership ads now partnership ads are more complicated but what they allow you to do is they allow you to run the ad it's still be you have control of the ad campaign you're the one paying for it etc etc as the business it's not going like through their ads manager anything like that but as it's a partnership ad the creative itself where it will come from so you know when you see the ad pop up and you've got the instagram profile and or the facebook page where it's coming from that will feature both you and them just like collaboration posts on instagram so what that means is that when people from their audience from the influencers audience see the ads they will see that this ad is coming from your business because it will have either your instagram handle or your facebook page name on there as well but also their instagram handle and that means they're more likely to feel connected to it more likely to take an action because they're like oh yes this is also from the person um that i follow there is also supposed to be some benefit around um being able to target their audience more accurately because their account is involved as well right so those are the people that you really want to reach for the most part because those are people that are going to pay attention to the ad that much more that's going to make the ad that much more effective and so if it's coming from their account and that's linked within there then the ad is going to be put in front of their followers more than if it's just uploaded and ran through your ad account separately i do think met is pretty good at working out who to put ad creative in front of so i think the benefit of that is not as big as some people talk about because like if we use an influencer in a video ad that we use to run through our own accounts exclusively that ad's going to be put in front of people that follow that influencer meta's going to work that out right but it does certainly doesn't hurt to have their account involved and that gives some extra data and some extra insight and some extra connection and changes who it's from which certainly has benefits so it's worth doing now partnership ads can be kind of tricky to set up with managing the permissions and there's a number of different ways to go about doing that just want to very quickly show you what partnership ads like where that is within ads manager so i'm in ads manager i'm an example ad account i've just created an example campaign i'm going to jump to the ad level and click on edit here not edit next to the name i want to click on edit here and then you can see that right underneath the ad name we've got here partnership ad run ads with creators brands other businesses that's exactly what we've been talking about finding the people to be able to do that with you can turn that on and then you have options to be able to go about um using that and setting up the partnership ad to appear from the two different profiles you can enter in ad codes manage partnerships like i said it's kind of complicated to go about setting these up i'm going to cover that in a whole separate video so make sure you subscribe to that because i'm going to walk you through the exact details and show you how to go about setting these up because like i said this doing it this way is better than um just getting the creative asset from the creator uploading it to your ad account and running it that way so i think this is one of the best new features that met has added to for advertisers for marketers to help them get more out of uh the meta products facebook instagram in particular um i'm really excited about this i think this is going to make things a lot easier for a lot of businesses and be able to do a lot more of what i've been advocating for a long time in in using influences um in the ad creative met is actually making a ton of changes right now uh many of them really good news for advertisers really beneficial they've restructured for example the facebook ad campaign structure so whereas previously you had the manual campaigns versus the advantage plus campaigns that's been reworked so there's effectively one campaign tape but you can still adjust things and do things manually if you would like to at the ad set level which i think is a good move if you want to know more about how that works and how that's going to look check out this video here i got early access to uh to that setup within one of the ad accounts um some advertisers have it now but it's being rolled out over time and you definitely want to know what this looks like before you get it so you're ready uh to use it so go ahead and check this out if you haven't already
