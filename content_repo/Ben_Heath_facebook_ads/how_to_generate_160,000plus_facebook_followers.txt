Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how you can get 160,000 Facebook followers. That's roughly how many followers I've got on my Facebook page. I'm going to show you the steps that I use, exactly how you can implement them yourself.

They aren't time consuming, they're not very costly, these are techniques that most people can use and implement to help build their Facebook page, help build their Facebook following. Before I get into action I very quickly ask you to smash that like button, that really helps me out and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay so this is my Facebook page, I just want to quickly show you obviously that I know what I'm talking about in case you're new to my content, have I gone past it?

So there we go, so you can see I've got just over 160,000 people that follow me on Facebook which by anyone's measurement is a large following. Of course there are larger followings but it's a pretty significant following and it does convey benefit to my business, to me my ability to sell my products and services and actually I'm going to get into what you can do with your Facebook followers at the end of this video. So once I've shown you exactly how you can get a whole bunch I'll show you how you can monetize them, how you can promote your products and services to them, how you can generate value from that audience that you've built.

So I want to get into obviously the things that we're going to do to get these Facebook page followers, get these Facebook followers just like I've done, but there are some things that I need to mention that you shouldn't do first which are really important. So firstly don't buy Facebook page likes or Facebook followers from an external source, that is not something you want to do. There's lots of people and businesses that offer you know pay us $50 and we'll get you 10,000 Facebook followers.

That is not something that you want to do, it's highly likely that Facebook will realize what you're doing, they will ban your Facebook page or Facebook profile. Facebook don't want any of that at all. Those people are almost certainly not going to engage with your content, that's if they even are real people when you get those Facebook followers and it's just all around a bad look okay, so it's just not worth the risk, don't do that.

Also you don't want to go down the organic route. So if you're trying to get Facebook followers by posting you know five times a day and on there and answering comments and trying to get people to follow your page it's yeah you're going to get a handful but it's just not going to be anything substantial. It's not going to work and the reason why is because the organic side of Facebook other than a specific area that I'm going to talk about later has all but disappeared okay.

So it's not like other social media platforms like Instagram where you can post and use hashtags and people can discover your content and follow you that way, just doesn't happen on Facebook. So if you want to generate Facebook followers, Facebook page likes, they're effectively they're not quite the same thing but effectively the same thing, you want to run a Facebook page like campaign through Facebook's ads manager through their ad platform. Now these don't have to cost a lot but it's by far the most effective way from a time standpoint massively from a time standpoint and as you can see with my 160 000 it just straight up works there's tons of other methods that just do not work anymore okay.

So before we get into I'm going to show you exactly how to set up that campaign, how to run it, all that stuff. Before we get into that I want to mention a couple of quick things about your Facebook page first that you want to have in order before you start running that campaign. Now obviously to get someone to like your page there's going to need to be the indication that they're going to get value from liking your page, from following your page right.

Why would I follow anyone on anything if I don't think that there's something that's going to entertain me or educate me or there's something in it for me. So you don't want to do what I'm about to teach you if you've got a brand new Facebook page, Facebook profile with nothing on there okay because when people follow when they come through they check out your profile or your page and they see there's no activity going on there think oh what's the point in this. So take a little bit of time and make it look a little bit more established, a little bit more professional.

So for example like my header image here not very difficult to create this sort of thing you can either do it yourself or get a desire to do it for you very expensively on something like Fiverr, well worth doing just makes me look a lot more professional. In your about section you know include a bit of information in your about section about your page have some contact information if that's you know appropriate for your business you know I've got a little about section here and then post right, post some stuff. So I post content very regularly that's a huge part of my business is posting Facebook advertising, Facebook marketing related content so I've got a blog post in here from a couple days ago, little videos like this all that sort of stuff right.

Now you don't have to be producing that content you could be posting other people's content that's relevant to your products or services relevant to your industry and if you do have your own content fine you could just be posting what you think on your page in written posts you could have images of your products or of your service or of your locations or just information surrounding your business. Super easy way is obviously to post other people's content or relevant content within your industry and you want to do that and put on five six seven posts before you start running a page like campaign because as I said if it doesn't look like there's anything going on no one's going to follow you on Facebook right. So that's just a quick thing that you want to do a little bit of a no-brainer to set you up for success basically and make your not only make it much more likely to get those Facebook followers but then also make them more valuable once they follow you.

Okay so that's the page side of things now let's go ahead and jump over into Facebook's ads manager I'm going to show you how to set up a Facebook page like campaign. Okay so I'm in Facebook's ads manager I'm in an example ad account that I use for demonstration purposes if you haven't run a Facebook ad campaign before you're not familiar with Facebook advertising go to my YouTube channel and just search for like first Facebook ad campaign I have a bunch of videos around that where you can find out exactly how to get started how to get to ads manager how to set up a business manager all that sort of stuff if you're brand new to this which I know some people will be who watch this but if you're a bit more familiar then we can just get started. So I'm in an example ad account first thing I want to do is click this green plus create button and then I want to run a page like campaign so as I said likes follows are not quite the same thing but very similar you're going to achieve your objective of getting more Facebook followers if you run a page likes campaign.

So Facebook have recently hidden the page like campaign objective it's just under engagement so if you go ahead and select engagement and then scroll down you can see that you've got the page likes option here you can just select that and click continue fairly straightforward okay so new page likes campaign is absolutely fine um buying type auction campaign objective page likes don't worry about A-B testing and for this you don't need to worry about turning on campaign budget campaign budget optimization we're just going to be targeting the one ad set again if you're interested in things like campaign budget optimization go ahead and check out um I'll include a link in the video description actually to a video talking all about CBO and how it works and when you want to use it which is most of the time but this is one of the rare exceptions where it's not necessary okay so here we are now at the ad set level we just handled the campaign level now the ad set level now ad sets is where you're going to set your targeting so who you're going to be advertising to and your delivery um settings where you're going to advertise all that sort of stuff okay so obviously make sure you've got the right Facebook page um selected if you've got a number of different options um and then budget look budget is really up to you page likes do not have to cost a lot if you do it well um I would recommend starting with something really small and establishing ahead of time what your objective is you may not need 160 000 uh Facebook page followers like I've got maybe you're after 5 000 or 10 000 maybe you're after half a million but just set your objective I would recommend starting with something really small for whatever your business I mean for me that might be 25 pound a day that for me that might you might be 10 pound a day 10 dollars a day and just see how it performs you can always increase budget you can always decrease budget you can pause the campaign turn it off start with something small see how it performs and project out if you realize that on 10 a day to get to your 20 000 Facebook followers target it's going to take you you know two weeks then you know exactly what that's going to cost and how long it's going to take and all that sort of stuff okay so that would be my uh my recommendation don't worry about the schedule I just recommend starting it you can always come back in and manually turn this campaign off whenever you're ready as opposed to setting an end date before you get started don't worry about custom audiences and that's not really applicable to this Facebook advertising campaign type I've got tons of information on custom audiences though if you want to find out more information about that so the first thing we're gonna get into is the locations okay so the way I've typically done this personally is I've targeted the countries where I know that our customers like to come from so as a business if you're not familiar I own a Facebook advertising agency so we're specialist Facebook and Instagram advertising agency we manage create and optimize um Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns for our clients that's where obviously where a lot of my content comes from I also have courses and training programs on the same topic so not we do have customers all over the world of course but the majority of our customers are going to come from uh the UK the US um Canada and Australia and you can you know that's probably going to be 80 85 percent of our clients on the services side of things and our customers on the courses and training side of things so typically that's where I might personally start running a Facebook page like campaign would be to those four countries and to leave everything else super open you want to leave your page like campaigns as open as possible that's the best way to get Facebook followers inexpensively now doing it this way is going to cost significantly more per follower than doing it the way I'm about to explain and whether you want to do it this way just go after the locations where you are um likely to generate the most majority of your customers from all that sort of stuff is something that you may want to do if you've got significant budget to play with as I'm in you know I'm in a fortunate position with my business to be able to do and you don't mind paying more for higher quality Facebook followers if you want volume which is what I actually recommend a lot of new um or relatively new Facebook marketers social media marketers go for on Facebook is go ahead and get a lot of volume because when you're looking to market your products and services on a platform like Facebook having a few thousand followers is a really good thing for your credibility to make you look more established it's going to help having that presence on the platform is going to help your other marketing efforts on the platform that much more because when people come to your page and they come and check you out and they go oh you know this guy this girl this company's got 20 000 followers like right sure they're obviously legit they obviously know what they're doing so you may want to start by generating a ton of volume um get yourself looking established and then maybe switch to this approach but if you do want to go with volume then what you'd want to do scroll down a little bit is remove these um as i'm doing now the ui is jumping around all over the place making that difficult which is annoying no no no that's not what i want i want to pop in into here worldwide okay now this is the most open and broad targeting option you could possibly use when it comes to facebook and instagram advertising okay um the potential reach as you can see on this right hand side here is 2.1 billion people which is just the most ridiculously enormous audience ever okay um now when you select something like worldwide what facebook's going to do is when you start running this ad campaign is they're going to find the people that are highly likely to follow you on facebook but for the lowest possible price so you're unlikely to see um ad impressions in like western countries or anywhere that has a relatively strong economy to be honest you're going to be seeing a lot of ad impressions in um poorer asian countries poorer african countries depending on whatever language you're advertising in if you're if you're advertising in spanish for example you're going to get a lot of bad impressions in in um less wealthy south american countries um and as i said that is going to reduce your cost per follow enormously it might be a hundred times less than if i'm advertising like i showed previously to say uk us canada or australia so when you're just getting started i certainly did this when i was getting started if you want to get those first 20 000 30 000 facebook followers by advertising to those less expensive um locations or just in this case worldwide so facebook can make up its mind uh for you i think that's a really good idea i think there's very limited downside in doing so facebook's not going to dislike you doing that as a tactic at all because you're using facebook's ad platform to do it you know they wouldn't provide it as an option if they didn't want it to be possible and as i said it gets you established gets you credible which is more important than you think and i don't know your specific circumstance your specific business but a lot of the times having a following that you can demonstrate on a platform like facebook confers benefits outside of it so you may like i do certainly get um offered um sponsorship deals or you know people are willing to sponsor posts on your page people are more likely to have you to interview on podcasts or other youtube videos or things like that because people are searching for businesses and influencers within all markets that have followings that they know can produce content with and all that sort of stuff so it confers a lot of benefits to get started i said once you reach that point you may then either decide i've got enough facebook followers or you then decide to switch over to something like what i would do now which is just target the audiences or the locations where i know the majority of our customers come from because i'm after quality at this point i'm not just trying to get you know i've got plenty of facebook followers i'm now going for um higher quality so the decision is up to you and it's up to your budget unless you've got relatively deep pockets this is how i'd recommend you get started at least okay the other options age gender detail targeting you want to leave open and that's definitely not what we do for the vast majority of facebook ad campaigns but page likes are different facebook is going to go out and find you from within everyone who is most likely to follow your page and they're going to use all sorts of data points that they can use to work that out right and facebook is very good at doing that they know which of their users just followed a bunch of pages let's say your content your business is all around basketball right facebook's going to know that there are tons of facebook users that have within the last day couple of hours started following pages on basketball perhaps someone has just got really into it and they want more information perhaps you know that person is perfect to be putting your ad in front of right now because they're obviously not only interested in basketball but they're also actively finding sources of information and following businesses and content providers in that space okay so that's why you want to leave it as open as possible which may sound a little strange but that's absolutely fine and everything that i sort of don't mention you can absolutely leave and i'm going to get rid of that there you may have seen that warning on the top right hand side it was just talking about connections which is connections here now facebook used to default um they used to default exclude people that already follow your page so exclude people who currently like or follow your page from this targeting um but as you saw may have seen in that warning it facebook have said that that's going away as a feature and finish you don't need it anyway so just don't worry about it just you don't need to add in any connections out of 2.1 billion people the chances that your ad are going to be put in front of people that already follow you on facebook are absolutely infinitesimally small so it's not not something you need to worry about you're not going to waste money on those people so just delete out connections for placements you can just use automatic placements that's absolutely fine in fact if i'll show you a click on manual placements you'll see that there's only a few different placement options that you get when you're running a facebook page like campaign it's not like regular facebook ad campaigns where your ads are automatically going to be shown on facebook and instagram and all these different locations you're just going to be shown within a few places within facebook because that's something that's really appropriate for getting facebook followers right wouldn't make sense to advertise on instagram get someone to leave instagram come over to facebook they may not even have a facebook profile all that sort of stuff okay and don't worry about optimization delivery don't worry about cost controls that's more advanced facebook advertising related stuff that you do not need to worry about when it comes to running facebook page like campaigns to get facebook followers okay so we've just done the ad set level that's everything we need to do at the ad set level now we're going to go ahead and jump to the ad level and we've already removed connections so that's just an error that's popped up by the way that's a good little thing if you're new to facebook advertising facebook's ads manager is super buggy issues pop up all the time just like that don't worry about it often a refresh or using a different browser will sort you right out okay so obviously we've already selected our facebook page and then there's basically a few different elements to the ad itself and you can see the preview down here right so we've got the name of the page which is under my name ben heath that's something i should quickly mention by the way guys if you haven't yet created a facebook page we've just created one you're wondering should you go with your name as a person or your company's name um either way is absolutely fine i would just go with the one that people are most likely to resonate with so with my business people are more likely to know me within my industry as ben heath as opposed to uh lead guru which is the name of my facebook ads agency so that's why i've gone with ben heath i produce a lot of content it's on my name on my youtube channel all that sort of stuff right but just go with the one that you want you think is most appropriate people are more likely to recognize um that's absolutely fine like don't don't need to overthink that or think you're doing something wrong if using company name you're not at all so obviously the headline there is just the name of the page and then you've got here the description underneath that headline is ben heath is a facebook advertising expert that information is just pulled from the about section on my facebook page so if you wanted to change what that says you just want to go back to your facebook page and edit that about section um mine's just uh in fact if we jump back we can see what my what it's drawing here my about info is ben heath is a facebook advertising expert content creator and the founder of lead guru just something very simple clean and easy like that okay jumping back into ads manager now um so okay so that's what's underneath the image has been pulled directly from um the cover photo on my facebook page and that's what's going to default now this obviously as you can see hasn't quite cropped right i would have to i would go back to my designer and get basically that sort of image is absolutely fine like whatever you're going to be using for your cover photo it's almost certainly going to be okay if your facebook page like campaign um i would just get them to crop it a little bit differently because obviously it just cuts off the bend it's almost perfect but um but it just crops off the bend so i'll just get them to crop a little bit differently and then all you need to do is you can see you've got media here untitled is edit you can come in and click change media and select a different option and that will be you know you can in fact if i select on change media here and you can see account images if i go to page images as an example um there's a load of quote posts i've put on my page but this is all the stuff that's you know up on my page and been added um you can just um upload images obviously to your page or into your ad account they'll be available here and then you can go ahead and add them in right and if you wanted to test a few different options run two three four different ads to see which one performs best that's absolutely fine as i said whatever you go with with your cover photo it's kind of going to make sense because it's got to be obviously highly relevant to your page and for people to follow your page they need to understand what it is that they're in it for okay so as i said if you are an e-commerce business perhaps your cover photo wants to display like a bit of company branding along with a few of your images right so if someone's really interested in into i don't know asian food for example having that in the image asian food in the image is going to grab their attention they're more likely to follow you does that make sense having um you know if you're into like weightlifting and that you're paid you're a personal trainer you train people around weightlifting and that's what your facebook page is all about again you would want images of equipment or clients working out and it's going to grab people's attention so just make it relevant in fact something like what i do like facebook advertising is not very easily represented in an image and there are businesses like that where it's like more um education based there's not something physical involved necessarily even a lot of service providers are something physical involved like if you're a roofer you can show roofs if you're whatever and then i'm going to go with an image of me and then explain more information in the text and i know that with me personally there's likely to be some recognition within industry for my name okay so that's why i'm going to go with something this but you might have something quite different depending on as i said whatever it is that your your business is and what's appropriate the guidelines for the cover photo is often going to work well for this image in here and then up here we've got in the primary text um which is this part above the image here we've got that facebook have drawn through um the about information again they then he's a facebook advertising expert content creator and founder of lead guru i don't think that's great for primary text when it comes to a page like campaign i'm going to change that to something like something that's more benefit rich so i'm going to have something like um learn how to generate low cost leads and sales um from facebook okay that's what my that's the benefit that someone gets when they follow me on facebook when someone follows me on facebook the benefit they get is i produce content regularly that shows them how to generate low cost leads and sales how to get results with facebook instagram marketing and that's my whole gig right so benefit rich i think is important and i think for me this is extra important i put something in like this because the image i can't really show like a facebook ad campaign um in my image it doesn't really work whereas you may not need to be quite as benefit rich if you are for example um a kitchen designer and you can demonstrate like a beautiful kitchen that you designed for a client or you are you know uh whatever there's something that's much more visual okay i mean i still structure a sentence like that you want to be short sharp concise nothing fluffy but that's what i'd go ahead and uh and basically pop in and um your ad would look something like this obviously i would just change this slightly to to crop better um you can try editing the media itself right so i could come in here and edit media but you'll see i've played around with this before that the crops aren't quite going to work just because of the original image which is uh you know if i try to do square well that's not going to work is it and horizontal is close but not quite enough you know so that's gonna um that's that's getting close and and i would just get that redesigned and get that to work i said easy to do okay everything else you don't need to really worry about tracking and pixel and all that sort of stuff doesn't really come into it with a page like campaign because you're not taking people to your website or anything along those lines they're clicking on your ad or liking directly from your ad you can see that the page like ad format if i can just get it to scroll there we go the page like ad format has this little thumbs up so someone can click that and they automatically like and follow um my facebook page and i'll do the same when you run a campaign like this so it's not super complicated not something to uh overthink it's probably the most simple type of facebook ad campaign you can run and doing this before you run other types of campaigns or do other forms of marketing on facebook is well well worth it because um as i said it establishes credibility builds your presence and all that sort of stuff so then you can go ahead and publish obviously as i said keep an eye on this you when you come back in if i minimize this down once you've got it running um you can see it's in draft right now you'll start to see results accumulating here you'll see how many you've got how many likes you've got how many follows you've got how many uh how much they're costing you you can start to work out okay if i want five thousand it's going to cost me this much am i willing to pay that maybe i just want 600 to get started with just to give you something on the platform you know that would be absolutely fine but you can come in and monitor this and then when you're ready to be done you're like i've had enough just come in here and turn this off simple done um nice and easy okay so that's how you run the campaign best of luck with it it's fairly it's you know it's not doesn't need to be something that's super complicated or difficult um have a little bit of fun and learn the ropes and build that facebook following big time i mean you can generate you know not spending a lot particularly if you're going with the worldwide option you can generate a thousand likes a day thousand followers a day no problem okay so we've gone back over to the page um and i want to explain about the value of these facebook followers and what you can do with them so i want to demonstrate something quite quickly which i think is important so if i come down here and you see on this left hand side right you can see that over the last 28 days uh the content that i post on my facebook page has reached 24 000 people that's out of 160 000 okay and if i have a look at individual videos this one's reached 832 that one just over a thousand that one 1300 so it's a small small percentage i mean each individual video is reaching less than one percent you know almost one percent but less than one percent of the people that follow my facebook page you might be thinking oh well that that sucks like what's the point in getting these facebook followers if they're not going to see your stuff and i haven't advertised these videos by the way these are just posted onto my page organically um it's something that i do regularly it's a big part of my business so you make what's the point in all that then if you're not getting any any organic reach and you're right the organic reach so turning the people that follow your page into customers is not really likely to happen i mean i'm reaching some right so i've reached what 24 000 out of 160 000 is 15 almost exactly of my facebook followers so it's not nothing but it's not a huge amount okay there are other advantages that come with having facebook followers as opposed to just directly converting these people into customers and by the way i do a pretty good job it is my my whole gig really i do a pretty good job of putting out content as well so it's not like my content's poor quality and therefore if i just did better quality i would get you know more uh engagement from people that follow my page that's unlikely but i just wanted to highlight that point so really want to drive the point home that yes by all means post your page try and try and convert the people that follow your page into customers but don't expect that to be the primary use of of value instead there's two big reasons why you want followers the first one i've already talked about is the credibility the looking established the demonstrating you've got a following so you get invited on media appearances and podcasts and all that sort of stuff which absolutely happens which is all that significant right particularly if you can be running facebook and instagram ad campaigns because people will come to your page before they buy from you they will check you out and if you've got 45 likes yeah it doesn't look great you've got 5000 oh okay this is legit business something going on here but the other thing is a facebook group i'm going to quickly show you that now so this is my facebook ads mastermind group this is a facebook group and facebook groups are different to facebook pages i've got a video explaining differences between the two so you can go ahead and check that out a link will be in the video description and you can see my group has 110 000 members so not as many as my facebook page but still a massive group it's one of the very largest communities of people interested in facebook marketing in the whole world and something i'm very very proud of and one of the really good things you can do with your facebook followers people like your page is once you've linked your group and your page is you can invite these people you see this little plus um invite button you can invite these people to follow to join your facebook group and i've got a whole video on exactly how to build a facebook group i'll include a link um again in the video description that shows you how to go about inviting people how to get them involved how to build a group all that sort of stuff so if you're interested in facebook groups definitely check that out now the reason you want to do this in the first place is because you know i said that only 15 of people who follow my page are going to see my stuff in a month roughly a much higher percentage of people will see what i post in a facebook group there's much much more organic reach so unpaid reach within facebook groups so i would say that even though i've only got 110 000 people in my facebook group versus 160 000 people on my facebook page my facebook group audience is much much more valuable much more valuable to my business in fact we've run the numbers on this and as a company we generate more than seven figures a year from this group in terms of core sales client um fees all that sort of stuff right so this group is has enormous value to my business i've encouraged a lot of people looking to do any facebook marketing um to build a facebook group i think it's absolutely worth it as i said more i don't want to make this video too long so more information on that in the video description below um excuse me a whole video all about that um but that is where one of the massive value points that you get from building a facebook page and building a following on facebook is then being able to invite those people to join your group and tons of people will do it if you try and directly advertise a group it's nowhere near as effective as first getting them on your page and then inviting them um we've tested that a bunch it's absolutely true it seems to be that just joining a group in one go is too much whereas joining a page is one step is like a bit of a commitment and then they can take a bit more of a commitment people know that groups are really involved there's lots of activity all that sort of stuff um but yeah that is the other massive value you get from running a facebook page like campaign so if i jump back to my uh to my facebook page um so hopefully this video has been useful before you go a couple things you should absolutely do the first is go ahead and follow me on facebook if you're interested in what i do and this sort of stuff and how i not only grow my page which you will see but also how i promote content there and all that sort of stuff um then please go ahead and uh and follow my facebook page link will be in the video description go ahead and join my facebook group you know if you're interested in facebook advertising facebook marketing this is the place to be 110 000 people just like you asking questions getting them answered i do free live trainings in this group that's exclusive to this group um it's just yeah it's a no-brainer to join completely free link is in the video description below um if you found this video useful comment below to let me know it's always really appreciated i do answer a lot of the comments i can't get to all of them but if you've got questions pop them in i see them all and i get to as many as i can hit that thumbs up button that always helps me out and of course subscribe to my channel if you haven't done so already um this sort of content i put out sort of in-depth helpful stuff and uh yeah hopefully you'd enjoy seeing more of it and find consuming more of it useful for your objectives uh particularly on facebook and instagram okay thanks a lot guys bye for now and best of luck with it
