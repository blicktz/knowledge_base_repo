Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to create Facebook custom audiences and I'm going to show you how to create Facebook custom audiences in a post iOS 14 Facebook advertising world that we're operating in right now. Custom audiences and how you want to use them have changed a bit so I'm going to show you how to create the Facebook custom audiences as we used to do it and also how we would tailor that now for post iOS 14 and how things operate and how I'd recommend you think about creating your custom audiences and how you think about retargeting on Facebook. Before I get into that I want to very quickly ask you to click that like button please click that thumbs up button that helps me out a lot and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already I release Facebook advertising related content all the time.

Okay so I'm in an example ad account and I'm going to go through this process sort of step by step so let's go ahead and jump over into audiences and I'm going to show you how to create these these Facebook custom audiences step by step. Okay so as I said this is an example ad account and there's all sorts of things in here that you don't need to to worry about um there's a whole bunch of demonstration related things in here but if we go ahead and go over to create audience and then we select custom audience and we see we've got a bunch of options now as you're probably already aware custom audiences include people that have already interacted with your business before so when you're talking about retargeting or advertising to warm or hot audiences on Facebook you're talking about doing so to custom audiences and if you've been playing around with your Facebook ad campaigns you may have seen at the ad set level there's this custom audiences section um and you may wonder what that is perhaps you went to YouTube and searched for Facebook custom audiences and that led you to this video but um but you can see that when you go into the audiences section when you bring up the custom audience tab there's just tons and tons of stuff here okay I'm not going to go through every one because I don't think um that's necessary but what I do want to do is highlight the custom audiences that we focused on previously and we're still going to be advertising to those custom audiences but we're going to be looking to add in a few others depending on what it is you're looking to do on the platform okay so the first thing that we would always recommend doing is uploading an email list and retargeting those people so you want to create an email custom audience so you would do that by selecting customer list if I click on next and then you can see that there are a number of different options and I'm not going to go through the process because it will depend on what you have you can import directly from Mailchimp so if your email list is stored in Mailchimp um it's super easy click on that and go through the uh go through the options you can also um upload your own list you can see it's a download file template you can put in the information that Facebook needs in order to be able to match the people that are on your email list to Facebook and Instagram user profiles that's how Facebook basically works out who it is that you want to retarget um but you can go through the uh the step-by-step process obviously that's not something I can uh I can upload and show of our customers but once you click on there go through that upload those that information and great and what I'd recommend you do is that you create um a custom audience out of your email list so everyone that subscribes to your email list assuming of course you have one if you don't that's absolutely fine and also your customer list again assuming you have one and not just getting started those in my mind will be two separate custom audiences we would have an email list containing all subscribers that aren't haven't bought from us previously and then we have another list that contains all subscribers that have bought from us again you may have one of those none of those all that's actually fine but if you do have those go ahead and upload both and that's going to want to be added into your retargeting mix um and then we come across to website so if I go ahead and click on next now obviously to do this you will need to have the facebook pixel installed in your website and I have videos that show you exactly how to do that so check out the video description there'll be links to exactly how to install the facebook pixel if you're not familiar but what I'd recommend you do here is what we typically do when we're creating custom audiences is we make this 180 days and we go with all website visitors and that's a starting point you can get more specific or more detailed later on but to start with you want to create a custom audience from everyone that has visited your website within the last 180 days okay that's the largest website custom audience that you're going to get and that means that everyone that visits your website um that doesn't have that isn't opted out because they're an ios um 14 user and they haven't opted in um it's going to be tracked and added to this custom audience and that's a fantastic audience to be able to advertise to because of course we know that people on your who visited your website just like people who are on your email list are much more likely to buy or become a lead than people who've never interacted with your business before that's why retargeting so effective it's why you want to be advertising to facebook custom audiences okay so we make this as large as possible there's all sorts of arguments around or shouldn't we be more specific and go with audience that that have only visited within the last 14 days or have only got to the add to cart stage and you can do all that if you want but you also want to be advertising to the largest audience possible particularly in a post ios 14 world because we want to give facebook as much opportunity as possible as many people as possible for facebook to then be able to work out who is most likely to buy who to put your ads in front of um and that's even more important with some of the data that we've lost and some of the people that aren't going to be added into these audiences after the ios 14 updates okay so you want to give that a name click create audience and we've already got that in there so i'm just going to go back um so those would typically pre-ios 14 those would be the three custom audiences that we would be looking to advertise to we'd be advertising to all website visitors um a customer list and an email list as i mentioned if you have them um we may look to add in some more specific ones previously depending on the business if the business was generating just hundreds of thousands or millions of website visitors a month we might get more specific on the website custom audience obviously if it's a different type of business and there's app activity then we look to do that but our sort of standard bread and butter go-to was previously those three custom audiences on facebook that's what we'd be retargeting website visitors customer list email list okay those are your three warmest audience most likely to buy now i think it's worth adding in on app custom audiences in facebook custom audiences or in instagram custom audience as well and that's the stuff that you have down here you can see you've got your sources so that's sort of external your website your app your lists even offline activity for certain businesses and now we've got the facebook sources section now the custom audiences that come from facebook sources i'm going to get into those in a minute the people within those aren't typically as warm as the people that are within your sources custom audiences and that's because they haven't necessarily left the apps they haven't necessarily left facebook or left instagram and taken an action that shows they're really into whatever it is that you have to offer and that's why we didn't include them previously okay because they just weren't as engaged weren't as interested they hadn't taken enough of a step to warrant in many cases being retargeted but we now know that from the your sources the website custom audiences have shrunk considerably because the ios 14 users um the vast majority of them are not going to be included in your retargeting audiences which is a shame but nothing we can do about that so we now think it's best to increase the size of your total custom audience pool on facebook by adding in some in-app sources um for custom audiences and remember that ios 14 restricts facebook and instagram's ability to track what people do after they lead the app so what they do on third-party websites and apps and things like that well if you're retargeting people based on in-app sources so videos if someone's watched a video of yours on facebook or in engage with your instagram account for example um that's not being affected by ios 14 and it's not going to be because that's all within the app itself you're much more protected going forward if there are new privacy rules and things brought in in place these custom audiences are going to stick around even if these continue to be further affected which they may or may not be we don't know so which ones of these facebook custom audiences that you use as a facebook advertiser will depend on what you're doing as a business now if you are advertising using video content or you've got a significant um facebook page following and there's lots of video lots of um views on those videos in there then absolutely one of the custom audiences that you want to be using on facebook is a video viewer custom audience so if i go ahead and select video and click next it's interesting that facebook have put it top and then the way this works is you can create just like you can create a custom audience for people who visited your website you can create a custom audience for people that have watched a video of yours on facebook and there's a number of different levels that you can use here so as you can see facebook have these what's that seven options people have watched at least three seconds 10 seconds 15 seconds 25 all that sort of stuff because i prefer retargeting audiences to be sort of notably warmer than cold audiences i think it is worth going for higher percentages than three seconds 10 seconds stuff like that okay so usually i would be selecting at least 25 often 50 of the video is watched and that means obviously that people would only be added to this facebook custom audience if they've watched at least 50 of your video if you've got a really long video if it's five six minutes long then it's fine to go with a lower percentage if your video is 45 seconds long you may even want to go with a higher percentage so you have to be somewhat um flexible and fluid with this then once you've selected your percentage you want to go ahead and click on choose videos then you want to make sure that you've got the right facebook page selected obviously if you've got access to multiple facebook pages like i do and then you want to go ahead and select which videos you want to apply you can see facebook gives you like view totals so maybe you just want to go with some more popular videos uh maybe you want to go with um all of them that's absolutely fine but just go ahead and select which ones you want to use um let's just take like that and that one for example just a couple of videos that don't actually have many views have only just been published and then retention 365 days is the maximum that's what i recommend you go with with custom audiences the better the bigger the better and provided you still got people that are nicely engaged okay so it's no point as i said not no point but if you're just going with three second video views someone can watch a video of yours for three seconds and not remember you in the slightest um but all things being equal you want to include as many people as possible so 365 days is best give it a name pop a description uh in fact let's just go ahead and do that shall we so example video custom audience and if you you can get really specific and granular with this stuff so if you just wanted to target people who've watched a specific video of yours with the product or service that is applicable to that video and perhaps create different custom audiences for different videos and match them up with products that's absolutely fine i've got more sort of detailed tutorials on how to break that down and things like that just check out my my youtube channel for all that sort of stuff now let's go ahead and click create audience um and don't worry about this for now and let's go ahead create audience custom audience so that was video okay number of different options you can have loads of videos lumped in just go with specific it's absolutely fine we'd normally the way we'd normally set this up now is we'd go with either 50 or 25 video watched 365 days retention and then we would select all the videos that we're using in ad campaigns it's typically how we do it right if you are using lead generation campaigns then it makes a lot of sense to go ahead and try and use uh well not try and use if you're using um lead gen campaigns you will be able to use lead form facebook custom audiences okay if i click next now okay so like with all different types of facebook custom audiences there's a number of different options you can create a custom audience from people who open this form people who opened but didn't submit people who opened and submitted um these people are likely going to be included in your email list or something like that anyway and this is the highest level option anyone who opened this form is obviously going to include those two below so again you can get really granular with this if you want if you wanted a specific retargeting campaign to people who had opened but not submitted that's all fine i'm gonna have more details on that but to start with anyone who opened this form is fine and then go ahead and add in i don't believe there are any lead forms associated with my page at the moment but go ahead and add in any lead forms that um you're currently advertising or have advertised that you think would be appropriate retention for this one maximum is only 90 days and that's what i'd recommend you go with and then let's go ahead and put example lead form uh custom audience okay this is another great warm audience option oh i haven't added any i haven't got any lead form so i'll have to um cancel out that one but that's fine you can see how you just click done and that would be that so if you are running lead generation campaigns and want to be able to retarget want to be able to use facebook custom audiences that's exactly how you do it um there are obviously other options with instant experience shipping events things like that but i want to focus on two of the most common other types of on facebook sources that you're going to use for custom audiences well actually the first one is instagram so if i go ahead and click next after selecting instagram account and then this is another type of custom audience that you can create basically an instagram custom audience so i can see people associated with my instagram profile and again there are a number of options that you can select so you can you could create a custom audience from everyone who engaged with your professional account including facebook gives a lot of great information here includes people who visited your profile or took an action on your post or ad such as likes comments saves carousel swipes you could do anyone who visited your profile people who engaged with a post or ad and people who saved a post or ad um so there are again varying degrees of specificity which one you want to go with will depend on what you're doing on instagram and also how much volume you have if you've got a massive instagram profile okay maybe you just want to try people who saved a post or ad but for most people you want to go with the largest custom audience here and go with anyone who engaged with your professional account that is absolutely fine retention maximum 365 days like a lot of on facebook custom audiences that's what i'd go with and then i go ahead and create instagram um in fact i'll call it example so i don't want to talk about example instagram custom audience okay that would definitely be another one we would look to create so anyone who's engaged with my instagram profile um gets added to this custom audience another good one to create all right let's close that down and let's go ahead and select uh custom audience again and the last one i want to talk about is your facebook page so if i go ahead and select that and click next then we can see that again very similar to instagram so there's people who have instagram who have engaged with your instagram posts instagram ads visited your profile etc you can do the same with your facebook page there's again a whole bunch of different options so you could go people who currently like your page um so i have almost 160 000 facebook page looks i could target those and everyone who engaged with your page so this includes people who have visited your page or taking an action on a post or ad such as reaction shares comments link clicks carousels again that's likely to be a smaller um custom audience than people who like your page but um i've got more information about page likes and the value and how to get them and stuff in other videos so again check out my youtube channel if you're interested in page likes and this current one up here that's not what i'm going to go with right now and not what my default would be so i want to make that clear you do anyone who visits your page anyone who go engage with the post or ad people who could call to action people who saved any posts are similar to the instagram options again most people are going to want to go with the default everyone engaged with your page that's going to create the largest audience most likely other than this one at the top here the page likes but there that's a bit of a different audience um and with the low organic reach on facebook i've got i'm sure a hundred thousand plus people who are like my facebook page that very rarely engaged so that's a sort of different story but that's the option we're going to go with again retention we want nice big facebook custom audiences where possible so we're going to go with 365 days um and let me give it a name so we can go with example facebook custom audience and we're going to create that okay so as i said let's um there are other options you know if you're running events or things like that then that might be something you want to play around with i'm not going to include in this video because if i went through every single option it would be three hours long and it's not going to apply to the vast majority of people that watch this the vast majority of people are going to be well served plenty served with um the three i mentioned up here assuming you're not an app-based business but the three i mentioned up here the customer list email list website visitors and then video viewer custom audiences lead form custom audiences instagram custom audiences and facebook page custom audiences now you don't have i've created i've sort of demonstrated the four main ones but it's probably quite unlikely that you would be using all four because if you're not running lead generation campaigns you can't use lead form if you're not running video ad campaigns you can't really use video so they would be out it may be that your business you're advertising almost exclusively on facebook almost exclusively on instagram either way is absolutely fine but again that's going to affect which one of those you you want to focus on if all your ads are going through facebook and instagram custom audiences isn't going to do anything for you so you may end up with all four but you may end up with two three absolutely fine go ahead and create those okay and that's what we're going to be looking to add in so i'm going to do now is jump back to ads manager and we're going to go and have a look at an ad set and show you how you add in these facebook custom audiences and how we would set this up in a post ios 14 world okay because things are things are slightly different now and we have to adapt okay so here we are back in ads manager i've got a new conversions campaign set up actually so let's go ahead and select that and let's go into the ad set level it's obviously where we do our targeting um so let's scroll down now to this one here so let's get rid of the lookalike that was for previous video just please ignore that um okay and let's add in some stuff here so we can add in all website visitors so we've got a website visitors and audience and you can see that facebook's literally telling you the size of your website customer audiences may decrease they definitely have decreased um because of ios 14.5 we know that and that's a lot of what this video is about right so we're going to add that in we're going to add in you know um uh email list i've got an email list in there not not one that i created just now but one that's just in the account and i don't believe there will be a customer list in here which will be the case with a lot of you guys yeah there's no customer list so if you had a customer list you could absolutely go in and add that in or you could just add an email list but that would be the setup okay now often we would have customer list in here as well and that would be the three that we used to target but now we're going to want to add in those other ones if possible so we're going to want to add in an example facebook customer audience so those people that engage with our facebook page right much bigger pool of people we're going to want to add in the instagram and in this case we're going to want to add in video we can't add in lead form because um in this scenario my page we i don't run lead generation campaigns on my page well i have done for testing purposes but not typically and that's absolutely fine that may well be the case with you so this is a good example but that's often what we will look to now add in to our retargeting ad set and that is how i'd structure things by the way a retargeting ad set as opposed to a retargeting campaign and i'd have this within a cbo campaign if you want to know more about that check out there'll be a link in the video description below to a video all about um how to structure a facebook ad campaign it will show you how we structure our retargeting ad set not a retargeting campaign but we'll look to add these in now you have to be somewhat flexible with anyone's content including mine and apply it to your own specific circumstances this is often what we're going to look we'll start with now in the post i was 14 we're going to add these three at the bottom but if you have a massive email list if you've got you know i've got 45 000 people on an email list and i don't even know what my website visitor audience would be but big um we may not look to add these three in because the people in these custom audiences aren't going to be as good quality as the people in website and customer as custom audiences that's very important so it's a quality versus size trade-off right like that's how it works if you believe that these audiences up here your all website listeners and your email list custom audiences are quite small then absolutely you want to be adding in these other custom audiences if these up here are really large and established then this becomes a lot less necessary so you have to apply it to your your own individual scenario okay um a lot more established facebook advertisers larger ad accounts things like that probably aren't going to want to add these in and the other thing i obviously want to mention like all things facebook advertising related is test very easy to go ahead and test how a facebook page custom audience performs does it do well see you're seeing the data yes improved our performance no it worsened our performance if it did well keep it in if it didn't take it out you found out a really valuable piece of information and it hasn't cost you the world and you can then move on very very important thing to always keep in mind when it comes to anything facebook ads related including your facebook custom audiences okay so hopefully that tutorial has been helpful
