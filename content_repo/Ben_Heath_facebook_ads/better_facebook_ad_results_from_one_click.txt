So a few days ago, I got a very interesting email from Meta and I want to share it with you. Now, they are claiming that with a simple tweak to your Facebook ad campaigns, you can get 13% better results on average, which sounds amazing. But I think there's some really important nuances being lost here.

So in this video, I'm going to explain what Meta are recommending we do and whether or not you should actually do it. Okay, so this is the email that came through from Meta. The subject line was winning ad start with this optimization, which I thought was pretty punchy to begin with, which is interesting.

And then right at the top of the email here, they've got Advantage Plus placements. That's what they're talking about here. And they're saying improve ad performance with Advantage Plus placements.

You see here, Ben, small businesses who used Advantage Plus placements or Six Plus placements in their campaigns achieved a 13% lower cost per action, CPA, on average compared to campaigns that didn't. Now, Meta is trying to push Advantage Plus placements and they have been doing so for a long time. It actually used to be called Automatic Placements.

They changed the name to Advantage Plus placements because that sounds much better, doesn't it? Sounds like you're going to get an advantage. It's going to help you improve your results, which is obviously what they're claiming happens.

And Advantage Plus placements, if anyone's not familiar, is just all the placement options. So when you create your Facebook ad campaign, it's saying, look, Meta, I'm happy to put it on Facebook, Instagram, feed, stories, reels, audience network, everywhere that you've got as a placement option and that you can think to put on the platforms where ads do appear. I'm happy for you to go ahead and do that and put them all over the place.

And over time, they've been pushing advertisers more and more towards this. You do have the option to select manual placements instead and say, no, I only want to advertise in certain locations. I only want to advertise on, say, feeds or stories or reels.

I don't want to advertise on everywhere else. But Meta's really pushing towards Advantage Plus placements. So they've done that by changing the name.

They've also done that by making it the default option. So if you're thinking, oh, I've never actually checked the placements, you are using Advantage Plus placements if you haven't changed it. And they're actually hiding the manual placements more and more.

So it used to be really obvious. You'd see like what used to be called automatic placements and then manual placements. You could make a decision as advertiser.

Now, when you go through a campaign, you have to sort of click in to find the manual placement settings. It's sort of a layer hidden and then you need to go ahead and change it. And with some campaign types, you can't even change it at all.

So if you use, say, a manual sales campaign or a manual leads campaign, you can do what I described and change the manual placements. If you don't, if you use Advantage Plus campaigns, Advantage Plus shopping campaign or a tailored leads campaign, it's just fixed. You're going to be using Advantage Plus placements.

You don't have any flexibility around that. Now, I'll explain why Meta are pushing Advantage Plus placements or the reasons why they're pushing Advantage Plus placements because there's more than one in a second. But before we do that, let's dig into this claim a little bit more and take a look at the wording because it's really important.

Okay. So they claim that you get a 13% lower cost per action when you do so on average when you use Advantage Plus placements or six plus placements. And a 13% lower cost per action for just clicking one button is amazing.

Who wouldn't want that? That could massively improve the profitability of your ad campaigns, right? But notice the wording.

It's cost per action, not cost per conversion. They are different things. A lot of advertisers get those two mixed up because if you're running a leads campaign or a sales campaign and you're optimizing for leads or sales, then your cost per action is the same as your cost per conversion.

But not everyone is running a leads campaign or a sales campaign. Some people are running traffic campaigns or engagement campaigns. And that action will therefore be different.

What the campaign is optimizing for will be different. It could be optimizing for link clicks. It could be optimizing for video views.

And if you think about how meta works, there are higher quality placements and lower quality placements. When you're running a leads or a sales campaign, your ads are rarely put on the lower quality placements, things like the audience network, because those placements don't convert as well. But if you're running a traffic campaign, an engagement campaign, something like that, where you're not optimizing for a conversion, the lower quality placements like the audience network are a really good place to get cheap actions, to get cheap link clicks, to get cheap video views, to get cheap reach and impressions, if that's what you're optimizing for.

Now, it makes sense to do that because they're cheaper and meta's thinking you just want link clicks. So they're like, great, let's get cheap link clicks. So that's what they do.

But does that help your business? Not really, because there's a reason why those link clicks are cheaper. It's because they're lower quality and less likely to convert.

But that's all factored into this number here. That's factored into the 13%. And of course, if you were to take your traffic campaign, let's say, and switch it from just advertising on feeds, let's assume you're using manual placements, just advertising on feeds, and then go with advanced plus placements and advertise everywhere, you are absolutely going to see a significant decrease in your cost per link click.

Does that then translate to better results for your business, for people going through and taking meaningful actions for your business, like purchasing, becoming, etc.? Probably not, but it is going to be factored in to that 13%. So if switching to advantage plus placements or using advantage plus placements doesn't actually help your business get what it wants.

Now, there are scenarios where it does, by the way. I'm not always against advantage plus placements, so I'll talk about that a little bit later on in the video. But if it's not necessarily delivering the improvement in results that meta is making it seem like it does, why are meta pushing this?

Why are they pushing advantage plus placements? Well, we have to be aware that meta has ad inventory to fill. And if all advertisers just run ads on, say, the feeds on Facebook and Instagram, or stories on Facebook and Instagram, and didn't use any of the placement options, then meta couldn't run ads on those placement options.

They would serve less ads. They would make less money. So there is absolutely an incentive for meta to be able to fill ad inventory and make more money by convincing advertisers to use advantage plus placements.

And that's what a lot of the tweaks have been designed to do. So whenever we see recommendations or advice from an ad platform itself, a lot of the times those pieces of advice are good because they want us advertisers to get better results. Because if we get better results, then they know that we will stick around for longer, we will spend more money with them.

That helps as well. But there are always scenarios in which they will make a recommendation that will make them more money and isn't necessarily in the best interest of advertisers. And this kind of falls into this category.

I think it does some of the time, not all of the time. I talked about there being new ones here. I'll explain more about that in a second.

Before I do, I want to quickly let you know about something I'm really, really excited about, I think you're going to really like. And that's my brand new course with community called Facebook Ads Mastery. So basically, I've packaged everything that we've learned as an agency, spending more than $50 million on meta ads, running ad campaigns for our clients, generating more than $200 million in revenue from those ad campaigns.

It's literally the strategies, the tips, the techniques that we use to get those great results for our clients. It's also the material that we use to train our new staff members. It really is the best possible stuff.

And it comes with a full school community as well. So there's tons of interaction in the school community with me and the members and sharing information and helping each other out and all that great sort of stuff in there. There's weekly live calls and trainings included.

The starting price is just Â£97 per month. If you're interested, there is a link in the video description. I very much hope to see you on the inside.

Okay, so so far in this video, it might sound like I'm very down on Advantage Plus placements and I wouldn't recommend you use them. We always use manual campaigns and that is not true at all. We use Advantage Plus placements all the time, but there are scenarios where we do and don't use them.

I think this is really important to understand. So we will use Advantage Plus placements if we are using a conversion-based campaign objective and optimizing for the conversion as well using the performance goal, of course. So if we're using leads or sales, for example, then we know that Meta is going to try and optimize for a lead, optimize for a sale.

So we're quite happy for Meta's AI to work out where to put our ads on the platform. If you think that the best results come from Instagram, put them on Instagram. If you think the best results come from Facebook, put them on Facebook.

If you think the best results come from stories, put them on stories. The best results come from reels, put them on reels. And it's nice to give Meta that flexibility because what you'll often find is that, yes, the best placements might be, say, feed, stories, and reels.

But they then have the flexibility to put an ad in front of someone or the only audience network if they've already engaged and Meta's thinking, we just need to get an ad in front of this person one more time and we're going to push them over the edge and they happen to be somewhere else where we can put a placement. You know, we can stick one in an in-stream video and get this person over the line. So if you've got a conversion-based campaign objective, great, absolutely, Advantage Plus placements is the way to go.

And most campaigns should be those. And that's why we use Advantage Plus placements with most campaigns. But if you are not using a conversion-based campaign objective, so use engagement, traffic, awareness, it is very important that you don't use Advantage Plus placements for the exact reasons that we described.

You need to use manual placements and I would recommend that you limit it to the highest quality placements like feeds, stories, and reels. Otherwise, Meta can get you really cheap clicks, really cheap video views, really cheap reach and impressions on those lower quality placements. And those numbers are factored into that 13% lower cost per action claim, which is why I don't think that's good data.

I don't think that's necessarily good advice to go on. There's that nuance there. And if you do have one of those campaign objectives, you have to go with manual placements.

Otherwise, you are likely to see a better cost per result, a better cost per action in that column within your Meta ad account, but will it be overall better for your business? Will those people then, like let's say you're running a traffic campaign to an Amazon, you sell products on Amazon, you're sending them there. Are they then more likely to go on and purchase if you're using Advantage Plus placements?

I think not. I think those people are then more likely to go on and purchase if you use manual placements and go with the higher quality placements. And the reason why I use Amazon example is because there's obviously tracking difficulties in terms of being able to optimize for like an actual purchase in that scenario.

And there are other examples where that sort of thing happens that forces advertisers to use traffic engagement awareness, etc. I talk a lot about my omnipresent content strategy. With that, we use the awareness campaign objective.

Very important that you use manual placements with that as well. Also, before you go, have you heard about the huge changes to the Facebook ads learning phase? If not, I explain what's going on in this video here.

It's really good news for us Facebook advertisers and can completely change the way we run Facebook and Instagram ads. It's something you have to know about if you're running ads on the platform. So go ahead and check it out.
