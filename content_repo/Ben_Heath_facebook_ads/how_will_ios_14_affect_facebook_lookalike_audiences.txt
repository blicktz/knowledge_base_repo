Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about how Facebook lookalike audiences are likely to be affected by the iOS 14 update and the changes that Facebook is currently making in response to what Apple have done and the new rules that Apple have implemented. I've recently created quite a bit of content around iOS 14 and how that's impacting Facebook ads or how Facebook's changing its platform really is what's impacting us as Facebook advertisers. And in those videos I've had a lot of people commenting saying what about lookalike audiences, how a lookalike audience is affected.

I know that so many Facebook advertisers, us included, are reliant on lookalike audiences as their highest performing cold audiences. It's where you're able to scale your campaigns, you get your best cold audience results from. They're absolutely fantastic, we use them for almost every single client and I'm sure a lot of you do as well.

So people are worried about how lookalike audiences are going to be affected. That's what I'm going to address in this video. Before I go into that I just want to quickly ask for you to smash that like button, please click that thumbs up button, that would really help me out.

And of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. So I'm not going to go into the details too much of iOS 14 and how that's impacting Facebook advertising changes. I've got other videos on that so I'll include links in the video description below to those talking about what the changes are going to be and the likely impact of those changes.

I just want to quickly say that the impact of iOS 14, the good news is that it doesn't seem like it's going to be anywhere near as impactful as we first feared which is fantastic and means that a lot of the best practices and all that sort of stuff are going to hold true as we move through these changes that are currently being implemented and sort of as I'm recording this and that's the great news and Facebook ads can continue to be a fantastic platform and all that sort of stuff. I also very much expect as a result of that that lookalike audiences are going to continue to be the best performing cold audience targeting option for the vast majority of Facebook advertisers. I do not expect that to change.

So in order to work out given that that's the case what how our lookalike audience can be affected are they going to be less effective are they going to stay the same etc that's what we're going to discuss in this video. So I'm an example Facebook ad account because I'm going to show you a few different elements here. Whenever we're assessing lookalike audiences and how they operate and how they might be impacted we need to look at the two component parts right so there's obviously your custom audience that you create first that's your source audience that's the group of people that you're giving to Facebook for them to then go on and create a lookalike audience from that group of people so find people that are very similar to that source audience and again I'm not going to show talk too much about how to create lookalike audiences I'll include a link to a video below that shows you exactly how to do that in a lot of detail shows exactly how they work why they're so awesome and all that sort of stuff so check that out if you're if you're not familiar with the process.

But when we're assessing lookalike audiences as I said we need to assess the custom audience we also need to assess the process by which Facebook creates lookalike audiences and how therefore that might be effective so two component parts. So the first thing is is the custom audience now it really depends what type of custom audience you use to create your lookalike audience from as to how much you are likely to be impacted so if I go into create audience and then click on custom audience we can see again I'm not going to go into details on this video links to videos in description for lookalike audiences custom audiences all that sort of stuff but you can see that what we've got here is a number of different custom audience sources website customer lists etc some are going to be more affected than others a lot of people will create lookalike audiences based off of people that have visited their website or website visitors perhaps um everyone is added to cart all that sort of stuff that custom audience is going to get smaller as people opt out of being tracked by tracked by Facebook with the iOS 14 update Facebook is not going to be able to track as many people therefore if you're sending traffic to your website um not if Facebook's capturing you know let's say 80 percent of those right now they never quite get 100 maybe 90 something like they never quite get everyone perhaps that will decrease by 10 or so so if you have 100 people visit your website right now Facebook's able to produce a custom audience for you of let's say 90 people out of that that might go down to 80 because we're not going to be able to track as many people i don't think it's going to be that much more significant than that because remember obviously the iOS 14 update only affects um people on iOS devices right so all your Android devices absolutely fine carry on as usual it's also only going to affect the people that opt out and even the people that do opt out um we're not going to be completely blind as to what they go on and do on your website it's not like if they opt out we can't track anything we know that's not the case we know we can still see one conversion event things like that so customer is going to get a bit smaller but not a huge amount so what does that mean for lookalike audiences well in general it's better to have larger source audiences to create lookalike audiences from because the more data you give to Facebook you know if you give Facebook 100 people and say create me an audience of people that look like them or you give Facebook a thousand people and say create me an audience that look like them the thousand person source audience for the lookalike is usually going to be better Facebook's got more data they can create more accurate lookalike audiences so i think in terms of smaller custom audiences so smaller source audiences for those lookalikes we are going to see an impact particularly if you create them based off website visitors if you're doing things like uploading a customer list you know an email list perhaps um or you're basing your lookalike audiences off on from on Facebook activity so people who've let's say viewed a video you know Facebook sources here people have viewed a video of yours on Facebook as your source audience for your lookalike perhaps people who have submitted a lead form as your source audience for your lookalike interacted with your page Instagram account all that's basically not going to change there's no reason why it would um it's really just going to change obviously app activity as well but mainly for most advertisers your website customer audiences are going to be smaller the rest of your customer audience is going to stay the same you know Facebook can still track what people do on Facebook so all of this stuff down here video views um you know engaging with your Instagram account Facebook page lead forms all that stuff the custom audiences are going to be the same after these changes more or less as they are right now um customer list and email list well you're uploading the data from an external source right so that doesn't really change um it's really just the website so which is probably the most common type of um of custom audience to create is based on website whether that's based on people who have purchased on your website or based off people that have uh you know visited certain pages or just anyone who's visited but it's probably only going to affect that and even that that it affects i'm you know might make your audience 10 smaller it's not the end of the world by any means okay so the custom audience side of things has affected a bit but nothing to panic about so now we know that once you create your custom audience you then go ahead and you know create a lookalike i mean i'm not going to go through the process here because you know you can create lookalike and you'd have to select a source audience and you'll see that in the other video content that i've linked to in the video description if you're not familiar with that process so how does facebook create a lookalike audience well basically when you give them the source audience facebook has tons of data on that group of people okay so let's assume you've uploaded a customer list of a thousand people right well facebook then analyze you go all these people have bought from me i know that this type of person is just the sort of person i want to advertise to facebook please go out and find me people that are similar to them that's the mechanism by which lookalike audiences work right and facebook's lookalike audiences have gotten better and better and better over the years because they have so much data on that thousand people that you've uploaded so they can then go and be like oh well we've worked out that the ideal prospect for this uh company is a woman who is 42 who has who lives in this location who is very active online who is interested in x y and z okay now with these changes the ios 14 changes the ability for facebook to acquire as much data as they currently do is going to be curtailed but not by as much as we first feared a bit so the process by which facebook takes a source audience and makes a lookalike audience from it is going to become slightly less effective but it is going to be very slight okay so facebook's not quite going to be able to track as much data from what people do once they leave facebook and instagram and go onto your website other people's websites and do all sorts of things but they're not losing all that data by any means as i've already said if someone click even if they opt out you know again this only affects 50 of the users then it only affects within that 50 of the people that opt out and even the people that opt out we can still track what they do on your website or anyone's website to some extent not in as much detail as we have been able to but we can still do it to some extent so let's say for example you know someone is showing an ad for sunglasses and they click on it even without getting to the website facebook's like aha this person just clicked on an ad for sunglasses or even just a post on facebook or perhaps they're part of a group that shows that they're interested in soccer or whatever it happens to be facebook has tons of places to gather data not just what they do on on someone's website and then it's not like all that website data is going to go away so they've still got all the on facebook and instagram data that they gather which is very significant and they've got the vast majority they're still going to have the vast majority of the data that they get from when people go on to um someone's website and the interactions they have online and all that sort of stuff okay so basically i imagine that lookalike audiences are going to get ever so slightly less effective than what they are currently maybe five ten percent less effective so you might see if you're advertising to the exact same audience you might see a five or ten percent increase in your cost per conversion something like that now if that's make or break you're in trouble anyway um you can't you it's not sustainable for you to be that close to the wire over a long time period and it can be made up for in the case of lookalike audiences by just increasing the size of your source audience by 10 or 20 for the most part which usually is just a question of time that's why lookalike audiences get better the larger the source audience becomes and basically the more time goes on so we've got lots of clients we've worked with you've been running campaigns for like three years and in year one we were targeting lookalike audience based on previous customers and they did well but now they do significantly better because you know there's i don't know 50 000 customers that have been generated and that data is so valuable um so don't panic don't think well how are lookalike audience going to be created are they going to go away are they going to not work not work i don't think that's the case at all as i'm recording this video in january there are you know the changes that are coming facebook's response to ios 14 is being implemented sort of as we speak you know we're seeing it in some ad accounts not in others things popping up right um it may well be that your campaigns and your ad sets targeting lookalike audiences go a little bit haywire for for a week or so maybe a little bit longer whilst facebook recalibrates so if you if you watch this video and you think oh great lookalike audience still gonna be fine that's good that's what you should be feeling and then in a week's time or two weeks time you have four or five bad days don't think oh you know ben was wrong look like audiences are done we're never gonna do it again obviously facebook is adjusting a lot of its internal processes and systems right now so just be mindful of that then there might be a little bit of a dip as they recalibrate but i am absolutely convinced they're going to come back and they're going to perform um very similarly to how they do now i don't think lookalike audiences are going to be hit too hard particularly if you're creating lookalike audiences based off of a customer list or an email list or you know either external to your website sources or or app um or on facebook stuff like you know people have watched videos of yours on facebook none of that's going to change right people who have uh submitted a lead form open lead form none of that's going to change okay so hopefully that puts your mind at ease and prepares you for what may be coming over the next uh weeks and months okay hopefully that video has been useful couple of things i want to mention uh before you go first is
