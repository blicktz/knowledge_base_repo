Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook ads estimated daily results. It's something I've received a lot of questions about recently. There's a lot of people seeing poor estimations, Facebook's estimating they're going to get very poor results and that's stopping them from running campaigns, making them worried.

So I thought I'd talk about what that actually means, the estimated daily results and what you can do about it if you do see poor results in this video. So before I get into that, I just want to very quickly ask you to smash a like on this video, click that thumbs up button, that would help me out and be much appreciated and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and you haven't done so already. Okay so I'm in a Facebook ad account, I've brought up an example campaign with an ad set.

This is just an experimental campaign that we've been running that's just all about generating Instagram followers and having a little play only on tiny budgets. We've got a whole bunch of ad sets up with tiny budgets on at £5 a day. Now this is actually a reach campaign, as I said we're experimenting with a whole bunch of different things but the part of the point of this video is to talk about what's going on over here with the estimated daily reach.

So Facebook is estimating that for £5 per day we're going to reach between 39 and 113,000 people with this campaign. Okay so the first thing you can see about estimated daily results is that the window they give you is enormous. So the difference between reaching 39,000 and 113 is what two and a half times as much?

So that's a huge huge difference between those windows. So the first thing they'll do is they'll give you a very broad estimation that may or may not be useful. The other thing that's important and I'm going to read out what Facebook say about this estimated daily results down here.

So they say the accuracy of estimates is based on factors like past campaign data, the budget you entered and market data. Numbers are provided to give you an idea of performance for your budget but are only estimates and don't guarantee results. That's very important and it's absolutely crucial that if you've set up a Facebook ad campaign and you've seen poor estimated daily results or particularly good estimated daily results that you basically ignore that.

I get questions about this all the time people say I set up my campaign it's saying I'm going to generate zero leads a day should I still do it? And I'll say yes run the campaign after five seven days you will have a much much better idea of how many leads, sales, whatever it is you're optimizing for you're going to generate than what the estimated daily results will give you when it comes to setting up your campaigns. These estimated daily results are notoriously inaccurate particularly if you have a new Facebook ad account or a new campaign that doesn't have much data.

This campaign's been running a little while but even that window is very wide and in my opinion very generous. I cannot imagine that for five pounds a day we're going to reach 113 000 people even though this is a worldwide test and the target audience as you can see the potential reach up there is um is enormous um I don't buy it I don't think it's very accurate. So I can understand why Facebook provide estimated daily results a lot of people want some sort of indication of what's likely to happen but I think this often does more damage than good more harm than um than than benefit because it stops people taking action it makes them rethink it.

I've seen people try and change elements of their campaign to try and help improve this number and you think no ignore that run your campaigns two things happen you'll actually see the conversion data the reach the whatever metric you're going for so you can make a a judgment based on that but also you will give Facebook more data which will actually help improve your estimated daily results so when we run campaigns for quite a long time you can then go back in and their estimates of what you're going to get let's say when you change budget they'll give you you know an estimated daily results like this um when you change budget those will be more accurate they can still be way way off by the way guys so it's not something that I want you to worry about in the slightest it's not something to really focus on and you can see here you've obviously got this section on the right hand side you've also got this this part here where what Facebook's trying to basically show you is that look the more you spend the more results you get in this example they've got a bit of a a kink here in the line which is very important I've talked about this in a lot of detail which is when you scale Facebook ad campaigns at some point your cost is going to increase obviously more than just a scale amount so what I mean by that let's say your cost per conversion is 10 pounds um if you scale beyond a certain point you will not generate a cost per conversion of 10 pounds that will increase that's because you're targeting larger audiences people are less specific and you're having to reach more people etc etc so Facebook kind of showing that in that little drop off there you can see once you start spending your reach is not going to keep going up and up and up and again this I think is somewhat of a a sales tool to be perfectly honest to try and convince people to um spend more because you know they put them on the graph right down below and they're like look if you just spent more you could have this monstrous reach these huge amount of conversions these huge amount of link clicks but it's not very accurate I think it's very helpful just my advice is if you're getting stuck at this point or you've seen this pop up and you're thinking what is going on my advice is just to give it a go don't spend a huge amount don't break the bank think of it as money to learn money to test not to um generate a return on and you're going to very very quickly find out you know what Facebook estimated I'm going to get 15 leads a day I'm actually going to get about four leads a day or vice versa Facebook estimator is going to get no leads a day we're actually ticking along nicely at eight to ten leads a day and you'll find that out really fast so that'd be my recommendation just wanted to quickly cover that and help you guys not worry about the estimated daily results just explain basically what's going on there so hopefully that's video hopefully that has been useful before you go
