Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about how you can retarget on Facebook after iOS 14. We know that with iOS 14 we're less able to track what people do on our website which means that some of the retargeting capabilities have been curtailed, particularly around retargeting website visitors and the various options within website visitors that you could or you used to be able to retarget very effectively. There are some things that you probably want to change, some things that you want to adjust, that's what we're covering in this video so you can still retarget after iOS 14 and it can work really well for you.

Before I do that, I want to very quickly ask you to smash that like button and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay so I am in the audience section of an example ad account because I wanted to be able to show you this. Now typically what I used to recommend always when it came to retargeting was that unless you have an unusual business model where no one ever buys anything from you again, I would have typically focused on three retargeting audiences to focus on so we would have had all website visitors, we would have had your customer list and we would have had your email list.

Now you can still retarget all three of those and the iOS 14 is not going to affect your ability to retarget your customer list or your email list in terms of those audience sizes but it may well have shrunk your all website visitor retargeting audience which is not ideal, certainly not something we want to have to deal with but that's just something's happened, nothing we can do about it, how do we overcome that problem? I think you want to be adding some on Facebook or on Instagram custom audiences, some retargeting audiences into the mix to help bring the overall audience size back up. Typically from those three retargeting audiences that I mentioned it would be the all website visitors where the majority of the volume would come from and that's the one that shrunk.

So we want to we want our retargeting audiences to be nice and large, we know that Facebook performs better with larger audiences so that's what we're going to be doing in this video. So in the audience section if you come in to create audience go to custom audience which is of course what you need to create to create to be able to retarget is you need to retarget custom audiences and if you're not familiar with those I've got tutorials on exactly how to create Facebook ads custom audiences I'll include a link to those in the in the video description below but we come in here and you can see that typically we'd have focused on perhaps website audiences website visitor audiences so retargeting people to visit your website as I already mentioned customer lists email things like that but you can see that you've also got Facebook sources and this is where I'd encourage you to look and play around with to add things in you can see there are lots of different options a classic one to go with would be video so you click on video and you click next and I'm not going to go through all the steps I've got separate videos on this but you can basically re you can create custom audiences from people that have watched a video of yours okay and you can get quite specific instead of it just being all videos you can choose specific videos or you could choose multiple videos you can even specify the percentage of the video that someone needs to have watched in order for them to be added into this custom audience so you can all the way as small as three seconds all the way up to 95% of the video I would normally recommend something like 25% I think is a good option but you can go ahead and and create custom audiences let's go back based on video views if you're running video ads that's a great one to do and lead forms if you're running lead ad campaigns you can select this option and you can create custom audience for people that have submitted um you know the data to become a lead or even have just opened the lead form and shown some interactions um not going through all these you can do um you can create custom audiences based on people who have interacted with your Instagram account whether that's through ads or organically which is a fantastic tool you can create custom audiences based on people who have interacted with your Facebook page perhaps have clicked on an ad of yours or sent you a message and things like that so these are fantastic custom audience options to be able to add into your retargeting mix now typically or historically I didn't use these retargeting audiences as much because they didn't tend to be as good quality as the other ones mentioned but I think that now given the changes have been made is still a consideration that the people on there aren't as good quality but the the added volume that they bring more than makes up for the reduction in quality and as we know Facebook is pretty good at working out who within your target audience is most likely to take your desired action whether that's purchase become a lead etc so I don't see a problem with adding these in in fact I think it's beneficial hence why I'm creating this video to get people to for example if we click next on this then we can see that you know you can create a custom audience of anyone who's engaged with your page people who like your page anyone who visited people engage with a post or ad you know there are various options that you can use and that's something I would look to play around with look to add in and look to work what works for your business we often find that people who have watched a certain percentage of videos can work very very well for certain businesses okay other times we want to go based on Instagram interactions and a custom audience based on Instagram engages produces good results so have a little play around think about where your audience is likely to be obviously if you're not running lead ad campaigns then you can't go ahead and use the lead form option if you're not running video ads you're not going to be able to use that but have a think about the various options and likewise if you're you know using events for example then you can focus on that I haven't focused on those options because they're not as common as some of the others but I look to add those into retargeting mix see how they perform and always be responsive to the data and that's something I should quickly mention around all my video content is I often recommend things that we've seen work for our clients in fact that's nearly always what I'm doing but you always have to test it for your specific business you know we have some things that work really well for some clients that don't work for others so you may find that people who've engaged with your Facebook page is a great audience people who've made but people who've engaged with you on Instagram is not test these things out and see how they perform and if you have seen a real drop off in performance from your retargeting campaigns or retargeting ad sets which we have seen quite a bit of with the iOS 14 changes not with everyone but with some people in particular then this we feel so far is a great way to help combat that and we have seen some good results simply because of because of volume these are still warm audiences right they're still people who've interacted with you before so it's better than a pure cold audience they're not as warm obviously as someone on your email list but the added volume in the retargeting campaign certainly helps and it means that you won't have to refresh ad creative quite so much when you've just got those small custom audiences small retargeting audience you're constantly refreshing ad creative that's time consuming um this is a good way to go so look to add some of those in what i typically might have now is a retargeting ad set still going to have all website visitors still going to have customer list email list but we may also have anyone who's watched more than 25% of a video ad of ours on Facebook or we may have anyone who has engaged with an ad of ours um on Facebook which you can access via the Facebook page option okay that's the sort of thing we might and we might add in both we will test a bunch of options constructed that way that's the sort of thing i'm talking about here okay so hopefully this video has been useful before you go a couple things i want to quickly mention the first is a free webinar i've created called three killer
