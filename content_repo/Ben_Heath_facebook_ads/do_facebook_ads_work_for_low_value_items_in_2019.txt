Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and today's Facebook advertising question is, do Facebook ads work for low value items? This is a question that was asked on my Facebook ads mastermind group and someone actually asked, is it worth advertising anything on Facebook that costs less than $600? And the answer is absolutely.

Facebook's a fantastic advertising platform for many e-commerce businesses, the vast majority of which have average order values much lower than $600. In fact, of the clients that we work with on an e-commerce basis, I would say that nearly all of them, Facebook and Instagram advertising is their lowest cost per acquisition channel, it's the best channel for acquiring new customers for them. We've got lots of companies that we work with, their average order value is $30, $40, some as low as $20 and we're still able to make sales profitably.

So if you have low value items that you want to sell, if you've got an e-commerce business, something like that, and you're thinking, is Facebook ads going to work for my business? There's a very good chance that it will. Don't think that it's just for high to get items.

That is not true. Thanks a lot guys. Bye bye.
