In this video, I'm going to show you three things that people miss with their Facebook ads all the time. These three missed opportunities cost them a lot. And by going through this whole video, you can make sure that you aren't missing out.

So the first thing that Facebook advertisers miss all the time is they don't zero in on the most important metric, the most important data point, and focus almost exclusively on that. They use other bits of information, other data points to make decisions, to adjust their campaigns. And that leads to Facebook ad campaigns that are not optimized properly.

It's quite an easy thing to miss, quite an easy thing to fix. I'm going to show you exactly how now. I've got an example campaign up that we ran that was designed to generate leads via our website.

And I want to quickly ask you a question looking at this data. So ignoring the bottom ad set, because that's a warm audience ad set, and that's different. We'd expect that to get great results.

Out of these other five ad sets that were all cold audience ad sets, which one delivered the best results? Now, most people would come in and say, oh, it's ad set four. That delivered 826 website leads.

That's the best performing ad set. None of the others even come close. I would disagree.

And I would disagree because whilst it does have the highest volume of leads, it does not have the best cost per lead. And that's what matters more. For me, ad set five at a cost per lead of £1.59 performed better than ad set four.

It's the cost per lead in this scenario that is by far the most important metric that you should be making your decisions around, that you should be turning things off or leaving things on based on, not on volume. Okay, that's really, really important. That's something that a lot of Facebook advertisers miss, and it costs them big time over the long run.

Now, of course, if we've got ad sets that are delivering almost identical cost per lead or cost per result, whatever happens to be, and one has more volume than the other, then yes, that ad set is performing better than the one with lower volume. But in a scenario like this, where ad set five is delivering a cost per lead that is a good 25, 30% less than ad set four, that is the best performing ad set, and that may lead us to make adjustments such as pausing ad set four. In this case, we'd certainly be looking to pause ad set three, ad set two, and optimizing that way because we want to optimize for the lowest, in this case, cost per lead.

For you, that might be cost per message. It might be cost per purchase. It depends what exactly you're optimizing for, but that's what matters.

Don't miss that fact. Don't look at volume or look at other things like cost per link click and things like that. Those are distractions.

Focus. That's really important. The second thing that Facebook advertisers miss all the time is the importance of ad creative.

Ad creative is often something that Facebook advertisers feel they do well, almost from the start, or it's not something that they think too much about. They're more focused on the settings and the other parts of Facebook ad campaign. But ad creative is what separates the average Facebook advertisers from the truly elite Facebook advertisers.

And I know that Facebook advertisers focus on other stuff from my experience over the years, but I also recently polled my audience and asked them, and they said that targeting was the thing that they struggle with, they find the hardest. Targeting is a lot more simple and easy to get right than ad creative. A lot of Facebook advertisers think there's this secret audience they just haven't found yet.

And if they get the targeting right and they set up the right exclusions in our audience, they'll find that audience and then the results will be fantastic. That's almost never the case. If you've been through my tutorials on my channel about how to do targeting, you've probably got the right setup.

You're almost certainly advertising to the right people. It's actually the ad creative that's going to make the difference. As I said, that's what separates the amateurs, the ones that produce average results, from the truly elite that produce fantastic results.

So I would really encourage you to hire that professional photographer, that graphic designer, that videographer, whatever it needs to make sure that your ad creative is beautiful, it's engaging, it's eye-catching, it's professional, it represents your brand how you would like it to be represented. That's the big difference maker. The importance of ad creative is an easy thing to miss, but please don't.

Instead of spending all that time tweaking settings at the ad set level, changing the targeting options, I would encourage you to focus on ad creative. And I know that it's not something that a lot of your competitors are going to do because they fall into the bracket of Facebook advertisers that don't think it's that important. So it's even more of a competitive advantage for you if you do focus on ad creative.

As you can see in this poll, not only did targeting come out as number one, ad creative actually came third also behind sales funnels. That's crazy. It's much more important than that.

So that's something you shouldn't miss and a potential real improvement for your results if you can get this right. Now, before we get into the third and final thing that Facebook advertisers miss all the time, I want to quickly let you know that my company, Lead Guru, can create, manage, and optimize your Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns for you. We offer that done-for-you service.

If you're interested, you can find out more. There's a link in the video description below. So the third thing that Facebook advertisers miss is that your Facebook ad campaigns have to be delivering fantastic results before you scale them.

Scaling is not a solution to problems. A lot of Facebook advertisers think that, oh, I'm just not spending enough money. If I spent more money, my results would improve.

That's clearly the problem here. So even if they haven't got campaigns that are performing really well, they increase the budget. It invariably doesn't go well.

They bring it back down. They get disheartened. Maybe they stop advertising on the platform.

It's crucial that your Facebook ad campaigns are delivering good results, results you are very happy with before you go ahead and increase the budget. And contrary to the popular belief that your Facebook ad campaign results will improve as you scale, they actually do the opposite. Most of the time, you're going to get a better cost per result at a lower budget level.

As you start spending more, you're going to get a worse cost per result. Now, of course, as you spend more, you might get more volume of leads or sales, but your ROAS, your return on ad spend, and your cost per result is likely to be worse. In this graph, Facebook let us know this, right?

This is a perfect example. So here's a campaign, and Facebook are estimating, this is Facebook's estimated results, that at $150 per day, we're going to generate four purchases through this campaign. Now, if we increase that up to 300, if I can get it almost exactly, there we go, $300 per day.

So we've doubled the budget, but we haven't doubled the results. We've gone from four purchases to seven purchases, okay? And then if we were to go up to 450, if I can get it on the right spot, there we go, we go from seven purchases to nine purchases.

So you might be thinking, okay, well, if I get four purchases at $150 a day, if I 3X the budget, then I 3X my results, right? I should be on 12 purchases. Not the case.

If we keep going, you can see that as the graph goes, it slowly tapers off more and more and more. So the more you spend, the worse, in most cases, your cost per result, whether it's, in this case, purchases, or your return on ad spend, is likely to be very important. That's why the campaigns have to be doing really well at the initial stages, so that you then have the ability to scale, and as your cost per result increases, it's still within an acceptable parameter for you.

It's still, okay, our cost per result is increased by 20%, but that's still profitable for us. We can keep going. And the reason this happens is because Facebook is very, very good at working out who is most likely to purchase or become a lead or whatever it is that you're after.

So when you're spending a small budget, they go after the very, very tip of the spear in terms of the best possible people for you to advertise to. As you spend more, instead of being super focused, you go a little bit wider, a little bit wider, a little bit wider, a little bit wider, and you've still got good prospects that you're advertising to when you say 3X your budget, but maybe some of those people aren't quite as perfect as the people as when you've got a smaller budget. That's why that happens.

Nothing anybody else can do about it, but it's something you need to be aware of, something you need to not miss because it's very important about scaling and making sure you don't waste money. We've covered three things that you really don't want to miss in this video. And it's also really important that you aren't making any big mistakes with your Facebook ad campaign setup.

In this video, I cover eight really costly mistakes that tons of Facebook advertisers make. I strongly recommend you go ahead and check it out. You do not want to be making any of these mistakes.
