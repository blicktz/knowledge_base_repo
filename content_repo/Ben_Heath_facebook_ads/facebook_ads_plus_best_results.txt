Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about the other digital marketing channel that you should be using alongside your Facebook advertising campaigns in order to get the best results possible. Now before I get into that, I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button, click that thumbs up on this video, that'd be much appreciated and help me out and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Now what I've got right in front of me, some of you may recognise this, but it's a MailChimp dashboard and the title of this video was Facebook Ads plus blank equals the best results and that's email marketing.

The blank is email marketing. I think that email marketing complements Facebook advertising very, very well and I would strongly encourage you to not only engage in email marketing but also make sure you dedicate some time, some effort and some resources to doing it well. You know just ticking that box isn't good enough.

I know a lot of people might have a monthly newsletter for example, that's not the sort of thing I'm talking about here, that's not really going to move the needle. Now to sort of quickly demonstrate the value of email marketing, I've got my dashboard here and then I'm going to quickly talk about, I'm going to show you some of the elements, some of the things you need to do to get the most out of email marketing when combined with Facebook advertising. So you can see here, this is within my MailChimp account, as I said some of you will recognise this, you can see that right now I have 28,557 people on an email list, which is not a massive list by a lot of digital marketers standard but a reasonable size list, bigger than the vast majority of people that are getting started at least with email marketing or Facebook advertising, anything along those lines.

I do actually have slightly more people than this on my total email list for my own business. I have other platforms like Klaviyo that have other stuff on there but this is my biggest one, this is my biggest list here is in MailChimp and I wanted to show you that that's sort of number of people that I've got in there and then I want to scroll down and show you this section here, this campaign engagement right. So my email marketing doesn't have the best engagement, the best sort of open rates and things like that in the world but it's still tremendously, tremendously valuable for my business.

So you can see that over the past, the time frame there is over the past 30 days I've sent, well I had delivered 217,000 emails, so that's how many people, 16, almost 17,000 people have opened and we've generated just under 1600 clicks. So immediately you can start to put that in terms of what that's saving me from a cost standpoint. You know if I was to run Facebook ad campaigns to generate the same level of engagement, there's a monetary cost associated with that.

You know if you're running conversion campaigns you might be seeing $1.50, $2 cost per click, we can immediately see that that would be worth you know $3,000 a month that I'm obviously not paying in terms of a MailChimp subscription to be able to send these emails to these people. It's you know it's significantly less than that. So there's an immediate advantage there in terms of the cost saving that you can get from having a channel where you can reach your prospects, reach your customers without having to pay an advertising platform to put ads in front of those people again and again and again.

But the benefit of email marketing along with Facebook advertising is much more than simply I can reach people without having to pay again even though it's significant. It's also the relationship difference you can start to build with these people. Now the people on my email list are people that have opted in for something.

You know they've said yes I'm interested in your content, I want to be part of your list and they've taken that action. That's a really big action to take. Reaching that person and getting that person to click on a link is much more significant to my business than putting an ad in front of someone again on Facebook because as I said they've signed up for my webinar for my Facebook ad template something along those lines they've shown they're very much interested, they've shown they've liked my stuff and that's why so being a click from someone on my email list is worth a lot more than a click from someone in a cold audience, even a warm audience to be honest, through a Facebook ad campaign.

Now I'm not saying do email marketing instead of Facebook advertising, I want to make that very very clear. They work really nicely in conjunction with each other. You run a Facebook ad campaign and when I say Facebook I mean Instagram as well.

So you're running a campaign on Facebook or Instagram that's going to generate the initial interaction that you have with your prospects. So depending on the strategy you're using it could look a number of different ways. It could be if you're running a direct to offer campaign so you're directly selling a product or a service, it could be that someone then comes to your website, let's say they buy a product, okay, they purchase a product from you.

Well depending on what they tick and privacy notices and GDPR and all that stuff they may well end up on your email list. The Facebook ad campaign is what got someone to become a customer in the first place. But extracting the maximum value from that person is going to come after that initial transaction if you're an e-commerce business for example.

And email marketing is such a huge part of being able to get the maximum value and maximizing the value that a customer has to your business is enormous. The difference between let's say someone coming to your website buying something from you once for let's say $40, let's say your average order value is $40, if by using retargeting campaigns on Facebook I'm not just going to use email marketing to do all the follow-up process, I'm absolutely going to be retargeting those people as well. So you know we're not abandoning the Facebook advertising once we've had that initial transaction with them, we're going to keep doing that.

But in addition we're also going to be sending emails to these people. If instead of just that initial $40 transaction you can get them to buy on average twice again over the next 12 months. You know some businesses are going to be lend themselves much more to repeat purchase than others, I appreciate that.

Some businesses are going to have wider product ranges so you can sell lots of different things to them. But if you can take that $40 customer to be actually be worth $120 because you've got two more purchase at an average order value of $40, that is going to change the finances and the numbers on your ability to run Facebook ad campaigns and acquire customers at scale enormously. If your customers are only worth $40 to you perhaps you can only afford to pay $20 to acquire a customer which is doable but being able to acquire 10,000 customers a month with that sort of cost in place might be quite difficult.

But if instead you know your customers are worth $120 to you and you can afford to pay $60 or even $40 to acquire a new customer well you can almost certainly do that a massive scale. You could spend an enormous amount on a Facebook Instagram ad campaign provided the campaign set up well and acquire customers and have that be very very profitable for you. So increasing average customer value is absolutely key for e-commerce businesses, direct to offer businesses and things like that and email marketing is such an important part of that.

What I really like to do with those sorts of businesses is tie up your Facebook campaigns with your email marketing. Okay so if you're running a let's say a Black Friday sale make sure you are retargeting the people that are on your email list on Facebook and Instagram and emailing them about the special offers, the discounts, the Black Friday stuff that's coming up and what your prospect or your customer if they've already bought from you previously will get a sense that you're everywhere. You know that you start to create this sort of omnipresence approach where people can see you whenever they go on all various different platforms of their device.

Okay and that's a way I really like to use it for direct to offer. If you're using let's say a lead magnet or a webinar strategy whereby instead of getting someone to buy initially perhaps you're offering a service or a product that's a bit more expensive you don't think you can get people to buy straight away. Perhaps you're going with an approach whereby you're getting them to opt in for a lead magnet or a webinar first and then you're going to be retargeting those people on Facebook to get them to purchase.

You should also be heavily engaging in email marketing right there as well. That's when you want to be sending, you know, putting them through an autoresponder sequence. It's when you want to be emailing them consistently with the same things that you may do with a Facebook ad campaign on the retargeting side of things to help convince them to buy.

Customer testimonials, demonstrations that you can deliver the results that you know your prospects are interested in. All the things that we talk about in the videos that helps get your prospects from not ready to buy to ready to buy. Demonstrating your expertise, all those sorts of things you can do through email marketing alongside your Facebook ad campaigns.

And then of course if you're running an omnipresence content strategy, which is another thing I often talk about particularly for high-end service providers and things like that, once let's say someone's inquired into your business, they've signed up for a lead magnet, they've taken an affirmative action to get someone to your email list and that's when you'd be retargeting them with the various pieces of content in your omnipresence content campaign, absolutely want to be emailing them then. You absolutely want to be emailing them. I've got various things like if you sign up for my Facebook ad template or my webinar, you will get a five, seven, ten day email sequence that's designed to do a whole bunch of things.

It's designed to demonstrate my expertise, it's designed to show you what great results we've been able to achieve for other businesses, it's designed to offer you discounts, get you to purchase our courses or inquire into our services, all those sorts of actions that you can get people to take. And I think people don't engage, a lot of Facebook advertisers don't engage in email marketing for a couple of reasons. One is effort, it takes time, you know it's not a huge cost, they want the silver bullet, the Facebook ad campaign that just makes their business super successful.

So they're sort of shying away from the steps they need to take to help guarantee their success, to put all the pieces of the puzzle in place to have a machine that can generate customers for you very profitably. So a lot of it is the time aspect and the thing that's kind of tied into the time aspect is that people don't really see the results from it early on. Now I see incredible results from my list but as you can see on this list alone I've got 28 and a half thousand people.

If you've got 200 people on an email list are you going to see tremendous results on it? Probably not yet. Doesn't mean it shouldn't be done and it doesn't mean that you shouldn't practice and start developing the habits now so that when you do have 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 people on the list it is a significant part of your business.

You don't want to all of a sudden get to that point and go right now I'll engage in email marketing. You haven't developed the skills, you haven't built that relationship with the people that are already on your list. You start emailing them and be like who's this guy emailing me?

You know what's going on here? Start now and yes you may not see fantastic results in the short run but in a year's time, in two years time when you're building this list either by generating customers, by advertising a lead magnet of some sort, this could be absolutely significant and I'm in a situation now where I can send out an email, let's say we're running a sale on one of our courses for example, I can send emails out about that to my email list and we could generate £20,000 which is $25,000 from one email to our audience. It really is that that sort of thing is possible for my sort of size audience and my level of engagement and I know email marketers that do way more than that, orders of magnitude larger, you can stick a zero on that easily and particularly those that operate in industries that you know Facebook advertising which is my sort of wheelhouse is really quite niche there's only so many people interested in that but in other industries people I know operate in the health and fitness niches and things like that they can they have much larger lists they can get much people more people on an email list and they can send out emails and and it be their main source of revenue be absolutely significant they can you know spend an hour writing an email as I said generate a quarter of a million dollars by doing that that's absolutely possible happens all the time so I want you to get in the mindset of yes I'm running Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns but I'm also developing my relationship with my prospects and my customers I'm convincing them to purchase or inquire into our services through email marketing as well no matter what sort of Facebook advertising strategy you use you should be using email marketing as well and it may not be significant now but I can assure you if you generate and get enough people on this list and you do it well it will be it'll be very significant and I think one of the big things I always come back to especially when I do consulting with businesses who aren't engaging much in email marketing as I said what is the downside here yes it takes some time and effort but the costs are minuscule absolutely tiny for me to be able to send you know an email to 220 or 220 000 emails in a month um you know I my mail description is probably 200 pounds a month maybe something like that maybe maybe a bit less 150 pounds a month that's it that's that's the cost plus my time that's the cost so what is the downside in me in me um engaging in this I know that the potential upsides are massive so something I would strongly strongly encourage you to do and I think it goes really nicely with Facebook and Instagram advertising and I think a lot of people ask me like what else should I do should I when that you know they know they're running Facebook ad campaigns and they're like should I be doing uh should I be doing YouTube ads should I be doing LinkedIn ads should I be doing SEO and all this sort of stuff and I like businesses in general that focus with their digital marketing channels so I think you should not be trying to advertise on five different platforms at the same time particularly if you're a small business if you've got you know a particular specialist to work on each one of those platforms for you then absolutely go for it but if you're trying to work this out yourself don't stretch yourself that thing become an expert in one but everyone should be engaging in email marketing okay if you're running a Facebook ad campaigns email marketing is a no-brainer and the two together deliver the best results it's what all the best marketers are doing they put a significant amount of effort into email and it becomes more and more significant over time as I've said okay so hopefully I've really sort of drilled that home and you've got got the message on that one that uh that this is a really important component and really helps improve the profitability of your Facebook ad campaigns and improve the profitability of your business before you go couple of three things quickly want to mention the first is a free webinar I've
