Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to give you an absolute game changer when it comes to your Facebook ad creative and your Instagram ad creative. Tons of Facebook advertisers, they're trying to improve their results. You might be testing new images, new videos, new slideshows, making adjustments to colours and copy elements and often things that get you incremental improvements and that's absolutely stuff you want to do.

It's something that I recommend but if you want something that's going to make a big difference all in one go, sort of as close to a silver bullet as you're ever going to get with Facebook ads particularly when it comes to the creative side of Facebook ads, this is it. What I'm about to share in this video is it. So I think you're going to find this very useful, very interesting.

Before we get into that I just want to very quickly ask you to hit that like button, that really helps me out and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new. I release Facebook advertising related content just like this all the time so if that's what you're into I think it'd be well worth doing. Okay so to help explain how we're going to talk about the significance of this I've got an example ad in front of us.

Now I'm in an example ad account and this ad is part of the Facebook page like I campaign I created a few days ago whilst recording a separate video all about growing a Facebook page following and you don't need to worry about the specifics of this ad you know it's not even it's not even edited right you know part of my name is cut off but I wanted to use this because I wanted to highlight something about this ad that you don't tend to see very often in Facebook ads that can make a big difference. This ad has got a picture of me in it okay now we know that when we're running Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns we are trying to convince people to take a certain action whether that's purchase become a lead etc etc and we use all sorts of tools at our disposal to do that we talk about the price point being competitive we talk about the benefits associated with the product or service but one thing and this is not unknown in in digital marketing space is there are certain individuals certain people that will have influence over your target market of course commonly referred to as influencers I'm sure you're familiar with influences and an influencer marketing to some extent now that's a whole um sort of channel of digital marketing now as influencers on Instagram YouTube etc but I think one of the underappreciated opportunities for using influencers is to instead of contacting an influencer getting them to let's say promote your products or services via their Instagram profile which is absolutely something you can do but what I would encourage you to at least test is getting permission obviously you're gonna have to hire them to do this but getting permission from that influencer to use their likeness use images of theirs or maybe even video if they're going to record video in your ads not just get them to promote your stuff but use that in your ads okay now the reason why I wanted to highlight this is because I have somewhat of a name and a brand within the Facebook ads industry if a let's say a Facebook advertising related piece of software okay let's say it's a targeting software and I get contacted by these sorts of businesses all the time so I absolutely know this is the sort of thing that they're looking for I basically always say no but um but I get contacted for this for these opportunities if they were to run ads with my face in the image or with my or me recording a video perhaps talking about the software and how good it is and all that sort of stuff that ad is almost certainly going to do significantly better than the exact same equivalent without that because there will be enough people within their target audience that perhaps a part of my Facebook ads mastermind group or have watched video of mine on on YouTube that are interested in Facebook advertising that my face is going to help get them to stop scrolling and it's also going to help lend some credibility if they like my content of course and if they trust what I put out it's going to lend some credibility to the product or service and as I said this doesn't have to be me promoting it myself um it could just be me being in the ad that that company is using now I obviously you know I across platforms maybe have an audience of half a million people okay so there are influencers with much much larger audiences in all sorts of different industries there are also influencers with smaller um audiences so you can find you don't just have to work with massive influencers you can find them that that operate at your level but I think there is a big difference and this is the thing that I really want to get across on this video you can take your exact ads right now like let's say you're running a video ad that's talking about your service okay if you can get someone that's known within your space to you know add it on to the end of the video to to provide an endorsement of that service that might half your cost per lead likewise if you're trying to sell a product and we've and I know this because as a as a Facebook ads agency we've done this a number of times we've had clients we've worked with that have uh agreements with influencers we've instigated some of that stuff ourselves and you the difference is night and day it really is and that's why I call this video game changer because it can be a game changer now we're not in in these scenarios we're not getting the influencers to promote it themselves we are using their brand to help our ad campaigns perform better that could be with an image like this it could be with uh video you know depends on your ad creative and what you're doing we've run we've run image ads where there's someone that's recognizable and and is liked and trusted within the industry in the image just kind of like the example right here where it's just kind of like a headshot alongside the rest of the image ad perhaps promoting the products with some text you know highlighting the benefits versus the exact same ad without that and yeah you can generate a cost per purchase that's half or sometimes even better than the equivalent with everything else being equal which you know makes a lot of sense I think this is something that is not being done a lot at all but can make a really big difference there are certain industries where this is more important than others if you operate in a really competitive industry a lot of e-commerce businesses a lot of drop shippers operate in hyper competitive industries where there's very little differentiation if someone can buy very similar products and services to yours on amazon or from other facebook advertisers which for many businesses that is true to the order of tens of thousands of other advertisers advertising shoes or whatever happens to be right um you need to build a brand to distinguish yourself now you can do that yourself and take the next three to five years to do it or you can massively speed up that process by leveraging other people's established brands and using those using that to help massively increase your performance I mean I said this can be an absolute game changer and often what you'll find and we've certainly found this is that influencers will be more willing for you to say look we just love to use your image in our ads we'll send you the product please only accept if you like it think it's useful um we'll pay you a fee for it they will often be more willing to do that and charge less for that service as opposed to promoting it to their own audience because influencers and this is something that me as a sort of small influencer within the facebook advertising space I know that I don't promote much other people's products and services and things like that because a I don't really have the time to vet them to make sure they're good and b I don't want to just be constantly promoting stuff to my audience so most influencers are going to be somewhat where they're going to have an idea of how much promotion they want to do when you say to someone um we're going to use your likeness your brand in our ads that's less of an issue for them because they're not thinking oh that's another sort of check mark against me promoting to my audience they're not having to do that okay so often you can get away with um paying significantly less than if you're getting an influencer to promote to their audience and of course once you've got permission you could spend you know half a million on that particular campaign you could spend even more you could or you could spend a lot less but it's the same the scalability there and the the ability to use that is is is there and available and ongoing which is what makes it really powerful okay so how do you go about finding these um influencers then like um and I think that one of the things that I really want to get across because I've had the conversations around influencer marketing particularly with combining them with um Facebook ads is people go oh we don't have the budget to engage influencers aren't they really expensive and there's influencers that completely span you know you have influencers even in the digital marketing space that have millions and millions of followers then you have influencers like me that have followers in the hundreds of thousands you have influencers that have a couple thousand I mean you watching this video are an influencer over an amount of people if you've never started business that have any following that might just be 20 family and friends but you would have influence if they asked you about okay you know I know you're into watches what sort of watch would you recommend you would you would be able to influence their purchasing decision so you can absolutely find a level to fit your budget obviously the larger the name the larger the profile the more of an impact it's going to have but you can start small start really specific see how things perform and work your way up okay so how do you go about finding these instagram these these influences so because we're using Facebook ads and Instagram ads I think the best place to start looking is on Instagram so what I'd recommend you do is obviously come into Instagram and then make sure that you're and you may already be aware of a bunch of people in your space but for for more and you may think okay I'll reach out to those people and that's exactly what you want to do by the way just send them a message I get these literally multiple per week I'll get something asking me to promote via YouTube or or to my Facebook group around some sort of product service software in in the Facebook ads industry so it's certainly something that's done a lot and so you may already be aware of the sorts of people you would think I'd love it if that person was involved in my ad campaign and you know worst thing is they'll give you a price it's too expensive or they'll say no fine move on to someone else there's loads but if you're not or perhaps you already know the really big names and you want to work with some smaller ones I would just come in and start following tons of hashtags around whatever it is that you offer and just monitor them see who's using those hashtags check out their profile who comes up regularly who has who has engagement you know who has an audience that that that engages that shows that they actually do have some name value and some brand in the industry so let's say we were selling um like dog pet related products right you know I could come in here and search for like um dog training for example okay I could search and then I could you know the dog training hashtag and you know you can obviously go through the post but I would recommend that you spend a few hours go in I'm not going to do it because this is not relevant to me but go in and follow a whole bunch of different hashtags um around the things that are relevant to the product services you sell and have it as part of your sort of to-do list going through and ticking and checking things and all that sort of stuff okay that's step number one second thing to do would be just to come into google and search for uh instagram influencers I did a little practice dog training okay and you'll you'll find some good examples again these might be quite large um influences at this point maybe a little bit too much but maybe not you know here's someone that I've no idea about that person or instagram profile but that's someone that's popped up uh Dave's another one that's popped up there um you can just go through and take a bit of time and just go through the pages in google who comes up as instagram influencers in this case dog training or instagram influencers whatever your name happens to be okay um there may even be uh publications that have helped consolidate this information so you've got the pet people to follow top 10 dog influencers being consolidated there well worth going through and if you are on the lower budget side of things and don't want to pay a huge amount for this um I'd recommend being more specific in your search terms so if it would set a dog training which might be a bit broad maybe it was something like recall dog training and it might prevent you know provide you with someone that really specializes in that and therefore you know if you were I don't know selling really long leashes that allow you to do recall training like 10 meter long leashes allow you to do recall training long lines um then you could you could use that and that might give you the sort of thing that you're looking for so those would be the first two tactics what I did in in in Google you can also do in YouTube um I think there is an advantage so like obviously influencers can have a following in various different locations I think there are advantages to being somewhat Instagram and or Facebook focus given that's where you're going to be advertising like if you were to take YouTube influencers for example and then run ads with them on Facebook and Instagram it might not have quite the same impact as someone who's more active on Facebook and Instagram so if you take Facebook as an example um like you know I have a large Facebook group so I would be a really good influencer to run Facebook like to run Facebook ads more than perhaps someone who had the same size audience but over on YouTube okay I hope that makes sense and then of course if you don't want to take the time to go through this there's other options you can use some of the um well there's tons now of actual influencer platforms where you can find other influencers where you can um things like upfluence is probably the most the the one that most people talk about um they do cost more money obviously than finding yourself but they provide um a much greater time saving a much um more streamlined approach to finding people and and don't overthink this like find someone test it out pay a bit of money don't break the bank see how it performs wow this was a significant increase um in performance and just remember that when you are looking to invest in something like an influencer appearing within your ads on both Facebook and Instagram if you spend say 10% of what you're planning to spend on your ad campaign which might amount to quite a lot of money if you're planning to spend a reasonable amount on this ad campaign and it improves your results by more than 10% which if you pick someone who's relevant it almost certainly will that could be way more than worth it right just run the numbers on it so you might balk at oh this is going to cost a lot but actually if it gets you a 10% improvement it's paid for itself 5% improvement and it may well get a much larger improvement than that and as I said in certain industries where that are hyper competitive you need to stand out you absolutely need to stand out and an influencer is as close as you're going to get to a silver bullet that just takes you there if you if if you know that your audience are being advertised to by advertisers and this happens all the time in dropshipping you're being advertised to by advertisers that offer a very similar product at a similar price point that is where you get your competitive advantage um well that's where you can straight away it's by using influencers so um so yeah give that a go definitely let me know how it goes in the comments before
