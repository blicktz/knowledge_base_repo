Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from LeadGuru and in this video I'm going to tell you about five Facebook advertising metrics that I think you should really be tracking and if you keep on top of them and make adjustments based on the data you see can really help you get better results from your Facebook ads. Now before I get into the steps into those five tips I mentioned there's something I want to quickly mention now and that's at the end of the video and we talk about a couple of free Facebook advertising resources I think you'll be really interested in so make sure you stick around until the end. Okay so what are the five metrics?

Well before we get into that just quickly I'm assuming already that you're tracking cost per conversion and the number of conversions that you're getting that's obviously the primary metric you should be tracking with your Facebook advertising that's what you're going to base the vast majority of your decisions around if you're not tracking that data then that's an added bonus for you keep an eye on that that's what you should be basing the majority of decisions around because of course conversions whatever that means for your business is what you want at the end of the day and what you need to optimize for whether that's purchases leads etc etc okay so with that said what are five other Facebook advertising metrics that I think you should track and that should form the basis of your analysis and what you use to then improve your campaigns etc etc so the first one that I mention is frequency frequency shows you how often people within your campaign ad set etc you can look at frequency at the three different levels campaign level ad set level or ad level how many times someone within your audience has seen an ad on average so let's say for example your frequency is 2.5 that means that on average someone within your audience within your target audience has seen your ad 2.5 times like I said that could be at the campaign level so it could be you know how many what's the frequency across this entire campaign so how often on average has someone within my audience seen an ad from this campaign it could be the ad set level it could be at the ad level as well you know how many people have seen how what's the frequency for this ad specifically now the reason why you want to keep an eye on frequency is that as frequency climbs too high you are likely to see a drop off in results particularly with cold audiences so with cold audiences people that don't know you haven't interacted with your business before once frequency reaches 2 to 2.5 we usually start to see a drop off of results and if you think about it that makes a lot of sense because at that point on average everyone within your audience will have seen your ad twice maybe slightly more than that and if someone's already seen it twice there's a good chance that they're either going to have taken the action you want them to take whether that's you know click through to your website or fill out a lead form or whatever it happens to be or they are simply not interested in what you have to offer and they're just not going to do it now of course there are you will still get conversions after that point you're not going to get no conversions because there will be people that you know didn't take a good look at it the first two times who are interested etc etc but as the percentage of people that have already taken action increases or the percentage of people that are just not interested who have already been exposed to your ads increases you're going to see the number of conversions drop off and the cost per conversion start to increase now usually the best and most effective way to combat that with frequency is to change up your ad creative now there's a bunch of different methods but if you change up your ad creative it would look like a new and different ad people won't sort of have ad blindness where they don't see your ad don't process it and you can get a lot more juice out of that audience if you change up your ad creative i've got another video on how to combat facebook ad fatigue and things like that so make sure you check that out there'll be a link in the video description below but i just wanted to quickly mention that frequency being a primary one there's lots of people that have had the experience with facebook advertising whereby the costs of um their conversions or whatever it is they're they're trying to get all of a sudden just starts creeping up and going up and up and up and up and it's basically people have become bored with your ad and you need to change something up first one is frequency second one is your conversion rate from link clicks to whatever it is that your conversion actually is a lot of people blame the facebook ad campaign for poor performance when they're running facebook ads to an audience to get them to do something on your website and of course it can be the facebook ad campaign you need to have everything in order you need to have targeting set up correctly engage in creative all that sort of stuff but if you're getting a lot of link clicks for a relatively low price but they're not converting into conversions that's an indication to me that the facebook ad campaign is doing its job it's getting people to your website but your website at some point in that sales funnel is letting the side down it's not convincing people to convert now you probably are watching this video saying okay well what should my conversion rate be i can't really give you one because depending on what you're going for it will be massively different so if you're trying to generate opt-ins for a lead magnet you would want a conversion rate from link clicks to conversions of 40 plus something like that would normally be a good one whereas an e-commerce business is never going to see those sorts of conversion rates you'll you know if you see i don't know five percent conversion rate with most e-commerce businesses you're doing very very well so what what i would say is i can't really give you a an example because it was so depend on your business but what i would do is i would monitor um how that changes um over time with percentages the percentage of link clicks to conversions and if you make any sort of website adjustments you try and test things change things i would also keep an eye on that metric closely because you're going aha with when we send people to the product page instead of the home page we see this conversion rate when we change you know our big offer on that sales page to this we see this conversion rate that's what i'm talking about with that and then going into that facebook advertising metric number three going a little bit deeper into that is to go through the various stages so you might just have link clicks to conversion all the way through but you might want to chop that up so for example instead of just looking at well alongside just looking at link clicks um and conversions and sort of how that works and sort of what that conversion ratio is i would also take for example the difference between your ad to carts and purchase if you're an e-commerce business and you're seeing lots and lots of ad to carts but only say 10 of those people are going on to purchase that's that's quite low you would like a higher percentage and sometimes by the way when we run campaigns we see sort of 20 30 ad to carts for every one purchase and whenever we see that there's something wrong with the checkout process perhaps you're trying to charge a really high delivery fee that only comes in in that checkout process and that's putting people off perhaps it's just not easy to use or you know you may not realize it but your website just doesn't look quite right on a um on a mobile device something along those lines so not only take you know facebook advertising metric number number two is to take the full link clicks to conversions and calculate what that conversion percentage is facebook advertising metric number three to track is to break that down into its component parts um and take a look at the stages so if you have add to cart versus purchase for example that'd be a great one okay so those are three facebook advertising metric number four that i would track i think it's important to track is cpm so cpm is cost per thousand impressions okay and that's an important metric because that's basically how facebook thinks about the cost of facebook advertising so facebook you know you might be looking at cost per conversion maybe cost per link click but facebook is trying to get as much money out of advertisers as possible per thousand impressions that they provide because of course that's what facebook has to sell that's what they're effectively selling to advertisers is we can put your ads in front of people okay that's what they are um they're going for so the reason why you attract cost per thousand impressions is it can vary massively between different audiences and particularly between different ad creative so facebook wants advertisers to use engaging interesting creative that doesn't annoy their users because if it did annoy their users people would stop using the platform and you'd run into all sorts of facebook would run into all sorts of issues so they effectively reward advertisers for creating engaging creative things that doesn't annoy their users by providing a lower cpm a lower cost per thousand impressions okay if your ad likewise is the opposite if it's not very engaging to users they're not interested in it perhaps it's even annoying them even worse your cpms are likely to be very high now your cpm will massively depend on your industry and that you're advertising in it will depend on um when you're advertising geographically so what countries you're advertising in so again i can't give you an average you know in the uk a cpm of anything less than five pounds is pretty good um in places like california if you can get cpms under sort of fifteen dollars you're usually using quite you're doing very well whereas in countries like india you're going to have cpms that are much much less expensive so it's difficult for me to give averages on what yours should be but again it's something to track and something to keep an eye on and you might find that okay before you start to see a lot of conversion data coming through let's take a look at our cpm and see that you know what when we advertise to this audience our cpm is much much higher maybe they're just not that interested in our stuff this ad is producing a much higher cpm again maybe this ad just isn't um sort of resonating with the audience etc etc again all these facebook advertising metrics need to be caveated with if you're seeing a great cost per conversion this other stuff basically doesn't matter um other than frequency you need to keep an eye on that because that's something that's going to um increase over time and potentially affect performance over time but um but yeah but if if if you're seeing you know you're wanting to optimize beyond just the cost per conversion um data then that cpm is something to um to really keep an eye on okay and then finally we've got cost per link click so these are all metrics these are all facebook advertising metrics that are very centered around the sort of action people are taking on facebook and the very sort of facebook centric metrics and it and that's because of the way the platform is set up as i've already mentioned facebook incentivizes advertisers to basically produce great ads by reducing cpms and things like that so cpc cost per link click is a little bit different one of the things that we will often find is that we're getting let's say a nice low cpm so the ad is engaging we're getting perhaps a lot of engagement a lot of social proof a lot of comments likes shares things like that but perhaps clicks are costing quite a lot and again what a click cost you will depend on your industry where you're located sometimes a you know a two dollar cost per click is great sometimes that's really expensive so i can't give you examples of what you should be depending on where you are in the world what you're advertising but again just monitor it in terms of across the board which audiences produce lower um or higher cpcs and most importantly which ads so when we see if i go back to the example where we've got you know an ad campaign that is producing a low cpm lots of engagement it looks like everything's going well but the the cost per click is low that's usually because the offer isn't strong enough or the call to action isn't strong enough so a lot of people think that you can't tell people what to do in a reasonably aggressive manner with facebook advertising but that's not true if you've got a great offer you can tell people in your ad copy go and get it now it's a limited time offer go and get it now likewise if your ads aren't driving people to your website let's say people love the product you're advertising you've got a like product demonstration video people like oh this looks fantastic but they're not really clicking through to your website your cost per clicks quite high um then try putting in a more aggressive offer so instead of just saying you know come buy it it'll be here tomorrow it'll be here next month whatever talk about the fact that there's limited stocks available offer a 20 discount but for the next three weeks only do those sorts of things to really help um drive down the cost per link click get more people to your website that can then obviously buy can be retargeted etc etc okay so those five those are the five facebook advertising metrics hopefully that's really useful when you're looking at your data you can use those to optimize your campaigns now at the beginning of the video i mentioned a couple of free um facebook advertising resources that i want to quickly mention
