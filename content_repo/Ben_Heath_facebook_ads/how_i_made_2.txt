2.7 million pounds in additional sales is what we were able to generate for a client of ours in just 90 days by fixing their Facebook ads. In this video I'm going to show you how we did it. Okay so let's run through this case study video a format that is backed by popular demand.

I can show you a real world example of massive improvements that have been made to this business's Facebook ads and the results that came with that. So let's start by going through a little bit of context so you understand a little bit more about this business this client of ours. So an e-commerce business operating in quite a specific niche the puzzle notebook niche.

Some interesting things about that industry so average order value AOV is pretty low for this business UK based business it was £27 and that's actually reasonably high for that industry because you think well how much you're going to spend on puzzle notebook type products. This business had done a good job of increasing their average order value from about £20 so they'd actually done that quite well even though that's relatively low in comparison to other businesses but the products are high margin they don't cost much to print to produce so even though the AOV is low that the margin is high. Now those dynamics do introduce some difficult circumstances and things you need to be aware about when running ads for a business like this right so okay the AOV is low which means our cost per purchase needs to be really quite low and our ROAS doesn't need to be really high because they're high margin so just things to understand before we go through the process.

So and oh that's another really important thing about this business that was almost forgot to mention was that the vast majority of their sales are generated in Q4 so people are buying these typically as Christmas presents for other people stocking fillers things like that so yes they generate sales all year round but their real most popular time something like 60 to 70 percent of all sales are generated in in Q4 in those three months leading up to the end of the year. What I'm going to do in this video is compare their results Q4 2023 before we started working with them before we implemented the changes that I'll describe and then what their results were like Q4 2024 so the Q4 that the most recent one that just finished and you can see the enormous difference in results and also explain what we did to get those enormous differences okay so Q4 2023 revenue was just under a million pounds 979 thousand pounds meta ad spend was just under half a million pounds 499 000 generating a ROAS of 1.95x so pretty low tonal ad spend the average cost per purchase was 14 pounds 12. They sold 35 000 units they're really shifting some product already you'll see what it gets to in Q4 2024.

So this is one of those scenarios where because they're high margin I think break even for this business was about a 1.4 1.5x ROAS and so 1.95 is profitable and and so you you can't say that Q4 2023 was a failure but it wasn't massively so it wasn't really really exciting actually interesting side note about this business they had considered hiring us to run their ads for them during Q4 2023 but thought that they we'd had a meeting with them but they thought yeah we're not quite ready if they thought they weren't ready they wanted to manage it themselves so they ran their own ads for Q4 2023 they then decided to hire us for Q4 2024 hence the you know all the information I've got for this video and what I can what I can talk about and that decision to wait the extra year cost them literally millions of pounds because we were able to improve their campaigns that much and scale and you'll see all of that later on but um but yeah we did not run ads during Q4 2023 for them they didn't think they were quite ready even though they were and this is the results that they got okay but nothing special target cost per purchase so you can see their cost per purchase during Q4 2023 was 14 pounds 12 their target was 12 pounds and this company really felt like look if we can just get a sub 12 pound cost per purchase we'd be able to scale significantly because that would be not just profitable but profitable enough to be able to then absorb some extra costs you know as you scale things naturally get added in on the cost front any business have been through a scaling process knows you have more people that don't necessarily drive direct sales and costs add up so you need nice healthy margins in order to scale typically like I said Q4 2023 performed okay we felt we could do much better we looked at what they were doing even though they have a relatively low average order value they had shown that they could sell loads of product they had achieved quite a low cost of purchase we felt we could get that much much lower and we were brought in to run their ads Q4 2024. So before we started working with them we did an ad account audit like we do with a all our new clients and we identified that there were some things that they hadn't done in an ideal way that we thought we could improve on one of the reasons why we're confident we could help improve their results one of those was campaign structure issues there were definitely those within the ad account we felt we could restructure the campaigns restructure the ad account and that would help improve things the other one was there was definitely a lack of creative testing going on and we felt that if we implemented that we would find winners produce much better results so we'll dive into that detail around those two in a second most of their meta ads for Q4 2023 before we started working with them were image based we felt like there was a massive opportunity for video there was I'll talk about that more in a second but let's go through the campaign structure part first in a little bit more detail okay so their ad account before we started working with them had way too many campaigns and this is actually something that we are seeing more and more of often business owners that are running their own ad campaigns they will they'll want to test everything they'll watch tons of my youtube videos for example and hear about this and that and they basically try and do a bit of everything and what that can lead to is budget being spread really thinly across lots of different campaigns and meta is not able to optimize properly it's difficult for you as the advertiser in that scenario to work out really what's producing the best results and to be able to zero in on that so one of the things we like to do is right let's take all of that let's consolidate the campaigns let's make sure that a lot more budget a larger percentage of the budget is being put behind the best performing elements and it's one of the ways we can often generate a really quick and substantial win early on when we work with a client like this so we consolidated the campaigns into just a testing campaign and a scaling campaign now their products whilst there's a range of puzzle notebooks they are very much of a set of the same type and i've talked before about wanting different campaigns for different product ranges as opposed to individual products most of the time we don't always do that but most of the time so we thought you know what we can really consolidate this because this business has low cost per purchase they sell a high volume that's amazing in terms of generating a lot of data for meta to be able to optimize but that doesn't happen if you've got 50 different campaigns running i can't remember the exact number it probably wasn't that many but lots of different campaigns running and budget is spread really thinly so we're like right we're gonna have a testing campaign and we're gonna have a scaling campaign for this type of business oh and also one of the reasons why we're able to consolidate with a business like this is because we need a one step sales funnel if your average order value is say 27 pounds you can't afford to pay for multiple steps we can't advertise a lead magnet and then retarget because each one of those steps you need to pay for from an advertising standpoint that's just not going to work with a 27 pound AOV and it also does you don't need those extra steps because you don't really need to warm people up this is an impulse purchase for most people and they're buying it for someone else's a Christmas present for example they just quickly go oh yeah that looks great i'll grab that in the mix of things i might be buying someone for a present or that's perfect for my dad or whatever i'm going to go ahead and grab one of those that's his present taken care of um so you can't have multi-step sales funnel also allowed us to consolidate the campaign structure uh that much more and and and also just stop doing a bunch of things that they were doing stop running awareness campaigns or traffic campaigns and extra stuff that was in the mix that wasn't really driving return on ad spend so new structure testing campaign scaling campaign allowed to consolidate budget it also then allows for a lot more creative testing not only can meta optimize better we can optimize better but if you are generating many more conversions per creative within those consolidated campaigns you find out much faster whether an ad works or not because everyone always asks me how long after i launch an ad do i need to wait before i know if it's performing well or not and my response is it's not time it's conversion volume that you need to look out for because if you generate three conversions a week it's gonna take a long time for you to get enough conversions to be able to see an accurate representation of what that cost per conversion will be for you to be able to make a decision on that whereas if you're generating 2 000 sales a day and we've worked on campaigns like that you might know if an ad's working within a few hours because it oh it's already generated 45 purchases what's the cost per purchase that's a pretty good sample size this is pretty representative how this ad will perform is it working yes is it not no great go ahead and turn it off so allows for much more creative testing which is the other thing that we really needed to uh implement in this ad account so let's talk about that let's talk about the creative strategy so like i said i had slide pro talking about mostly relying on image ads as the type of ad format that was used to sell these products and that makes sense with our low average order value products let inexpensive products impulse purchase we often say that simple ad formats work the best so i totally understand why they'd settled on image they had tested videos previously but found them ineffective and i hear that story quite a lot and one of the things that people often do is they'll create a few video ads they will test them they won't do as well as their image ads and they'll go right video ads don't work i'll go back and it's not often what people want to hear but the proper advice give in this scenario is maybe video ads just weren't good enough i wouldn't write off video as an ad format just because the sample test that you ran with a couple of videos um didn't do well like how good are you at making video there's a really difficult thing to do if you've not done it before to get it right um so think about that when you're thinking about any form of testing is did i test that properly or did i just kind of think oh it's something i should do right quick little video let's maybe let meta animate an image there we go video tested it's like well what would happen if you really produce some fantastic video creative would the test results be quite different turns out they were so we felt very strongly that for this type of business ugc video ads were going to work well we've worked i mean we've worked with 3 000 plus businesses worldwide we've spent hundreds of millions of dollars um on facebook and instagram ads like we have all the data and internal knowledge to know this type of business wants this type of ad so we felt like ugc video ads would do really well and they absolutely did i'll explain more about that in a second they performed brilliantly ugc by the way if you're not familiar is user generated content and you will have seen ads like this where someone is effectively um creating a video it could be a previous customer could be someone that you've specifically hired to do it like you send them some product they use it uh talk about their great experiences with the product and that's what we did in in this scenario and they could be great for the ugc videos feel more like content as opposed to an ad when someone's scrolling through facebook or instagram ugc ad pops up and the person's more feels like they're getting a recommendation from someone like them as opposed to anything that's overly produced in a and a full app now there are places for highly produced ads that look fantastic and i want to make that clear but for this type of business we felt ugc would work real really well because they are great for impulse purchases that sort of like honest trustworthy feel someone you've you've met has just provided a recommendation around a product oh yeah i've got one of those and they're fantastic you know you bump into someone at an airport they really like your shoes or your bag or whatever and they ask you okay you know what do you think how do you get on with that and they give you an answer it's that kind of feel ugc ads so great for impulse purchase which is exactly what these products are and we also added carousels into the mix so because we could see that it was very common you know these are puzzle notebook type products right so what people would do is they would come through and they'd rarely purchase one that's how you get an ovi of 27 pounds they purchase like a range a number of different options so if your business is like that where it's very common for multiple similar products to be bought together carousels can work great because people can see well i'm not really interested in that one but that one looks good i really like doing those i'll grab that oh i can see there's some other options they can click through and also we found that carousels for business like that can help increase your average order value because instead of just being advertised the one product and people click through and buy at the ad level they're already aware there are other products here i might be interested in so when they click through they might still add to cart that first product but because of that previous exposure to the other ones they then go okay where are the other uh right i'll shop around i saw something else on that carousel that i like the look of so that was beneficial too um and uh yeah so we the carousel ads if you've got image ads that have performed well previously carousels are often really easy to create in terms of what to do you just go ahead and grab a load of your best performing previous images and uh stick those in there alongside each other as carousels offering different products worked really well and no matter which facebook ad creative strategy you're using you need to have accurate data you need to be able to properly track your results so you can make informed decisions and optimize your campaigns properly the best way to do that is with hyros hyros is the best tracking and attribution software for facebook and instagram ads it's a software that all the big players including myself use i use it to track the results i generate from my own ads i also use it for all my organic content as well which is really useful so someone comes through and books a call for our done for you services for example i can see exactly where they came from with a lot of accuracy and that allows me to make decisions in my business which is really really helpful and let me quickly show you how important this is so i'm in my hyros dashboard and i've isolated one of our meta ad campaigns and i've created a report for it so we can see the data and you can take a look at this so this campaign spent just under two thousand pounds generated fifteen thousand pounds in revenue but here's the really important bit reported versus revenue and in this column we can see twelve thousand pounds now what that means is that out of the fifteen thousand pounds that this campaign has actually generated hyros has been able to report on the full fifteen thousand twelve thousand pounds of which meta was not originally able to see so if we're just looking within our matter ad account not using hyros we would have seen that three thousand pounds of revenue was generated from this campaign and that is not true at all that is a much much lower roas number than the actual fifteen thousand pounds of revenue that was generated for a number of years now metas ad tracking capabilities have not been as accurate as they once were because all sorts of privacy regulations have come into effect and it's only heading that way it's only becoming more and more difficult to get accurate data and and track our results as we need to be able to do this is a relatively extreme case and the reason why is because meta has a seven day maximum attribution window and this is an ad campaign that's retargeting for one of our services that people usually take a lot longer than seven days to make a decision on so someone clicks on an ad they often won't convert within seven days meta's simply not able to see that data and that's where hyros comes in the important thing is that you need accurate data and hyros takes care of that so if you want to get better results from your facebook ads without actually having to touch your ads go ahead and sign up to hyros there is a link in the video description one thing to note and i think this is something that facebook advertisers who get into a testing mindset which is a good mindset to have run into as an issue is different people respond to different ad creative so often when we're testing different ad formats we're trying to work out which ad format produces the best results and often the answer to that is well actually a mixture of the two so in in this scenario we still had some image ads running the majority of the budget was being spent on the video ugc ads user generated content ads and then we had some money going on carousels and i was really happy with that mix because some people are far more likely to engage with video others are far more likely to engage with carousels and if you're trying to scale and sell lots of product as we did here then you want to put different types of creative in front of different types of people and met is smart enough to work that out they will know this user responds to carousels more images videos etc so an ad creative format mix like i said could work really well and we knew ugc8 video ads like i already mentioned were going to perform really well um for this business but we have that massive internal knowledge because of the experience and the money that we've spent and the literally 3000 plus clients all over the world every type of business you can think of virtually at this point but if you're not in that scenario which i imagine just about everyone watching this video will not be in that scenario then you need to test different video ad styles it's not good enough to just say i've tested video ads or what type did you test different styles to help you do that i'm going to run through some examples of different video ads i've talked about ugc i just want to make this as helpful as possible so ugc user generated content i've already mentioned i explain what that is influencer now a lot of people confuse these two but user generated content is a regular person it's a previous customer previous client it could be someone that it could be like an actor that you send product to that they then use it and talk about it just someone that's comfortable on camera and people can do that with with ugc type stuff influencers are different because that's someone who has an audience has a following and that would be someone like me for example so i have sponsors on my videos i do influencer type stuff for brands typically software brands because they want me to make a recommendation around their product and their service their software to my audience now influencer video ads are often more powerful than ugc because that person has influence but they're more difficult to do it's more difficult to get someone who is an influencer to create video ads for you it's probably going to cost some money um that you know it's a more valuable thing there's more people going after it therefore there's more difficulties in it achieving that sort of thing but can be really really powerful i'm a huge fan of using influencers in your video ads get them to create your video ads for you particularly if you're not very good at it you don't have that skill set in-house influencers can work really well and actually i've created a video on the new creator marketplace i'll include a link in the video description that's going to make it much easier for you to find influencers should you want to do that anyway moving on founder led pretty pretty self-explanatory explaining why you created the business what the product or service does that sort of thing demonstration so some video ads just demonstrate how the product or service works and particularly if you've created something new some people don't really understand or there's like a new take on something a technological improvement which can be a great way to go demonstration slideshow take a bunch of images let meta put them all into a slideshow or do it yourself or do it with another ai tool and then full-on animation not something that many businesses do but can work really really well and it stands out quite a lot because not many people businesses do it so just some ideas there we're thinking okay yeah i tested founder-led video ads but i've not done any of those other ones and there are other types but these are the ones we use most commonly i could go ahead and give some of those other ones a go not easy to do but the reward potential rewards are massive um we also significantly increased the volume of creative testing for this business to overcome ad fatigue so the goal of this business was get the cost per purchase beneath 12 pounds then we want to scale now when you're doing that to a reasonably small audience these products advertise uk wide i mean it's not as big as say us or like large international markets but like a decent sized audience still uh but we're doing it in quite a condensed time period like most of this we were comparing here directly q4 most of sales are in q4 so you need lots of creative variation and new creative to overcome ad fatigue otherwise you might have a campaign that performs really really well and then drops off quite aggressively because the people if you've got a small audience the people that have seen your ads have either decided they like it or not and they've made a decision right um so like i said especially important when you're spending a large budget a short period of time anyway it's time for the results the part that people are typically most interested in that we've all been waiting for so this is now the results for q4 2024 um the last q4 the one we ran ads for this business for and we'll compare those to q4 2023 i should also quickly mention that the average cost of facebook ads usually measured in cpm's cost per thousand impressions was up about 20 percent q4 2024 in comparison to q4 2023 at one of the largest price increases that we've seen so that should be factored in that these results are actually even more impressive than they look because the overall cost of facebook advertising increased during that time period so let's go and have a look revenue generated q4 2024 3.69 million pounds now if you remember the previous one for q4 2023 was 973 974 000 pounds an enormous increase a 2.7 million pound increase in revenue during the same um quarterly period one year to the next that's why i said this company really missed out on uh millions of pounds by deciding to wait that extra year to uh to hire us okay their ROAS was 4.68 which for high margin products is absolutely fantastic especially when you consider that their previous ROAS in q4 2023 was 1.95x we've more than doubled their return on ad spend and scaled at the same time very difficult to do it shows that the new campaign structure massively improved results and that the new ads particularly UGC video ads we tested a whole bunch massively improved their results so their new cost per purchase for q4 2024 dropped all the way to £5.91 an enormous decrease because their previous cost of purchase was £14.12 so more than half their cost per purchase and that led to basically the massive improvement in these results or a large part of it and their AOV their average order value remained pretty much same as about £27 between the the Q4s in in the two different years now remember their target was £12 so we can get below £12 then we can really scale this campaign well we absolutely blew that out the water smashed that went um less than went to less than half of the target cost per purchase and this is over the entire quarter by the way this isn't like cherry picked the very best bit um okay units sold in Q4 2024 was 133 000 that's a lot of puzzle notebooks um sold which is fantastic in the previous um year it was 35 000 so almost a hundred thousand extra units sold when comparing the two Q4s um meta ad spend during this quarter that we managed was 788 000 up from 499 000 so we've had this 2.7 million pound increase in sales like more than a tripling of sales um but we've only spent we haven't even spent double so we've spent an extra what's that an extra 288 000 pounds so about 55 increase in spend for a 300 plus percent increase in revenue now you might be thinking if these results were so fantastic why did you only increase the amount spent by uh 288 000 and that is a very obvious question to ask we would have scaled a lot more the client ran out of all stock of their best sellers which is not surprising really when you sell an extra 100 000 units um in q4 2024 versus q4 2023 they didn't have that much stock um so they completely ran out of stock we really had to scale back campaigns um turn um some stuff off that were advertising a lot of their best sellers and we would have been able to sell more we think we might have been able to get um over five million pounds had like stock levels remained like perfectly high across the board um but what a good problem to have when you're uh when your campaigns could have been a lot better but you simply ran out of stock it actually happens with clients more often than you think which is great but it means we're all very excited for q4 2025 because this client is absolutely on board they're super pleased very excited with what we did uh we're running ads for them all year but q4 2025 is is their big time of year that's when we're spending the most generating the most customers and they're gonna make sure they've got plenty of stock in so we can absolutely go ahead and smash it okay and that leads me on to my next question is would you like us to manage your facebook and instagram ads for you and likely get you much better results so just quickly explain how we can help so heath media name of my specialist meta and google ads agency we've spent more than 150 million dollars on ad campaigns for clients very experienced very much know what we're doing like i said worked with more than 3 000 clients in countries all over the world and actually that 150 million is a very conservative estimate the platforms don't show you too far into the past we can only see like a few years worth of ad spend um data it's likely much much more than that we're spending close to 10 million a month at the moment so um yeah all the experience in the world and from that ad spend we generated at least 600 million in sales for our clients probably that number is a lot higher we sort of give a conservative forex whereas estimate across the board so if that sounds interesting you'd like us to manage this for you take that workload off your hands or take it from another agency if they're not producing as good a result if you would like there is a link in the description you can book in a free call with one of my team members they'll let you know about how we can help no obligation of course you can just find out more we've probably worked with a business just like yours in the past um so yeah that sounds interesting go ahead and do that hopefully we get a chance to work together now we do have a 5k minimum budget requirement for this service now i should quickly mention that is in dollars we work with clients all over the world so if you're in the uk thinking well i've got 4k a month well technically you still qualify but just wanted to quickly let you know about that and if you don't have 5k per month if you operate with a budget less than that which i know a lot of my audience do for now we have an alternative option where we can help and that is my mentorship program so in my mentorship program we have exclusive course material things you won't find on youtube or anywhere else explaining how we do what we do we do daily live calls with me and my team we do trainings q and a's um lots of interactive live support to help you get the best shots possible show you exactly what you need to do you can ask any questions that you've got around your campaigns or in your business to be perfectly honest and that's how a lot of these calls often go try and give business advice where we feel it's appropriate to unlimited one-to-one support so you get assigned with a one-to-one coach and you can message them through slack as much as you want and they'll get back to you and ask you answer your questions make sure you're on the right path help you out with things like that amazing community in the mentorship program more than 800 business owners just like you so um yeah opportunity to connect with other similar businesses and all that sort of stuff as well which is handy again link is in the video description should you be interested in that option and lastly if you found this video valuable you'd like me to make more of this case study style where i give you real world examples um then subscribe and simply let me know in the comments i look at all the comments and i will definitely take that feedback on board see you soon
