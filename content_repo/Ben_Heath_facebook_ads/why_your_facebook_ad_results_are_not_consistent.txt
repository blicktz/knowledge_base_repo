Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to explain why your Facebook ad results are not consistent. It's something that a lot of Facebook advertisers struggle with, something that a lot of people try to fix and really tear their hair out over. I'm going to explain why they're not consistent and actually what you can do about it in this video.

Before we get into that I want to very quickly ask you to hit that thumbs up button, that really helps me out and it's much appreciated and of course subscribe to my channel if you haven't done so already. Okay so to demonstrate this fluctuation in results that happens all the time when it comes to Facebook advertising and that really annoys a lot of Facebook advertisers, a lot of Facebook advertisers struggle with, I wanted to bring up a campaign. So this is an example campaign that was run for, I don't know, what's that, five, six months.

It's a traffic campaign, we spent just under a thousand pounds on it and this was just promoting content to our warm audiences. Actually no, not just warm audiences but warm and cold audiences just sort of ticking along in the background for an article that we were testing something out a lot which is why not much was spent given the length of time. But what I wanted to show you was not so much the number of results but of course they fluctuate big time, you know, we're talking 152 link clicks on that day versus you know 77 just a few days afterwards.

But we did change the budget around a few times so that's a little bit, if you're changing the budget that's obviously going to affect how many results you generate massively right. The important part is down here in the cost per result and I think this graph here tells you so much about what you need to know and what you should expect when it comes to your own Facebook advertising. So firstly the starting cost per result and our result in this case is link clicks as you can see is quite a bit higher than what it ends up sort of settling as right.

Not only is it quite a bit higher to begin with, the fluctuations are also significantly larger and the spikes at the beginning. Why is that? Two things, A the learning process, you are seeing Facebook's learning process in action there.

That is why the longer campaigns run the more you spend the more results you generate the better they perform. You can literally see it perfectly. Starts off higher but about 9p per click with lots of big fluctuations and spikes.

The longer it goes on the more not only does the number the actual cost per result reduce and stay low you know we're talking five cents, six cents, five cents, six cents down here but it's also much more consistent as well. Okay and that's exactly what we expect to see because of that's how Facebook's learning phase works, that's how their optimization process works, it's getting the better results, generates more consistency and a better cost. It's why so many people can't like they pause and and stop advertising after a week, five days and declare this isn't going to work and you think oh if you'd just given it a couple months you'd have been at half your cost per purchase and you know that might have been the best thing for your business you could possibly imagine because now you can scale.

Anyway but it's also that but there's also we're learning from this campaign right so I think we had two or three different ad creatives running for this one article so some of these fluctuations will have been testing they will have been pausing stuff we test a few audiences so not only is Facebook learning but we're learning okay so if you look at the average for that first say couple months we're going to be up over probably 10 you know around this period maybe 11 pence per link click that comes all the way down to an average of like five in this in this spell and and like later on as well we can see a bit of a spike here but that's because of Christmas and New Year yeah look at the dates there um so we half our cost per result here and when you're talking from 10p to 5p this is a link clicks campaign so you know you think oh what's the big deal but if that's going from a 40 cost per purchase to a 20 cost per purchase which it absolutely can do that's really significant so the whole time for this video is why your Facebook ad results are not consistent they're not consistent because Facebook and Instagram advertising campaigns operate in the real world a lot of people want to treat Facebook and Instagram ads like it's a video game like you know a video game you're going through the levels you're not playing against other online players in this scenario you're going you're going up against like the computer the CPU right and they do the same stuff all the time because they're a programmed computer player and you know that when you go through that door you know an enemy is going to approach you from the right and you need to turn take him out okay that's not how Facebook and Instagram ads work you are not operating with CPUs on the other end you are advertising to real human beings and because real human beings are heavily affected by external factors to Facebook Instagram advertising that has a big impact on your Facebook ad results so a classic example I mean I live in England right everyone knows that the weather in England is terrible when the sun is out like everyone just dives outside because it's out so infrequently everyone's desperate to be outside and and enjoying it so on those days we certainly see less ad impressions worse results basically across the board not for every single business but for most you know if you're selling sunglasses okay great you're doing well but for most businesses because Brits are not on their phones in front of their computers as much on a sunny Friday as opposed to a Friday where it's raining that has a big impact that's not something you can predict in advance well not not with you know a long time frame and it absolutely should be taken into account and there is nothing that you can do about that the exact same happens with other external factors like big news events right right now for example England are just about to play in the final of the Euros you do not want to be expecting your Facebook advertising results to be fantastic whilst England are playing their biggest soccer match for you know 55 years not in not in England at least you advertise in other locations but you don't want to be expecting great results in England for those you know three hours it's not going to happen and that whole day will be affected as a result these things big weather events big news events I mean we had so much with the pandemic and the lockdowns and all that sort of stuff where where we would you could see you could track it you could track in the results when like a new lockdown was announced or something was eased or something like that these have massive impacts on your results and there is nothing you can do about that absolutely nothing you can do about that okay the other factor that you're not only advertising to real people not CPUs you're advertising against real people and not CPUs so other advertisers activity on Facebook and Instagram are also going to have a big impact on your results and that is going to lead to massive fluctuations this is even more the case if you advertise to a smaller target audience or in a local area where the impact of a few big players has a greater impact on the cost so Facebook advertising is priced for an auction system it's as close to a perfect market as you can get if there's more people advertising more money being spent the cost of Facebook ads goes up if it is three days before the end of a quarter and a massive car manufacturer has big leftover budget and they go quick let's dump it into Facebook um in you know uh I don't know Bristol um over the next three days that is going to have a big impact on your Facebook advertising results if a big player comes in they get like investment and they've got tons of money to spend on Facebook and Instagram ads and you operate within the the fly fishing for Scottish salmon niche and someone's just moved into that market and they've increased the total ad spend in that niche on Facebook you know by 25 percent that is going to have a big impact on your Facebook and Instagram results and there's nothing that you can do about it so the only way to really improve your consistency is to control what you can control accept what you cannot a lot of the stuff I've talked about means you you cannot affect those things and they will have an impact no matter what you do you need to control what you can control and not do things to make the situation worse as opposed to make it better so you can be consistent with your advertising don't tweak with things every day keep them just ticking along uh make adjustments of course and make adding new ads and things like that but not every day every seven to ten days at the most sometimes less frequently particularly if you're using a lower budget um don't be super erratic with your offers don't be offering one thing one day another thing another day you want to provide consistency within your rad account which will then feed to feed through to consistently seeing results same with budgets don't be spending you know three thousand dollars a day one day three hundred dollars a day the next back up to two thousand if you can keep your stuff consistent that's really going to help your results be consistent so it's more like don't constantly fiddle and tweak with things to make the situation worse other than that there's so little you can do other than just time and patience and it's one of the hardest things for you know I've had to learn that over a decade to be an entrepreneur and it's really hard time and patience solves so many issues and so many mental headaches look at this campaign is the perfect example of that I could have been tearing my hair out that on September 23rd we had a cost per result of 9p two days later or three days later it was 16p I could have been like what how has it gotten that much more expensive going mad what's going on why has this happened who knows I don't know what happened on September 26th could have been a big news event could have been really great weather um I think this was just being advertised to the UK no no it was being advertised internationally but could have been a big news event could have been all sorts of things going on on that day could have just been natural fluctuation because we're not advertising to CPUs could have been that someone else in the Facebook ad space was advertising a more interesting article for those few days and that was competing with my um ad and they were doing that few days and they stopped advertising it it also could just be that Facebook was testing and results fluctuate big time you know if you've given Facebook an audience of two million people well they're not going to advertise to all two million they're going to advertise to like 20,000 here 20,000 there they're trying to work out which part has got the best results and that is why the key to consistency is patience and allowing things to play out and this campaign shows it massively look at the how the results a improved and b leveled off so there was less fluctuation now there's still fluctuations right so look we can see here that on that day it was 5p cost per result drop down to 4. um you know not that long it's on the 20th december we're looking at 7 and here's another great example things really spike back up again for Christmas and New Year which is not surprising in the slightest you've got 9p here you know 8p this is just after New Year and things then begin to to drop back down as we move like later January into into February and things like that again that's exactly what I would expect given um how things like Christmas and New Year affect Facebook ad results because they affect people's behaviors right um there is still even though we've got more consistency here along this part and better result there is still fluctuation so you know we've got 4p costs per click there all the way down to 3 on February 9th back up to 7 on February 13th okay that's more than a doubling from a few days again if you're looking at that tearing your hair out you're just causing yourself an unnecessary headache so how do you get over that psychologically and so much of well all digital marketing all business is obviously psychology yours as a business owner founder entrepreneur by the way um not manipulating your target audience your psychology is to just not care about those short time horizons I will not check and worry about campaigns that have had a cost per purchase let's say or a cost per result double from one day to three days time I will look at longer trends than that and if we are seeing a doubling from month to month now that's a big deal that is something we really need to address and deal with and do something about but if we're just seeing you know it was ten dollar cost per purchase on Tuesday then 12 on Wednesday 15 on Thursday 18 on Friday and then Saturday was back down to 12 Sunday was at 10 Monday was down at 9 Tuesday was 12 Wednesday was 15 that's all fine that's all expected that's all fine it's the averages that matter so just assess your results over a longer time horizon this is particularly important post iOS 14 assess your results look at um 30 days as a always to have in your mind all right what's my average over 30 days I've had a bad few days let's have a look at my average over 30 days oh actually over the last 30 days our results look very similar to what they did the previous 30 days okay we're fine just just a little blip just a few bad days um so basically the takeaway from this video is your Facebook ad results aren't consistent because Facebook ad results aren't consistent that's so much of it and hopefully that gives you some relief helps you calm down helps you relax but also on top of that shows there are things around time around optimization around you not being an erratic Facebook advertiser that will help improve your performance and help improve consistency it's not like you're completely helpless but I think people want a so many people want a system where they're like no I want a $20 cost per purchase every day no matter what it's not gonna happen just not gonna happen and trying to go after the impossible you're just gonna make yourself crazy control the controllables that is not a controllable okay before you go a couple things I want to mention the first is a free webinar I've created called three killer Facebook ad strategies to double or more your revenue
