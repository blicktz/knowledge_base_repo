Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and today's Facebook advertising question is, can you target a competitor's customers with Facebook ads? Now it's obvious why a business might want to target their competitor's customers, particularly if you've got a new product or a better offer than them and you want to sort of steal their customers for yourself. Can you do this on Facebook?

The answer is maybe. It depends how big your competitor is. So if your competitor is a big company with a large Facebook following, they may appear as an interest targeting option.

So when you're in your Facebook campaign, you're in the ad set level setting your targeting options, enter your competitor's name into that field and see if it pops up. If it does, you can target the people that are interested in that company on Facebook. Now the people that are interested in that company aren't going to overlap 100% with their customer, they're going to be people who like their page, interact with their posts, but there is going to be a significant amount of overlap.

Those people are going to be very similar. So that might be a targeting option that you might want to test. If your competitor's not big enough to appear, they don't have a large enough following, then you're not going to be able to use that specific technique.

If that's the case, I wouldn't worry about targeting your competitor's customers specifically. You'd be much better off at building your own customer base, creating lookalike audiences based off your customer base, and that's likely to deliver much better results over the long run, even if you've got a significantly better offer than your customers. Let's say you're undercutting them by price or you've got a new innovative product that has better features than theirs.

I think that's still a better approach. Thanks a lot guys. Bye bye.
