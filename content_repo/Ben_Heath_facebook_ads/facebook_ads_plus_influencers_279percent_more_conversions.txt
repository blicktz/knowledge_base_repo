Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about an underutilised Facebook advertising technique that can help you improve your results by as much as 279%. It's a bold claim but I'm going to explain all in a minute. Now before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button, please click the thumbs up button, that would help me out and be much appreciated and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already.

Okay so most Facebook advertisers will be aware that influencers are a thing. Just about every industry no matter what you're selling there will be influencers in that industry. People that have clout, people whose recommendation means something not just because of the social media platforms and followings that they've built although that's often where where the influencers sort of do their work is by promoting to their audiences on their various social media platforms but also just in general to people who are interested in products and services to do with that industry.

These are people to follow, these are people to pay attention to, people whose as I said opinion means something and recommendation carries weight. And I've actually spoken to a lot of Facebook advertisers, a lot of small business owners they've been talking about things like or we don't know where we should put our money, should we put it into Facebook ads or should we pay these social media influencers to promote our products and that way what's going to deliver the best results. And actually what I would recommend a lot of Facebook advertisers at least test is combining the two.

Now this is something I've recommended sort of in passing previously it's something that we've done with previous clients but I've got a specific example I wanted to talk about here because I think it's absolutely fascinating the impact that this has had on their Facebook advertising campaigns. Now I can't talk about any of the specifics of the business because all our client work is confidential but it's a company we've been working with for a number of years, e-commerce business, spent a hundred thousand dollars on Facebook ads, very successful Facebook ad campaigns but we've seen massive improvements recently and around about a month or so maybe a little bit longer we've sort of changed approach to their Facebook advertising a little bit, still running the previous campaigns but what we've done instead of running the regular sort of ads that we've been running for a number of years now is the company went out and contacted a number of influencers in their in their industry and created videos that got these influencers to create videos that we're now able to use in our ads okay and over the last it must have been just over a month or so now we have seen an enormous improvement from using ads that feature these people these video ads that feature these people as opposed to the regular what I would still say is high quality advertising that we're doing previously including a lot of video content and the improvement is quite frankly to my eyes unbelievable so their typical cost per purchase usually sits in around about the 40 low 40s mark dollars this is something along those lines and um can be a little bit better can be a little bit worse as Facebook advertising does these these these things uh oscillate they have very high average customer values which is which um really helps helps with their return on ad spend but we've seen a 279 increase in conversion volume so the amount of purchases we've generated with the same ad budget which brings their cost of purchase all the way down into the teens um by using influencers in their Facebook ads as opposed to previous ads that we're using that still had videos still had you know featured the product still had um the business owners and some face to camera um style video content in them but they didn't have these well-known names in the industry personally recommending the product approving of of the of the product and I thought it would help improve results we've seen that previously with other clients but an almost three times as much conversions a reduction in cost per purchase by 60 something percent um is absolutely incredible far more than that I would have thought it it would be more than we've seen elsewhere so I'm not saying you might be able to get 279 improvement I want to make that clear but you might be able to get a 50 improvement or an 80 improvement which would be probably be absolutely phenomenal for your Facebook advertising efforts and for your business in general and you've got to think about why so there are trusted as I said there are influences there are trusted names people with with clout with with the power to to recommend products and services that get people to take action in every industry and I think that alongside their the power of their recommendation which carries weight and you're going to see higher conversion rates on your website as a result of things along those lines beyond that I think the biggest advantage that including an influencer particularly if it's a video ad in your Facebook ad is the interruption factor so it's so easy for us as Facebook and Instagram users to be scrolling through the feed ignoring all sorts of ads oh that looks like an ad I'm going to ignore it that looks like an ad I'm going to ignore it if we see someone that we recognize that changes everything now obviously that could be we recognize them because you know they've put a lot of effort into Facebook advertising they've built a brand and there's some brand recognition there but a way to sort of short circuit that would be to take someone that your target market will know these don't have to be people that are known outside of a very small niche and so it doesn't necessarily have to be a lot of money to to get these people to create video content for you and to review your product or your service or things like that so you don't have to spend a fortune on this it could be people or or even one person that's known specifically to you know a group of 50 000 100 000 people but probably not not a huge amount of other people but if your prospect knows that influencer and recognizes them that is going to do so much of a better job of stopping someone mid-scroll and that as I've talked about before is half the battle when it comes to that Facebook advertising it's stopping someone mid-scroll okay and that face oh I know that is I'll check this out oh what they're recommending you know this particular product let's go ahead and have a look and I said we've done this previously and seen great results but a 279 improvement is quite frankly unbelievable and it's been over a month now I I wanted to make this video a few weeks ago but I thought no let's let's make sure this isn't a flash in the pan it continues and it looks like it is going it is going that way and this this changed a lot of things for this particular client and really helps improve their results so something I would strongly recommend giving a go personally I'm not super familiar with how to go about finding influencers that are likely to deliver great results I know there are all sorts of platforms that are popping up as this becomes more popular medium and if you are familiar working with that space then obviously there's something you can take advantage of but don't let that stop you something we're going to be looking more into because we're realizing that as opposed to it being sort of an alternative or even a competing marketing channel to Facebook advertising it could actually be tremendously complementary and I think the the age of the sort of micro influencer makes this more powerful I mean it's been known in marketing for a very long time that if you get a big celebrity on a tv ad for example it's going to have good results but the micro influencer probably ticks that great box whereby you don't have to pay much to get them to help produce this content for you they're because they're only known by a very specific segment their voice is going to carry so much weight because they're so well known in that specific segment and then instead of just relying on their post or their reach to put your stuff in front of the right people which is what you do if you have like a traditional influencer campaign model combining that with the Facebook ads where you can guarantee your people in your industry see that ad is just a great way to deliver fantastic results so definitely give it a go and let me know in the comments when you do by the way guys I'd love to know and when you when you start implementing this and and seeing great results but um yeah just a quick one that I wanted to uh to share before you go a couple of things I want to quickly mention the first is our Facebook
