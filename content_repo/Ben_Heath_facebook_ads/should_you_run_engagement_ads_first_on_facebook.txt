Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to answer the Facebook Ads question of should you run engagement campaigns first on Facebook before then using those ads in conversion campaigns or traffic campaigns or whatever or should you just go straight for the conversion campaign start with that and go with that option from day one it's an interesting question there's arguments on both sides I'm going to go through those and explain what I think you should do in this short video before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already so I'm in an example Facebook ad account here and I've got up the campaign objectives because you can see obviously you know the engagement option conversions etc now the reason why people have historically very often run engagement campaigns let's say you put put an ad up on your Facebook page you know you've got your imagery you created there you're going to use that post in an engagement campaign to generate lots of social proof so likes comments shares that's what engagement campaigns are designed to do get you a lot of social proof and then you're going to run that ad in a conversion campaign or maybe a traffic campaign but primarily conversions and the idea is that all that social proof that you gathered up from the engagement campaign is going to help your Facebook ad campaign convert because then when people see it they can see oh they've got tons of engagement this must be a big company they must be particularly if the comments and stuff are positive that's going to help you convert and I can absolutely understand the logic and what I would say is there's very little downside in running an engagement campaign first to gather the social proof other than of course the money that you have to spend on that for me I would say the upside of doing so and whether or not you should do so depends on your budget okay so if you're operating with a fairly small budget let's say anything less than you know uh two or three thousand dollars a month something like that then yes I probably would run an engagement campaign first just spend a little bit of money fifty dollars something like that hundred dollars um to get social proof and engagement campaigns are great at that by the way with an engagement campaign Facebook knows to put your ad in front of people that are most likely to comment most likely to share most likely to like the post um and you will get lots more social proof with that option so that's great you get that social proof then use that post use that ad in in a conversion campaign if you're operating with a higher budget you know ten thousand dollars a month twenty thousand dollars a month I would say just go straight for a conversion campaign you do still generate social proof with conversion campaigns it's a little bit slower but with those higher budgets you get there so much faster anyway I don't think it's worth the time and effort of slowing things down to run the engagement campaign first um I just go straight for conversions particularly when you're operating at higher budgets you're going to need to be refreshing ads that much more regularly if you're constantly having to run an engagement campaign first I think it can can get in the way it just doesn't offer that much advantage now whether or not you should do this also depends on your industry with some industries social proof on ads is much more important than others okay so are you selling a product or service where there's a lot of market skepticism perhaps people in your industry competitive yours haven't delivered on promises it's known for there being some dodgy actors there in which case social proofs can be that much more important my industry would kind of be one of those right lots of people have experiences of hiring uh digital marketing agencies that just haven't been able to deliver so for us social proof is really important so you'll see in my marketing we use testimonials and caseless and things like that a lot um in other industries if it's a little e-commerce product less important okay and the advantage to having social proof is not as big as it once was so don't think that you know you run a conversion campaign it didn't work oh if you just quickly run an engagement campaign on those ads get lots social proof and then rerun it it's all of a sudden going to take off that's not necessarily the case it gives you a bit of a boost and is worth doing as I said if it's important for your industry if you're using a smaller budget but it's not that big a deal it's basically what I would say about that question so it's a very good question that I was asked recently wanted to address it in a specific video hopefully that is helpful and you can work out which way to go and and yeah and before you go one thing I want to quickly mention is a free um a free resource really called my Facebook ads mastermind group it's a free Facebook group we currently have 85 000 members one of the biggest communities of
