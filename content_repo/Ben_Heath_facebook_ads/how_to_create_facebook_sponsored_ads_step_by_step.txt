Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to create Facebook sponsored ads. Now when you're using Facebook or Instagram you may see the sponsored tag alongside certain posts. Those are paid ads that people are running on Facebook and Instagram that businesses are using to try and get their products and services in front of the almost 3 billion people that use Facebook and Instagram on a monthly basis.

And you may want to get your ads in front of people as well. You get your products and services in front of people, use it as a tool to drive sales and that might be how you landed on this video. So I'm going to go through the entire process.

I'm going to walk you through exactly how you go about creating Facebook sponsored ads that will work on both Facebook and Instagram and hopefully you can implement the steps and use it to generate a whole bunch of sales for your products and or leads for your services depending on what kind of business you have. Okay so I am in an example Facebook ad account here. That's what I'm going to use to demonstrate this and I'm in Ads Manager.

Now if you're not familiar with Ads Manager you've never looked at anything like this I'd recommend you check out a video I've created called How to Create a Facebook Business Manager Account. So if you want to advertise on Facebook, on Instagram it's well worth creating a business manager account and then you create an ad account within that and once you've done that you'll be sent to a screen that looks like this. So there'll be a link in the video description below all about how to create a business manager account.

Just go through that, follow that video step by step, get your business manager set up and then you can come into Ads Manager right here and follow along this process from where we are right now with me. Okay so let's go ahead and create a campaign. So you want to click on this green plus create button and then what I'm going to recommend you start with is a conversions campaign.

It's not the simplest campaign type to use but it is certainly the most effective. Okay now to use a conversions campaign objective you're going to need to have the Facebook pixel installed on your website. So again there'll be a link in another there'll be a link in the video description below to another video showing you exactly how to get the Facebook pixel set up and installed on your website.

So if you haven't yet done that again I'd strongly recommend you go ahead and do that. If you want to not worry about that for now and just get started as fast as possible and add in the Facebook pixel later then you want to go ahead and use the traffic objective for now. But as I said I would recommend you go ahead and get that done and use conversions.

Okay so we can give this a name if we want so let's just call this example Facebook ad campaign and then you'll immediately see here it's a great visual representation that when you create a Facebook ad campaign there's three levels there's the campaign level then within that you have the ad set level and then within that you have the ad itself and that's what you can see here right and the different levels govern different parts of the Facebook sponsored ad right so um well we're going to walk through the steps so you'll see it but ad set for example is targeting things along those lines so let's call that example Facebook campaign example ad set and let's go here with example ad we'll keep things nice and simple to start with so go ahead and click continue okay I am by no means going to cover every single little setting option that's available within a Facebook ad campaign setup there are tons I have videos on just about every single setting so if there was anything you were particularly interested like special ad categories or buying types or campaign objectives you can literally just search in YouTube for my name Ben Heath and the name of the thing a video will pop up and you can go through it so if there's anything that I missed you're like what about that what about that don't worry you can go ahead and find the details what I am going to focus on here is what you need to get right and what you need to add in if you're creating Facebook sponsored ads perhaps for the first time or perhaps you're relatively new to Facebook advertising and we're going to cover what you need to do and need to get right so we've already selected our campaign objective as I said I would strongly recommend you use conversions to do so you will need the Facebook pixel installed otherwise go ahead and use traffic and then we're going to scroll down and for the purposes of this campaign we're not going to worry about campaign budget budget optimization again I have videos about that I would normally recommend you use this but just to get started don't worry about it okay so then that's that's literally all we need to do at the campaign level so very straightforward don't worry about that then we're going to jump over to the ad set level now the ad set level we're selecting options for targeting who we're going to advertise to and delivery settings you know when our ads are going to run where they're going to run all that sort of stuff okay so the vast majority of you're going to want to send people through to your website and you're going to want to be optimizing for a specific event like a purchase or a lead or something along those lines so for example let's assume you're an e-commerce product I could go ahead and pop in purchase in there okay now I'm going to get warnings pop up as we go through this because this is an example Facebook ad account we don't have things set up fully in here so just ignore those if I don't talk about it it's not something you need to worry about but you could go for the purchase conversion event and if you're unfamiliar with this when you go through that Facebook pixel setup video it'll clear it all up for you don't worry about dynamic creative don't worry about offer the next thing to get into is budget I strongly recommend you use daily budget as opposed to lifetime budget those campaigns run consistently or at least can and they tend to produce better results and you can scale them lots of advantages again you can find out more about that in terms of what to start spending I have a whole video about starting budgets so I'll include a link in the video description below but just to quickly say that you want to spend something that is meaningful to you as in you're going to want to come back in and see how your campaign is performing you're not just going to set it and forget about it for a month but not no amount of money that's going to in any way hurt you if you lose it right so there's usually a sweet spot where you're like oh if I spend that much I don't want to lose it but our business it's not going to hurt our business in any way we're going to be absolutely fine but it's going to be important enough for me to check and be motivated to improve this incentivize to get it right what that is for your business you know for some businesses that might be as little as ten dollars a month for others it might be a thousand you know we as a facebook ads agency we work with clients where we spend the full range of of well not right at the lower levels but it can go you know larger businesses can spend huge amounts and it'd be relatively small amounts I mean I imagine for most people watching this video it's probably going to be something you know relatively small might be twenty thirty dollars a day something on those lines okay I'll leave it at the default and then we scroll down to the audiences section now I'd strongly recommend that you don't mess with custom audiences or lookalike audiences initially those are more advanced Facebook advertising techniques they're incredibly effective but when you're getting used to creating Facebook sponsored ads when you're used to when you're learning the process don't need to worry about it then set your location and this needs this just wants to be where the majority of your potential customers are from you can do a local area so for example I am based in Cheltenham in England so I could for example and all the Cheltenham's have come up I think except for England which is probably the original and so I can add in for example Cheltenham and then a certain radius around that I could do you know 14 miles around Cheltenham or whatever just think about where the majority of my customers located it is absolutely fine to advertise nationally so if you sell a product for example or a service that can be delivered internationally you could go with United Kingdom and in fact it is also absolutely fine to go with multiple countries so as a business ourselves you know we're a Facebook advertising agency we work with clients all around the world the two major markets that we operate in are the UK and the US I mean we have lots of clients in Australia Canada and stuff like that but those are the two major ones so we could start with something like let's add in Canada and let's add in Australia we could start with something like that would be absolutely fine as well so don't need to overthink that just where the majority of your clients and your customers are likely based age range you want to set that around what you think the majority of your customers fall into but be quite generous so let's say for example the majority of your customers are age 30 to 45 you might want to go with something a little bit wider than that better to be um better to be too broad than too narrow Facebook ad campaigns tend to perform better with larger audiences because that allows Facebook's machine learning process to work out who is best to advertise to so let's say the majority of customers are 35 30 to 45 we would go with something like 25 to 50 or 25 to 55 something on those lines okay genders if you are very heavily skewed towards women or men let's say 85 plus then you can go with one or the other otherwise again I would keep it broad if you're say 70 of your customers are women 30 of men I would leave it at all you don't want to discount that that really large um proportion of your target market then we get into detailed targeting I'll include another link in the video description below lots of links but I want to make this as useful as possible to how about we how we go about finding interest targeting options cold audience targeting options that can perform really well so I'll include link to that and you can go through that um but you can get started by adding in things that are relevant to your business so let's say for example um if I was advertising shoes I could start looking adding in things like shoes and it's taking a second but you know you've got shoes I've got all sorts of different types of you know trendy shoes you could women's shoes bespoke shoes and you can just go through these lists and just start to pick out options that you think are highly relevant to your business this is an absolutely fine way to get started there are more advanced techniques later on but absolutely fine ways to get started so for example I know that if I was advertising my own services my own Facebook advertising services I could go with things like business page admin so that's the the admins of business related Facebook pages I know that's going to be a good um targeting option for me to use okay I'd recommend you only add in one targeting option per ad set because we're just going to get started with one ad set it's absolutely fine just to add in one and there are advantages to doing that you'll find out more info about that if you check out some other targeting related videos but I just add in the one for now that's going to set you up better for success later so go with the one that you think is most applicable to your audience again broader is better than more specific now what I would encourage you to do once you've added in your targeting options is to unselect this detailed targeting expansion and what that's going to do is on the right hand side you're going to get an audience definition now my audience definition is four million people so there are four million business page admins age 25 to 55 in the UK, US, Canada and Australia four millions are perfectly fine audience size to advertise to if I was to find that this was anything below 250 000 I'd try and make it broader and you can do that obviously by adding in extra location targeting options if that's possible for your business if you're not a local business you can do that by using broader and detailed targeting options so targeting options that are going to encompass more people you can also do that by going from just men or women to all you could even get rid of all detailed targeting options if for example you're just advertising locally and this audience is quite small now if you're just advertising locally some businesses are always going to have audiences less than 250 000 people in which case that's fine don't worry about that but for all other businesses I want the minimum to be 250 000. There are maximums that I would put in place again another link in the video description about ideal audience size if you want to check that out okay but otherwise we're set up and I would recommend you actually leave this unselected when you're first launching a Facebook sponsored ad that's something that can be added in languages this is unlikely to apply to a lot of people watching this but for some it may perhaps you just want to reach certain language speakers within a market if you're in Canada for example maybe you just want to reach French speakers in which case you can go ahead and add in more specificity around here but most are going to want to go with all languages then we get into the placement options okay placements refers to where on Facebook and Instagram your ads are going to be displayed so the default is automatic placements but if we select manual placements I can show you the options there's four major categories there's Facebook Instagram audience network and messenger and you can see that within these there's lots of different uh various options okay loads and loads of placement options if you are using the conversions objective as I would recommend you can absolutely go ahead with automatic and that's one of the advantages of the conversions objective is Facebook is going to work out where your best results are going to come from are you going to get the best results from Facebook feed or Instagram stories and they'll put your ads there according to performance if you're using something like traffic because you don't have the Facebook pixel installed then I'd recommend you come in and narrow it significantly and just go with the feeds options and the stories options and the rest of the stuff you're going to want to um unselect and you could even get more specific and just go with say Facebook feed and Instagram feed and get rid of these other options although these other options only make up a small fraction of your own impressions and then you could leave the the various stories options in there okay and you could come in with something like this if you wanted to that would be absolutely fine and what I'd recommend you do if you're running a traffic objective because with the traffic objective Facebook isn't necessarily going to know where your customers let's say in this case we're optimizing for purchase where your purchase are coming from they're just sending you people to your website they don't have that further visibility and therefore you want to select the higher quality placement options where the quality of the traffic is going to be higher with automatic placements you don't need to worry about that because Facebook's going to find those anyway because that's where people are going to convert from so hopefully that makes sense but for this example we're using conversions therefore we can go over the automatic placements um don't worry about adding in a cost control again something you can look to add in later on I have videos about cost controls and cost caps so you can check those out if you want but otherwise that is our targeting our ad set level and delivery settings and placements taken care of we can go ahead and click next then we get into the ad level which is of course a really important part of any Facebook sponsored ad it's the part that your customers actually see it's the part that you'll see when you're creating Facebook and when you're seeing sponsored ads on Facebook or on Instagram and it's the visual part obviously a very important thing so Facebook now is defaulting to a lot of dynamic formats and creative and I think that really over complicates things for a lot of new Facebook advertisers you're creating your first Facebook sponsored ads or your first you know even your first 50 Facebook sponsored ads I would recommend getting away from dynamic formats and creative and what I'd usually do is go with something really simple to get started like a single image ad okay so let's go ahead and select single image we've turned off dynamic creative we've gone ahead and selected single image then we're going to go down to the add creative section and we're going to add some media so the first thing we need to do is select the image that we're going to use so let's click on add media and add image and what we're going to do there's loads of example stuff in there by the way so don't worry about that is we're going to advertise this rainbow cake okay it's very similar to an ad we've created for a client of ours that worked really really well it's a fantastic image that we've got here and I'm going to use this as an example to walk you through the ad creation process so I obviously selected this image that was already in our page but you've just seen on the pre I probably skipped over it too fast but you've just seen on the previous window you could just upload an image from your computer very straightforward to do once you've done that the next thing and you by the way you could do this with video as well if you've got videos that are there and ready to go absolutely fine to get started with videos um with your facebook sponsored ads and videos often perform very well okay don't I just want to keep this as simple as easy for you guys as possible to get started you can add in layer of complexity later so once you've added in your ad creative which is your image video things like that you can then select how it's going to look in various placement options so obviously when you see ads sponsored ads that are in stories formats um they're vertical aren't they they take up the whole screen so that's what we can see over this late left hand side usually we would replace this image with a a better option that's going to fit the space better and you can just use that literally by clicking the replace button we don't have anyone ready to go any image ready to go for that so I won't do that in this case but you could also go with this original it doesn't look great there but it will look much better when facebook and instagram do their thing to it and make it look fine so you can just go with the original image for feeds um I really like the one-to-one placement that's how it looks there I think that looks great we could also go with the original but I would I would quite like to zoom in on the main main feature and then right column search results there's you're not going to get as many impressions in this format if I go with that format is absolutely fine I could also keep the original but we could zoom in that's going to work as well so it's just like a visual check to make sure that your image looks good in the various placement options that you're going to use as I said we could use we could get a completely different image made um or edit it up which we often would for the stories placement and we would just click on replace and upload it super simple then you'll click on next and facebook will automatically add enhancements they're gonna um crop out dead space they're gonna enhance this is kind of works similarly to like photo editing software where you click like the enhance button it turns up the contrast and things like that so absolutely fine to allow those then we click done fantastic so we've now got our image added in I'm going to get rid of this stuff here because I said there's going to be lots of warnings and we can start to see here look how our first let me scroll down and see how our ad is starting to look okay so we've got the image which is still in the process of being enhanced by the looks of things we've got the image and you can see here that these are various placement options so that is this is how it's going to look in the facebook news feed we're going to add in the information here of course but that's how it's going to look in the facebook news feed I think that's a fantastic looking image you can go across that's how it's going to look in instagram facebook marketplace and this is what it's going to look like at the moment in stories this is the instagram stories option which as I said doesn't look anywhere near as bad as as it looked in the preview okay but we could we could upload a different image you can go through the various placement options and see make sure it all looks good okay now if we jump back to facebook news feed now once we've got the image added in and keep scrolling back up then we need to add in the primary text is the next thing and by the way if you didn't manage to customize your ad creative in the image uploading window you can do it here so you can edit the group and make adjustments and things like that all in the ad creative section very simple right primary text so I've prepared a document um here so this is the primary text let's go ahead and oh let's go ahead and grab this stuff and we're going to copy and paste this in to the primary text now the primary text is going to appear in different places on different um placement options so for example you'll see that the facebook news feed the primary text appears above the image you probably if you've seen facebook sponsored ads and paid attention to them you've probably seen this sort of thing and you can see that what we're looking to do with this primary text is sell the product you know and you could do this with a service as well someone could quickly read through this our signature rainbow cake smothered in white chocolate buttercream frosting and topped with fresh fruit but the best bit it's only 150 calories per slice and we're currently offering a 10 discount seriously click shop now to brighten up your day so you can see there that we're we're being really emotive in the copy we're trying to highlight the benefits associated with this product why people want to buy it it's you know um very descriptive words we're highlighting the fact it's only 150 calories per slice there's a 10 discount we're incentivizing people to take action and it's fun and and appropriate to the product that we're advertising but also the platform we're advertising on facebook and instagram ads don't want to be stale and stuffy they want to be light-hearted and fun and and useful and um and yeah so that's that's the sort of tone we've gone with here that sort of copy can work really well obviously you can take something like that and use it for your own product or services and we said click shop now to brighten up your day so there's a call to action at the bottom and we've included a bunch of emojis which is always fun right then we want to add it oh by the way you can see that the primary text if i scroll down options look different um depending on the placement so i said the primary text is not above the image on instagram feeds we've got the information in down beneath it but there's not you know you don't really have any control over that just because you're advertising different locations and that's nothing to worry about right then we come back in and let's grab the headline mouth-wateringly good low calorie cakes so let's go ahead and get that added into the headline you can see it's optional but i would strongly recommend you add one in and if we go back to our facebook uh feed option and scroll down we can see oh it hasn't added it in just yet but it will do it'll add in that uh that headline for us in there mouth-wateringly good low calorie cakes again benefit rich uh emotive makes people want to take action all that sort of stuff description is optional we've got one ready here um and we're just emphasizing the fact that there's a limited time only 10 discount so we're incentivizing action and we're also by giving the 10 discount and we're also adding an urgency like do it now this discount is going to go away if you can do something like that that's really um helpful i'd leave that disabled for the time being again something you can potentially look to to do in later on then we've got the call to action buttons hopefully this is now uh it hasn't added in the headline yet but it'll get there but we can see we've got the call now to now function is learn more i think for something like a cake that's not really appropriate i think um we want to go with hand it down shot now and out of these call to action buttons don't overthink it guys just go with the option that is most applicable to whatever it is that you're selling if you're trying to get someone to subscribe to something or to contact you or download something just go ahead with the best option in this case it's going to be shop now then of course we need the page that we're sending people to on our website with a ad like this that would usually be the product page i'm just going to pop in a url to get rid of the various warnings just url to my website and then if you wanted to you could have a different display link so the display link is this section you can just about see here we've got leadger.co.uk you could add in something to make that look different if you wanted to again it starts to get tons of complicated stuff in here right um instant experiences events just when you're getting started don't worry about that it really is quite a minefield again just a quick note on the languages you know you can add your own translation to automatically translate your ads to reach people more languages maybe that applies to you maybe it doesn't depends where you're advertising so that might be something you want to look into and then tracking down here all this should be set up for you automatically and if you've got the facebook pixel set up correctly and again as i said there's a video in there a link in the video description below that shows you exactly how to do that but we've now got our ad created okay so you can see the headline has finally been put in there i'd recommend you have a quick check through make sure you know how does the ad look in various placements do we need to make any changes you can see the text in there in stories fantastic and then you can go ahead and click publish once you click publish an ad like this will usually um you know take 30 minutes or so to be approved facebook has like an algorithmic approval process where they're making sure you're not breaking any of the rules if you're unfamiliar with the facebook advertising rules i'd strongly recommend you check out another link in the description to a video all about facebook advertiser policy if you break the rules your ads will be just will be disapproved and your ad account could be disabled so make sure you're familiar with the rules with your ads before you go ahead and launch any new campaign if i close this down now and then once you run the ad you'll see it takes half an hour or so to be approved then once it starts running you're going to start see results coming through um there is a bit of a reporting delay so be aware of that if you're thinking i'm not getting any results yet it could just be they haven't come through yet um but then you can go in ahead and make adjustments so you could see okay this ad is not performing well let's turn it off let's create a new one and try again you can also have a look at performance at the ad set level and you can go ahead and create multiple campaigns it's all sorts of stuff as i said i've got tons and tons of things for you guys to check out on my channel if you're new to facebook advertising you're relatively new to facebook sponsored ads lots of stuff that should be really helpful make sure you
