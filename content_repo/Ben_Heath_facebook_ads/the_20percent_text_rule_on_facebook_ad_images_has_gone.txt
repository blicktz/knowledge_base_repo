Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about the fact that Facebook have now removed their 20% text rule. Previously you may already be aware that Facebook used to require that no more than 20% of your image in your ads contain text. They want to limit the amount of text on images but they've now gotten rid of that.

In fact they've even got rid of their tool that they offered for free so that you could check that and that means that's a big deal. It may not sound like it but that's a big deal Facebook advertising is going to change the way a lot of Facebook advertising has done and a lot of the way Facebook ads look over the coming months and few years. So very interesting topic.

I'm going to quickly talk about what it means, what I think is going to happen, how we can take advantage of it in this video. Before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button, click that thumbs up and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already. So I'm in an example Facebook ad account just to show you the sort of thing that we can now do.

So a very quick example. I've got an example CBO campaign up here, just going to click into that I'm going to go into one of the ad sets. I'm just going to quickly create an ad and you will see I'm just going to call this example ad, click continue and then you will now see if I scroll down to, so if I go ahead and click add media and add image and then grab this image that I prepared here, click continue and we'll pop this in an ad.

So this image by the way is every Wednesday afternoon at 3pm UK time I do basically free live training in my Facebook ads mastermind group which by the way that sounds like something you want to watch out for. This one was all about custom audiences, you can join my Facebook ads mastermind group over 50,000 members, link is in the video description so go ahead and check that out and you can amongst a whole bunch of other things see my free live trainings in there. But every week I put up a post like this that shows what the topic is going to be all about.

Now as you can see this thumbnail that's been very nicely designed by my graphic designer here is basically all text. Yes it's got a little image of me, it's got some other stuff going on but it's basically all text. This would have been an absolute no-no not very long ago at all in Facebook ad campaigns but as you can see I'm not getting normally above this ad here you'd have all sorts of warning messages saying your ad has got too much text it's not going to run or Facebook would allow you to run the ad but they would just significantly limit the reach that you're going to get so they would put it in front of less people or basically charge you more for the privilege of having more text.

Now Facebook didn't want advertisers to use this because they wanted advertisers to use interesting images and things like that that didn't just sort of scream ad. Text-based images like this are more ad-like they're also highly highly effective there's a reason why advertisers have wanted to use them for a long time and there's a reason why Facebook have needed to basically well they started off by banning it completely they had a blanket rule of if you have more than 20% text you absolutely will not be approved and then they went to you can run ads with more than 20% text but we will basically penalize you for doing so you'll reach less people and now they're getting rid of it. There's a reason why it's because it's very very effective having a lot of text on a Facebook image ad you can get a great message across you can highlight the benefits of a product or service you can really grab people's attention often more so with text than you can with an image and that sounds a little bit crazy but particularly if you combine the two these bright colors and someone at a glance this is a little bit confused here because you know it's a lot of information live training time day the title but you can grab someone's attention as they're scrolling through their Facebook news feed or Instagram feed and just go boom tell them exactly what it is and grab their attention so I think this is absolutely if you're watching this video and you're advertising on Facebook something you want to be experimenting with are there image ads that you're using right now that perhaps have a little bit of text in that you could blow up that text massively that you could include um loads of loads more information on or a bit more information on that's really pertinent to getting people to take action what I would model from at this point that I think is where Facebook's likely to go is YouTube video thumbnails like if you go to my YouTube channel most other YouTubers we will in we include a lot of text on our thumbnails we know there's been so much testing on this done know that that is more likely to get someone to click on your video and go ahead and watch it that's why the vast majority of YouTube um thumbnails that you see come up particularly from established YouTubers are going to have lots and lots of text now YouTube haven't had a restriction on text and that's sort of where it's naturally gone in progression I think we're going to see something similar with Facebook ads now that we don't have this text restriction and they're allowing us as advertisers to put more and more text on I think we're naturally going to see lots of ads with lots of text I think they're going to perform very very well as a result um of course just because you've got lots of text on your image ad does not by no means a guarantee of success but it's absolutely something I think you should be experimenting with so that is what we're going to be doing with a lot of our clients over the next um you know few weeks and months and experimenting with things around this I think this is quite a big um potential opportunity it's also kind of easier to create great looking image ads now I mean look at this this is quite simply even though you know I've got a graphic designer that does these things for me but it's quite simply designed to get a whole like custom image made or perhaps find a really nice photo is a bit more difficult often whereas actually you can put text in that makes something look great without um needing to you know invest tons of time and money and resources into getting that prepared so um I think this is great news for us Facebook advertisers I'm gonna be very very interested to see how this performs in the next few months and I think in sort of six months time we're gonna be talking about the text ad being um the big thing and the big thing that you uh that you want to use so by all means give it a go very quick short sharp video for you guys today hopefully that's been useful before you go three things I want to mention is a free
