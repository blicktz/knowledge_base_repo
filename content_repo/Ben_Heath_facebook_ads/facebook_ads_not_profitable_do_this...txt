Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about what you should do if your Facebook ads are not profitable. If your campaigns are not delivering the results you need them to do for you to continue running them, for you to scale them, what should be the thing that you do, what should you test, that's exactly what I'm going to talk about in this video. Before I get into that I want to very quickly ask you to smash that like button and subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already.

I release Facebook advertising related content all the time, this video being an example. Okay so let's, I'm an example Facebook ad account here and let's say I've got a draft campaign, new conversions campaign, it hasn't got any results because it's in draft mode and this is for demonstration purposes but let's say you come into your ad account and you know you're looking at things and you see your results, you calculate your cost per conversion or maybe you've got a different campaign objective but you've got cost per conversion, you go through and you work out okay I'm costing this much in advertising to get a new customer, my customers are worth this much to me, once they factor in cost of goods or cost of delivering the service, you know what I'm about to describe applies to both product-based and service-based businesses and online businesses as well of course, it's just not profitable. You know that's what this video is for, it's people that have campaigns that are delivering some results, it's not just, it's just not doing it well enough and if you're delivering just zero results nothing I've got a different video you should go through, I'll include a link in the video description but if your campaigns are delivering some conversions, some purchases, some leads but just not enough and they're not profitable as a result, there's a number of things you can test to help improve that scenario, there's one I'm going to focus on and before I get into that a lot of people will test things like new ad creative, new targeting options, landing pages and those things are all great, don't think that you just have to test what I'm going to talk about in a second, you can test all that other stuff and go about improving them and isolating the variables and improving those over time is how you deliver fantastic Facebook ad results right, but the quickest and most reliable way to go from a campaign that isn't profitable to one that is, is to increase your average customer value.

Increasing average customer value is such a underutilized strategy that people don't often think about in terms of their Facebook advertising because they put Facebook advertising in a box right and to get better Facebook ad results you need to be working on your targeting options and your ad creative and your copy and just in Facebook things but that's not true. I'll give you an example to help explain why increasing average customer value is so important. Let's say you're selling shoes and you're selling a pair of shoes for $50, let's assume that it costs you $30 cost per customer required, so your cost per purchase is $30, so your advertising cost is $30, you're generating $50 in revenue once you factor in the cost of the pair of shoes to you, the cost of sales, perhaps the distribution cost and things like that almost certainly isn't profitable okay.

However, if you were to say sell a bundle of four pairs of shoes for $200, maybe you offer a little bit discount but just for argument let's say $200, it's not going to cost you four times as much in advertising costs to acquire that customer. So it's not like your cost of customer required is going to go from $30 to $120, it might go from $30 to $60 or $75 okay, something like that. And obviously there are exceptions to all this but in general that's what we're going to see.

And that's very interesting because when you work out the numbers you go okay $30 to generate $50 or let's say $75 to generate $200 or $75 to generate $200 is clearly the much better option. And the difference there is the average customer value provides much more revenue but getting more money out of customers often doesn't lead or doesn't come with a proportional increase in your cost per conversion, your cost per purchase. It's why the best performing Facebook ad campaigns in the business to see the best results of Facebook ads are basically always high-end service providers.

You know it's a kitchen designer that charges $50,000 to design and install a kitchen because that business won't think anything of spending $500, $800 to acquire a customer. They're like yeah sure easy. They can easily afford to do that because they make so much from the customer.

Now I'm not saying you should just you know tear up your business and go with high average customer value businesses although that may be something you want to do. But there are ways that you can increase your average customer value as a business owner right now just almost straight away things you can you can do. So obviously there's lots of things that are talked about in this in this space.

You can offer upsells so when someone buys something you can try and get them to buy something else either through a one-click upsell system. You can remarket people to get them to buy again and again and again and these are things you definitely want to be doing. But I think one of the quickest and easiest ways to increase average customer value is to take whatever it is that you're currently selling and make it into a bundle of other highly related stuff.

So I gave the example of shoes right. I could sell one pair or I could just sell four pairs you know as the bundle offer or perhaps I could sell three pairs and six pairs of socks. You know there are almost certainly this applies to products and services products and services that are highly related to what it is that you're trying to sell that you could add on that would be useful and helpful for your customer but massively increase your average customer value and maybe stuff that let's say once they bought the pair of shoes maybe someone needs to buy another pair anyway or another pair of socks or you know let's say you're selling you know let's say the shoes that you're selling are for soccer they're soccer boots right um well what's that person also going to need they're going to need shin pads and they're going to need long socks and they might need um a top they might need a ball they might need all sorts of things right that you could quite easily bundle in so I would very much encourage you to take some time and think about what is it I'm really trying to sell what else that's related to that product or service do my customers need like if you're an accountant could you also sell you know and you're doing wanting to do year-end tax returns could you also sell bookkeeping services could you also sell um some sort of admin services could you sell like remote receptionist services could you sell some legal services and in order to offer these things in addition you may well need to partner with other businesses or find other suppliers to supply with this stuff but if you can increase your average customer value from 50 to 200 or increase your average customer value from 350 a month to 600 a month that could be the difference between your campaigns being not profitable or kind of okay just about doing all right and being incredibly profitable you can spend 10 times as much acquire many many more customers and have a much more successful business there's there's very rarely a setting change within the facebook ad platform that's going to produce a you know a 3x improvement in results let's say you've got a 2x roas we change one thing and it goes to a 6x whereas almost never happens unless you've got campaigns that are set up poorly and there are big mistakes made which sometimes happens but but it's rare right the campaign set up well um it's very rare you're going to get that jump but you can do it with average customer value very much so you can very much 3x your average customer value and that result in at least three times better results because as i said the cost per purchase cost per lead cost per conversion is unlikely to increase to the same extent you know know let's say the kitchen designer at 50 000 we might be able to generate leads for 50 each okay if we were selling a you know car washing services for 30 um it's no let's say 25 because the maths is easier it's not like we're going to then be generating leads for 40 cents just not going to happen right um it's not proportional to sell that 25 car washing services you might still be paying you know five six seven dollars a lead way that's way way closer to 50 a lead than the revenues are in 25 versus 50 000 okay so hopefully that makes sense increase that average customer value and that is the first thing i would do first go to is to get that average customer value up sometimes you can just increase price as well that's worth noting sometimes you can just increase your price if you're charging too little you don't want to become uncompetitive of course which is why i'm a big fan of the the bundling option it's not like particularly if a lot of your competitors aren't doing it because your customers are going to find it more difficult to price shop so if you're selling you know not just a pair of soccer boots but also socks and you know some they could just look at your soccer boots and go okay they're 70 pounds versus this other company that's selling them for 62 i'll go with those um but if your whole bundle is 110 but you've also got as i said shin pads socks shorts three tops and you know it's much harder to compare pricing okay hopefully that's been useful right before you go a couple of things i want to quickly mention the first is our facebook advertising services so my company lead guru is a
