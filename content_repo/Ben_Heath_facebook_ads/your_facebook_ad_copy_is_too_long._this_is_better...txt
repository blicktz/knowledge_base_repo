Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to explain why your Facebook ad copy is probably too long, what you should do instead, but if we're going to interact I just want to very quickly ask you to smash that like button, that really helps me out and is much appreciated and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Very important you're aware of this Facebook advertising related stuff if you're running Facebook ad campaigns for your business. Okay so I'm in an example Facebook ad account, I'm going to jump straight, I've got an example campaign created, I'm going to jump straight to the ad level and let's go ahead and click edit into this and the part that I want to highlight here is the primary text so this is the section that appears above the image let's say in the Facebook feed, it will appear beneath the image or video in the Instagram feed and other placement options it's going to move around but if you think about the most common place to get an impression on your Facebook ad being the Facebook feed which is which is the case and the primary text what's going to appear above your image or video or whatever creative you're using.

Now Facebook are making a recommendation that is quite shocking I think for a lot of Facebook advertisers I'm going to hover over this little eye so here we go the primary text for your ad appears in most placements though the position varies the one I just explained basically you can use to tag we recommend 125 characters or less 125 characters or less is incredibly short copy so I just did a quick bit of research for this video the average sentence is 15 to 20 words long written sentence apparently and the average number of characters that that 15 to 20 word sentence is going to be is 75 to 100 so basically Facebook is recommending that you have one long sentence maybe a little bit more two medium-sized sentences three very short sentences that is incredibly short copy that's very very short primary text I see most Facebook advertisers are going to use primary text they're going to use Facebook ad copy that is significantly longer than that now that's not to say that you never want to go beyond that because there are certainly times when you do I think that in your primary text you should highlight the main one or two benefits associated with your product or service is it better quality than the competition is it a better price is there a new innovative feature do you have better customer service whatever it is really focus on that you would often start your primary text with something like the call out method to let people know who are involved in a certain industry or a location that this ad is for them I'll include a link in the video description below to another video all about copy and how to write it and various options so strongly recommend you go you go in fact I include a link to a couple of videos about ads in general so make sure you go through those this is really about the length um so there are times when you do want to go beyond that and times when you do want to use long form copy but the 125 characters being recommended is recommended for a reason that's because Facebook over the enormous amount of data that they're seeing within their Facebook across their Facebook ad um accounts that are operating they're seeing better results from really short copy we're talking a sentence or two for the most part now this is not something that Facebook used to recommend quite that short I've seen 250 I've seen 280 characters but that short really is very interesting so if you've got ads that are currently running and doing well leave those going perhaps try creating some ads to run alongside those that have really short copy that have a sentence or two how could you really condense the information you're trying to give away you know trying to provide in your ad to just a sentence and a bit or two sentences that highlight the main benefit associated with your product or service maybe use a bit of a call out method you could sometimes combine the two you know so instead of having a one sentence for a call out method one sentence for a benefit you could combine that into one sentence hey you know you could have something like West Londoners um check out our lowest price you know obviously I'm just coming up on things on the fly check out those other videos for more information on on Facebook ad copy and primary text in general but try some really short copy I think this is very interesting and a lot of you might be looking at this going wow my copy is way longer than 125 characters it might be five six sentences long in which case you may see better results by going with this way okay hopefully that's been
