Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about how and why you should become a Facebook marketing partner if you can. There are some real advantages to doing so so I'm going to talk through some of those and talk through the process of what the criteria are and yeah I think it's something that a lot more Facebook advertisers should be looking into. Before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button, please click that thumbs up button and subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already.

Okay so you can sort of google around Facebook marketing partner and you'll see all sorts of various pages and things like that come up. I'm on one of those pages you know become a Facebook marketing partner here that I'm going to sort of go through some of the things some of the advantages some of the stuff that that you need to to have. The advantages of becoming Facebook marketing partner you if you go on these sorts of pages and have a look around Facebook support docs you'll see loads of information but for me there's there's there's basically well there's mainly two there are some others.

The first is that you definitely get better access to Facebook support now whether you're and I'm going to get onto this in a minute whether you're an agency operating for clients or you're running this as your own business you know you're running your Facebook ad campaigns and and things for your own company everyone would love to have better access to Facebook support if your ad account gets disabled which we know happens all the time often unfairly you want to be able to jump on chat and get someone to take a look at that much faster that's one of the big big advantages that being a Facebook marketing partner gives you it is that support network you know if we have an ad account don't go down we can normally get it back up and running within a few hours whereas I know a lot of people are waiting weeks aren't they and so that's one of the major advantages is all the support side of things that also comes what comes with that often is high quality reps so when Facebook reach out to you and they say would you like to set up a call with the marketing expert we've definitely seen a big difference when you're in or we've had clients within the marketing partner program you get higher quality contacts within Facebook to communicate with and their advice is better and they're better able to escalate issues and all that sort of stuff okay the other side of things and this is somewhat recent is that Facebook have started making a lot of suggestions around how to improve performance so we've been sort of experimenting with this over the last you know a couple of months since we've since we've really been paying attention to it and much in the same way that if you've got any experience with like Google Ads Google been doing this for a while where they will say we predict a x percentage improvement in four months if you change these three settings and it's all done through there you know automatically but it's certainly helpful you know so we've had obviously we've got tons you know dozens and dozens of ad accounts within our our business manager account and um and Facebook has started popping up with suggestions of we'd recommend you change this setting we recommend you change this setting it'll help improve performance some of those we've enacted and we've seen better results from that which is great not all the advice given all the suggestions I think you want to go ahead with some of them we've seen we've been like no that's not quite right seems to be some things they always recommend like always going with automatic placements we know that yes that's right a lot of the time with conversion campaigns but not in every single scenario if we're running an omnipresence content campaign it's not necessarily something we want to do well it's not something we want to do um but having those recommendations are more useful and it also very much seems that Facebook is um gonna push this quite hard they know that a significant agency community has been built up and not just agencies and I'm going to get into that in a second it's not this is not just for agencies anymore which is great it used to be it's not just for agencies anymore but they know that a significant agency community is built up and they know that if Facebook can provide these people with support they can get better results for their clients they can get more clients through the door they can um help Facebook make more money by generating more advertising revenue you know Facebook's not sort of seeing as Google I think at one stage kind of did internally saw you know digital marketing agencies and things like that who operated on Google they saw them as maybe as not desirable unnecessary Facebook's and Google changed their tune on that by the way but Facebook seems to have really embraced their agencies and thinking these guys are effectively unpaid salesmen for us like my business for example we work very very hard to convince people to spend money um on Facebook advertising lots of money on Facebook advertising we work very very hard to get our clients great results so they scale up their Facebook ad budget so Facebook's going to be putting more and more into this and I think the requirements are going to get harder and harder to get in so it makes sense to try and get in now if you can if you're an agency and I said it's not just for agencies if you are an agency or your Facebook advertising services this is an absolute no-brainer you want 100% want to come and and do this okay so we've got becoming a Facebook marketing partner I'm going to go through some stuff in a second but let's just have a look at um some of the requirements so this is another tab up here kind of what this page is called oh it's just something we're already obviously a Facebook marketing partner so it's not providing um what that page is but um but this is section I want to have so qualifying Facebook marketing partner for agency so this is agency specific I don't know exactly what the criteria are for the other two categories I'm going to show you some of the stuff around that in a second and that's because we don't fit into the two categories we're obviously an agency and signed up a long time ago but the requirements are not very onerous right so verified business manager is what you need okay very straightforward spend minimum of 10 000 um usd in 180 days so if you've got ten thousand dollars spent within six months within your business manager account and that's the spend requirement that is not a lot at all if you're an agency with you know even one client you're probably going to hit that um so that's that's very easy to to get in on um this one's fairly non-negotiable it says be headquartered in the supported market I don't know exactly what the list of supported markets is if you go ahead and give this a go go through this process if you're not in supported market your Facebook will say and they'll find out pretty quickly again I think they're going to be expanding this program so more and more countries are going to be made available but but there you go but I know that for example obviously like us uk and major advertising countries certainly are um you need some business pages in there so your business manager must be connected to at least 10 facebook pages each having a minimum ad spend of 100 usd in the last 90 days that actually might be the harder option the harder box to tick than the spend for a lot of you facebook ad agency owners because you may have you know six seven clients and not enough pages you could probably create a few to be perfectly honest yourself and just have a little play with 100 usd just to to get this box ticked off that might be the more difficult one but again an agency of any size is going to have 10 clients remember this is obviously going to include a page of yours at least you could even create as I said two or three others so you can hit this fairly um easily and then of course you've got to have you've got to comply with all the uh ad policies and all that sort of stuff but that's that's very straightforward so that's all you need to get in in the first place okay it's not obviously going to be available for everyone but for a lot of people watch my stuff particularly those who offer facebook advertising services they're probably already ticking this box okay and then we've also got some information down here around how the facebook marketing partner program is ranked right so you basically move up in tiers within the marketing facebook marketing partner program um when you first get in I think it's just you have like a regular account and then you can go up to a preferred level and then you can go up to a premium level that's sort of the the three tiers at least the last time I checked obviously this is subject to change by facebook um but this is all done on based on things like spend qualifying placements how many active pages you've got qualifying spend so like to go up to the preferred level which is next one up I think you need two million dollars ad spend in your business manager across the last 180 days I can't remember yeah and 90 of that spend also needs to come from like conversion campaigns can't come from brand awareness um you need a whole bunch of active pages I can't remember the exact numbers um so that's where we are we've moved into the preferred tier then the premium one um it's like 20 million I believe over the last six months which is really quite a lot I mean you're talking million you know three million plus per month to get into the premium which you would need either very very large clients with massive budgets um to do that or a lot a lot a lot of clients that are you know even even if a client spending fifty thousand dollars a month you need a lot of those to get to to over three million a month um as you can can do the calculations and you also need a whole bunch I think you might need a hundred plus pages that you're managing to get to premium so there aren't that many businesses facebook ad agency owners in the premium section I said we're in the preferred I I expect we'll get to the premium at some point but uh but don't quite meet the criteria there but as you go through based on these requirements your benefits and what you get and your access to support improves as well so not only do you want to get in you want to try and move through the the uh the tiers where you can I mean obviously the jumps are huge right so going from you know you may have uh an agency that's you know across your clients you're spending you know um a hundred thousand dollars a month which would be absolutely fantastic right and uh and you're doing really well but obviously that over a six month period is six hundred thousand dollars you've got a way to go to get to the to the two million so getting in at ten thousand dollars spent over the last 180 days versus going up to preferred at two million does take some time takes a whole bunch of clients um so so don't sort of worry if you're just stuck at the the account level is what I'm saying there but if you can move up as your business grows you take on more clients then that's fantastic so that's just that's what the requirements are if you are an agency if you're off facebook advertising services now if we go back to the other page and you can see if I go to uh get started here and this will bring up a link where you basically can apply for the program so he says interest in the facebook marketing partners program and if I scroll down this is what I wanted to show you um you know you can say interest becoming a facebook marketing partner obviously you need to meet the criteria and then you need to go ahead and fill out all the details which I'm not going to do but this is the really interesting part down here so you have um you know please select the facebook marketing program type you were interested in so originally it was all just agency and that's what we're in as and that's what I've talked about with the qualifying things but they've added commerce and creative now I'm not going to go into these too much but if I click into these and open these sort of up in new tabs um and this is what I was saying this is not just a thing for agencies anymore they're expanding their marketing partner program because they want to be able to provide great support perhaps to larger businesses for the most part that are e-commerce based or creative based and who aren't necessarily working with lots of clients it might just be their business their own assets assets but their spend and and their what they what they give to facebook as a customer is worth facebook investing more resources in them so you can see here look help merchants maximize online sales by embedding facebook e-books purchase facebook pixel uh product catalog that sounds fairly basic at the moment there are some other benefits associated in this um and I think they're going to get added too as we go on so even if you're watching this video and you think well I'm not an agency company come and check these out right come and check out the commerce go through this see what it's all about um I don't know a huge amount about these to be perfectly honest because we're personally we're not in this one right we're in the the agency side of things and they do seem a little bit different but there clearly is some um some benefits to to be had having in this and as I said I think they're only going to increase okay so just go through you can click get started you can see what's going on and all that sort of stuff right you can see the requirements and that sort of thing okay and then of course there's the creative option which again I know very little about you'll know more if this applies to you go through read through the details um as I said we're focused on the agency side because we are an agency right so hopefully that has been useful you now want to where are we going to go let's come back to here you now know that where possible you want to try and become a Facebook marketing partner especially if you're offering Facebook advertising services it makes this an absolute no-brainer if you're a Facebook ad agency to become a marketing partner there's a lot of things you can do um once you get in there around providing information about your business and potentially using it as a as a as a option to find clients you know you can see here connect with new clients access partner specific resources and get served for your skills it's not something that we've delved into very much because we just don't need to to be honest we generate tons of demand for our services from other sources um but might be something that you want to explore you can upload all the information about your business and um and people can find you and hence well they've got this section down here um but yeah go ahead and give this a go and get on this and i think um you won't be sad that you did it there's no downside didn't have to pay for anything like that so there we go okay before you go a couple of things i want to quickly mention the first is a free webinar i've created called three killer facebook ad strategies to double or more your revenue and in this webinar i've broken down the
