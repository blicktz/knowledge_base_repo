Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to create a Facebook Ads schedule with Facebook Ads rules. Now a schedule is something that a lot of Facebook advertisers want, a lot of clients request it because there may be only certain times of the day or certain times of the week when you actually want your Facebook ad campaigns to run, particularly if you're looking to generate leads because perhaps you want to be able to contact those leads straight away and all sorts of things, maybe higher quality leads come through during the week as opposed to the weekend, maybe vice versa. So there's all sorts of reasons why Facebook advertisers might want to only run their Facebook ad campaigns during certain times of the day, certain times of the week and I'm going to show you exactly how to do that.

Now a very simple way of doing it that you may have come across is to use a lifetime budget. So when you create your Facebook ad campaign instead of using a daily budget, so setting an amount that you're going to spend each day, you can instead use a lifetime budget where you say I want to spend $500 over the next week and then with a lifetime budget you can set the schedule that says turn my ads on or on at 9am on a Monday, off at you know 5pm on a Monday, on at 9am on a Tuesday, all that sort of stuff. But the issue with that is that you have to use lifetime budgets and if you see my videos you may know that I'm not a fan of lifetime budgets, I'm a much larger fan of daily budgets because with lifetime budgets your campaigns have got to start and end date which means you have to keep creating new campaigns, that means you're constantly re-entering the learning phase whereas if you have a daily budget you can keep that campaign running for as long as you want which makes scaling much much easier and avoids keep having to go back through the learning phase.

So we always use daily budgets, I mean I'm trying to think of exceptions, I can't really, we always use daily budgets so how do you go about setting a schedule with daily budgets because that isn't an option within your Facebook ad account, that's what I'm going to show you how to do in this video. So here I am inside an example Facebook ad account and I've got an example campaign created, I'm going to show you exactly how you go about setting a Facebook ad schedule with rules. So I'm at the ad set level just because that's where most people want to set their schedule and targeting options, things like that but you can do it at any level, I'll show you that in a minute.

And what you want to do is you want to go ahead and click rules and create a new rule. Now just to quickly explain what rules are, rules basically automate certain activities. So you can use rules for example to turn your campaigns off if they get too expensive or increase budget if your cost per conversion drops below a certain threshold, your campaigns are doing really well and you want to spend more.

So you can automate all sorts of things. Now I'm not going to get into the detail of all the settings because I've created another video that shows you all about that stuff, exactly what Facebook ads rules are, how they work, why they're great and I'll include a link to that in the video description. With this I'm just going to focus on setting a Facebook ads schedule and we're going to use rules to do so.

So the first thing you need to decide is what you want to apply the rule to. Okay so I'm just going to go ahead and select all active campaigns. So I want all my campaigns to be turned on and off during certain times and for this example what I'm going to use is the classic that we get requested in that campaigns are only run during regular business hours and businesses want that because perhaps they're wanting they've got a customer support team that's going to call people but obviously they only work during business hours or their b2b and they think high quality leads are going to be generated nine to five Monday through Friday but that's the classic request that's what I'm going to show you how to do.

So apply the rule to all active campaigns all campaigns we want to turn them all off or on then what we're going to do is we're going to start with turn on campaigns okay uh yeah so all pause campaigns even because we're turning on that makes sense all pause campaigns turning on now we don't want this action to be conditional on anything we want it to happen at a certain time no criteria needs to be met so go ahead and get rid of that time range you want to select lifetime I don't want this rule to stop in three months time and my campaign's just to run all the time I still want to put this schedule in place attribution window don't worry about that and then you get down here to schedule so we want to go ahead and click custom and set up a custom schedule we want to run this campaign uh 9am to 5pm Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday so you want to come in and select all the days in here that we're going to get this rule to apply to and in here you want to go ahead and select 9am for all the options because remember this rule is just turning on pause campaigns so we're going to create a separate rule that turns off active campaigns at 5pm okay so if I scroll down and do 9am on all of these and you can see that basically this this rule isn't conditional on anything so every time it's a Thursday at 9am or a Friday or any other weekdays as soon as 9am ticks over boom the rule will kick in and the campaign will automatically be turned on but all pause campaigns in this case I mean you could be more specific you could select specific campaigns if you wanted to completely up to you so now I'll call this on I would say uh I'll give this rule a name turn campaigns on at 9am Monday to Friday something like that click create fantastic okay so that's our first rule so each time it goes to 9am Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday all our pause campaigns are going to be turned on now obviously we need to set the other side of that which is turning off all campaigns so I'm going to select all active campaigns as well I'm going to do turn off campaigns remember this is not conditional I want it to happen based on time no conditions need to be met everything else will stay the same going to click custom and we're going to do the same thing but we are going to set this at 5pm for all these options you see this is very simple to do and if this is something you've been wondering about before I bet you're going to be really frustrated that you've never seen it before um because I don't know why Facebook don't make it an easier option with daily budgets this is as far as I can see the only way to do it with daily budgets but for some businesses this is super important because you know I've seen it where we're running a campaign for a company looking to generate leads and you know the difference between calling someone 10 minutes after they became a lead particularly if they've got a call center set up um or 30 minutes after they became a lead and calling them the next morning when they became a lead at 7pm last night is the conversion rate difference is just enormous so that's now set up to turn everything off so I'm going to call this turn off campaigns um 5pm monday to friday create and it really is as simple as that guys and I can come in I can click manage rules and I can see in here that I've got two rules I've got an example of one I've obviously created later but these two have just been studied here so I've got turn off campaigns and turn on campaigns you can go in and you can delete these you can um edit them all sorts very very simple to do but um yeah a fantastic little tool and a very very easy way to set a schedule so if you only want your campaigns to run at certain times then go ahead and do this to set them up and you you don't have to do 9am to 5pm some businesses just want to advertise at the weekend um I've worked with one business that just advertised on Sundays because that was their best day and complete dependence it's completely up to you right before you go something I'll quickly mention which is a free webinar I've created called three killer facebook advertising strategies to
