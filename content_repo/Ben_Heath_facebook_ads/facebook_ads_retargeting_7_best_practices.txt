Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook ads retargeting and specifically I'm going to give you seven best practices, seven things you want to do or not do when it comes to retargeting on Facebook ads which is obviously a very important component of Facebook advertising and if you are retargeting which basically everyone advertising on Facebook should be, I think these seven best practices are going to help improve your results. Now before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay so I'm in an example Facebook ad account I'm going to demonstrate a couple of these I've also got some notes alongside me make sure I get these seven points right so let's get into it.

So the very first best practice when it comes to retargeting ads on Facebook is to use the conversions objective. Well conversion objective for the majority of people you could also use catalog sales if you're doing dynamic retargeting that's absolutely fine and I'm going to have separate videos about that but the majority of people want to be using the conversions objective or catalog sales as opposed to things like traffic, reach etc. Now I get this question semi-regularly where people will say but hang on with retargeting you're only advertising to warm audiences why don't you just use reach because that's going to reduce your cost you know per thousand people reached surely that's going to result in improved performance and I completely understand the theory there completely understand the logic but it just doesn't happen in reality.

If you run a retargeting campaign with a reach objective alongside a retargeting campaign with a conversions objective the conversions campaign is going to win we've tested this a bunch of times and I think it's because within a conversions campaign the structure of conversions campaign there is so much going on sort of behind the scenes that Facebook is doing to try and get you what you want which is conversions. With a reach campaign obviously the setup is completely different and Facebook is just trying to get you as many eyeballs as possible. There are things so obviously with a conversions campaign Facebook's trying to put your ads in front of the best people possible and you might be thinking with retargeting that doesn't apply but it does right if you've got a retargeting audience of 10 000 people the person that visited your website yesterday is a much better prospect than someone that watched a video of yours on Facebook you know four weeks ago.

Facebook knows that Facebook also knows or at least can work out as you run your campaign the best placement options to use the best time of day to advertise all those sorts of stuff that help you get the best conversions so with retargeting unless you're running an omnipresence content campaign which I talk about in separate videos I include a link in the in the video description that's the one that talks about all about long-term strategy which is a different campaign structure than what the majority of Facebook advertisers are going to use unless you're running that you want to be running conversions or catalog sales when it comes to your retargeting campaigns or different retargeting structures that I'm going to get to later and you can see it I've got that in front of me right now with this retargeting campaign you can see we've got the the conversions objective selected so that's best practice number one conversions or catalog sales number two in most industries you don't want to use what I would refer to as creepy retargeting copy so you don't want ads that have headlines copy or even you know text in images that has things like you didn't complete your checkout process come ahead and purchase or I saw you signed up for my webinar but you didn't actually go ahead and watch it in general people don't like that and we know that in 2021 and going forward we are going to see more and more crackdowns on privacy and retargeting in general and things along those lines so I think as that increases as sentiment sort of shifts more and more to anti-advertiser's ability and platform's ability to sort of track what you do and and retarget super specifically you don't want to bring attention to that highlighter in your ad copy now obviously if someone added a cart right and then they were about to purchase but didn't and then you retarget them either dynamically or not with that same product um that's absolutely fine but just don't highlight it in your copy saying you almost bought this come and buy it again just advertise it to the gem again use your regular sales copy it should be absolutely fine that's more likely to get you the best results we've tested this a few times and just sort of regular sales copy what you're often doing for your cold audiences in terms of ad copy can work better than sort of what can be creepy retargeting copy there are a few exceptions and so where the prospects in your industry are very familiar with retargeting practices so like if i'm advertising as a facebook advertiser my people know that these things happen um if you're a tech based business your audience almost certainly knows that these things happen they don't have an issue with it so you're probably fine in those sorts of spaces but otherwise steer clear of what can be creepy retargeting ad copy when you're retargeting on facebook okay number three when it comes to retargeting ad fatigue is a much bigger issue than cold audiences because your audiences are smaller i mean you might have larger warm audiences than you do cold audiences but it's very very unlikely you'd have to be a an enormous brand because your warm audiences are often much much smaller than your cold audiences obviously your ads are put in front of the same people many more times and you can run into ad fatigue issues so it's always a good idea to be refreshing ad creative changing up offers and things like that more often with retargeting campaigns retargeting ad sets than it is with cold audience campaigns okay what that number is in terms of frequency that triggers ad fatigue really depends on your audiences how warm the people actually are i've seen retargeting campaigns run up into the 30s of frequency with no issues i've seen them start to struggle around a five six frequency okay so it can it can vary a lot what i would say is keep an eye on a drop in performance when you see that is a very good chance ad fatigue is the issue and that's when you know you need new ads new offers and things like that okay i've got another video about ad fatigue and how to combat it so if you think you're having that issue go ahead and check out the video description there'll be a link to that video um in there okay facebook ads retargeting best practice number four is you might want to tailor your imagery to things that will speak to your specific audience and you can do the same with ad copy as well but imagery i think is the most striking part because that's where you're going to grab people's attention so this is a very separate point to the the sort of retargeting ad copy i'm not saying things like put in your images or in your copy you visited before but what will they recognize and mean something to them that perhaps you couldn't use advertising to cold audiences so a perfect example would be if you've got any sort of personal brand or figurehead attached to your business including a picture of them in your imagery in your videos in your images will speak to your warm audiences and might give you really good results in those retargeting campaigns whereas you couldn't do it with cold audiences so if i gave my example you know i've got a pretty large audience in the facebook advertising space if i run a facebook ad campaign i can include images of me and in the image or in the video whatever that's going to grab my audience's attention because they're used to watching my youtube videos being part of my facebook group and seeing me do videos there all that sort of stuff i couldn't do that really with cold audiences it just wouldn't be anywhere near as affected people that don't know me image of me is not interesting to anyone who cares right but it's going to have extra impact to people that do know my face and there are all sorts of examples of that so you could have you know if you're a local business and people would recognize your location you know you're perhaps you're on the high street or they might not know the name of the butchers they might not know the name of the business and it could be a butcher's and they might not know the name of the business but perhaps they'll recognize the building oh yeah i know i didn't know the name of that restaurant but now you've put a photo of it in front of me i know where that is that's just off this street and that sort of thing okay so what might your warm audience really resonate with what might grab their attention much more so than cold audiences okay try and include some of that in your imagery or your videos can help improve performance right facebook ads retargeting best practice number five is in general you want to make your retargeting audiences as large as possible don't artificially constrain them so a classic example is people will often just retarget people who have added to cart okay i would prefer now you can get more sophisticated retargeting and break it down to the various layers but i would prefer that if you just have one retargeting audience and and you would go with all website visitors as opposed to just add to cart so you're going to see better results we've already talked about the fact that smaller audiences leads to ad fatigue issues so where possible you want larger audiences but also when you're just start retargeting add to cart i don't think you're giving facebook as much credit as it deserves facebook let's say you give them all website visitors facebook knows who just added to cart they know who visited yesterday they know who initiated checkout they know who spent half an hour on your website versus who spent 12 seconds on your website um facebook is not going to miss out on those people that have added to cart but by including all website visitors you give facebook many more people with which to advertise to with which to work out who's going to get you best performance so i don't like artificial constraints on retargeting audiences so i don't like going with um you know people who visited the website in the last seven days i like to open it right up to 180 days make those retargeting audiences as big as you possibly can whilst obviously still keeping to the core of who you think is going to be a good prospect um and just giving facebook more leeway i think is a much better way to go and that brings me into into point number six um is that whilst you want your audiences to be as large as possible there are better retargeting audiences and others ones that give you better results so typically i would like to focus on off facebook retargeting audiences as opposed to on facebook retargeting audiences so what does that mean you're likely to see better results with previous customers um or website visitors um your email list so you know people that have taken actions off of facebook to get onto those lists or get into those audiences like visited your website like subscribe to email us like bought from you previously as opposed to the on facebook uh retargeting audiences things like video viewers um people who have interacted with your facebook page stuff like that okay um those audiences tend not to be as effective because it's just very easy for someone to just sit there and watch 20 seconds of your video it doesn't mean they're that warmed up you know they could um whereas if they come through to your website or particularly if they buy or subscribe that's a much larger action they've shown much much more intent there and i think those are the people that you particularly want to to retarget and make sure you don't miss out on so in general if i was sort of you know and obviously we tweak it for various businesses and circumstances but if i was to take the most common scenario when it comes to retargeting i'm going to have one retargeting ad set and that's going to include previous customers website visitors 180 days and my email list okay that's what the three that are going to be in there it's going to be as big as possible but narrow down to the off facebook custom audiences off facebook retargeting audiences okay that's point number six and then finally um number seven i kind of alluded to it just then is that in an ideal scenario most of the time i'm not going to have a separate retargeting campaign okay instead i'm going to have let's say my main cbo campaign my main campaign budget optimization campaign within that i'm going to include a retargeting ad set as opposed to a retargeting campaign separately and you can see in this sort of example retargeting campaign we've got cbo turned on down here why am i going to do that i think it's very easy and i've seen this mistake so many times it's very easy to overspend on retargeting remember the audiences are really small you probably can't spend a large percentage of your budget on your warm audiences just because you're going to burn them out really quickly now if you include a retargeting ad set so one ad set that's got all website visitors email lists previous customers in in amongst your main cbo campaign with your other cold audience ad sets what you're basically doing is you're handing the decision of how much do i spend on retargeting over to facebook and what facebook will do is they will spend money on your retargeting cam on your retargeting ad set according to performance and also according to its size because of course you might set up a a retargeting campaign with 10 000 people in your warm audiences today in three months time you might have 40 000 people in there and you need to be adjusting the budget along the way that's really hard to do and to work out to get right but if you just include it in a cbo campaign facebook will update and adjust that automatically so they'll start with the 10 000 as you put more people into that warm audience they'll spend more and more as um import performance increases perhaps you know you've got a new offer facebook put more into your retargeting ad set because a new offer is doing really well with your warm audience once that starts to fatigue they'll pull more money out of your retargeting ad set put it more into the cold audience ad sets that budget fluctuation and movement automatically by facebook is definitely something you want to take advantage of so for the most part we're going to be including a retargeting ad set in our cbo campaign as opposed to a separate retargeting campaign now there are exceptions i've already mentioned omnipresence content campaigns i said there'll be a link in the video description talking all about that that strategy which is very much a long-term strategy that is um so by all means you can um you could check that out for something that's that's different to what most facebook advertisers are doing but for the vast majority of facebook advertisers and what you're going to be doing on a retargeting standpoint i like the ad set within a cbo campaign as opposed to a separate campaign right quick recap through those seven facebook ads retargeting best practices number one use the conversions or catalog sales objective not reach traffic and things like that number two don't use creepy retargeting ad copy people don't like the idea they're being followed everything they do online number three ad fatigue is much more of an issue uh new ads new offers more frequently with retargeting number four is there imagery that will speak to your warm audience that wouldn't speak to cold audiences perhaps a picture of a figurehead in your business or a specific location something like that number five make retargeting audiences as large as possible where possible number six off facebook retargeting audience will produce better results than on facebook retargeting audiences and number seven including a retargeting ad set in a cbo campaign as opposed to having a separate retargeting campaign usually delivers the best results okay hopefully that's been useful couple of free things i want to quickly mention before uh before we go the first is a free webinar i've created called three killer facebook ad strategies to double or more your revenue now in this webinar i break down three different strategies three different sales funnels that we've created and that we use for our clients all the time they're very much tried and tested to deliver fantastic results and i break down each one of these sales funnels into their component parts and i also explain which one or which two of the three you want to use depending on which business you have right you need a different sales funnel to advertise 30 products as opposed to ten thousand dollar services or an online business versus an in-store business versus an e-commerce business versus a an app business there's all sorts of different things you need to do depending on on your business so i'd strongly strongly recommend you go through that webinar it's completely free link is in the video description below i think one of the biggest mistakes i see facebook advertisers make is using the wrong strategy for their products and services and if you do that doesn't matter what you do nothing's going to work no matter how good your ads are how good you you need the right strategy right so go ahead and watch that completely free other um thing i want to quickly mention is our facebook advertising
