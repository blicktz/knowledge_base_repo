Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to get consistent results with Facebook ads. In fact, I've got eight tips for you to help you get consistent results with Facebook ads. It's something that a lot of Facebook advertisers really struggle with is how can they get some consistency.

They might see great results on one day, really poor results the next day, etc, etc. So I'm going to go through some things that we do as an agency to really help flatten out those results and get you consistent results that you can use to scale and plan from and all that sort of good stuff. Before I get into the steps, I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash a like on this video, smash that like button and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new.

That would be very much appreciated. And with that said, let's get into the content of this video. So as I said, we're going to be, I've got eight different tips for you about trying to get your Facebook ad campaigns to deliver more consistently.

I'm going to go through those now. What you can see in front of you right now is that I am in an example Facebook ad account, I'm in an example campaign and an example ad set because a lot of generating consistency and sort of not doing things that affect your consistency is set at the ad set level. So I thought this would be a good place to jump in and show you some things.

I've got my little list on the side here to make sure I get these, get them right and don't miss anything out. But with that said, let's go ahead and let's go through them. So the first thing I'll say about getting consistent results with Facebook ads is that you need to look at a longer time horizon, okay?

It's basically impossible to achieve high consistency levels if you're looking at your Facebook ad campaign every three or four hours, even daily, okay? There is going to be some natural variation and it's one of the reasons why, and if you see my content, you'll know that I'm a big fan of assessing things on a seven-day basis, okay? Assess things on a seven-day basis and if you can compare week one to week two to week three to week four, your results are far more likely to be consistent than if you compare day one to day two to day three to day four, okay?

A week obviously encompasses, seven days obviously encompasses a week and you can have a lot of variation just depending on the day of the week. Some businesses will get great results on a Saturday, Sunday over the weekend, some won't. There'll be terrible results for those days.

So you get a lot more consistency in that sense, but also just natural, if you've got any understanding of statistics, the longer time horizon, the more you have, the more data you have within that data set, the more likely you are to see something that's closer to the average you're likely to achieve. If you look at things on a daily basis, you can be like, ah, that ad's not performing anymore. You can pause it and that could be a really bad decision.

You can make adjustments too quickly, jump to snap decisions, and that can really negatively affect your campaign. So the first thing is to look at things on a weekly basis and you'll find that your consistency, your campaign performs much more consistently naturally and that's very, very important. So that's the first thing I would say, assess things on a weekly basis.

Now you do have to run that through a budget filter. You know, we've got campaigns where we're spending $5,000 a day, right? So we're not going to look at that on a weekly basis because we're going to generate so much data so quickly that you have to do things a lot faster.

So calibrate that seven days according to your budget. With a really small budget, maybe you need to wait longer. With a larger budget, maybe it can be quicker than that.

But that's just the first thing that's really important about assessing and maintaining consistency is just the time period around which you assess your campaign performance, okay? So that's number one. The second one, which is more of a sort of technical, practical thing, is to use larger audiences.

So if you keep running campaigns, you're creating new ad sets, you see great results for a little bit of time and then they drop off, which is something a lot of Facebook advertisers see, try using larger audiences. So you can see me here, I'm at the ad set level. You know, perhaps open up your age ranges.

You know, you don't have to go necessarily with just a 10 age or 10 year age bracket. Perhaps you could open that up to 20 or 30 years worth of whoever your target market is around. Perhaps you could add in, you know, other genders if you're just targeting male, female, add other options in.

Perhaps you can look to remove detailed targeting options or use broader detailed targeting options. So one thing that we find really helps with consistency, if we're seeing that sort of, you know, rollercoaster effect in results with things up and down is, okay, we're targeting a 1% lookalike audience, let's try and open that up to a 3% or a 5% lookalike audience and hopefully we can stabilise that out. Works really, really well.

Quick and easy thing to do, but is effective. So tip number two is to use larger audiences. Tip number three is to run multiple ad formats at once, okay?

Now let's say you've got your ad set set up here, you're targeting your group of people, you've got your targeting set up, it's a large audience. Some people within that audience are going to respond to video content. Some people within that audience are going to respond to images.

Some people are going to respond to slideshow. People have different personality types. They use Facebook and Instagram differently and therefore running multiple ad formats at the same time.

In fact, I've created a whole video about this recently, but running multiple ad formats at the same time can help Facebook advertise to more people within your target audience, which kind of has the same effect of increasing your audience size and gets you more consistent results. You're not just, you know, the video content lands really well with 5% of your target audience. So whenever Facebook finds that pocket of people, you get great results, but then it burns them out and your results drop off again.

Whereas if you've got multiple ad formats, you could advertise successfully to a higher percentage of your audience. And again, that does the same thing as increasing your audience size, just really helps level out your results and get you a lot more consistency. So something again, that's fairly easy to do.

You could be advertising the exact same thing, but just think, how do I turn this image in this image ad into a slideshow ad? How do I turn it into a carousel? Potentially, how do I turn it into a video?

It can make a big difference if you're seeing that rollercoaster effect that we often see with our Facebook ad campaigns. Okay, tip number four is to refresh your ad creative often. So this is particularly important if you have to advertise to smaller audiences, perhaps you're a local business or you operate in a niche that's really quite specific.

You want to be refreshing ad creative. All businesses that are advertising on Facebook want to be refreshing ad creative, but obviously if you have smaller audiences, you need to do it more often. But I really like to get ahead of ad fatigue here.

Don't let, you know, let's say you've got really good results for a couple of weeks, then you just sort of slowly start to see it trickle off. A great way to combat that is to get new ad creative into your ad campaign. Okay, ad fatigue is a real issue because you don't want your prospects thinking to themselves when they see your ad for the third, fourth, fifth time, I've already seen that don't need to worry about it.

I can ignore that. If someone does that, if your prospects are doing that, they're not going to pay your ad any attention. It could be the product or service is absolutely perfect for them.

But if they've seen it before, they're bored, they're not going to give it any time of attention, they can skip on to something else that's more interesting. If you change up the ad, if you test new images, if you write new copies, new headlines, they don't have that instant, I've seen that, ignore it. They're far more likely to actually check it out and actually give it some time and attention.

And therefore, they're more likely to find out what it's about. And they're more likely to convert. So in terms of how often you should refresh ad creative, it really depends on your target audience size and your budget.

I would say that for lower budgets, you know, you could probably get away with only refreshing ad creative once every two months. For higher budgets, you know, if you're running a campaign that's spending more than let's say $100,000 a month, you might need to be adding in ad creative at least once a week, perhaps twice a week to really help freshen things up. So it does depend on your current circumstances.

But my recommendation would be to stay ahead of it. For most advertisers, perhaps refreshing ad creative about once a month is probably about perfect. Okay, so that's tip number four is to refresh ad creative.

Right, tip number five is very important, not necessarily at the ad level, because it's not where I see people doing it. But here at the ad set level, we've got right in front of us, is to not mess with your campaigns too much. Every time you make a significant edit to your Facebook ad campaigns, and they will re-enter the learning phase.

Okay, when something re-enters the learning phase, obviously Facebook goes back into testing mode. And testing mode is very, very important, because they're going to find out the elements of your campaign that perform best, who to advertise to, what time of day to advertise, what placements to use, all that stuff. But obviously testing is not when your campaign is at its most effective, because some of the things Facebook tests are not going to work.

And that's going to reduce your number of conversions, increase your average cost per conversion in the short run. If you're constantly tinkering, if every two days you're coming in here and changing the targeting parameters, and you're going down to placements here and selecting manual placements, okay, let's turn on Instagram, let's turn off Instagram, let's add in some new ads, let's do all this sort of stuff, just constantly making little tweaks, which I see people do all the time, that is really going to negatively impact your Facebook ad campaigns. And really, you're going to really struggle to get consistent results.

That is absolutely one of the culprits I see for, and I have this conversation with Facebook advertisers all the time, where they're like, some days we can get great results, but other days we just can't. And I say, well, how, you know, are you in there messing around with things often? They go, yeah, yeah, I can't help myself.

I'll watch a video and I can't help but tweak a little thing or change a little thing. You think, just got to have more patience. So in the way I like to approach things, again, this is depends on budget, with high budgets, you can do this more often, with lower budgets, do this less often, but I think seven days.

So every seven days, we're going to assess performance, and we're going to make a batch of adjustments then, right? So we're not going to change one thing on Monday, another thing on Tuesday, another thing on Wednesday, we're going to wait seven days and change three things that we think need changing all in one go. So we're limiting the time that our campaign is in the learning phase.

Very, very important. So that's tip number five, is to don't mess with your campaigns too much. Tip number six, is to really experiment with your offers and try and find offers that appeal to a large proportion of your target market.

You know, okay, let's say we wanted to advertise, as we've got this ad set right now, to the whole of the UK. Now, there are offers that you can use that will only, I mean, that's obviously a very, very broad audience. So I'm just, it's a bit of an example.

But there are offers you can run that will only appeal to a tiny, tiny percentage of those 45 million people that are the Facebook and Instagram advertisers in the UK. There are other offers that are going to appeal to a much larger percentage. So a classic example is, if you're doing like a buy something, get something else for free, what's the something else for free that you're using?

Is that fairly specific and only going to appeal to a fraction of your target market? Or is that thing they get free something that everyone in your target market is going to be interested in? The second option might be better.

Again, this is the same principle what's going on here with finding offers that appeal to a larger percentage of your target market, as why we increase the audience size. You know, if you've got an offer that appeals to a small percentage of your target market, that'll work really well for a while when Facebook finds that pocket of people and you have fantastic results. And then once they've advertised those people, they start advertising to other people that aren't really interested in that offer, then you start to see a drop off.

Okay, whereas if you find an offer that's got much more broad appeal to a larger percentage of your target market, then you're going to have much more stable and consistent results. So, you know, the classic offers are things around price. That's obviously, you know, something that usually appeals to a large percentage.

Perhaps your audience isn't price sensitive, you know, some target audiences aren't. Get buy one, get one free, adding in extra things, free consultations, free quotes, this sort of stuff. And broad appeal offers can sometimes be better if you're seeing issues with consistency than just sort of trying to find something super specific.

There's been a lot talked about in digital marketing over the last, you know, decade, couple of decades, about going really, really specific, like niche down, niche down, you know, you've got to go with a tiny little audience. I'm not such a big fan of being too specific. It's definitely not good for Facebook advertising.

And the same applies to your offers. Okay, so tip number six is to find offers that appeal to a large percentage of your target market. That might mean you need to test four or five.

That's not a problem. It's well worth the effort. Tip number seven is that your consistency will improve naturally, the longer you advertise on Facebook and the more you spend.

So again, a lot of this is is just simple statistics. If you run an experiment, and you have 10 people in your sample size, the results have much larger variance, you're much more likely to get results that are, you know, not what you would expect off to one side either way, unrepresentative than if you've got 10,000 people in your sample audience. The same happens with Facebook advertising.

So for the accounts where we're spending a large, large budget, you know, 100k, 50k plus a month, you see usually very consistent results. You might see a fluctuation from day to day, like all Facebook ad accounts have, but it might be 20%. Whereas I imagine some of you watching this video are perhaps seeing, and I've seen this a lot where you run campaigns and you might see 10 conversions on a Monday, two conversions on a Tuesday, six conversions on a Wednesday, 13 conversions on a Thursday, and you're thinking, but this is just insane variation.

I'm seeing 80, 90% swings on some days, okay. And when you're spending at higher levels, and when your ad account is more mature, that's less likely to happen. So part of it's statistical variation.

The other part is just Facebook learns. So once you've generated 5,000 conversions, or 1,000 conversions in your Facebook ad account, Facebook's got a really good idea of what a conversion is, how to get you more of them, and all that sort of stuff. So your results do get more consistent over time.

So part of it is if you've launched a brand new campaign, and things are fluctuating, you're in the learning phase perhaps, is I'd say try and be patient, and just know that provided your average is okay, your results will be more consistent in two or three months time. That's just a natural way of doing things. And there's a lot of advantage with Facebook advertising to spending larger budgets, and one of them is the consistency that you see.

You also get access to Facebook reps and all that sort of stuff. But don't, obviously don't spend more just for the sake of getting that consistency. Your campaigns still need to be delivering good results for you to take that step.

But just be aware that if you're thinking, I can never plan my business around this and never scale based on these numbers, it will be more consistent in the future when you've got more conversion data. Okay, and then finally, number eight is not necessarily a tip that you can implement, but it's just something that's linked to the very first thing I said, and it's kind of worth reiterating here, is that some variation is absolutely natural, absolutely to be expected, and not a problem that you can fix. I get a lot of questions, and I'm getting this more and more and more from people that are saying, I've got this Facebook advertising related issue, how do I fix it?

And often my response is, you don't, that's just something you live with, that cannot be fixed. Or the fix is so drastic, it will do so much damage to the rest of your campaigns, that it's not worth it. For example, you'll see that one of these tips is not put in a cost cap.

Not a big fan of cost caps. Because yes, you might get more consistent results with cost caps or bid caps. But they also might stop you spending your Facebook ad budget, which might really negatively impact the performance of your Facebook ad campaign.

So the cure, in that sense, is worse than the actual issue in the first place. And trying to get rid of any variation and just wanting consistent results is absolutely not worth it. It's just like if you were to invest money in the stock market, right?

You would not expect there to not be any variation. That is not a problem you can fix. There's no strategy, no trick, no tip that you can to get rid of all fluctuation in the stocks that you've bought.

Absolutely impossible. And the same with Facebook advertising, right? There are steps you can do to mitigate these issues, and I've talked about those in this video, but some variation and some movement is absolutely unavoidable.

I mean, very simple things like external factors play a big role because you're advertising to real people, right? So what time of year is it? That can make a big difference.

What day of the week is it? That can make a big difference. What's going on in the news right now?

Obviously, 2020 has been a bit of a mad year in terms of what's been going on in the world and the news cycle being completely dominated. These things have an effect on your Facebook advertising. This variation is natural.

Depending on your business, the weather in your local area could have a big difference on your Facebook advertising performance. So don't fret and panic and get yourself all worked up, trying to get rid of all inconsistency and just have a flat curve. As I said, there are things you can do and I've been over those, but to some extent you have to just go, okay, this is life.

This is how it works. How can I still succeed knowing that these parameters are in place and that they're unavoidable? That's a much more mature and much better conversation to have, much better approach that's going to help you succeed, which is obviously the whole point of Facebook advertising.

You know, your Facebook advertising has helped your business succeed. It's not there to make your Facebook ad account look very pretty and numbers be exactly the same every day and all that sort of stuff. Okay, so hopefully those eight tips have been very, very useful.
