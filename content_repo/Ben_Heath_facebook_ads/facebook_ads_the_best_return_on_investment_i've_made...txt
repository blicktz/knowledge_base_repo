Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about the best return on investment I've made when it comes to Facebook ads. Now this is something I don't think a lot of you are going to expect given the title of this video but I think it's going to be very interesting and very useful and help you get better results from your Facebook ad campaigns if you're not doing this already. Now before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button please click that thumbs up button that helps me out and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already.

Okay so what do I talk about in this video? Really what I want to talk about what I want to emphasize is paying to get professional creative made for you professional media. I think a lot of Facebook advertisers let themselves down by you know they do all the research they watch like my YouTube videos or go through courses they work out exactly how to put a Facebook ad campaign together they've got all their targeting set up they've got everything set up and they you know maybe even they write good copy but they let themselves down at the creative side of things they just put an image in or they find a stock photo or whatever and they and they go with that and I think that if I you know I'm assessing where some of my best improvements in results have come from you know you can look at oh okay well we invested in a traffic campaign first before a conversion campaign and that helped improve our our return on investment not not the same I'd recommend but it's just an example or perhaps we ran a brand you know we invested in a brand awareness campaign and and that helped boost our profile which then led to increased conversions and that was a good we got a good return investment from that brand awareness campaign but I think in terms of what it costs you in comparison to what you get out of it paying to get professionals to create imagery videos slideshows and and sort of everything in between those for you is absolutely worth it for the vast majority of advertisers it's not necessarily something you need to do immediately when you first get started I think when you first get started you want to just get going make it nice and easy keep costs low prove that this platform can work for you but once you've sort of got that proof of concept you know that okay facebook and instagram advertising is something we can use to drive revenue on our business it can be a profitable outlet how do we make this better I think getting professional creative made is such a big thing it doesn't have to cost a lot at all and that's why I wanted the top of this video to focus on the return on investment because what it costs you to get professional creative made it could well be a tiny tiny fraction of what you end up spending on the ad campaign and if it's say one percent of what you spend on the ad campaign I mean maybe it's more than that I don't know what you're going to spend but if it's a small percentage of what you're spending on the actual ads themselves but it makes the campaign 20 30 percent more effective which it easily can do sometimes more often than that it is absolutely worth doing so it's something that I did really you know many years ago relatively early on and I started with some of the sources I'm going to recommend and I started with things like upwork okay it's a freelance you know in fact I've got a little tab here a freelance a place to find freelancers that will create images for you can find graphic designers video editors things like that you can also use tools like fiverr I've used fiverr before in more recent years I've been a big fan of using design pickle um we like design pickle is a bit more of a instead of like an ad hoc process where you get different bits made for you and you get teamed up with the designer or with a team of designers and they sort of continually work on the stuff that you provide them for a fixed monthly fee so I'd recommend um checking those out um as good options to get started with this and then at some stage you may want to just fully go ahead and hire a creative professional now you know as part of our agency we have a number of people that handle video editing graphic design work um all sorts of that sort of stuff and we're adding to that team and I think that that's really important I think when when you're thinking about facebook advertising you need to think about it through a competitive landscape right in all of the world you're going to be able to do it through a competitive landscape right in order for you to get the best results possible you need to win you need to do better than your competition okay um it's not something that's often talked about that much I mean it sounds obvious when you say it's not often talked about that much but if people are advertising similar things in your space which they almost certainly are and they're almost certainly targeting a similar audience to you you need to present things have an ad campaign that delivers better results than most of your competitors in order for you to achieve fantastic results it's just a fact of any online advertising platform that's you know this well known and this well used and you've got that many competitors on there and I think that if you're looking for a competitive advantage you know it used to be that five years ago we'd you know take a look at we get a new client you take a look at clients ad account you think oh wow okay they've got all these sort of delivery settings are wrong they're only advertising on this placement option the targeting's all off you'd go in and make all those adjustments keep the same ads and you'd see significantly better results just based on tweaking those things and we still do sometimes see that right we sometimes we will do that with clients where we keep basically the same ads but adjust some settings and we'll see significant improvements but as facebook has gotten more and more sophisticated as an ad platform as people have become more and more educated around facebook advertising most people know about lookalikes and things like that right they know or anyone who's been advertising for a while knows how to um use if not the best targeting options but good targeting options they know um how to set up their campaigns in a way that deliver along the lines of what i'd recommend um and often it then comes down to like i said what's the differentiating differentiating factor you could do it on price you can do it on what offers you're using good options but you can do it on ad creative and depending on your industry going from just a boring photo of an image um or even stock photography to something that a professional graphic designer can put together for you might immediately elevate your campaign above what your competitors can produce make you stand out and massively improve results you know we've seen creative come in and you know 30 40 50 improvements by a really professionally made suite of creative i think that is a way to stand out for your ad campaigns also if you own an agency you know how can you stand out from the competition deliver a better service i think the creative side of things is going to become more and more important that is going to be what really differentiates the sort of doing okay advertisers to the ones that you read about and hear about that have scaled a campaign you know a thousand x and you know they're generating insane amounts of customers on the platform is the creative so look tools like canva and stuff are great you can have a mess around yourself but unless you are a graphic professional graphic designer or or video editor or or a creative professional i really think that paying to get some stuff made for you is well well worth it and don't just do it once and get a couple of images and run those and go oh it didn't work we didn't see great results remember you know i get a lot of comments people say like oh i tested the thing you recommend didn't work and i'll be like okay well that's that's only part of it right like i'm recommending something here but you still need the other parts to get this to work it'd be like you know having a nice logo for your business right and going well i'm gonna have my business gonna be successful because i've got a nice logo you're like no that's a part of it you do need that or or it would help to have that but you need a lot of other parts as well and that's what this is so you need all the other parts as well but getting some some creative content made and going through a few rounds as i said don't just do it two or three images didn't work it could be other parts of your campaign that got in the way keep going keep going with it it doesn't have to cost a lot you know i'm always shocked at what some people will charge on platforms like upwork and fiverr in particular to do that sort of work and unless you're you know very much that way inclined which like i'm not personally at all um i don't do well with with imagery and things like that and it can really really help improve your results it's relatively expensive and look if you want this campaign to be something that means something to your business you might end up spending tens if not hundreds if not millions of dollars you know tens of thousands hundreds of thousands not tens or hundreds tens of thousands hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars on a campaign spending you know it can be less than a hundred dollars getting some images created easily even video even if you spend you know a thousand dollars on some video work um it could be absolutely well worth it so that is what i'd recommend and not just in terms of the campaign itself right so not just in terms of the um the return on ad spend you get from that conversions campaign let's say but also if your creative looks fantastic that does a lot for your brand awareness as well that remember that's the part that your prospects and your customers and people in your target market see are they going to remember it are they not how do you present yourself that visual element is really really important so a quick tip for you guys today but hopefully i've sort of you know hammered home the the importance of this and and it's a quick tip but a powerful one and something that you can really recommend and also if you're someone who struggles with creative which is what i did right at the beginning just going someone else can do that it's such a like relief in a way to someone who's really creative can do that they can make it look great and we can move on or we can get great results so that's what i'd recommend anyway hopefully that's useful before you go a couple of things i want to mention the first is a free webinar i've created called three killer facebook
