Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about what a realistic cost per lead is when it comes to Facebook advertising and Instagram advertising. What can you realistically expect to achieve? Now I get a lot of questions about this.

People want to know is my cost per lead good in comparison to the average? Is my cost per lead bad? Do I need to improve my campaigns?

What's possible? Will Facebook advertising work for me because I need to achieve a certain cost per lead? So I'm going to talk about all those sorts of things and what you can realistically expect when it comes to a cost per lead in Facebook advertising in a second.

Before I do that, I want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button. That very much helped me out and of course subscribe to my channel if you haven't done so already. Okay, so I'm actually on the home page of my website and you can see we are actually doing a bit of a website redesign right now by the way guys.

So if you check this out, it's leadguru.co.uk, you may well see that you know it looks differently. But right now we've got a screenshot of a Facebook ad account showing some campaigns we ran for one of our clients and you can see that in this case we spent just over £100,000 and so that's going to be today's exchange rate, 130-135,000 US dollars. If you're not in the UK, you're not familiar with pounds.

Generated 15,797 leads for a cost per lead of £6.50 which you know you're going to be talking $7.50, $8 cost per lead, something along those lines. Now I'm going to get into that in a second. What the first thing you need to do when you are assessing lead cost through any advertising platform is what exactly are you counting as a lead?

Because if you're counting let's say an email opt-in as a lead, you're going to have a far, far lower cost per lead than if for example you're directly advertising a service or perhaps you're advertising a free consultation for a service, a free quote, basically a full-fledged inquiry into your business, into your services, into wanting to work with you more, not just an email opt-in or something along those lines. In this scenario I'm counting the second option. I'm counting the full-fledged inquiry and that's why I'm going to base these numbers and this realistic cost per lead around.

With email opt-ins you might get far, far lower in terms of cost because it's a much simpler ask to get someone to sign up for a lead magnet as opposed to say actually yes I am interested in your accountancy services and would be interested in working with you. So with that said that's what this is here by the way this is a full inquiry via the website into this business's nationwide business obviously as you can probably imagine given that there's you know 16 000 leads a lot of small local service providers could not handle anything like that and but they were coming out at this sort of price. Now are these results typical?

Should you expect something like this? No. These results are absolutely fantastic.

This campaign was run over about a two-month period with these two campaigns so spending about £50,000 a month, 60, 65 000 something like that which is relatively high budget. The higher the budget you spend usually the higher the cost per result is going to be. If you were to spend tiny little budgets that number would probably be even smaller so that just helps reinforce the fact that this cost per lead here of £6.50 is actually fantastic.

By the way the average customer value for this business if they go on to that lead goes on to become a client is around about £3,000. So this campaign was I can't even work out the real ice on that it'd be monstrous absolutely monstrous. This is not typical.

This is particularly um well particularly great set of Facebook advertising campaigns. So there's sort of two things that you should I think think about when it comes to what your cost per lead is. A lot of people tend to think that Facebook advertising is a sort of I tell you what I tell you the people who talk about it it's when they talk about you being a media buyer or a Facebook ad buyer as if like it's just this thing you go and purchase and that I think sort of insinuates that the cost you're likely to receive through your Facebook ad campaigns is not tied to your skill as a Facebook advertiser which it absolutely is.

We could have run this exact same campaign with uh worse quality ad creative um with um poorer targeting options, worse setup and the cost per lead could be five, six, ten times as much as it was. So your skill as a Facebook advertiser absolutely impacts what your cost per lead is like to be. So how does that impact into what's a realistic cost per lead?

Well how skilled are you? How experienced are you as a Facebook advertiser? If you're just getting started don't expect to be able to produce incredible cost per lead let's say sub ten dollar cost per lead full of fully fledged inquiry um that's unlikely to happen it's possible but it's unlikely to happen just in the same way that you wouldn't pick up a tennis racket go to your local tennis club and start playing around and being like oh the pros make it look so easy you know they're they're hitting it in the lines every time with lots of speed they never make any mistakes well of course you're not going to be at that level you know you've just gotten started why would you expect to be at the same pro level so just in the same way that these are campaigns that were created by my Facebook ads agency we spend millions and millions of dollars and pounds and whatever on on Facebook ads all the time we've got hundreds of campaigns running at any one time we're professionals we know how to get the best shots possible so that's the first thing is put this through a how skilled are you yet filter and know that if you are inexperienced if you don't have the you know the knowledge of how to get the best results possible yet your cost per lead is going to be higher as a result with that sort of aside because I think that's really important what would be an industry average for something like getting someone to inquire into services to sign up for a free consultation a free call a free quote something like that now I would say that in general if you're able to get a cost per lead of under 30 dollars you're doing pretty well if you consistently get a cost per lead of under 20 dollars you're doing very well there's some caveats here I'm assuming you're advertising in an expensive um usually english-speaking nation or you know include perhaps countries like Japan and Western Europe and stuff and stuff like that um expensive countries to advertise in if you're assessing cost per lead in other countries that we sometimes work in like India or Philippines something like that well yes your cost per lead a good cost per lead is going to be significantly less because it costs a lot less to reach those people there I'm talking about countries like US, UK, Canada, Australia so that's that's where that benchmark comes in cost per lead of under 30 dollars is is decent cost per lead of under um 20 dollars is really very good I'm also assuming you've got a reasonable budget here if you're looking to spend two to three hundred dollars per month your cost per lead is likely to come in quite a bit lower than that and you might be looking at a campaign spending three hundred dollars a month going this is amazing I've got cost per lead of eleven I'm doing really well in comparison to the benchmarks I provided and then try and scale that campaign up to you know three thousand dollars a month and you see your cost per lead go up significantly so with those estimates I'm also assuming you're not just spending a couple hundred dollars a month or less I'm assuming you're spending thousands maybe even tens of thousands um because that has a significant impact as I said this cap these campaigns were operating at about 50 000 pounds per month um and we had a cost per lead of six pound 50 on average if we were to see uh if we were to be only spending 10 percent of that say five thousand pounds a month that cost per lead would come down and then 10 percent of that again 500 pound a month that cost per lead would come down again okay so that's um that's a very important thing to uh to take into account the other thing to think about is what your cost per lead is likely to do over time so there's also there's your skill as a Facebook advertiser right which I've already discussed you wouldn't start playing tennis and expect to be as good as the pros so don't do it with Facebook advertising um there's also the optimization that takes place in your Facebook ad account so if you first launch a campaign and given the benchmarks I've just given you see a cost per lead of 45 and you're really annoyed at that you think oh that's rubbish I really wanted to be in that under 30 range it may well be that your campaign will get there it just needs two weeks a month two months of not only your skill development I mean it could need six months you know your skill development is called but also Facebook's actual optimization process itself we've got lots of campaigns we've been running that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on them over you know let's say six to twelve month period and we almost sort of seem to reach an optimization level we've generated thousands of conversions and then we see like a real nice improvement in results at a certain stage after we got there okay and um and that's an important thing to think about don't be disheartened if your cost per lead is really high at the beginning I've just got a few notes here which why I keep glancing down just want to make sure I've got I'm gonna um mention everything I want to mention yeah the other thing I want to uh to talk about is everyone wants to know what a good cost per lead is but all that really matters is what that means for your business so when you're assessing any sort of marketing channel like a Facebook ad campaign something like that you need to assess it in terms of the profitability and the results it drives for your business there are many businesses that we've worked with where a sub 30 lead is absolutely impossible to achieve no chance no way not going to happen with business like that perhaps uh we're happy with a sub 80 lead or a sub 100 lead which sounds really expensive but if that business is super niche super luxury and they're only looking to work with a handful of clients every year that are worth an enormous sum to them classic example being like a luxury home builder you know we work with a luxury home builder they wanted to generate four more five clients per year each client would be worth in excess of a million dollars um each and often many times that because they're building super luxury homes from scratch um so if they you know for them a hundred dollar cost per lead is nothing absolutely nothing they're going after a very small percentage of very high net worth individuals that cost a lot to reach they only want four or five customers a year so you know if they have a couple leads a week they're very happy um so i hope that helps put it in perspective now there are other businesses of course that need to generate a cost per lead of twenty dollars or less in order to function and therefore your mass looks very different so always go through and calculate what your cost per lead needs to be for your business and work backwards so you go you can go okay each customer is worth two thousand dollars to my business i'm willing to pay 20% of the value of that customer to acquire a uh the customer so i'm willing to pay 400 to acquire a customer um i know that i convert one in five leads okay 400 um dollars to acquire a customer i need to generate five leads for 400 therefore each lead is going to cost you a maximum of 80 dollars is your acceptable cost so then when you run your facebook ad campaign and you hear me say a good cost per lead is 30 and a great cost per lead is under 20 and you're generating cost per lead of 50 but you can afford to pay 80 to acquire a lead don't worry about it okay i want to want to make that um make that that also very clear because it still is profitable for you now of course there are things you can do when i talk about these all the time to help improve performance so you can create better ad creative you can improve your targeting options you can develop your skills as a facebook advertiser but um but there's no reason to turn off the campaigns at that point if that makes sense okay so hopefully that's uh shed some light on that for you guys and hopefully that's uh that's pretty useful before you go a couple things i want to mention the first is our facebook advertising services so as i mentioned we are able to produce much better results than the vast majority of
