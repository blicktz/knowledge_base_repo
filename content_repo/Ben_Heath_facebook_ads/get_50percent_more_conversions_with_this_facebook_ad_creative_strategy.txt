Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to get up to 50% more conversions from your Facebook ads with a specific Facebook ad creative strategy. Now I get asked questions around Facebook ads and Facebook ad creative all the time where people ask me what sort of format should I use, how many ads should I run, how do I test new ads, what sort of creative should I use within those ads. So those are the sort of things I'm going to be explaining in this video.

Now the strategy that I'm about to explain, we've experimented with it, it was based on some data that I received from my Facebook rep which I thought was really interesting and we've run some experiments ourselves and we found that you can get up to a 50% increase in the number of conversions you're generating with this strategy which is very very simple to implement and not something that a huge amount of people know about or actually do. Now before I get into the strategy itself just want to quickly ask for you to smash that like button, that'd be very much appreciated to help me out and if you're new of course subscribe to my YouTube channel for more Facebook advertising related content. Okay now that you've done that let's get into the strategy, let's get into the steps.

So what Facebook have found recently, and I think this is very very interesting as I said this is based on data that my Facebook rep gave me, is that having multiple different ad formats running at once can really help improve the performance of your Facebook ad campaigns and in a recent study that Facebook conducted they said that on average if you have multiple ad formats running, so what I mean by ad format is video is one format, static image is another format, carousel is another format, slideshow would be another format etc etc. By having more than one type, more than one format of ad running at once, Facebook have noted in a recent study that that generates a 16% increase in conversions on average and 16% is not something to be sniffed at, you know it's that's going to really improve your cost per purchase, cost per lead, whatever it is that you're optimizing for and help improve the performance of your campaigns. Now we've actually experimented this ourselves and gone one stage further and instead of just having more than one type of ad format, so just having let's say image and video, we've gone for a range so we've had let's say video, image, carousel and slideshow all running at once in the Facebook ad campaign and we've seen up to a 50% increase in conversions using the same budget with that approach.

So I'm just going to quickly create an example campaign and demonstrate how we might set this up, how we might approach it and how this factors into testing and some of the other stuff that I've previously talked about when it comes to ads because some of this stuff is slightly different but I think very very interesting and potentially very valuable for you guys. So here I am inside an example Facebook ad account and as I said I'm just going to create a quick example campaign, so I'm just going to call this example campaign and obviously I'm going to change that to conversions, the data and what I'm talking about really applies to conversions campaigns, I'm assuming it would apply to other campaign types as well, traffic campaigns and things like that but I haven't tested that specifically. Let's call this example ad set and then let's go with example let's call this image ad right now we're going to save to draft.

Now one of the things I've talked about for quite a long time when it comes to ad creative and things like that is to test different ad formats. I've always been an advocate of that and what I've said is that for different industries different ad formats tend to deliver the best results so for some industries you're going to find videos deliver great results, for others slideshows or image or carousels are going to be the best option okay and what I've previously discussed quite a lot and this still holds true in a lot of cases is that when you first create a new campaign let's say like I've just done a good example campaign I set up my ad sets I've got lots of videos on how to set up um ad sets in fact I'll include a link in the video description below to another video all about Facebook ad campaign structure and how you can go through all that stuff but let's say I've got all my ad sets set up with the how I recommend and then I get to the ad set level and then within each ad set in fact let me minimize this so you can see the the overview of it within each ad set we're just in one of the ad sets here I'm going to start with three or four different ads okay and what I've recommended is when you first get started why not have a video ad an image ad a slideshow ad a carousel um and part of the reason why I accidentally clicked on that part of the reason why is because we want to test at the beginning which ad format produces the best results and then once we know aha video produces the best results therefore let's focus on video going forward and let's start testing other elements of the ad things like the headline the copy perhaps the video itself so I'd still recommend that you start the same way okay so let's say we've got example video ad and we're going to duplicate this and let's say we're going to add in we're going to start with three let's duplicate these three ads in here and then I'm going to minimize this down get that out the way that's not what we want for this video deselect these I'm just going to change the names of these so let's say this one is a video ad okay and let's say this one is a slideshow ad and then let's go with carousel the four ad formats that we use the vast majority of the time okay and what we'd be looking to do as I said is we've run this campaign let's say four different ads at the beginning run this ad set and we'd usually see within three or four days but we'd give it a week as I like to give things along a time period to test we would see ah okay video and carousel are working really well for this particular market slideshow and image aren't working as well let's say let's therefore pause slideshow and image and focus on video and carousel going forward so let's say after a week that's what the data is okay we've got video and carousel we would then grab this video ad we would duplicate it create some other video ads to test alongside it and maybe experiment with things like headline copy some of the other variables within your ad that's still a great approach there's nothing wrong with doing that at all and that's what i'd recommend however i want to add in some new ones and that's that unless certain ad formats are just way outperforming they're the ones so let's say for example if your video ad is producing a cost per purchase that is 40 percent lower than slideshow well yeah then yes go ahead and pause slideshow but let's say it's 10 15 maybe even 20 percent lower initially in the video ad than it is the slideshow ad in that case i would be tempted to leave that on particularly if it's sort of 10 15 something that i'd be tempted to leave that on because i think the added value that comes from running multiple different ad formats at once overcomes the fact that yes video is that is the better performer and over time that's going to be that's going to bear fruit as in what you're going to see is that the longer you run this ad set yes facebook may direct a lot of the budget to that video ad initially but over time you're going to see more and more of that budget also um put behind that slideshow ad and there's a few different reasons for that the first one is ad fatigue right so if you have multiple different ad formats running at once it's going to take much longer for ad fatigue to set in you're going to get much more runway with that particular offer because you know if you see a video ad on monday and an image ad on tuesday you're not seeing that image ad and going ah i've already seen that already and just ignoring it okay but if you see an image ad on monday tuesday wednesday thursday you're just going to get to that point where your prospects are just glancing at your ad going i've seen that ignoring it and scrolling past it and that's really what ad fatigue is it's people going i've seen that already don't need to pay any attention and moving on so it definitely helps with ad fatigue and gives your um campaign some more runtime now there are other ways you can overcome ad fatigue so for example if you just decided that video ad was the way you wanted to go you could just create new videos to overcome ad fatigue but there's another factor and i think this is becoming more and more clear with the digital marketing space with facebook advertising in particular and that's that different people react to different types of ad creative you've got your image people that are i'm probably an image person personally i do things very quickly i'm very busy got a business to run i'm glancing at things i want to see an image and i want to know exactly what that's about and make a snap decision over whether or not i'm going to buy that or not whether i'm going to acquire that company or not other people operate perhaps at a slower pace do things differently and they're video people so they want the extra information that a video is going to provide them they are going to go through the news feed quite slowly they're going to check out the video they're going to watch your 15 30 90 second video find out the information about your product or service whatever it is and then make their decision and i think you can say the same for carousels and slideshows so i think what you're able to do by having multiple ad formats running at once is tap into those different types of people think about this in the same way that you've probably heard about talked about before where some people learn really well when they listen to something so that's me i'm an audio learner and some people learn much better when they read something when they take notes and things like that and i think it's the same with different ad formats some people are more likely to take action based on the video based on a carousel based on an image etc just depending on their personality types so having the multiple ad formats running is beneficial because facebook's machine learning process is getting smarter and smarter and this is the conversation i had with my facebook rep where they were saying um they're starting to work out you know this person interacts with a lot of video content this person interacts with a lot of carousels therefore if we've got multiple options within an ad set we can put a carousel ad in front of this person and a video ad in front of this person so previously you may have only been able to advertise successfully to say 20 of your target audience because those are really ones that really respond well to images but actually if you had multiple ad formats running then you can get these slideshows and videos and things like that to also deliver to other segments of your target audience and keep that campaign going a lot longer and increase the number of conversions you're generating that's why facebook on average is saying so far that having multiple ad formats running increases your cost increases your number of conversions by 16 and i said we've tested this and we've actually been able to generate better results than that all the way up to about 50 increase in conversions particularly when you have multiple ad formats running so the takeaway from this video one of the takeaways from this video is if possible have multiple ad formats running at once okay and that needs to be caveated that needs to be nuanced there's and i think people in any form of life but definitely in digital marketing facebook advertising are too like but i've heard this is the way to do it okay but there are certain scenarios for um using this approach there are certain scenarios for using other approaches so as i said if let's say image ads is producing cost per conversion for 50 or 40 percent less than other ones then by all means go ahead and pause those other ad formats don't just leave it running because of what i'm saying here what you have to do in is take this information on board and run it through your own personal filter what i'm saying is that if slideshow ads produce a cost per purchase that's 15 uh more than image ads don't turn it off i would have previously you know a year ago i'd have recommended turning that off now i would say don't turn it off there's added advantage of leaving them running but if there's a big discrepancy still turn off the underperforming ad formats and then move on to testing other ads other elements of your ads because we do run campaigns often in industries where the only um ad format that delivers great results is video and that's still going to be the case these are particularly industries where it's a brand new product or a fairly complex service or something that needs a lot of explaining only work well with video we have likewise we have businesses that only work well with very simple image or perhaps carousel ads these are usually businesses that are selling things that are very very inexpensive they're offering a good discount they're very much competing on price and then you want to get the message across and explain what this is all about as absolutely as quickly as possible you don't want it to take time for people to be switched off by a video you don't need the extra information do you like this pair of whatever sunglasses novelty sunglasses they're you know twelve dollars you're going to buy right now go ahead and do it simple stuff like that okay so if that's been useful definitely test running multiple ad formats and a lot of people are guilty of just testing the one ad format test
