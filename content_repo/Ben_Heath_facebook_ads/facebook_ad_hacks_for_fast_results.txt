yeah i used to talk into a camera and sometimes a dog in the corner so it's a lot more people than i'm used to so if you have seen me before i do have legs in all my videos it's just uh just a torso um and yes i am shorter in real life than you might than you might uh expect i do think the schedulers did me a bit of a disservice by putting aaron on who's the basketball player six foot seven or whatever just before uh just for me right so facebook ad cheat code so you guys have been consuming loads of content loads of tons of great ideas i imagine some people's brains a little bit fried at the moment what i wanted to do in this was not make it really technical if i start talking about the conversions api or anything like that there's you know as i said brains are gonna are gonna fry i wanted to give you some simple things that you can actually implement relatively easily but can have a massive impact on the performance of your ad campaigns so yeah so facebook ad cheat codes what does that mean i kind of explained a little bit there but just to clarify a little bit of how i would define what a cheat code actually is so it's something that's easy to implement i think that a lot of people in this room probably aren't lazy enough which is different advice than what you'd get from most people i certainly started this way you think the answer to everything the solution to every problem is just maximum effort work as hard as you possibly can and i actually think that sets you up for well difficulties but also means you won't succeed as much as you'd like to because you're not trying to find the most efficient way you're not trying to find the things that you can change that have the most leverage so i do think it's actually really important to be like what's the easiest way we could get to where we want to go with this so easy to implement be the first thing second thing is it can realistically double or more your return on ad spend so for those you aren't familiar return on ad spend is well roes return on ad spend it's the facebook advertisers way of measuring return on investment but it's just specific to ads now when i say double or more your return on ad spend i'm talking about campaigns that aren't just a complete mess it's easy to double return ad spend on a campaign that's a complete mess it's really quite difficult you know it's a really high bar what i'm what i'm talking about here with the cheat code it's really difficult to double or more your return on ad spend if you've got campaigns that are set up well that are doing well imagine there's a bunch of people in this room that have got ad campaigns running that are generating leads generating sales how do we double the results from there that's really quite difficult to do but there are some simple things you can use that we do with our clients all the time okay one thing i want to quickly clarify i mentioned in turn facebook ads i'm sure most of you know but just in case there are some that aren't when i say facebook ads and talk about facebook and instagram ads i should really say meta ads but um you know old habits die hard and most people still search using facebook ads instead of meta ads which are on my youtube videos i've got facebook ads in the title and things like that so there's lots of things you can do right you can test targeting options you can split test placement setups you can tweak ad creatives all sorts of things very few things will actually double or more your results and because of the way ads work as you scale you start off at smaller budgets usually as you scale if you keep your campaign the same your row ass will decrease so a lot of people think if i can just get this campaign to work at a thousand pound a month 500 pound a month i can then spend a hundred times that and i'll have this massive business and it just won't happen you will see worse results you scale which means that in order to scale successfully you first have to significantly improve your results you need to be really profitable on your lower budget ad campaign results before you're able to scale so very few double results that's what we're going to talk about and my goal today is to give you just one or two facebook ad techniques i'm actually going to talk about five but some of them apply to different businesses some apply to different business types so um you can uh apply the right one i think that's always really important something i talk about a lot is you need to take the advice that applies to your specific circumstances super important facebook ads as with anything else and then hopefully someone in here will implement one of these and it will change their entire business because i think if there are people in this room running facebook ads and you can implement one of these things and it does double your return on ad spend that might change your entire business change your entire life and if it does please let me know i'm very findable online send me a dm somewhere okay who on earth is this guys this is the non-british bit where just to very quickly talk about myself which is always weird and a bit um uncomfortable and the reason why i'm doing this very quickly got this in here is just to say whenever you're taking anyone's advice i think it's really important that you know that they know what they're talking about so here's the the 10 second version that should give you confidence to let you know that i know what i'm talking about when it comes to giving you a bit of facebook ads advice um so specialist facebook ads agency now for almost eight years we've worked with a thousand probably more than two thousand clients across and we're broad we work with like all different niches so a lot of the content i create a lot of things i'm going to talk about today will apply if you're a service business or an e-commerce business or anything like that um and i've spent i've personally overseen ad campaigns that spent more than 50 million pounds um on facebook and instagram ads which is which is quite a bit cheat code number one what can double or more your return on ad spend with your facebook ads influencers but not in the way that most people think now most influencer marketing revolves around here's someone with a following can i pay you to promote my stuff and that's great nothing wrong with that they're going to promote it to their audience you might get some sales some leads from it but our 48 hours after the post um no one's going to see it again it's the nature of all these platforms things move in and out maybe if it's a long form youtube video that you get someone to do it's going to get some more traction because it might rank in youtube search and that's great but for the most part if it's an instagram post 48 hours after they posted it you're done maybe it's worth it maybe it wasn't one of the things that i really like doing that i don't see enough people do is hiring influencers to record your video ads for you so let's say you're a product-based business you probably know of some influencers in your space that would be um that would be the you know their audience is your target market and you can send them some of your products and you can say look here's some free products test them out if you like them please create a product review video you can do the same thing obviously with services just get them to use whatever it is that you do and get them to create your video ads for you now why would you want to do this what are the advantages of doing this way instead well they're much longer lasting um if you've run ads for any length of time you probably know that sometimes you get ads that just absolutely crush it and you can run those for six months a year you've not got that 48 hour window max on an organic instagram post or something like that not saying don't do that but just with this you might be able to leverage that piece of creative that that influencer has created for you um and use it for a very very long time high quality influencers most of them record video for a living so they're probably going to produce a video ad that looks really nice that makes a difference and it saves on ad creative cost one of the pushbacks i get when i say to people to do this is i say i can't afford to hire an influencer you can i'll explain why in a minute but just think about this if you're getting them to create your video content for you your video ads for you you don't then need to hire a videographer or whoever is going to be putting that creative together so something to factor in featuring an industry specific influencer is a very powerful scroll stopper so think about how people use facebook and instagram scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll something grabs their attention paid a bit of attention does it hold it long enough do i check it out no yes if not scroll scroll scroll if someone in that post there's a person in there that someone recognizes they're far more likely to pay attention and obviously if they're then talking about your product they're far more likely to find out about what it is that you offer product service whatever it is and that's a big deal so how would you go about actually doing this start with the little fish so i'm giving you an example from a client of ours um unfortunately i can't share names or specific ad creative or anything like that trust me if i could i would love to i'd have double the social media following if i could but you know i'm sure a lot of you in here work with clients and things need to be kept confidential okay but i can tell you like how it worked and the details and all that sort of stuff so this client sells newborn clothing and um we hired a influencer in the baby niche that talks about newborns and what you do and all that sort of stuff so very much very very relevant they had about 175 000 followers on instagram so we're not talking anything massive here i know to like a lot of people here that would seem like a really big following but there are lots of people that have followings in that sort of size and they're all very relevant to the products that this client sells that person is only known in that specific niche so like i you know it's been really nice being here last few days um quite a few people have come up and said hi watch your videos all that sort of stuff i'm only ever going to be recognized in a place like this i never have anyone come up to me in um in like regular life and that will be the same for this influencer this is not someone who's famous that costs tons of money to go and hire this is someone that has like a very specific following that you can go ahead and hire and i'll share what that looks like so contacted them explain more about that explain the whole setup how we're going to do things yada yada and sent them a handful of products said look these are free also if you like them a couple product review videos would be great got two out of this influencer cost was 800 this is a us-based client and a us-based influencer 800 that was it i think when i explained this to someone else they were asking me about how could you possibly hire someone with that sort of following for 800 to do this for you you think well it's really quick and easy for them to do it because they record video all the time very quick and easy for them to do it and if someone has 175 000 followers on something like instagram and they're in the sort of newborn baby space they're not making a ton of money out of that so 800 bunch of free product it's a good deal yeah there are other industries we'd have to pay a lot more because they're a lot more lucrative marketing being one of them um but i think i'd like that to sort of shatter a few limiting beliefs on we couldn't hire someone with a proper following because you probably can depending on what it is you're advertising in the result 263 improvement in return on ad spend that is absolutely massive that is completely business changing and because of that we scaled this client's ad campaign for fifteen thousand dollars a month to sixty five thousand dollars a month hopefully we will be able to go again and keep doing it this technique and some of the other ones i'm going to explain they are simple um but they're very effective there's no point over complicating things i said i think some of you in this room are probably not lazy enough i was that way and it meant that i earned next to nothing for the first seven years of having my own business okay how do you go about finding these influencers outreach this one was just a um direct message by instagram believe it or not because they're on instagram very easy um you probably already have an idea of whatever industry you're in of some people would be like oh they'd be good oh they'd be good they'd be good for this um and that was this client this client knew exactly a few people to contact contact a few this one said yeah sure sounds great um you could also you know you want to take this to another level influencer platforms things like influence city and things like that and then you can also get influencer agencies to do this for you um i think if the average advertiser took 10 of their ad budget so what they're actually spending on ads and put that into the creative whether it's an influencer or improving their creative they would definitely see more than that back because you only need a 10 improvement in the performance of your actual ads for that to be net positive and if you get a 263 improvement in ads like this one then you've made way more money um by just taking a little bit out and spending a little bit less on the ads themselves okay cheat code number two i saw a bunch of you run facebook ads who's generating leads as opposed to selling products and things like that okay good amount of you yeah yeah probably half um so this one's for you so facebook advertisers complain about lead quality all the time and clients if you run campaigns that generate leads will also complain about lead quality single best way to improve lead quality is with follow-up ridiculous persistence do it very quickly do it very often this is not super sexy this is not super interesting will this make you a lot more money yes aim for this that is my four-year-old sprig a spaniel who is possibly the most insane dog that has ever been created but if everyone who generated leads and was responsible for following up was as keen on lead follow-up as he is about chasing the ball no one would ever complain about leads so here's what typical lead follow-up looks like i'm sure some of you can relate to this right so you generate the lead it comes in day one meant to call them didn't get to it was busy i'll try tomorrow then tomorrow you call they didn't pick up so you left the voicemail next day emailed because i haven't got back to you from your voicemail messaged day after that haven't heard from them should probably call again day five oh they haven't got back to me they're not interested i'll give up that is very very typical and you are missing out here's my recommendation which i know will shock a bunch of you and seem quite painful follow up with your leads within five minutes of them being generated could completely change business if you're used to calling all your leads at the end of the day or the next morning and it needs to be a call by the way don't bother emailing if you're generating leads facebook instagram whether it's via instant forms on the platform or by your website need to ask for phone number and you have to call do it within five minutes that sounds crazy you will get in touch with probably three or four times as many people if you do it within five minutes and the conversation will go something like hi i'm calling you because you just signed up for this you registered interested in this can tell me a bit more about what it is you're after and they will go oh wow i just did that oh i wasn't expecting a call great yeah actually i need help with this whereas if you even leave it a day people go sorry who are you why are you uh what was this about i don't think i did fill out that form i imagine there's lots of people in the room have had that experience easy way to do this is you can integrate crm um with facebook if you're generating if you're using instant forms to generate your leads and those can notify you the minute a lead comes in so you one of your team members pick up the phone straight away i mean that sounds i know it sounds boring but that might triple the revenue generate because if you get in touch with three times as many leads you'll convert three times as many and you haven't spent any more on ads so what after you've called them within five minutes i try calling twice a day every day for seven days to initiate contact before giving up which sounds like a lot but again get someone to do it you almost certainly cover someone's salary by getting them to do this for you and really go for it really follow up okay cheat code number three exceptional offers back to one that can apply to everyone you've probably heard a lot of this stuff but i want to give a little wrinkle on it and give you an example an exceptional offer will make everything else much easier i'm always looking for things that will make everything else much easier is there one thing i can do that will just make everything else much easier just as a little side note from this that's what i did with my own personal brand would it be easier for me to build run a marketing agency if i bought a personal brand would it make everything easier client acquisition lead gen finding talent yes all of it exceptional offer will do that for your facebook and instagram ads here's an example this client um they do boilers so they supply the boiler and install it really boring business right average cost of the boil is about three grand apparently their offer this is their exceptional offer interest-free finance deals six pound a week they're the boilers they put in weren't actually three grand they were like cheaper ones that were like 1200 quid but um that's how six grand six pound a week can work i don't know paid off over a five-year term or something like that but that's a really good starting point it gets better and they guarantee 72 hour delivery and installation so imagine you're someone i mean you know most people in this room we live in the uk weather's terrible winters are cold apparently september's weather's terrible as well and what happens with your boiler breaks anyone just show hands anyone had a boiler break go down have issues yeah like loads of people right absolute nightmare you see an ad pop up you don't have the money for it i've got i've got to i've got to pay for another boiler how do i put on a credit card that's already maxed out ad pops up six pound a week and we'll do it guarantee it within 72 hours that is that is in a boring industry where people think you can't use exceptional offers that is an exceptional offer results we generated 15 000 plus leads uh per month that's actually month one cost per leader six pound fifty which is incredibly cheap conversion rate one in eight that's a row as of 57.7 which if you're familiar with row as is absolutely insane by the way just as a side note for all the marketing agency people in the room those results were too good we lost the client after like two months because they were full for the year and then it ended up getting sold so if you if you're generating leads for businesses you can uh do two good job and then um they run out of capacity and and you lose them because they just can't advertise anymore but there are worse things to have i can talk about it on stage things like that as i said six pound a week 72 hour guarantee um delivery installation is a fantastic offer someone is in that situation which thousands people will be right now in the uk that is great um for more info on offers recommendation alex from moses 100 million dollars offers that will cover a lot more about more offer stuff than i can i wanted to give you an example and tell you that it absolutely applies to facebook and instagram ads right cheat code number four industry selection so how many people in this room could have some sort of like you could decide from now future what industry you're going to go into how many are like now i'm already out i've got to advertise the thing i advertise i work for company business setup and how many people are in a situation where they could choose their industry going forward if you're just hands on how many could choose yeah okay quite a few people this one's for you high average customer value really really really important again not very sexy but makes enormous difference and also look for low competition levels lots of businesses that intersect those two points if you choose that you might see everything will be much much easier as you go along okay hi average customer value so the very first business i ran ads for it was google ads initially and then it became facebook ads was my mom's interior design business i dropped out of uni to have start my own business it did not work at the slightest i needed some money mums have come work for me um which is very helpful but when you run ad campaigns for a business like an interior design business it's really easy industries interior design average customer value is about 85 000 pounds you don't hire interior designer unless you're having a big extension or doing a lot of work or moving house and you need a load of furniture something like that average cost per lead was 75 pounds that's really high there'd be loads of people in this room generating leads for way less than that thinking 75 pounds that we could get we're going for premium they cost more could have paid a lot more though and that's one of the best things if you can choose the industry we work with a lot of e-commerce businesses and other businesses where if they see a 30 increase in their cost of acquisition their cost to generate a lead their cost to generate a sale that's just a killer for their marketing return on ad spend they just can't do it they're losing money with a business like that we could paid five times as much for a lead it would still be nicely profitable so really high average customer values make everything really easy if you generate leads for a business that sells a service maybe a product that costs 200 grand 300 grand and there's more of those than you think there are um it's really difficult not to make money you could pay so much per lead you could have a terrible conversion rate and you're still going to work low competition levels so we're in brighton right now how many funeral service businesses are running facebook ads in brighton right now do you think definitely less than 10 right i've had a few nuns i i won't be surprised probably less than five they've just gone on the safe side um how good let's say there are a couple running ads how good do you think their ads are they're gonna be rubbish like they really are like maybe there's someone who's you know maybe watched a few youtube videos and know what they're doing so how hard would it be to create the best funeral services facebook ads in brighton could you just win that little market yeah honestly you could watch a couple of youtube videos on how to run facebook ads and you would be able to then create the best facebook ads for the funeral service industry in brighton brighton i just quickly googled it before i came in here it's about 280 000 people let's assume you know one in 80 people dies a year given you know roughly how long people live so that's three thousand three and a half thousand people dying every year in brighton all need funeral services how much is a funeral you quickly get to let's say it's you know 20 grand or something that's 60 million pound market just here in brighton in funeral services so pick markets you can easily win there's loads of money in it and then expand out the reason why a lot of the content i create a lot of things i talk about are very facebook ad specific is because i believe that's a place where i can create the best stuff i do not yet believe i can create the best stuff in broader markets maybe one day i'll try and compete with some of the big boys but i don't think i can do it yet i'd much rather start where i can win and you should absolutely do that with your facebook ads where can i be the best but all the rewards go to the best like all the rewards go to the best there's lots and lots of facebook ad markets where there might be 400 businesses running very very similar ads and 90 of the sales will go to five of them 10 of them okay next one specific positioning so you've all heard niche down something i'd recommend but how do you go about doing that with facebook ads nowadays so we used to do that with targeting anyone here run facebook ads more than eight years ago just a couple well back then it was really easy really specifically tight you could advertise to 20 people you get really specific targeting and advertise to 20 people and that was really powerful can't do that anymore um people don't like the idea that you can do that sort of stuff for privacy reasons so that has all been done away with you can target small audiences nearly always you're going to see worse results than if you target at least to some extent larger audiences but you can achieve specificity through your messaging instead you can target broad but include specific words phrases in your copy in your ad creative that lets people know this ad is for them this offer is for them don't think that it's the targeting at the ad set level that does all the heavy lifting on who you reach more and more and more we're seeing that in the ad from a copy and creative standpoint so let me give you an example let's say we've got a fitness apparel brand you know clothing create separate ads for each use case now you might be thinking well of course i'm going to create separate ads for each use case right i've got football boots and i've got running shorts and i've got no no much more specific than that so let's say you have running shorts let's say you have one pair of running shorts instead of just creating an ad advertising your running shorts we would look to create one ad that focuses on long distance running one ad that focuses on running in the winter one ad that focuses on cross-country running like the differences between things like long distance and cross-country are very small in terms of what the product needs i said this could be the same product could be different products it could be the same product but what that will mean in terms of who your ad get puts in front of initially which dictates who responds to it which then obviously feeds into the algorithm and that affects who it gets put in front of is massive with that approach it might mean you need to do a bit more work 40 ads instead of four is what i've put on here that might be realistic it's not too much extra effort because if you've got your running ad you know with running in a copy you're just duplicating it changing the copy in the next one duplicating it change copy next one you can do the same in a creative it's not that complicated but i really believe that'll be worth it i think that's a little bit of extra effort that can double or more your roas i've seen it happen it's not super exciting of a technique but it works right why is this important everyone thinks they're special and have unique requirements they don't but we can tap into that as advertisers so if we think about the the cross-country the running shorts i just gave if we think about a cross-country runner like i identify as a cross i don't but someone could i identify as a cross-country runner that is much more likely to grab their attention think about how you interact when you've got your you're on facebook you're on instagram scrolling through a lot of people will see very similar ads for very similar things one after the other i bet tons of people in this room go on facebook at facebook or instagram right now and you'll scroll and you will see tons of ads from marketers selling you know courses and all sorts right they'll be very very similar other people are seeing the same things so when they're seeing all these ads for like running equipment because they've been categorized in that interest and they're seeing seeing running shorts running shorts running cross-country running shorts oh that's for me that's just what i'm a cross-country runner that's that's just what i need that's what i want to go ahead and grab it could be the exact same pair of shorts but that one will get um much more traction people are far more like to buy if they believe your product or service is perfect for their needs doesn't necessarily have to be the case i mean obviously it's going to work right pair of shorts are running pair of shorts more or less but you can tailor it they can make a big big difference sounds trivial but it is not okay that was uh the main meat of the content as i said there's a lot of the things that really improve your results aren't the super exciting new techniques they aren't the the fancy added bits it's doing a lot of the basics really well like really well taking a little aside and um these are the things that we look to implement with our clients that we hope get fantastic results first of all please thank you
