Hi guys, it's Ben Heath and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook ads for e-commerce and specifically I'm going to give you four keys to success. Now these four keys to success are not things that are talked about a lot elsewhere, it's not something that a lot of Facebook advertisers talk about but they make a really really big difference. If you're running Facebook ad campaigns for an e-commerce business whether it's your own or a client or something like that I think you're going to find this tremendously valuable they're all fairly easy to implement and yeah I think it's going to provide a lot of value.

So before I get into those four keys to success I just want to very quickly ask you to smash a like on this video, click that like button, that would help me out and be much appreciated and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay so I'm in an example Facebook ad account here, it's going to help me demonstrate some of these keys to success that I want to share and the first one is really sort of like a broad overview of your attitude towards Facebook advertising. What do you expect from a Facebook ad campaign?

What do you hope to get from a Facebook ad campaign? Now I've spoken to a lot of Facebook advertisers, a lot of people just getting into Facebook advertising and they will often say things like look I'm not willing to pay more than 10% of the value of a customer in advertising costs. So for example let's say you're an e-commerce business, you're selling a range of products, your average order value is $50.

In that scenario you'd be willing to pay a maximum of $5 to acquire a new customer. Now wouldn't that be fantastic? Who wouldn't love to 10x, deliver a 10x ROAS whenever they run Facebook ad campaigns?

Isn't that awesome? And it does happen but it's very rare, it is not the norm. And I think if you go in with that attitude you are not doing yourself any favors over the long run.

It's very very difficult to consistently deliver a cost per purchase of $5. It is possible but very very difficult and very rare, particularly at scale and particularly over the long run. So what should you do instead?

I am a big big fan and I think this is something that all e-commerce Facebook advertisers try and keep in mind that your initial target should be to break even on initial customer acquisition. So what does that mean? I'm not talking about if your average order value is $50 you spend $50 per new customer.

I'm talking about spending at your average order value being $50 you still have to factor in your cost of goods, whatever you're paying the the manufacturer, supplier, perhaps some delivery costs and things like that. But let's assume you've got like a 50% margin. So you're acquiring new customers $50 each, 50% of that is yours to keep which is $25.

Therefore your target cost per purchase should be $25 and that means that you're basically acquiring new customers for free. You aren't making any money on them but you aren't losing any money on them. Now that might sound like what's the point?

What's the point in running Facebook ad campaigns if I'm not making any money on customers? And I can understand that attitude but it's incorrect. And particularly over the long run this has been shown to be very very incorrect and very detrimental.

There is a tremendous amount of value in acquiring new customers. Firstly the vast majority of e-commerce businesses either have products that people will repeat purchase. So if you acquire a whole load of you know if your business ticks that box oh yes our products are consumable for example and there's repeat purchase.

If I could give you 10,000 new customers for free right now that would be an amazing thing for your business. The amount of those people that are going to reorder and reorder and reorder is tremendous. Okay and even if you don't have a consumable product and people buy again I'm sure you have other complementary products that perhaps someone bought something today but they could buy other products of yours next week, next month, next year.

Nearly all e-commerce businesses are going to have something along those lines is a part of their business. Now if you can acquire a ton of customers as I gave the 10,000 example that is so so beneficial over the long run. Often when you're running a Facebook advertising campaign you have to choose between short-term profitability and scale.

So we all know or you know if you're new to Facebook advertising you might not but it's very well understood that if you run a campaign at $100 a day your cost per purchase is almost certainly going to be less than if you're running a campaign at $2,000 a day. As you scale you have to reach larger and larger audiences, people become less and less specific and less targeted and your cost per purchase increases. But so you can make the choice we can keep our Facebook ad campaign operating at a really low level and generate a profit on each new customer or we can go to the point where we break even, look to acquire an enormous customer base and then in six months, definitely 12 months time, when you've been running a Facebook ad campaign at scale acquiring tons of customers you're then in an amazing situation where you can generate so many sales from your email list emailing your existing customers, from retargeting existing customers as opposed to constantly going out to cold audiences on Facebook.

I've seen businesses do this and then they launch a new product and it sells out immediately or within the first 24 hours or something because they've built that customer base and I think that that's the attitude I want to get across. Everyone in the sort of tech world and a lot of these very fast growing fast-paced companies that get access to external funding whether they're venture backed or have other sorts of investors not only operate with this in mind they go one step further. So we've worked with a number of companies that have external investment that are actually willing to make quite a big loss on the initial customer that they generate in exchange for generating a boatload of customers really really quickly.

They're basically willing to make a loss. Now obviously when you have external finance it's easy to do that so I'm not necessarily recommending you do that yourself but everyone can operate at break even you know you know that's not there's no money out of pocket for you you know at least once averaged out of course once you've paid your Facebook ads and things like that there's no money out of pocket for you that is sustainable and you can keep going with that. The venture backed companies often have a huge advantage because they can make that big loss but they generate an enormous customer base they in effect generate a ton of brand awareness whilst running their more direct to offer campaigns they know that people are going to buy their products again repeat custom they know they're going to recommend it to friends and spread it via word of mouth and so whilst I appreciate that's not open to to everyone and I've never got any external investment in in in my business and had to grow organically break even is the point at which you can do that you can operate at break even and the difference between needing to double your money on a Facebook ad campaign as an e-commerce business let's say in the first year and being willing to just break even might be the difference between you acquiring a thousand customers in your first year and ten thousand customers in your first year or you know your metrics may vary it might be 10x that might be less than that depends on the price of your products all that sort of stuff your budgets and things like that but that is such an important thing to to get across and I'm sort of hammering this home but have that attitude over the long run you will win your customer is thinking I need to make a profit I need to make a profit in the short run and you're not you're happy to break even in a year two years time you will have 20 40 50 times as many customers and you'll win simple as that okay so that's the first one right I'm going to rattle through these a little faster because I uh delayed on that one a little bit so it's somewhat similar to the breaking even um well it's a piece of it the point at which you can break even or even do better on that on a Facebook ad campaign when it comes to e-commerce is obviously to do with your Facebook advertising so that's one to be the big component pieces right who you're targeting what's your ad creative look like but your average order value is the other massively important part there's a lot of Facebook advertisers that have a cost per purchase of say 20 and they're like how do I get that down to 15 I just need to get that down to 15 and they're trying all these things testing stuff creating your ad creative recording videos etc etc when actually it might be a lot lot easier for them to instead of decreasing their cost per purchase by five dollars increase their average order value by five dollars or ten dollars or whatever um which will effectively do the same thing to how the finances look on your Facebook ad campaign and this is so underutilized amongst Facebook advertisers amongst people advertising e-commerce products is using one click upsells in order to increase your average order value it is just such a no-brainer I see it so rarely and it should be used just all the time now I'm not talking about sort of more traditional upsells or old school upsells where you know perhaps you when someone's going through the checkout process you then say oh would you like to add this to your order otherwise known as an order bump I'm not talking about someone purchased something and then you're emailing them the next few days trying to get them to purchase something else you can do those things as well you can have an order bump you can have an email or to respond to sequence that's trying to upsell your your customers but I'm talking about one click upsells so let's say if someone goes through to your website they purchase a pair of shoes right um the thank you page the next page those people are taken to after they purchase entered in their payment details they've purchased boom they're then presented with a page that you've probably seen these sort of things and they're often only used by expert marketers but they should be used by far um more people as said e-commerce providers things like that um whereby the page is like thank you for your purchase oh by the way would you like to add this to your order um it's fantastic here's a big discount because you just became a customer of ours yada yada yada they and then they click one click they don't need to enter in their details again they click it gets added to their cart they get charged and you massively increase your average order value and this should not be underestimated I've worked with lots of businesses where their initial um offering the initial product that's purchased is say 30 and they can double their average customer value all the way up to 60 with three or four upsells you don't need to have one three or four upsells that is such a huge um component of improving your results as a facebook advertiser for an e-commerce business being able to scale you know if you take your average order value from 30 to 60 that might mean you can take your acceptable cost per purchase from 15 to 30 and if you can pay 30 to acquire a customer as opposed to 15 to acquire a customer you might be able to have a 10 20x campaign and as a sit however as i've already mentioned acquiring that many customers just does amazing things for you um for your business over the long run so that's really important so one click upsels how do you go about doing it right so i've got a couple of examples up here sam car offer one click upsell is very very easy to use click funnels offer one click ups as both pieces of software that i've used in the past i just wanted to to bring those up quickly if using something like shopify or any of these other um e-commerce platforms there are tons of like plugins and external software that you can just feed in just search for things like shopify one click upsell and you should be able to implement that fairly easily tech technically it's not that difficult and it's so worth the time to go ahead and work that out so that's key to success number two is increase average order value as much as possible with one click upsellers you do not hear people talking about that anywhere near enough it's really really important okay now i want to jump to the uh the ad level show you a couple of things let's bring up an example ad and just this is just an example ad campaign i created before by the way guys so you don't need to to worry about this at all so where are we um oh that's selected on use existing post we don't want that i don't know why it is it's going to create ad okay so when you're creating a facebook ad one of the first things you're going to do is select the ad format now a lot of people just think video performs best and that's not actually true what i would say and this is particularly the case with e-commerce is that the ad format should reflect the price point of your product product in that more expensive products need more complex ads simpler products need simpler ads so if you're selling something for just 15 20 that's an impulse purchase maybe people can buy that without really thinking about it too much you want a simple ad format something like a single image or even a carousel something where they can glance at it they get the idea i'm interested i'm not i go and buy i don't etc etc if you're offering something more expensive you know something that's 150 or perhaps something that people aren't familiar with they don't know how it works that's when i want more complex ad format so that's when i want to use things like videos slideshow particularly explainer videos demonstration videos for e-commerce works really really well and you may also want to use longer copy in your ad so when you're writing in your in your text section i've selected carousel this is a little bit different if i go back to single image a format you guys will more um readily appreciate there we go primary text when you're entering your primary text information again cheaper less expensive products one or two maybe three lines just to get across the main benefits emphasize the sale or something like that get to purchase more complex things that are going to take more thought more reasoning more convincing to purchase add in or text so complexity add with um match the price point and i think that should save a lot of you guys that are creating very complex videos and things a lot of time if you're selling inexpensive e-commerce products stick to images and more simple ad formats that's number three fairly simple and then number four which is probably the biggest one if you've stuck around this long well done because it's probably the biggest most important key to success when it comes to facebook ads for e-commerce and that is that you want to be constantly running a special offer but a limited time special offer this is so so important you can half your cost per purchase by doing this alone so how do you do that how do you constantly run a special offer but have it limited time only what we love to do is we will let's say take uh we might set up offers on a monthly basis so we might say for the month of september we are offering 30 off this product range or this particular product so the special offer the discount helps grab people's attention and makes it seem like a better deal which it is but the time frame on it you have to do this by the end of the month that makes such a big difference because there's so much to do with facebook advertising when people are on their phone waiting in you know in a in a line somewhere they're in their car you know waiting to pick someone up they're you know maybe sat in the toilet they're just grabbing it at any time and just having a quick look right a lot of times people won't purchase something not because they're not interested but it's just not a great time they haven't got their wallet to hand it's a bit difficult if you have a limited time offer it makes people buy there and then oh i don't want to miss out on that i don't want to pay 30 more if i wait another week they go ahead and buy so you have something like 30 off for the september only for this product range then in october or you could do it even more frequently than this maybe every week maybe every two weeks something like that you change up the offer so instead of 30 off that particular product or product range you do buy two get one free um on a different product range or a different product okay so not only are you changing the products that are being discounted but you're also changing the structure of the offer you know got 30 off in one case buy two get one free it helps keep it fresh when people are seeing ads over and over again and stop just going oh they're always running a 25 discount they're always running a 40 discount something like that and you could even have another offer in the next month or the next couple of weeks where it's like if you buy this product we'll throw in this other product completely free something along those lines so those are three different types of offers and then if you combine those with doing that on different products or product ranges within your store um you can have a whole year of offers there really easily okay and that's how you're constantly running special offers discounted offers on a limited time basis a lot of people constantly run special offers but they just leave them going the limited time is everything and what you'll often see when you do that let's say it's the end of september the end of the month is your sales will shoot up right at the end of the month your results will be fantastic and because of course people don't want to miss out they want to take action and everyone loves to procrastinate a special offer that has a limited time removes the ability for people to be able to procrastinate easily so um so yeah so hopefully that's been useful before you go a couple of free
