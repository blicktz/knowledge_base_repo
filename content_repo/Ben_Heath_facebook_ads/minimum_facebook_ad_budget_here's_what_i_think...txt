Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about your minimum Facebook ad budget. What's an acceptable and appropriate minimum Facebook ad budget? Something I get asked about all the time, particularly with new Facebook advertisers.

I'm going to cover some things around what I would recommend and also how you should think about a starting Facebook ad budget and how that should change as time goes on. Before I get into that, I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button, please click that thumbs up button and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already. So I'm in an example Facebook ad account right now and I'm at the campaign level in an example campaign.

If you follow my stuff you know I'm a big fan of campaign budget optimisation so I'm usually setting budgets at the campaign level which is what you can see right here. If you're not familiar with campaign budget optimisation I'll include a link in the video description below to another video that talks all about that and how to use it and all that sort of stuff. Okay first question to sort of address is is it okay to start with a really small budget.

Now I've put in here five pounds a day you know it could be five dollars a day something like that could you start with that sort of budget 150 dollars a month and the answer is yes you can start with a very small budget the most important step to getting good at anything Facebook advertising like anything else is to get started to get your feet wet to give it a go to make mistakes to learn all that sort of stuff right so absolutely you can start with a small budget but don't think that a budget of five pounds five dollars a day something like that is going to do incredible things for your business. A five pound a day five dollar a day budget is for testing it's for experimentation it's very very unlikely to be a needle mover for your business and that's because you just have to think about how any sort of marketing platform any advertising platform like Facebook works right a 10x return on ad spend is really good for most businesses now some businesses particularly service ones with high average customer values achieve a much higher um ROAS than that return on ad spend but a 10x ROAS 10x return on ad spend is is pretty good right and for a lot of e-commerce businesses it would be very good if you're spending five dollars a day and you're getting a 10x return on your ad spend you're generating 50 dollars a day in revenue for the vast majority of businesses businesses even if it's just you it's probably not hugely exciting fifteen hundred dollars a month in revenue you've got costs coming out of that i can't imagine you'd be very excited about that i certainly wouldn't be so you need to keep that in mind now if you run start running a campaign on five dollars a day and you are seeing a 10x return on ad spend you should be very excited not because of the money that that's generating but the fact that you can very quickly and easily scale that budget and if you're already generating a 10x ROAS at a five dollar a day budget you should be able to generate really very good results with um with with higher budgets that actually do mean something instead of generating fifteen hundred dollars a month in revenue from it you could be generating ten hundred higher than that times that um these things are are certainly possible so it when you get started you need to think about this it's the most important thing is not necessarily the number it's the mindset right so i've given a five dollar a day as a minimum that i think is appropriate to start with um to sort of the average person who's perhaps got a one person company um doesn't have much money to play with potentially certainly where i started and i don't think that would be a terrible place to start bearing in mind that that's for testing you need to work it out that it works at that level before you then scale etc etc as i mentioned but of course your starting budget or your minimum budget should depend somewhat on your circumstances so what i would always recommend is that you start with something small start with something that you can afford to lose no one should ever go broke because of a facebook ad campaign you should not be spending your rent money your whatever on a facebook ad campaign don't do it um but you equally need to spend something that actually means something to you so i've mentioned five dollars a day minimum there are many people in many businesses where five dollars a day um 150 a month means absolutely nothing there's no point in them doing it they're not even going to bother checking it it's just not interesting you know a business of any sort of size this is not going to mean anything to them right if you've got a seven figure business even spending you know fifty dollars a day is almost certainly going to mean absolutely nothing so you need to start with a number that you're actually going to care about that you're going to check you know if i ran a five dollar a day budget i just i'm not interested it's not even going to bother me in the slightest okay i have to spend something that means something because if it means something then i'm going to go and put time and effort into improving the campaign into working it out into doing all these various things so for a minimum budget you're looking at sweet spot where i can afford to lose it it's not going to hurt me if i lose it i'll be absolutely fine but i'd rather not lose it and i do care about what i've invested okay so perhaps for a small business that might be you know three hundred dollars a month you might be like i can afford to spend three hundred dollars a month and let's say you set aside six months worth of budget to test this and make it work so you've got eighteen hundred dollars as your budget over a six month period and going i don't want to lose eighteen hundred dollars no one wants to lose eighteen hundred dollars but if i do lose eighteen hundred dollars over six months it's not the end of the world um and that might be an appropriate starting budget three hundred dollars a month would obviously be double five dollars a day it'd be ten dollars a day um but that might be an appropriate starting budget for someone to go with that as i mentioned meets that sweet spot and of course no one wants to lose the money when i'm saying it needs to be something you can afford to lose you're thinking but am i going to lose the money you may do you may not set up campaigns right you may not land with your target audience there's all sorts of reasons why you may lose that and it's important to go into a budget decision with that in mind going i could lose this now a lot of people balk if i say look you might lose the eighteen hundred dollars over the next six months testing like you'll think oh okay well i won't do it then go yeah but you've got to think about the risk versus reward here um is it worth the risk of losing eighteen hundred dollars to test an ad platform that could be a consistent generator of clients and customers for your business in the vast vast majority of cases the answer that question is going to be yes it's absolutely worth the risk it's still a risk you could lose it just like any marketing venture could always lose the money um but is it worth it i would say so for the vast majority provided you can afford to do that i would say for the vast majority business absolutely worth the risk because if you come out of that six months with an advertising platform a marketing channel that can consistently and reliably generate customers for you it's going to be worth many many many many times what you've uh what you've invested in what you risked there so certainly worth doing but that's uh that's what i wanted to discuss so just a quick recap yes you can start with that there's five dollars a day that is okay just be aware that's for testing that's not going to do anything for your business long term you will need to scale and then try and find a minimum budget that's appropriate for your circumstances it should be something you can afford to lose it should also be something that actually means something that you're not just don't care about try and find that sweet spot for your business you know you could have a really large business where maybe that's maybe that's a thousand dollars a day you know if you've got a seven figure eight figure business you could be thinking well you know seven it would be more like eight figures uh plus eight figure plus business thinking yeah thousand dollars a day anything less than that i just don't care about it could be as little as five dollars a day it depends on your circumstances hopefully that's been useful before you go a couple of free things i want to quickly mention the first is a free webinar i've created called three killer facebook advertising strategies to double or more your revenue and in this webinar i break down the three sales funnels that we use for our clients all the time that deliver fantastic results very much tried and tested and i show you them in detail and i show you which one you want to use depending on your products and services very very important point that a lot of facebook advertising experts don't talk about enough is that you can't have a one-size-fits-all funnel you get a different approach for ecom than for service businesses you need a different approach for a ten dollar
