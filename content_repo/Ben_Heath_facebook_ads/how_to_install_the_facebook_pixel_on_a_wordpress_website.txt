So what is the Facebook Pixel? How does it work? And more importantly, how can you use it to generate low-cost leads and sales for your business?

Well, that's exactly what I'm going to cover in this video. My name's Ben Heath and I'm the founder and CEO of Lead Guru, which is a London-based digital marketing agency. Most Facebook advertisers have heard of the Facebook Pixel, but a lot of them don't use it because it sounds complicated and technical.

But it's not very difficult to use and the upside of using it is enormous. Basically, the Facebook Pixel is a small piece of code that you can install on your website and it's primarily used for two things. Number one, tracking the actions that people take on your website.

And number two, building custom audiences. Let's start with number one. By installing the Facebook Pixel on your website, you can track the actions that people take on your website, which is crucial if you're running Facebook ad campaigns.

Because with the Facebook Pixel, you can accurately track how many leads and sales your campaigns are generating and how much it's costing you per lead or sale. I see a lot of Facebook ad accounts that don't have the Facebook Pixel set up and that's crazy. You need to be able to track the results that you're getting and know whether or not your campaigns are actually profitable.

And number two, build custom audiences. When you have the Facebook Pixel installed on your website, anyone who visits your website can be added to a custom audience, whether they come from a Facebook ad campaign or not. And that means you can specifically advertise to the people that have visited your website, which is incredibly powerful because the people that have already visited your website are highly likely to be interested in the products and services that you offer.

So how do you install the Facebook Pixel on your website? To install the Facebook Pixel, the first thing you need to do is go to the pixels tab in your Facebook ad account. Then you need to click the setup button and that will bring up a window that looks like this.

Here you have a couple of options. If you are using one of the platforms listed in the first option, then you can simply select this option and follow the installation instructions. Otherwise, you will either need to install it yourself or hire a developer to install it for you.

If you don't use one of the platforms listed in option one, you most likely have a WordPress website. So I'm going to show you how to install the Facebook Pixel on a WordPress website. But remember, you always have the option of hiring a developer to install this for you.

You can find a developer to do this for you on upwork.com or fiverr.com and it won't cost a lot at all. So to install the Facebook Pixel on a WordPress website yourself, you don't actually need to select the second option. You just need to make a note of your Facebook Pixel ID, which you can find by selecting option three.

Copy your Pixel ID and then head over to your WordPress website and go into plugins. The easiest way to install the Facebook Pixel on WordPress is to use a plugin. There are a number of plugin options, but my favorite is Pixelcat.

Install that plugin and then activate it. And that will bring up a page that looks like this. Then you can simply paste your Facebook Pixel ID into the text field, click save, and that's it.

The Facebook Pixel Pixel is now installed on your website and you can use it to create incredibly effective custom audiences and retarget the people that have visited your website. I'll talk to you soon. Bye bye.
