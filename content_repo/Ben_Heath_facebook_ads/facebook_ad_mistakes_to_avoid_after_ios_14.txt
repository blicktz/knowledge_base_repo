Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook ad mistakes that you really want to avoid in 2021. The game has changed somewhat after iOS 14 so these mistakes are sort of specifically updated for post iOS 14 Facebook ad environment which we're obviously in right now. So if you've seen previous mistakes videos or think you're avoiding the issues you may want to go through this video and make sure that you're not making any big mistakes that could be really having a negative impact on your results.

Before I get into them just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button click that thumbs up button that'd be much appreciated and help me out and of course subscribe to my channel if you're new and haven't done so already. Okay so I've got a little list of these alongside me I think I've got eight mistakes that I want to go through. A lot of them are very easy to avoid a lot of them can make a big big difference.

So the first one is that if you have not verified your domain and configured your web events you absolutely want to do so. So that's why the screen in front of you right now started in events manager within an ad account. This is just an example ad account that's hooked up to a sort of a test website that we have and you actually want to come in here you want to verify your domain and then under aggregated event measurement you want to make sure that you've got your web events configured your prioritization web events configured.

I'm not going to show you how to do that in this video I've got other content about that and if you want full detail and exactly how to cover all the iOS 14 stuff you should check out my Facebook ads inside this course I'll make sure I include a link to the link to that course in the video description below because I've got exactly how to do all this sort of stuff but mistake number one is not having your domain verified and not having your web events configured in aggregated event measurement. Very very important. Okay mistake number two and this is particularly this is always well not always but this has been true for a while now and is particularly true right now is two small target audiences.

So you can see for example I've got an ad set set up here an example ad set to demonstrate and it's targeting the UK and immediately the potential reaches 50 million so how small would you want to make that? Well I absolutely do not want to be advertising to anything less than 250 000 people ideally nothing less than half a million people in a country like the UK. Now if you're advertising locally that may not be possible you're sort of exempt from this mistake but if you have the option but you're just choosing to target small specific audiences particularly post iOS 14 that is not a good idea and you absolutely want to be targeting larger audiences if you've got an audience of two million three many people that's absolutely fine better to be too big than too small so that's mistake number two.

Mistake number three is stop using well the mistake is to use complicated sales funnels my recommendation would be to stop doing that. When Facebook advertising first came onto the scene there was all sorts of really complex stuff that people set up often just to sound smart to be perfectly honest where you'd have your target audience and you give them one thing to do and like they'd opt in and then they'd get a specific piece of content and then they'd get a webinar and then they'd get a it's like a eight nine ten step sales funnel where they have to do a then b then c then d in order to move on okay that is not what you want to do and I for a lot of businesses like this sort of setup one conversion campaign now I teach other strategies and I've got a whole webinar around different types strategies that you want to use for different business models and I do recommend using content and email opt-ins and things like that as part of sales funnels they're set up completely differently to what I just described in there much more interesting so if you're interested in that I recommend you again there's a link in the description to a free webinar I've created called three killer Facebook ad strategies double or more your revenue strongly recommend you check that out for strategies that we do use but a lot of the time we're going to use a direct offer setup which is one conversion campaign okay complicated sales funnels have to go because they haven't been great for a while but particularly post iOS 14 where we don't have as much visibility over the actions people take if you're needing someone to take action a before they get advertised to take action b before they get advertised to take action c and so on you've got so much drop off before you get anywhere near actually selling them anything you're gonna end up spending an absolute fortune to not get many sales so complicated sales funnels mistake number three get those gone now mistake number four is something I see a lot of advertisers do once they start to be a bit see a bit of success I'm going to jump over to another tab and come into the ad level and they basically stop testing let's say you've been experimenting for a while things weren't quite working and you got it right you you found the targeting options that worked you um put an ad together creative image um headline copy it worked right delivered results and you just thought great and sort of sat back and enjoyed those results but the thing is it's not going to last all ads fatigue all audiences provided you spend enough get burnt out you have to find ways to keep testing keep adding in new elements and not sell new laws because it's so much easier to have lots in the bank as it were ahead of time like lots of different creative options to use as opposed to waiting for things to really drop off and then trying to to ramp things up um it could be a lot harder and you can have a a dead period and in between so strongly recommend that you keep testing even if things are going well you don't want to stop testing that was mistake number four um facebook advertising mistake number five is optimizing for the wrong thing okay so if we just go back over here we go to the campaign level and there's basically a couple things that i want to talk about when it comes to optimizing for the wrong thing the first is the wrong campaign objective objective i still i don't really know how given that you know me and plenty of other people have talked about this forever but i still see tons of people using the wrong campaign objective if you want purchases or leads via your website you should be using the conversions objective not traffic not reach not video views people use all sorts of logic to talk themselves into using other stuff like when i'm only retargeting warm audiences so i should use reach therefore i'm going to reach more of them okay the theory sounds good try it in practice you will see that conversions wins i don't generate enough conversion events per week so i should use traffic instead theory sounds good try it in practice you'll see that conversions wins right so just use the objective that you absolutely want if you want traffic because you're advertising an article or blog post fine go with traffic um if you want video views because you want brand awareness you just want people to watch this video of yours online fine go with brand aware go with video views that's absolutely fine okay but go for what you want so that's the first part is at the um campaign level and then of course is the answer level so perhaps some people are they know they want purchases via their website so they've gone with conversions but then in here they're advertising to add to cart or initiate checkout something like that no go for purchases again i've got more information on that and there'll be a link in the video description below to a video sort of really breaking that down and providing more nuance than i'm going to here but optimize for the thing you really want stop optimizing for the wrong thing that's number five okay number six is you want to be very very careful relying on website visitors for your retargeting audiences again this is something that's much more prominent post ios 14 we know that we have far less visibility over what people do once they interact with your facebook or instagram ad and go through to your website so if they're on an ios device and they've not opted in very good chance that they will not be included in your retargeting audiences you don't want to miss out on those people because we know retargeting is so effective so if i scroll down to the uh to the relevant part in custom audiences here so you may have just had for example uh website i'm sure there'll be something created in this ad account yeah you might have something like all website visitors and you can literally see facebook's popped up a warning saying the size of your website custom audiences may decrease because some people it may not include some people using ios 14.5 related devices which is exactly what i just said so instead of just using website visitors add some other um custom audiences that you know are less affected by ios 14 so that could be people who've engaged with your facebook page that could be people who've engaged with your instagram account and those are on app sources it could be an email list so for example we could pop in an email list in there something's been uploaded externally not as affected um i'm not sure we've got we've got a video view yeah there we go you could add in a video view custom audience people have watched a video of yours on facebook these are not affected by ios 14 they increase your overall retargeting audience size and yeah if you're relying on all website visitors or a variation of i think you're in quite a bit of trouble so all website visitors um it's perfectly fine to still keep targeting with your retargeting campaigns but don't rely on web visitors you need other custom audiences to add into your retargeting ad sets or retargeting campaigns depending on how you've got it set up okay mistake number seven is to tinker too much which is something i see happen all the time you know people will come in and they'll take a look at that campaign and they'll see the results and they go oh you know i'll come into the ad set and i'll i'll you know um change the i'll change the targeting options i'll tinker with the age locations i'll come into the ads i'll i didn't think that ad would work and the the headline's not quite right let's delete the headline let's and you just constantly every day or two if things aren't going well you're making adjustments typically i would say more at the ad set level people do that than the ad but they still do it at the ad making adjustments doing things here doing things there and it is such a i can so understand why people do it but it's so counterproductive to your objectives now we know that facebook has this thing called the learning phase right so you go through the learning phase you need to get to the other side of that and then give whatever it is you're testing a few days to find out how that thing performs like if you put a new ad into a campaign you don't want to be assessing that later that day or the next morning and turning it off you don't know how it performs yet you haven't given it long enough if you keep tinkering you constantly keep everything in the learning phase and you jeopardize your results so i really like to make adjustments and give it if possible seven days before i assess results remember that a lot of facebook's data is now modeled because well because of the lost data but also because of the reporting delay that's been implemented don't forget about that it might just take a bit of time for the results to come through very important that that's something that you're aware of don't over tinker i mean it's literally i'm asking you to be lazier you're gonna see better results okay facebook advertising mistake number eight is not something i can really show in a facebook well it's not something i can show in a facebook account and that's delivering a poor customer experience and i think that facebook are really cracking down on this and they rightly so in my opinion and they are surveying facebook and instagram users for you know they'll ask you what was your experience like with certain advertiser and a lot of drop shippers are running into issues with this because they don't provide a good customer experience and if your feedback score from those people that you know oh i bought a product from them but it took three weeks to arrive it wasn't very good when it got there they didn't give me a refund if people can't not comment but if they if they submit feedback with that sort of stuff in and give you a low feedback score facebook will prevent your page from advertising you will just be banned from advertising even if you're not fully banned they sort of as a halfway measure can negatively impact your facebook ad reach your results it's just not something you want to do so that's the on facebook stuff you don't want to live a bad customer experience because facebook are going to step in and go we're not having you give facebook advertisers a bad name and decrease the value of the platform that's why facebook do that by the way which is why i support it but also it's just not good for your business it's as facebook advertising has gotten more competitive in order to do well and stand out you really want to have all the tools at your disposal some of those tools are things like word of mouth referrals you're not going to get that if you have a poor customer experience you want repeat business you're not going to get that if people have a poor customer experience so very very important that you that yeah that you really think about how can i make sure that from start to finish my customers are at least satisfied ideally very happy okay don't want to let them down that's just a number eight right let's run through the list and i've got something i'll quickly mention so number one is not verifying your domain or setting up your configuring your web events in aggravated event measurement okay you have to do that that's mistake number one mistake number two is targeting two small audiences mistake number three is using complicated sales funnels mistake number four is stopping testing not continuing to test new ads new creative all that stuff mistake number five is optimizing for the wrong thing whether that's the wrong objective the wrong conversion event mistake number six is relying on website custom audiences for your retargeting you need other retargeting audiences mistake number seven is tinkering too much you don't be making changes every day and mistake number eight is delivering a poor customer experience okay so hopefully that's been useful before you go i want to quickly talk about our
