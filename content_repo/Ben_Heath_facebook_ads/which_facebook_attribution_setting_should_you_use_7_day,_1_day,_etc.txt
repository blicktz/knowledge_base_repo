Hi guys it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook Ads attribution setting and the options that you want to be using in your Facebook ad campaigns. Now attribution setting is something I've had tons of questions about. It's something that's changed a lot recently and there was a first round of changes on the 19th of January when Facebook was making changes to attribution in preparation for the iOS 14 update.

Then when actually iOS 14.5 was released at the end of April and it changed again. So there's been tons of changes to attribution. We've done a lot of testing as a Facebook Ads agency.

We've tested this in our clients accounts a whole ton and I think we're pretty confident now in the best approach and that's why I'm now creating a video on it because I want to share with you guys what we've done, what's worked and what I think you should be doing to get the best results possible which is of course what my content is all about. Now before I get into it I want to very quickly ask you to smash that like button and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already. I release Facebook advertising related content all the time.

Facebook Ads is changing so much right now that if you want to stay up to date and know the latest things and the best approaches as they change being subscribed to my channel is really going to help you do that. So something I would strongly recommend. Okay so attribution settings.

Let's demonstrate this. I'm going to talk through the options what you want to do. So I'm in an example Facebook ad account here.

I've created just an example campaign and I've just jumped into the ad set level because the ad set level is now where we set our attribution settings. So if you click edit on your ad set and you scroll down don't worry about all this other stuff as I said it's just an example for demonstration purposes and you come down to attribution setting and you have these options. If you don't have the window already up you might actually need to click a little edit button and it'll bring these options up.

So you can see that we have one day click, seven day click, one day click or view and seven day click or view. Now to explain which one you should go for I need to first explain what attribution setting governs and where it comes from. So before we used to have we didn't have attribution setting we had two things instead of attribution setting we had the attribution window and we had the conversion window in Facebook ads.

Now the attribution window the default used to be 28 days click one day view and what that meant is that if someone say clicked on an ad of yours if they then went on to purchase on your website or take the action you want them to take within 28 days that person would be registered as a conversion and it would be attributed back to the ad ad set campaign that that person interacted with before they then went to take that action. So basically provided they took that action within 28 days after they clicked on an ad or within 24 hours after viewing an ad that would then appear in your ad account. So that's what attribution window was referring to that's now been shortened as I'll explain in a minute.

We also had this other thing called conversion window now conversion window instead of being where the attribution comes from it was more around the data Facebook used to optimize your campaign. So you could set for example seven day click conversion window and Facebook is saying after someone clicks on an ad and then converts within seven days we're going to use those people as the data set to optimize the campaign for. So if someone say clicked on an ad and then converted 21 days after clicking previously that would still show up in your ad account if you had the 28 day click attribution window selected but Facebook wouldn't use that person as someone who goes into the data set that they optimize around.

It was two separate things. I know that can better get a bit confusing but hopefully that makes sense. Facebook have combined them to one.

So attribution setting now governs both your conversion window and your attribution window. So not only are we saying to Facebook this is the data that I want to show up within my ad account you're also saying to Facebook this is the data I want you to use Facebook to optimize my campaigns and if you're you know it one of the the truths and one of the fantastic parts of Facebook advertising is that Facebook's machine learning process helps you get much better results. So telling Facebook this is the data I want to use has a much larger impact than you than you may think.

So if I jump over to Facebook support doc about this because there's some interesting information here and I want to clarify the time the timeline. So you can see right at the top here Facebook say attribution setting has replaced conversion window and they've got more information about that. You can obviously go through this support doc by yourself if you want and they come up with the with the four options I just showed you in a conversion campaign.

I should quickly mention that's not going to be available in every campaign time. So if you've got app install campaigns for example as they say here you're not going to have the seven days you're going to have to limit that that time frame. So when Facebook made the changes on January 19th away from a 28 day attribution window they went to a seven day click or one day view which if we go back into our ad set level that would be this option here seven day click or one day view that was their default and out of all these four options that sounds like it gives you the most data which would normally be the best option.

As I've already said Facebook wants data to be able to optimize your campaigns often the more data you can give Facebook the better results you get. So Facebook defaulted to this on January 19th in preparation for iOS 14.5 being released however if we go back you can see they say here we initially defaulted to a seven day click or one day view attribution setting ahead of the ATT which is the prompt you've almost certainly seen by now in Facebook Instagram a whole bunch of other apps. And then here we go Apple has started to enforce new requirements including limitations around view through attribution so Apple's like yeah we're not really happy about the view through attribution as a result the default attribution setting changed to seven day click only however they're still making it available so you think okay well they've changed the default perhaps to be a bit more friendly with Apple but surely we still want to go with seven day click or one day view because that's going to have the most amount of people in it that's more data not necessarily the case okay it's not as simple as that right so that's the first point I want to make and I'm going to explain more about that in a minute.

Then we get into this section here where it says modeled versus partial data in the context of attribution settings. If you want to read through this you absolutely can but the important parts I'm going to try and distill for you are if you select one day click your data will be more heavily modeled than if you select seven day click what does that mean well Facebook haven't told us exactly what their modeling means but what I think we can interpret it to be is that Facebook doesn't have the real-time data that it used to have so a year ago if someone clicks on that goes through and purchase that's going to show up in your ad account basically in real time Facebook does not have access to that data in real time there's a reporting delay been implemented and I've got other videos about that and they just simply don't have all the data because if an iOS user hasn't opted into tracking they can't see it for the most part so Facebook is modeling that data they're basically making calculations like we know that for an e-commerce store like yours on average it converts at three percent we know that we've just sent a hundred people to your website therefore we would model we would assume there are going to be three purchases three percent of those people bought so if you go with a one day click you will often see you will see a lot more model data so you will see okay I generated 100 clicks Facebook is telling me there's three purchases and then perhaps you go into Shopify or whatever the website thing you're using and you see hang on a minute um I don't have three purchases I have nine purchases or I have no purchases because of course they're modeling based on averages and your results might differ from that massively so the one day click option will provide almost instantaneous data in your ad account but the accuracy is not that good now I should say I do expect Facebook's model data to get more and more accurate the more time they go and the more data that they have so they may be able to bring in other factors that get the more accurate in terms of um your website specifically so that's that's that's one day click seven day click on the other hand has less model data not no model data but less model data it started with no model data at all you can see that Facebook say here starting on June 30th 2021 we're also gradually expanding our use of conversion modeling to include it in our seven day click default attribution setting so it's not um yeah it used to be no modeled now we've got some model data in there but what you will see with seven day click is a greater level of accuracy around the data so when you're looking at say purchase in your ad account it's going to correspond more closely to the actual number that you would see on your back end and the actual physical number of say purchases or leads generated but with the seven day click you have the reporting delay so you may see no data for two or three days Facebook are addressing that they're starting to bring in model data so when you're choosing between say seven one day click I'm going to come back to the view stuff in a minute I parked that a second ago but when you're choosing between the one day click and the seven day click what you're getting with one day click is faster data but less accuracy with seven day click you are getting more accurate data but it's on a delay and that means you're going to have to take longer to make adjustments to your Facebook ad campaigns because if you takes you 48 hours to even get you know it takes you two or three days to get data through from there and you would normally take say seven days to assess ad performance well you need to add two or three days onto that and it takes longer to be able to optimize that's the the downside out of these two options I would still recommend seven day click which is Facebook's default personally I'm not in the needing to know everything immediately game I don't think any Facebook advertisers should I completely understand why they do and why they get wrapped up in that and they check their ad account four times a day and they make adjustments but I never I don't think that's been a good way to approach Facebook and Instagram ads for a long time and it certainly isn't anymore you absolutely in my opinion want higher accuracy around your data make take longer to make your decisions but make them make better decisions as a result I think that's certainly the way to go so out of those two even though you get a reporting delay the more accurate data is going to come through from seven day click and what I've heard a lot of people do is they will recommend one day click because of course if you were running seven day click and no date you ran that for two or three days and almost no data came through and then you switch over to one day click and immediately you start seeing data coming in what you may not realize is that the one day is modeled it doesn't necessarily mean that's really what's happening and the seven day data would have come in you just didn't give it long enough so I can so see why if you run a test you start liking one day click and we was thinking that way for a little bit at the beginning but add those two it's one day click or seven day click so then you bring up the question of seven day click or one day view one day click or view so we're going to discount the one day click or view because again same logic as applies to up here with the one day click now I remember I've obviously had these conversations with my team and my account manager a whole bunch and I'm like right okay so why wouldn't we go for seven day click or one day view why did facebook um default away from that that seems like the most data possible and usually you want to give facebook the most data possible um to be able to improve a campaign so for example the difference between these two is that if someone clicks on an ad today and converts within seven days both seven day click and seven day click or one day view will record that but let's say someone sees an ad this morning they recognize they don't click on it but they recognize the brand name they then go into google and google it they then come through to your website and purchase under one day click in theory that person should be attributed back into your campaign it's also then used that person's included in the data set to optimize your campaign all sounds good it doesn't seem to hold up in practice and I think going forward the view through attribution is only going to get worse so facebook basically it seems to me like they've bowed down to apple's pressure and defaulted away from one day view including one day view in in the in the attribution setting and from the testing that we've done it basically seems to just send it a little bit haywire not exactly sure why um i think that facebook with the one day view facebook's trying to track something and provide that data in your ad account that it can't really do anymore so you get more inaccuracies and overall a worse performing campaign i can't exactly say why but in our testing because we we started out testing the click work that out right let's take test click versus seven let's test seven day click versus seven day click or one day view seven day clickers perform better and i think it's because there's just not actually as much data coming through on the one day click as facebook would like it's confusing things and that's the case right now there's only this is only going one way attribution is not going attribution capabilities are not being expanded they're being contracted so i wouldn't want you to go and set up campaigns based on seven day click or one day view for facebook to remove the one day view option in three months time and then all your campaigns are going to go back through learning phases probably have to be recreated all that sort of stuff so i think facebook kind of realized this was going to happen when apple put their foot down a little bit more and that's why they changed the default from seven day click or one day view um and that's why i'd also recommend going with seven day click based on the testing that we've done so it's actually it's quite a long-winded answer um and the result is go with facebook's default um is is what i'd recommend but it's important to know these things because sometimes we test stuff and you absolutely don't want to go with facebook's default and that can make a huge difference to your campaigns and that can make a huge difference to your results and that can make huge difference to your business and that can make a huge difference to your life so these things are very important to test and know if facebook ad campaigns are important to your business um so i think this has been something we've tested so much and talked so much about i'm really glad i'm able to put this out there for you guys now with a concrete uh recommendation but that's what i'd go with if you've got one day click and you switch if you're currently running one day click and you're switching over to seven day click be prepared for your data to not look very good for a while because it's going to have to play catch up um so don't switch over and then two days be like oh ben was talking nonsense this isn't as good it won't look as good for a while it's going to be a lag so give it a good seven days maybe even longer um but i do think you're most likely going to see the best results with uh with seven day click one thing i should quickly mention if you are using a different attribution window and your campaigns are performing really well don't change it just because it's kind of rule 101 with facebook ads if it if it ain't broke don't fix it like if things are working don't change the setting now you may want to when you create a new campaign in the future go with a better set it set up option but don't change things if it's working really well okay hopefully that has been useful hopefully you now know what
