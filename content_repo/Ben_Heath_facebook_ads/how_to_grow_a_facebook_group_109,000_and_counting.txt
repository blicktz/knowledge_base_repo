Hi guys it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how I built my Facebook group to as you can see on the screen just over 109 000 members and counting and how you can do exactly the same if you're interested in growing a Facebook group want to know how to grow a Facebook group this video is definitely one that you're going to want to watch before we get into that just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button and subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already okay my Facebook group is called Facebook Ads Mastermind group if you're watching this video and you haven't joined it to check out what I do I'd strongly recommend that would be your first action so there'll be a link in the video description below you can go ahead and click on on Facebook Ads Mastermind group come through to my my group join completely free all that sort of stuff see exactly what we do but with this group I started it just over three years ago as of the recording this video just over three years ago and it's one of the absolute best things I did for my business was start and build this group Facebook groups are amazing online communities they're a fantastic way to build a brand build a name for yourself in your industry convert prospects into loyal fans and then monetize those prospects you can do all those things very very well with a Facebook group you can also learn a tremendous amount I mean I learn as much from my Facebook group as I teach in there so it is an amazing community amazing opportunity to have and as Facebook has changed the platform and they've removed a lot of the organic reach that you get from Facebook pages even Instagram to some extent a Facebook group is still a world where organic reigns supreme you know you can't advertise within a group you can't advertise to group members so it is definitely something that a lot of small business owners marketers entrepreneurs that want to build an online community should be thinking about I think a Facebook group is a great place to do that now obviously I'm a Facebook ads expert that's my thing right so my group is all about Facebook advertising so it's called the Facebook ads mastermind group and and yeah it's now almost at 110,000 members and the speed of growth has not been linear at all okay so it's not like a year in we had what a third of what we got now 33,000 members not at all I think a year and we may have had 1500 members so whenever you're growing a Facebook group it's very important to be aware that you are likely to start off slowly and then things will really pick up and momentum will build to be honest that's kind of how everything works anything digital anything online marketing you related it's all starting off slow you get to a point and then the thing just starts to starts to really grow so I've got six points that I really want to get across in this video and things that I've done and I'd recommend you do to grow a Facebook group and I'll talk about the various different stages because I think that's that that's important so the very first thing that I want to talk about and the main method that I use to get my Facebook group from say zero to its first handful of thousand members was not to advertise the group directly but to run Facebook ad campaigns for page likes generate lots lots page like so my page has 160,000 or so Facebook page likes and the reason why you want to do that or why I'd recommend you do that if you want to grow a Facebook group is that once someone likes your page particularly if they then interact with your content you're able to invite that person to join your group and we found that going from not knowing someone or a business at all to joining a group is quite a big ask people know that Facebook groups are quite involved but if you put in that intermediary step and you get someone to see a Facebook ad of yours like a page then you get invited to join a group it's it's it's a better sequence it's it's an easier step to take now I'm not going to go through how to run a Facebook page like campaign in this video that's not what this is about but I'll include a link in the video description below to a video that shows you exactly how to do that I think at the time I had 80,000 Facebook page likes so that's the title of the video how to generate 80,000 page likes but I've got about twice that many now but the price is exactly the same so you can go through that video and see exactly how to run the page likes and then once you've got them you can go ahead and click on this invite button and you can see there's there's a couple of options there so invite fans to your group so you can turn on automatic invites which we're going to have a little play around with not something I've done but no reason not to do so we've just more done it manually beforehand you can see that Facebook says save time by automatically sending group invitations to your followers will only send invites to top fans and recently active followers so as people like your page through your page likes campaign that's when they're likely to receive a group invitation which is absolutely when they're excited about you and interested and all that sort of stuff is exactly what you want and the people that are most active so if they're engaging with your content on your Facebook page or that sort of stuff great you want to go ahead and invite those people but you can see down the list below you can go ahead and you know a lot of my fans are already members of my group because that's what we used it for but you can go ahead and you know select a bunch of people and then go ahead and click send invites once you've once you've gone ahead and done that okay so I'm just going to cancel that exit for the time being so that's the first and one of the most important ways that you can grow a Facebook group is run a page likes campaign and invite those people to like your to follow to join your group and the reason why you want to do that is because page your page doesn't have much organic reach so someone likes your page doesn't necessarily mean they're going to see your stuff if they join your group they're far more likely to see what you post without having to pay to advertise to those people so well well worth doing okay that's the first one second one and I think this is often overlooked and this will apply to different businesses in different ways is to promote your group wherever you can so do you have a bit of a following on Instagram do you have a YouTube channel do you have you know a thousand connections on LinkedIn do you have or maybe a lot more than that do you have a Twitter following do you have you know a physical mailing list because you ship product to customer and you could send all of them a leaflet saying join my group there are lots of places where you have touch points both digital and physical with your customers your prospects your target market people in your industry get a Facebook group promotion into those wherever you can so for example a lot of the people that are in my Facebook group have come from my YouTube channel so I have 65 000 YouTube subscribers um I know roughly 4 million views on my on my channel in total and I promote my Facebook group at the end of a lot of my videos to encourage people to go join that's a great way for me to do it um I promote it to my group to my email list to my Instagram following wherever you can get those promotions in there it's an absolute no-brainer it's gonna if provided the group's good quality and got a great community it's gonna benefit them to do so okay um so that could look like a me talking about it at the end of a video if you're putting out video content that could be a simple post I've done on Instagram before saying why don't you go ahead and join my group I'd often do it when we hit a milestone so being like we just reached 50 000 members why don't you go ahead and get involved that sort of thing okay so promote it wherever you can on various social media um channels the other thing that I wanted to mention and this is sort of aside from the social media is to do the same thing but include it not just to your email list which is something that I do but in your email autoresponders so if you're generating any sort of transactions with your customers receipts um delivery confirmations um obviously if they're joining an email list and signing up for receiving content and things like that put links and encourage into your group and encourage people to go join so just wanted to confirm that your package is has been shipped and it's on its way PS if you've got a spare minute why don't connect with other like-minded people who are also really into tennis and join this Facebook group all about tennis okay um that sort of thing absolutely worth doing okay that's the uh the the next one okay the next thing I want to talk about is around the name of your group so here we've got called it Facebook ads mastermind group okay the having Facebook ads in the name of the group is absolutely critical to the success of this group beyond a certain point so the things I've mentioned so far things like the Facebook page like campaigns in particular can really help you get your group going and get those first few thousand members but once it reaches a certain critical mass you want to be findable within search a lot of people more than you think search within Facebook for Facebook groups to join on various topics if I just called this Ben Heath's mastermind group then people who are searching for Facebook ads related groups would not find this and this is one of the largest Facebook groups on on Facebook advertising in the world um and that's a great way not only of growing the group but also reaching new audiences it's not something that's going to matter early on that that you're findable in search but it will do once your group has started to grow and it will really help accelerate the growth going forward so just get it right from the beginning and call your group something that has the keyword or keywords that are associated with whatever it is the industry you're in so that people can find you in search I think that's just a no-brainer something that's easy to do um and also just reminds people whenever they're interacting and all that sort of stuff that that uh what it is that this is all about helps people people on topic on point and things like that so make sure you are found in search by the way one thing I want to quickly mention because I said I talked about things like using my youtube channel my instagram following to grow my group you might be thinking well I don't have any of those you don't now but if you're committed to marketing your business digitally you will have that sort of stuff I mean let's say you're only going to be running Facebook ads and building a Facebook group well you're going to build you can generate Facebook page likes you're going to if you're advertising on Instagram as well which you probably are you're going to generate Instagram followers just naturally through as a side effect of whatever else you're doing promote your stuff to those people don't think I can't ever do that because I don't have them everyone starts off with no Instagram followers everyone starts off with no YouTube subscribers everyone starts off with no people in their Facebook group you will build these other audiences like an email list you don't have one yeah but generate a thousand customers there you go you've got an email list um so don't discard that you can grow into those audiences and and use that as part of your marketing mix going forward this is an important point okay so um the other thing I want to mention about your group and growing it is how involved you are as a group admin as a group owner now I can scroll through this group and there are just I mean like dozens and dozens of posts hundreds of comments every single day so I absolutely cannot engage with all the posts or even scroll back up or even close to it it would take up more than I have time for um even if I didn't do anything else which I have and I have lots of other commitments as I'm as I'm sure you do but that wasn't true when my group was fairly new when my group was fairly new I tried to engage with every post so before it reached let's say three four five thousand members I tried to engage with every post someone asked a question I would answer it I would get involved and I would get the thing going and I would basically if you think about your new group as like this tiny little fire you know you're trying to build like a campfire tiny little fire and you're like blowing on it and adding kindling and just you're really trying to get it going once it's a flame you know it takes care of itself uh in terms of staying lit but you really want to nurture it and keep things going Facebook uses all sorts of data points to work out whether or not they should be pushing your group so should it be found high up in when people are searching for groups um should they be sending out lots of invites based on people who have liked your Facebook page you know via their automatic invite system or should they just be sending out a few and things like do people join the group and then leave pretty soon after okay if they do that's not good do people join the group but never get involved they just it just sits there as a member and they forget about it year after year you don't want any of that you want Facebook to see that people join your group and then they engage often and frequently and they stay engaged and you as a group owner or someone from your company can absolutely help that happen by getting involved so at the beginning I would post in there I would also answer all the questions as the group grew and grew and grew and that became not only impossible but it also became unnecessary because when someone asked a question at the beginning I had to answer it because you know I had 40 members it's unlikely anyone would answer that but once my group grew loads people answer just about every question that goes in there well not just about but a lot of the questions that go in there people can help out with um so answer every question you also want to be posting content in there and this is what I'm still doing now so what am I doing my group now I do live trainings okay I do which are free I do I post content in there almost every single day free content delivering value building that relationship with people I will answer certain questions I'll submit polls I will welcome new people to the group there's lots of things I will do to help increase engagement in the group without going through and answering people's questions and all that sort of stuff in a really detailed way I'm more um putting my stuff out there and saying here's a great place to consume it and I will engage if you want to have a chat around this piece of content and that's worked and that's been much more sustainable for me as we've gone on so engage as much as you possibly can particularly at the beginning and help that thing grow very very important okay and then the sixth one and the final one that I wanted to talk about is to moderate the group very closely so once we reached I think it must have been 10 000 facebook group members something like that we turned on um what's it called post approval so instead of before people would post into the group and then our me or one of our moderators would go through all the posts and basically make sure that it's not spam that they're not trying to sell something all the sort of stuff that we don't allow and then if they did we would delete the post if they did it a couple times then we'd kick them out um that became impossible to point where we were chasing and catching up and it was just unsustainable to be able to do so so instead we switched to uh instead of us allowing you to post and then us having to approve sorry and then us having to sort of catch the posts that are breaking the rules and get rid of them we just went you know what if you want to post in this group you are going to have to submit it for approval we can check it and then we can allow it um to be published if it meets the criteria and meets our rules if it doesn't meet the criteria if it doesn't meet our rules um it will be deleted if it's like an egregious breach like really aggressive selling or spam then that person will be will be removed from the group as well and that was really important because there became a time where there was just so many spam posts and we were just chasing our tail all the time it's not something i'd recommend you do early on turn on post approval i would recommend you turn on post approval once you've got let's say 10 000 members and the reason why is because you don't want to stifle interaction early on when posts are relatively few and far between because you don't have a huge amount of members but if you don't have post approval turned on which as i said i wouldn't recommend you to start with you absolutely want to be moderating the group closely so set your rules you know if i go in and uh go into the about section um uh where are we here we go group rules from the admins we've got some strict rules in here right do not private message other group members okay no promotional posts no post with affiliate links or offers no selling job offers service requests no special activity no spam pretty straightforward okay um set your rules out and stick to them other people will be put off your group if there's tons of spam in there and people are just asking for private messages and trying to take people off the group and trying to sell them stuff no one likes that so it's your community it's your place you need to guard it closely and um yeah and and you know protect it as i said this is when you're getting started in particular it's a little fire that you need to to to blow on and give kindling and get it to keep going and this stuff's really important so don't underestimate it okay really quickly the six i want to run through run facebook page like campaigns um link is in the video description on exactly how to do that step by step in a tutorial format how you create the campaigns what your ad should look like all that sort of stuff check out that video second one is to promote your facebook group on all your social media channels third is in any email autoresponders anything you send your customers transactions receipts shipping confirmation thank you for becoming a lead promote your group promote your group promote your group it makes a big difference over time those things um number four is make sure you be found in search so as i said we've got ours called the facebook ads mastermind group you if you're searching for a group based on facebook ads can't miss it um engage as much as you can answer questions post in there particularly at the beginning get that engagement up get people involved deliver value build that relationship number six is moderate closely don't let people break the rules and number seven actually which i just thought of which i haven't added is try and make it look professional you know like we've got this uh graphic created people know it's to do with me that there's association there which is important if they've come from a different platform and we talked about some of the benefits you know don't be this guy instead save yourself years of trial and error by learning from the experiences of others and we've got like an about sectional written up where we've got information about the group and all that sort of stuff so wherever possible just make yourself look a bit more professional this is an added little bonus one for you there on top of the uh on top of the six okay if that's been useful please comment below to let me know smash a like on this

relatively new or inexperienced digital marketer to do whether that's facebook advertising google ads youtube email marketing is find people that are where you want to be and model from them don't copy them but you go how did how did they do that how can i use perhaps the same strategy but put my own slant on it that is a big big recommendation will save you years of trial and error as as as as
