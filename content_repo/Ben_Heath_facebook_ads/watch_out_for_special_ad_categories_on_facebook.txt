Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to explain what Facebook's special ad categories are. You may have seen that at the campaign level, special ad categories. There's a lot you need to know about them because if you get this wrong you can have your ads disapproved, your whole Facebook ad account disabled.

So we're going to go through what special ad categories are, what that means and what you need to do with your Facebook ad campaigns. Before I get into action, I very quickly ask you to smash that like button and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay, so I'm in the example Facebook ad account and let's go ahead and create an example campaign.

I'm just going to go with conversions, click continue and then you will see that at the campaign level we've got this special ad category section. Now Facebook say here you're required to declare if your ads are related to credit, employment or housing, opportunities or related to social issues, elections and politics and if you click on the default is to have no categories declared. So if you were to not select anything here it's very important that your ads don't meet one of these criteria and if we open up the criteria you can see we've got credit, employment, housing, social issues, elections or politics.

Now Facebook introduced this a while ago and they did so because they wanted to help protect their users from what may be seen as discriminatory advertising practices. That might be too strong a word but something along along those lines. They didn't want advertisers to be able to really specifically target people with bad credit for example and things along those lines.

Okay, so they introduced these special ad categories they're likely to add to them and make adjustments to this but as it currently stands you need to declare to Facebook if you meet one of these criteria. Now I've had a lot of people ask me questions and leave comments along the things of along the lines of I'm not sure whether or not I fall into a special ad category and if you're not sure absolutely go ahead and say that you do. It's much better to say that you do fall into a special ad category when you actually don't or you're on the borderline than to do the opposite not declare that you fall into a special ad category.

As I said very likely your Facebook ads get disapproved and actually I've seen tons of ad accounts be disabled because Facebook will say hang on you know under review your ads have shown to be related to credit for example they're not at you haven't declared that they're related to credit in Facebook special ad categories that's a breach of our Facebook advertising policies therefore we're shutting down your ad account that happens all the time and when you do select that you're a special ad category you'll see that certain restrictions are placed on your advertising capabilities so let's in fact before I select one let's just do a little comparison so the main differences that you'll see if you are um advertising within a special ad category are the targeting capability so I've just jumped to the ad sale level and if I scroll down to the targeting section here in the audience section you can see that this looks just like regular ad set targeting sort of thing you're likely to see okay if I jump back to the campaign level and I select for example that we are advertising something in relation to housing as an example and you can see Facebook gives some more information around housing what that means you know as I said it was brought in a lot to do non-discrimination um purposes and there's some other information there I'll let you go through all of those um to if you fall in with the one specific of those four then you want to go through the details but I want to show you what that means at the ad set level so if I scroll down now to audience we'll see that under the custom audiences section we've now got an extra little pop-up from Facebook saying when using a custom audience be sure that your audience selections do not discriminate against people based on certain personal characteristics to be perfectly honest Facebook doesn't um like that wouldn't want that anyway okay um but it's just highlighting that it's probably more important when it comes to special ad categories to be absolutely above board I mean this is referring to the targeting section but we've known for a while that in the ad level for example you want to be careful saying things like have you do you are you or identifying anyone by personal characteristics that's not something that they uh that people want and if you're uploading let's say externally acquired lists like email lists and things like that just make sure you are very aware of this and you don't uh break the rules if you fall under special ad categories very very important so that applies obviously to custom audiences um which are primarily going to be in this case uploaded email lists although you could have other types of custom audiences um like website visitors and and uh even on app in-app activity based custom audiences like video viewers um things like that people who've engaged with your facebook page I'll include a link in the video description below to another video talking all about custom audiences and creating them and things like that because you might find that um useful as we're focusing on it you will also see that down here in the detailed targeting section we've got another little pop-up because we're we've added a special ad category and it says here some detailed targeting options which may include demographics behaviors or interests are unavailable and that's probably one of the most significant changes that you'll see if you're part of a special ad category is that you cannot use certain targeting options what targeting options are removed changes all the time and facebook as i said are increasing this and so i don't want to go through like the specifics that this isn't there and that's not there but it's it's a lot of things that you would expect things that again could potentially be used to discriminate against certain groups and you know again i reckon that's probably too strong a word in a lot of places but go after you know specifically target certain groups with your advertising interestingly which i find um fascinating and something that facebook have i didn't initially introduce but have now introduced um with the special ad categories is this line here excluding any detailed targeting selection is unavailable what they're basically saying is that with this special ad category selected you cannot use open or broad targeting so you have to use some targeting options but you can't um use all the targeting options that you would otherwise be able to use i find that very interesting i i struggle to understand why i guess they don't want you to just leave it open to anyone and then facebook's algorithms machine learning process find exactly who you want to target it seems a little bit strange to me but um but that's something that we're seeing that's something that facebook have said and if facebook said you've got to follow the rules i wouldn't be surprised if we see more stuff added special ad categories and if special ad categories are tight down on so for example i wouldn't be surprised that if the detailed targeting option list that's currently unavailable for special ad categories but available for regular facebook advertising gets uh grows more detailed targeting options are added to the list where you can't target but you know it almost seems contradictory that you can't go ahead and advertise um you know to open broad targeting that seems that seems a little bit strange okay so if we jump back to the campaign level now and obviously we had housing selected that's what we've just talked through and you'll see that there's four options in here there's uh housing employment credit and you could have multiple ones by the way you could be involved in credit employment and housing or often for example credit and housing may work together that sort of thing um however and that's absolutely fine you can declare multiple ones and as i said if you're borderline or think you could be included in one much better to declare that you are in a special ad category than not the downsides of not doing so are significantly worse than having certain targeting options curtailed right but if we get rid of those and we select social issues elections or politics whilst that is one of the special ad categories it is treated slightly differently than you know these other options these other special categories it's almost a it's almost a special ad category within the special ad categories and the main thing that i wanted to highlight was exactly what you can see popping up on my screen right now you need to verify your identity and create a disclaimer to run ads about social issues elections or politics very obvious as to why facebook have added this in um there was a lot of bad press associated with facebook being involved in elections and politics and things like that so they're trying to be more transparent about how all that works i imagine most of you watching this if you are um involved in a special ad category it's going to be one of these three it's going to be housing employment credit it's less likely to be social issues elections or politics but it's possible in which case you will have to come in here and i'll have another video about this at some point um but you'll have to basically verify identity create a disclaimer and you have to be authorized to run ads in this special ad category which obviously makes things more difficult but it's just a fact again you have to follow the rules there's no work around for these things um but i said most of you i imagine that fall into special ad categories that are watching my content are going to fall into these three one of these three or maybe multiple of these three um and maybe you have and this is why it's set at the campaign level as well by the way guys because perhaps you could run an ad for you know some sort of employment related uh even though your business is nothing to do with the other special ad categories you could be running a campaign for to find a certain employee or you know got internships or whatever and that would fall under a specialized category but maybe the rest of your campaigns don't which is why you set it at the campaign level and as i've said i would encourage you let's say you click on credit for example i would go in and take it see um category requirements they do change a bit between them there's there's a lot of overlap in here that you'll find they do change a little bit between them but you want to read through and say things like for example credit opportunities ads that promote or directly linked credit opportunity including but nominated credit card offers auto loans personal business service loans mortgage loans long-term financing must comply with advertised policies so it gives you some examples further clarification and it says ads in this special category must not discriminate against people based on a whole bunch of different things that's going to apply to all of them but there are a few little bit of differences and you probably want to check out the advertising policies again that relate to the specific special ad category in fact i'll include another link in the description to a whole video i've got about facebook's advertising policies and things you want to watch out for and if you're concerned about your ad account maybe getting disabled which i think all facebook advertisers shouldn't be paranoid about but it should be in the back of your mind that okay there might be extra things i need to do to protect myself here then you can go ahead and um and check through that video you might find it quite helpful be in the video description below okay hopefully that's been useful hopefully that's cleared up some things around what special ad categories are um what you need to do basically declare it what that means in terms of your campaigns and some of the questions you've got around that
