Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from LeadGuru and in this video I'm going to talk about five Facebook advertising myths that are really hurting your Facebook ad results and likely jeopardising your Facebook ad campaigns. And some of these myths are things that used to be good advice six, seven years ago and just way outdated. Some of them were just never true to begin with.

So I think going through these myths and debunking them is going to be really, really important because I see so many Facebook advertisers making mistakes based on incorrect assumptions. So that's what we're going to clear up in this video. Before I get into that I want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already.

Okay so I've got the list of five alongside me here and the first one and probably the one I come up against the most often in comments and things like that and have to sort of overcome is that you have to start by running a traffic campaign if you've got a new Facebook ad account and you haven't generated any conversions yet. I think that is absolutely false. You can absolutely start by running a conversions campaign.

Now the reason why this myth came about is because it's what Facebook used to recommend a number of years ago that you'd run a traffic campaign first because Facebook find it and have an easier time of optimizing for link clicks and then once you sort of have generated a load of traffic to your website you've generated a few conversions those conversions that data then informs Facebook and helps them run a conversions campaign. But as Facebook has got a lot more sophisticated as an advertising platform we really see that that's just not necessary. You can just go with the conversions campaign from the jump.

It's important to be aware that when you first start running a conversions campaign in a new ad account your results aren't going to be great. Facebook does not have a lot of data with which to optimize your campaigns yet so as you generate more conversions results will improve and I think that's what is helping to perpetuate this myth that you need to start with traffic is people start with a conversions campaign it doesn't do well and then they think oh I should have run traffic but here's the thing the traffic campaign wouldn't do well as either. Traffic campaigns yeah they might generate a lot more clicks but they aren't going to generate a lot more conversions that's just not how they are set up and on average I've talked about this stat before a conversions campaign will generate 74% more conversions with the same budget in comparison to a traffic campaign.

Now that number might be smaller initially with a brand new ad account but it is certainly going to still outperform a traffic campaign in the vast majority of cases so I would encourage you very much to run conversions campaign from the beginning and just be aware that results will improve over time but that's inevitable no matter what campaign objective you use okay so that's myth number one. Myth number two is that Facebook advertising only works for e-commerce business it doesn't work for service providers doesn't work for B2B doesn't work for local businesses this is absolute nonsense absolute nonsense when you're advertising on Facebook you are advertising to real people that want to purchase real services whether it's B2B B2C and in fact I would say that the the best results across the board on Facebook are often achieved by service-based businesses particularly when you're factoring in ROAS okay when you're factoring return on ad spend and that's because service businesses can generate leads often fairly inexpensively you could get someone to sign up for a free consultation or a free quote or a free call or something along those lines and your average customer value as a service provider is usually much much higher than e-commerce business so whereas an e-commerce business might be ticking along at 4x ROAS for every pound they spend on Facebook ads they generate four pounds in revenue service providers can be ticking along at 25, 30, 50x ROASs because if their customers are worth that much more um the numbers just look so much better so I think there's a lot of e-commerce businesses that are really trying to opt and of course Facebook advertising is still great for e-commerce businesses I'm not saying you shouldn't be advertising if you're an e-commerce business but there are so many service providers that aren't taking advantage of this platform um that really really should um and uh and I think part of that is because the ads they see on Facebook are just things like you know e-commerce products and little gizmos and gadgets and small little things people can buy for 30 40 dollars and they think oh this is what Facebook ads is nope you can generate leads for very serious b2b businesses um definitely a lot of service providers and we do so all the time and I encourage you to do that if you're in that space okay myth number three is that the more specific the targeting the better now this is a is a myth that used to be good advice when Facebook wasn't a very sophisticated ad platform you needed to tell it exactly who you wanted to reach otherwise you weren't going to get good results but now as Facebook has become much more sophisticated as our platform as the results have improved and their automatic optimization process of working out who to put your ads in front of has gotten better and better and better you don't want to over specify your Facebook ad campaigns and this is one of the biggest issues I see with Facebook advertising where someone's narrowed down to 25 000 people because they think that's all this is just my absolute core group people that are ready to buy and it just very very rarely works out like that you want big audiences if anything the bigger the better and we're seeing tons of of clients and see fantastic results with open targeting with just no um targeting option criteria in there at all just targeting everyone and allowing Facebook to work it out now there are specific circumstances when you want to use open targeting I've got a whole video about that so I'll include a link in the video description below to that video on on open targeting because not everyone wants to use that but um but the idea here is that bigger audiences are better in general okay it's always a trade-off you want to specify to some extent but you know look-alike audiences in the us that come out at two and a half million five million for a one percent or two percent look-alike for example um absolutely fine very happy to to run with those they are not too big at all okay myth number four is that Facebook has gone too expensive this is something I've probably heard a little bit more recently and I think that people not just Facebook advertising and everything but definitely in Facebook advertising they're too myopic they had had too much of a short-term view and we've seen you know I'm recording this December 2020 and we've seen what we've seen recently uh US election has definitely definitely inflated costs um we've just gone through Black Friday sales and things like that we're now right now in Christmas so people have seen their CPMs their cost per thousand impressions go up and they're going this is just too expensive to work the first thing is no that's not true even though things are more expensive right now we're still advertising for many clients that are generating fantastic profitable results secondly costs will come back down again in the new year and it's always more expensive at this time so that's that's something to be aware of Facebook advertising has gotten more expensive over the last five six years undoubtedly okay as there's more demand for um the ad inventory that Facebook has available basically more demand for the supply it has gotten more expensive that's a fairly inevitable um result of something becoming more popular but has it gotten too expensive to be profitable absolutely not I would say it's gotten too expensive to be profitable for poor businesses for badly set up businesses that don't have a unique proposition in terms of the product or service they sell they haven't got any retargeting in place they haven't got upsells in place they aren't delivering great service or products so that they get word of mouth it's gotten too expensive for those sort of crappy businesses that just sort of sell a rubbish product they're trying to make a quick buck and don't have any brand building or long-term um thinking in mind yeah it's got too expensive for them but if you're a good business with good products and services that wants to acquire customers and work with those customers for months and years to come you can absolutely still achieve fantastic results and the vast majority of people I speak to that advertising on Facebook both clients and otherwise are seeing the best results from Facebook tons of them are advertising on all sorts of different platforms but they're seeing the best results from Facebook still and if it was too expensive that certainly wouldn't be happening so I really think that's a myth that makes a lot of people give up too early when their ad campaigns or their business structure or their product offerings just aren't that good okay myth number five is that you always need to use a multi-step sales funnel you need to run a brand awareness campaign and then a traffic campaign then a conversions campaign and then another conversions campaign and take people through a 18-step sequence to get them to buy it it's not true it's definitely not true there are certain businesses where I do recommend a multi-step sales funnel in fact I've got a free webinar that shows you all about the sales funnels that we use as an agency it's included a link is included in the video description below strongly recommend you go through that check that out to make sure you've got the right sales funnel for your business so there are times when I recommend a multi-step sales funnel but so many businesses can use direct to offer approaches or even a one-step sales funnel one is in one additional step sales funnel um if you're advertising a relatively inexpensive product direct to offer is probably the only way you can go if you're advertising something like a free consultation for a service something along those lines you can absolutely use direct to offer we do so all the time so that I think is another myth that leads to huge mistakes not only in people spending so much time and effort in putting these complex campaign structures together but also in terms of results because if you're offering a 30 product you can't have a five-step sales funnel it's too expensive you've got to pay for each one of those steps right you've got to get people to buy that instantly so that's uh that's a big myth I think that that's another one that used to be good advice you needed a multi-step sales funnel six seven years ago because and the logic then was that people didn't buy from facebook and instagram ads because they were relatively new people didn't trust them that's all gone out the water people have been buying from facebook and sky ads for years now they're very used to them um you can absolutely get direct to offer purchase and direct to offer leads and we do so all the time it's the most common sales funnel structure we will use will be a direct to offer approach okay so I'm just going to run through those uh five myths number one you need to start by running a traffic campaign not true you can go straight for conversions number two facebook ads don't work for service providers or b2b absolute nonsense the highest row ass is often seen by service providers myth number three the more specific the targeting the better not anymore you want nice broad relatively open audiences big audiences produce better results myth number four facebook has gotten too expensive that's just not true given the data we've seen too expensive for rubbish businesses not too expensive for quality businesses and quality advertisers myth number five you need to use a multi-step sales funnel not true you could often use a one-step sales funnel we do so often and I check out my webinar to work out when you can and when you can't use that um I think you find
