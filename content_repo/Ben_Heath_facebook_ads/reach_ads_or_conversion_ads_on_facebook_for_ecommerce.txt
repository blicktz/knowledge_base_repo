Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and today's Facebook advertising question is, should a new e-commerce business use carousel ads on Facebook or reach ads? Now the answer I gave to that person, someone asked this on my Facebook advertising group this morning, the answer I gave that a new e-commerce business should use carousel ads. Now carousel ads are an ad format, reach ads normally refers to using the reach campaign objective, so they're not really interchangeable, you can use multiple ad formats in many different campaigns, but I think what they're getting at is, should I use carousel ads to try and generate sales immediately or should I use reach ads to perhaps grow my brand awareness and get the word out about my business and about my products?

In that case, I really recommend carousel ads. If you're a new e-commerce business, you want to prove that Facebook advertising is a viable platform for your business, that you can generate sales through that platform and of course, you know, in the future once you've had that proof of concept, you can run reach campaigns, brand awareness campaigns and use objectives that are likely to pay dividends over the long run, as opposed to that short run gain that you're likely to get from a conversions campaign, which is what I recommend and you may want to use carousel ads. Of course, you could use slideshow ads, static image ads, video ads as well, but we found that carousel ads perform particularly well for e-commerce businesses and it's definitely something you should be looking to test if you're an e-commerce business advertising on Facebook, particularly if you're brand new.

Thanks a lot guys, bye-bye. Bye-bye.
