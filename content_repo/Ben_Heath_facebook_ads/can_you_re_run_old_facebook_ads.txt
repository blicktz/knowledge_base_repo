Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to answer the question of can you rerun old Facebook ads? Can you have Facebook ads that you've run previously and turn them back on or do you need to duplicate them? Do you need to make some adjustments to them first?

That's what I'm discussing in this video. Before I get into that I want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button and subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already. So I'm in an example Facebook ad account here and I've got an example campaign created, I've got two ads, this is just I create all my example stuff in here right so there's some old stuff that's not really relevant but that's not the point of this video.

So let's say we've got example ad, we've got example ad too. Now I'm going to assume that you've got a scenario where example ad, we ran that for a while, it performed reasonably well and at some point the results started to drop off you know and it can happen quite quickly, usually happens more slowly but it gets to the point where you go you know what that's just not performing very well anymore, it's not performing as well as other ads we've got live, let's go ahead and pause that and focus on the other ads and that in this scenario would be example ad two that's been run. Now what most Facebook advertisers will do after that point is they will just basically forget all about example ad, they will carry on going forward and forget about it and you know they might use it to go okay that was an image so we could create other similar type ads going forward so they might take their learnings but they won't actually ever use that ad again and the truth is you can rerun a previously used ad, you can use it and there are actually some advantages to doing so.

The first thing is that that ad's probably got a lot of social proof on it, if you run it for a while and it was successful it's probably got a good amount of social proof on which we know social proof helps improve your results and if it didn't work very well previously, you didn't run it for very long then you wouldn't be wanting to run it in the first place so you know that's sort of a non-question I'm focusing on on ads in this video that have been run previously and did quite well it's probably why you'd be thinking about re-running them in the in the first place so it's got a lot of social proof on it it's also tried and tested so just along the lines of what I was saying there we know that this has performed well previously why wouldn't we want to benefit from that again? Now I think what people assume is that once something drops off or or once performance has been shown to have become bad it can never come back again and I think when people make that assumption they're not thinking about the dynamics of how Facebook advertising works. So firstly we know that Facebook ad fatigue is a significant thing okay we definitely know particularly if you're operating with higher budgets and or slightly smaller audiences if you put the same ad in front of the same people again and again and again they're going to get bored of it and the effectiveness of that ad campaign is going to decrease significantly as a result.

It's that's been known about with advertising for centuries probably millennia even I'm sure there was someone in ancient Rome that was running ads for something and um and they did it too much and people got bored of it right so this is a well-known phenomenon so a lot of the time when you do see an ad drop off it's because of ad fatigue now giving it a month or six weeks and turning it back on again you may well see a nice uptick in performance from doing so and when the ad comes back on comes back live it does really well and this is because we know that this ad can perform well previously it just needed a rest it just needed an amount of time for people to forget about it and for it to become fresh again you have to think that's not only because you've got the same people you're advertising to that just haven't seen it in a while so they're not sort of fatigued by it but also most targeting options are somewhat dynamic so if you're targeting like an interest for example or different people become interested and not interested in certain things in different stages of their lives so I don't know the exact statistics on this Facebook wouldn't share it but I know that you know over a 12-month period for example the 500,000 people that might be categorized within one interest a good percentage maybe a hundred thousand of those are going to change maybe more you know different industries will differ massively right some things like if it's an interest people interested in tick tock I imagine you know that's going to change much more rapidly than people interested in gardening for example something's going to be more static so it's going to vary between interest and between industries but what I'm getting at here is that targeting options change as in the 500,000 people that are in there are going to change over time because people will move into that interest as they become interested in it because remember when you advertise on Facebook there's real people on the end of those ads and they're also going to become not interested in it as they move on to other interests I've certainly done that in my life I've done you know different sports and hobbies and things I've been interested for a while and enjoyed them and then I've moved on to other things sure you probably have as well so returning on an ad that has worked really well previously not only is it fresher to the people that may have seen it in the past but there's also probably a whole bunch of more people in that targeting option that have never seen it that Facebook are going to be able to target so I think turning on old ads that have you know have performed well but they did drop off so you pause them is a fantastic tactic to have in your arsenal obviously a very easy one just takes a second and when I would recommend deploying that is when you're starting to get to that point which happens a lot with Facebook ad campaigns where you're just seeing you're just struggling to get results like your results have just been dropping off dropping off dropping off you keep introducing new ads you keep testing new stuff and it's it's not disastrous but it's not where it was say six months ago when we see something like that happen we would often go okay let's go back through all the old ads that did really well that we were able to run for three months or you know longer sometimes sometimes shorter that we know did well let's go ahead and turn a load of those back on and that can often help pick performance back up again you're going to have to turn those off again at some point because that's just the nature of Facebook advertising but you will get um hopefully some good results out of those for you know uh for a chunk of time will vary depending on your industry but for a chunk of time and um and yeah I think that's that's quite a big deal so definitely something I would I would recommend doing this re-running old ads applies to other elements of Facebook ad campaigns as well by the way so sometimes you just get to the point where with a certain targeting option you just can't get great results with them because you've burnt out that audience you have advertised them loads and you just need to give it a rest so you might not advertise to an audience for six months it having performed really well previously turn it back on after six months boom there you go um you get good results again because it had some time to sort of regenerate and and for your stuff to become fresh same can apply to campaigns even okay not just to ads applies to various elements of a Facebook ad campaign what I would encourage you not to do is not to duplicate your campaigns and then run the new versions I think you're better off if elements perform or you know campaigns or ad sets or ads if an element performed well previously you are better off just running that ad okay um or sorry I should clarify just running that version so that ad that campaign that ad set again as opposed to duplicating and running a new version I sort of I didn't explain that very well but hopefully that now that now makes sense right don't duplicate and run the new version run the previous version you get all the social proof Facebook's gone through and done a whole bunch of learning that's uh the better way to go so just a quick sharp video for you guys today hopefully that was useful and clarified some questions because I've had quite a few people ask can I rerun an old campaign um and absolutely yes you can I mean it happens all the time when we have sort of uh anniversaries of things come up so like Black Friday we might run the same Black Friday campaigns we did last year often we'll make some changes but broadly speaking the same campaigns we did last year again this year and there's no problem with that if it performed really well you know you might change the years and the creative and stuff like that but that's absolutely fine right that's absolutely fine to do that so definitely can do it um as I said hopefully that's been useful before you go a couple of free things I want to mention the first is a free webinar I've created called three killer Facebook ad strategies to double or more your revenue and in this webinar really go through um some of the the well the cornerstone of Facebook advertising and that's the sales
