Hi guys, my name's Ben Heath. I'm the founder and CEO of Lead Guru, which is a UK based digital marketing agency. Now, as an agency, we specialise in Facebook advertising and that's what this YouTube channel is all about.

So every week I release new Facebook advertising related videos that help you achieve certain objectives with your Facebook ads, such as generating more leads, reducing your cost per purchase and things like that. All the stuff that's in my videos is based on the work that we do day in and day out with our clients and we're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars every single month on Facebook ads in a ton of different industries. My videos range from hour-long in-depth tutorials to 90-second quick Q&A style videos.

So if you're looking for better results from Facebook, this is the channel to get the information you need. You can go ahead and click the subscribe button right now and then scroll down and check out some of my most popular videos. If you've got questions about anything, leave them in the comments section of that video and I will get to them.

Thanks a lot guys. Bye bye.
