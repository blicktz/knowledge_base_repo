Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook's advertising policies and I'm going to specifically focus on areas that you need to watch out for that a lot of people are being caught up on that you may not think about that may not be very obvious. I'm receiving tons of messages, emails, posts in my Facebook group from people saying my ads keep getting disapproved, my ad account has been disabled, how do I get it back? And it does seem that right now Facebook is being way over the top on basically disapproving any ad or disabling ad accounts that don't 100% comply with every single tiny little detail in their Facebook advertiser policies.

In fact they're even going beyond that and many many ads are getting disapproved when they shouldn't be disapproved, ad accounts are getting disabled when they shouldn't be disabled but I think there are some things that you really need to watch out for. I'm going to highlight in this video that if you do make sure you're ultra compliant with that you're no way near any sort of grey area on you'll make sure that your Facebook ad accounts don't run into issues, they don't get disapproved, they don't get disabled and you can obviously continue advertising on Facebook and Instagram which for a lot of people you know it's very very important a very key part of their business that their ad account doesn't get disabled that's what this video is going to be all about. Now before we get into it something I'm going to mention at the end all about Facebook advertising strategy so make sure you stick around to the end of the video for that something I think you're going to find really really interesting and it's free.

But with that said let's get into into this process now. Now I'm in Facebook's advertising policies webpage, I'll include a link to this beneath the video description. I would recommend that all Facebook advertisers take a couple of minutes to go through this at some point, it doesn't take that long but it's really really important you don't want to get your ad account disabled, you don't want to constantly be running up against ads being disapproved.

Now before I go any further I do need to quickly mention because I've had tons of questions about this. If your ad account is disabled it's not necessarily the end of the world. The way Facebook's approval process works is they basically use algorithms to sweep through the ads, highlight anything that might be an issue, they will disapprove an ad immediately and then you often have to appeal that you have to request a review and then that's when a human being will actually come and take a look at whatever it is that's been disapproved.

If you get enough of those algorithm disapprovals they'll automatically disable your ad account. Again that can happen automatically with algorithms when you then appeal that decision for your ad account to be disabled that's when Facebook can go ahead and take a look, a person will take a look and see oh actually you know what this ad, these ads aren't against the rules we can re-enable this ad account we can allow those ads to run. So that does happen all the time, happens to us as an agency all the time so the first thing I'll say is don't panic if that happens to you, go through the appeal process provided you haven't been egregiously breaching the policies you will be okay but just be aware that Facebook algorithms very frustratingly disapprove ads, disable ad accounts incorrectly for nonsense reasons all the time.

We often see ads put you know ads be disapproved and the message popping up well you'll read it and go hang on that has nothing to do with my ad, my ad has nothing to do with that, why are you telling me that it's to do with multi-level marketing? It's not, you can't disapprove my ad for a false reason, very frustrating but don't worry once a human being reviews it which is what you'll get when you request a review, appeal a decision etc, you'll be much better off. Okay so with that said let's work on how we can stop you getting ads disapproved in the first place and ad accounts disabled.

So I'm not going to cover in this video the really obvious things, things like don't include any adult content, don't include anything violent, I mean these things are self-explanatory. Of course if you include a violence in your Facebook ads or a violent video it's not going to be approved. What I want to focus on is some stuff that is catching people out a lot right now and that you may not think you have to worry about.

So misleading claim. Now what is and isn't a misleading claim is very much subjective and unfortunately right now Facebook is erring on the side of a claim is misleading and this is something that people get caught by a lot and it's something you need to be care about. Facebook is very very hot on things that they call deceptive, false or misleading claims.

So if for example you tell people that your product or service is fantastic and can achieve x y and z they can interpret that as being a misleading claim. Now that gets very frustrating because of course as advertisers how on earth are you going to sell a product or service without telling people that it can achieve good things? Why else would someone want to buy it?

But there are some things you want to do to make sure that you basically stay compliant. So one of the ways you can get around this is often to put in a mini disclaimer. So if you say for example this product or service can achieve x y and z, if you just have at the end of the ad copy you could say something like please note that these results are by no means guaranteed, they have been achieved by other customers but you shouldn't take this as you know you shouldn't you shouldn't assume that this is achievable for you.

Something along those lines. I'm sure you know the sort of thing I'm talking about. Another way of getting around it is to talk about results but talk about it in a case study format.

So instead of saying this product or service can guarantee you or get you x y z, instead you could say this is the results we achieved for a client. It's very difficult for Facebook to say that a claim is misleading if you say we you know our client used us for this service and based on this service we got them this fantastic result, we saved them this much money, we saved them this much time etc etc. It's very difficult Facebook to say that's misleading because you're giving an example.

I actually think that demonstrating the benefits of your product or service in a case study format can be very beneficial and can get you great results and something that your prospects are probably quite receptive to but it can also help with this meeting misleading claims. So if you are seeing ads get disapproved for this reason for misleading claims try and tone down some of the more sort of exaggerated results that you might be talking about. They might be they might be completely true, I've run ads for companies loads where they have achieved amazing results and they talk about them but we need to dial them down or try and use them as a case study or try and add a bit of disclaimer to just say this in the ad copy in the primary text you just say please note that these results are by no means guaranteed this is what we achieved for one of our clients but should not be taken as you know any guarantees of results success whatever it is you're talking about okay so that's one you need to really watch out for is misleading claims if you see those that that error message pop up that's one thing I would go ahead and watch out for so that's one of them another one that happens all the time before and afters so this is under the personal health section but I've seen Facebook not like before and afters for properties for all sorts of different things so it says here ads must not contain before and after images or images that contain unexpected or unlikely results so basically you're talking about similar things to the misleading claims but with before and afters um again as an advertiser there are reasons why you'd want to use before and after you want to demonstrate that look if you use my product my service it will take you from this before to this after it's standard marketing practices something that's very effective from a marketing point of view there are some ways to get around it if you are you cannot have before and after images alongside each other that's not allowed but if you were to take let's say a video ad or a slideshow ad and you had before and afters sequentially so you showed the before you took up the entire uh basically you know the creative space of the ad with a before let's say in a slideshow and then you showed an after after it Facebook is usually absolutely fine with that because the algorithm is not going to pick up on the before and after very well it's the side-by-side images either as an image or in a carousel or in a video they don't like but doing it sequentially could often be a way to get around that another way is to put the after somewhere else so you could run an ad let's say for example where you're showing the before people will resonate with the before let's say it's you know someone who's overweight they might well i'm overweight that person looks like me and then you could try and get them to click through to a landing page or something like that where there is an after if you put before and afters alongside each other in a Facebook ad they don't like that if you put before and afters alongside each other on a landing page on your website Facebook don't like that either that's something else you really need to watch out for and that can easily get your ad and disapproved and you may see the before and afters they may talk about the landing page experience not being very good this is in the warning message that Facebook shows you when an ad's disapproved for example and that might be why but what we found is that if we can put them sequentially so either the before and then the after one after another in the ad if that makes sense or the before on the um ad itself the after on the landing page so split them up then things can work a lot better again it's all about that initial stage is all about trying to bypass the algorithm not not in a deceitful way or anything like that just literally please let me advertise and you can avoid some of the things you know the algorithm is particularly hot on so before and after is um is absolutely one of them just checking my notes here okay another one that i've seen um come up as an issue quite a lot and i'm gonna hunt this down as well is not branded content but it is use of our brand assets so Facebook has now gotten really really hot on anyone who doesn't overtly demonstrate that they are not connected to Facebook or Instagram not endorsed by Facebook and Instagram in their advertising so if you're advertising any marketing services Facebook advertising services things like that this is something you really need to watch out for so Facebook say here ads must not imply a Facebook or Instagram endorsement or partnership of any kind and it basically used to be fine you know let's say i was running ads two or three years ago as long as i didn't say you know i didn't imply an endorsement so i didn't say something like you know Facebook's number one marketing agency or something like that which obviously implies an endorsement as long as i didn't say those things i was fine that's not the case anymore you need to go one step further not only do you not need to do you need to not apply an endorsement but you also need to actively demonstrate that you are in no way affiliated with Facebook so you can do this in a way you can put a little disclaimer at the bottom of your primary text saying um you know whatever your company name is so i could be like lead guru is in no way affiliated with Facebook um etc etc i'm sure you know the sort of thing i'm talking about you can also put a disclaimer at the bottom of a landing page so if you're sending Facebook advertising traffic and you're talking about Facebook and Instagram advertising in the ad itself maybe on the landing page it can make a lot of sense just to add in a disclaimer at the bottom saying lead gurus in no way affiliated with Facebook the results demonstrated are our own we're not endorsed by Facebook etc etc you know the sort of thing i'm talking about so for anyone involved in Facebook advertising Instagram advertising wanting to advertise marketing services don't not only do you not need to imply endorsement as they say here in my experience you need to go one step further and actively demonstrate that you are not affiliated with them okay so that's the third one right fourth one i want to quickly cover is multi-level marketing now basically okay you can't advertise the business opportunity when it comes to multi-level marketing you can advertise the products whatever it is you're selling but the business opportunity when it comes to multi-level marketing is prohibited unfortunately tons and tons of Facebook ads are being disapproved for multi-level marketing is the reason given when the business doesn't have anything to do with multi-level marketing as far as i can see Facebook don't really like people talking about uh you you know let's say you're advertising something that helps people make money or get rich or get wealthy things along those lines Facebook's kind of hot on that sort of stuff they don't really like it and the reason they give us multi-level marketing i mean i could have something that's a property investment for example i'm advertising a property investment and Facebook pop up with can't run this ad for multi-level marketing you think it's a property investment there's nothing to do with multi-level marketing so they're just using that as a don't talk about making money in your ads and you go okay that sounds good but what if your business is all about helping your prospects make money okay if that's what your thing is can you are you were not able to advertise on Facebook no you can advertise on Facebook still don't worry about that but there are things that you need to do in order to not get picked up by the algorithm so there are certain phrases don't say things like guaranteed returns don't say things like make make money get rich uh grow you know um become wealthy really obvious statements there are other ways you can other other phrasings you can use in your ad copy um that'll be fine so for things like grow your wealth Facebook won't pick up on that or it's very unlikely to pick up on that as an issue grow your wealth um you could talk about something as an investment opportunity as opposed to a way to make money literally in the ad copy don't say this will make you a lot of money or something to that effect you could talk about the investment opportunity do you see you just see the sort of thing i'm getting at here grow your wealth investment opportunity um optimize your returns there are there are things you can do just think right if an algorithm's been designed to pick up on a few sort of keywords things like make money um get rich uh guaranteed returns the word guaranteed is really the issue there um these are things they're going to pick up on don't use them don't think you can't advertise often we've we've taken a look at ads before and they say things like use this product to help you make to help you make money for example and we change that to add this to your investment portfolio to grow your wealth and the ad's been approved you think we're advertising the exact same thing nothing's changed about the message nothing's changed about the details we've just changed the wording so that's something to really watch out for when it comes to uh to anything to do with finance to do with money Facebook is really really hot on um and then you will give this multi-level marketing as the reason i see it happen tons of uh i've seen happen dozens of times over the last few months and um and yeah there's usually a simple fix okay so hopefully that's been useful those are four areas i wanted to discuss because those are things people keep getting picked up on and i think these are the ones that are causing people to send me the messages going hang on my facebook ad account has been disabled why i wasn't breaching any of the policies i wasn't discriminating on political grounds there was no adult content there was no you know some of the really obvious things in there but these things aren't as obvious and but they can still get ads disapproved and if you have enough disapprovals your ad account to say well if you can avoid them as i've described make some adjustments that i've talked about you've got a much better chance of not running into issues with facebook which is um which is obviously important if facebook industry advertising is gonna be a big part of your business which it is for a lot of people obviously a lot of our clients you really need to be on top of this stuff now at the beginning of this video i talked about a free facebook advertising resource uh all to do with facebook advertising strategy i'm going to quickly tell
