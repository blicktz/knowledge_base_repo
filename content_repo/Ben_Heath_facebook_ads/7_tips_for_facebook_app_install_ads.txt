Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to give you seven tips for Facebook app install ads. Now we have a number of different clients that are running app install ad campaigns. They're looking to generate large volumes of app installs and we've worked out some stuff.

We've worked out some tips and techniques and some things that have helped improve our performance when we're running these app install ad campaigns and that's what I'm going to share with you in this video. I think if you're looking to generate app installs with Facebook ads this video is going to be really really helpful. So right now I'm in an example Facebook ad account.

I'm just going to go through a bit of an example campaign creation to sort of highlight some of the areas that you know as I said that are these tips these seven tips I'm going to cover that I think you should be focusing on. So let's get started we'll just create let's just call this example app install ad campaign. Now the first tip the first Facebook app install ad tip is to make sure you choose the right campaign objective.

So Facebook's default is traffic you want to change that to app installs. Now we've tested alternative campaign objectives we've tested using the traffic objective using conversion sending people to a landing page first and then getting them to download the app from there. But to be honest we found that over time in particular just using the app installs campaign objective delivers the best results.

It delivers the lowest cost per install, the highest volume of installs, results are more consistent and which makes sense because with the app installs objective you are sending people directly to the location that you want them to be sent your prospects and they're more likely to download the app more likely to install and of course more likely to go on to become a paid customer as a result. So I it's not a very complicated tip this first one but just go ahead and use app install ads. Okay then I'm just going to enter in here example ad set and example ad and I'm going to click save to draft.

Okay so first tip use the app installs objective. Second tip is not at the campaign level it is at the ad set level so I'm going to jump across here and you can see this is an example ad account so it says you currently don't have any apps available because nothing's hooked up and but I'm going to scroll down to the targeting section. Where are we?

Here we go. Now we tested lots of different targeting options as you can imagine it's what we do with all our clients we're trying to find the best performing elements of a Facebook ad campaign and targeting is one of them but we keep coming back to the same targeting option when it comes to app install ads and that is a lookalike audience based off of existing app users. Very very simple targeting and to be honest we've tested this enough where I'd almost just say to you guys look if you're wanting to run a Facebook app install ad campaign just go ahead and target a lookalike audience based off your existing app users.

It's almost certainly going to be the best performing targeting option and you only need let's say 200 or more existing users to create a lookalike audience that's going to outperform basically any other targeting option so it's not like you need to have you know been running campaigns and built up this user base already you know 200 plus will be absolutely fine and if you're just getting started you don't have any users then yes you'll have to find other targeting options interest based targeting options and things like that and but it shouldn't take you very long at all to get 200 plus users and then you can switch from that interest based targeting option you've started with to a lookalike audience based off of previous users. Now if you don't know what a lookalike audience is how they work or how to set them up I'll put a link in the video description and that'll just contain that'll be a link to a video that shows you exactly how to create lookalike audiences how to set them up and explain sort of why they're so effective particularly for you know app install ad campaigns and I'll also include another video link in the description in case you are in scenario b where you're just getting started and you want to find interest targeting options to get you those first few hundred users so again there'll be a link to a video about Facebook's audience insights so check those out if you're not familiar with that process. Okay the next tip tip number three is at the ad set level but not in this ad set specifically because I've got this you do not currently have any apps available because it's a demonstration ad account and that's the difference between iOS users and Android users so when you're running a Facebook app install ad campaign you can most people will set up two different ad sets you know they'll have one ad set that's targeting iOS users one ad set that's targeting Android users and they want to know how to split budget accordingly and how to go about targeting one or the other in general and this has been fairly consistent across the clients we've worked with that have mobile apps iOS users are more expensive to acquire in the first place your cost per install with an iOS user is going to be higher but they're more valuable in that those people are more likely to go on to sign up for you know premium features in-app purchases things like that which makes sense you just got to sort of think about the demographic I think in general iOS users tend to have more disposable income Android users are obviously the opposite so that's why iOS users are more likely to purchase you know your in-app purchase premium features things like that but also why they're more expensive to advertise to in the first place because there's more advertiser demand for them so it really depends what you want to optimize for are you trying to build a really big user base in which case you might be better off focusing on Android users a little bit more putting more budget into that or are you really wanting to generate a return on your ad spend in the short run in which case iOS users may be the better option because they're more likely to convert into paying customers okay hopefully that makes sense right now I'm going to jump to the ad level and I'm not going to create an example ad but I'm just going to talk about some of the things that you need to think about and don't worry about these warning messages I'm talking about some of the things you need to think about when it comes to Facebook app install ads and the actual ads themselves so the first thing is that I see a lot of people running app install ad campaigns make this mistake you don't want to ask for someone to take step five when they've seen an ad of yours for the very first time on Facebook so yes run a direct to install campaign so run a campaign that is looking to directly generate app installs from cold audiences that's not a problem at all but don't in that ad also try and sell your in-app purchases your premium features and things like that your onboarding process of your app and things like that that's what should convert people into paid customers right at the beginning just ask them to do one thing and that's install the app when you start saying install our app and sign up for the message gets quite confused your cost per install on the front end shoots through the roof goes way up if you're trying to also sell your in-app purchases your premium features so I think that's really important on the front end when you're advertising to cold audiences just try and get them to install the app focus on the other aspects of your app to try and convert them to paid customers things like the onboarding process and stuff like that okay and so that's Facebook app install ad tip number four is to um yeah just ask for the one thing you know don't ask for step four ask them to do step one only and they'll work their way through tip number five which is linked to tip number four is to keep your ad fairly simple so in general when it comes to Facebook advertising the larger the ask the large you know the more involved the more of a commitment you're asking people to make on the front end the more complex the ad needs to be and that's because let's say you're asking someone to purchase a ten thousand dollar service well you know that's a really big decision for someone to make so you're going to need to provide so much evidence and proof and credibility and reasons why they should do something getting someone to install an app is not that big a deal it's going to take them 30 seconds um it's free for the most part it's not going to cost them anything um it's just not something that people need a ton of information about before they're willing to take that step if they like look at something oh yeah i'll download it i'll give it a go so you want to keep your ad really simple because it doesn't require lots of information to get them to install and if you put in too much information into your ad people will take a look at it and they'll go oh i'm not consuming that they won't hear about the benefits they won't watch your long video and they won't get to the point where they're actually installing your app which is obviously what you want so in general we see the best results from image ads or very very simple video ads that are very short perhaps almost in a slideshow format that just really highlight the few benefits of the app and don't go into a lot of details don't list you know 17 different features that it's got and again in the primary text so the text that we have above the image we're going to keep it very short and simple one sentence two sentences that just highlights the benefits associated with the app don't go and make it really really complex provide all this information people won't consume it and it's not necessary all you're asking at this stage is for an app install you're not asking for them to spend you know thousands of dollars whatever happens to be okay so that's tip number five facebook app install ad tip number six is around the headline so what we found with the headline is it's better to focus on the benefits that your customers are going to get from installing your um your app than to focus on the features within the app itself and this is something that's talked about quite a lot a lot in copywriting is that focus on the why on the benefits not the the how not what's included but it really is the case with app install ads and people don't really care what features your app has i mean they do but they only care about the features in as much as how is it going to make their lives easier how is it going to entertain them how is it going to give them something that they want so instead of saying you know um our app has x y and z instead say uh download our app now well you wouldn't have that in the headline but you want to focus on yeah so going back to previous example instead of saying our app has x y and z you would say our app helps you get x y and z and obviously x y and z is going to be different so instead of focusing on the feature focus on what that feature does does it save them time is it really entertaining um you know what what is it what what's the benefit why is someone downloading the app put that in the headline as opposed to features even if you don't actually explain what the app is at all in the headline you know you could have something like um i don't know save up to ten thousand dollars a year as your headline for your app if that's what your app does it helps people save up to ten thousand dollars a year through i don't know whatever means that's a perfectly reasonable headline that can work very well okay so that's something i would i would strongly recommend you uh you include um and then tip number seven facebook ad app install tip number seven is to assess results over a longer time frame so and this is something that people make mistakes with in all facebook advertising not just app install ad campaigns but i think with app install ads it's easy to run a campaign for a week take a look at your cost per install how much you've spent and then take a look at how many of those people have bought in at purchases or converted into premium customers and basically come to the conclusion that the campaign doesn't work but here's the thing if it takes someone on average because of your onboarding process and because they have to interact with your app first if it takes someone on average 14 days or 30 days to become a paid customer which is very common you know it may be that you have an onboarding process when someone installs your app and then you know that they need to use some of the uh free features and get used to those and then basically max those out and get to the point where they then want to become a paid customer they want the extra stuff that you're providing that takes some time and you need to factor that in into how you assess your performance so let's say your average um time from when someone installs an app to when they become a paying customer is 14 days you might need to run a campaign for two months because 14 days on average some people can take longer than that you might need to run a campaign or let's say for two months or run it for a month and then wait another month to have a look back at the results to actually assess how profitable that campaign was this is something we have with a lot of clients we talk about often is that we might report at the end of a month but if it's may 3rd when we do a report um on april on the month of april if we check that data again on june 3rd the data in april so the same time period that already had finished when we did the previous report that may well have improved because of course people have gone on to become paid users etc etc okay right so quick recap of the seven facebook app install ad tips and i've got my little list here to make sure i don't get it wrong the first use the app installs objective we tested other options that one performs best second is to create a lookalike audience based on existing app users and to target those number three is that ios users are more expensive to acquire in the first place than android users but they are more valuable more likely to buy your premium features number four is to not ask for too much in your app installed ad just ask for an install don't ask them to buy your own app purchase at that stage your onboarding process and other things should get them there okay tip number uh five is to use a simple ad format installing an app is not a massive request of your prospects so keep it simple use images or very short videos short text performs best tip number six is to use a benefit rich headline remember i gave the example of save up to ten thousand dollars a year with our app doesn't explain what the app does in the slightest but that works better in our experience than focusing on features so focus on the benefits of your app in the headline uh tip number seven is to assess results over a longer time period so you know if you are as i just mentioned you've got a 14 day average time period between someone in stores and becomes a paid user you're gonna have to give it a good amount of time probably two months before you can actually assess the profitability of your facebook app installed ad campaign okay hopefully that's been useful before i go just want to quickly talk about our services so we are a facebook advertising agency
