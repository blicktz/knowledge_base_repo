Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about the latest changes that have been made to Facebook advertising in the EU. There's been lots of questions I've been asked about this, Facebook have made some changes particularly to message campaigns and campaigns that use messaging related features. So I'm talking about what they are, what the likely impact is of that, what you may be able to do to overcome some of those issues in this video.

Before we get into that I want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button, please click that thumbs up button and of course subscribe to my channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay, so there's a lot of changes going on in the Facebook advertising world right now. We've got iOS 14 coming up soon, other things are happening and this one has kind of been sprung on us a little bit to be perfectly honest and has been impacted, impacted certain businesses a lot more than others.

There aren't a huge amount of Facebook advertisers that use message campaigns. I mean there are obviously a large number but as a percentage of overall Facebook advertisers people probably tend to use other campaign types more but of course if you are or were running message campaigns this is having uh this could be having a really big impact on your advertising on your business and all that sort of stuff. So I've got Facebook support doc up here about this and I strongly recommend you you check this out.

Okay I'm going to go through some of the the big things here and sort of work our way through it because there's a little bit to to unpack here. Now you can see the title here is some messaging campaigns and performance reporting unavailable. Okay that's kind of a little bit vague but if we go through some of this stuff through I'm not going to read through the whole thing but I'm going to read through through some of it.

Due to new privacy rules in Europe some messaging campaigns have been paused. This means that certain messaging messaging related ads targeting and audiences for ads delivered to and from Europe will be unavailable. Now the reasoning behind these new rules as you can see is privacy related and I think we're going to continue to see this sort of stuff into 2021 and beyond.

There's there's a big push at the moment to sort of curtail some of these big tech companies ability to track and and all that sort of stuff. So I think we're going to continue to to see this sort of thing so we're going to have to learn to uh to roll with the punches. But Facebook we're talking about just because these new rules it's the things that are going to be affected are messaging related ads.

So any message related campaigns um have obviously been big time um um affected and and basically unavailable um targeting which we'll get into and audiences as well which we'll also also get into. So you can see other messaging features is what we're talking about you're not going to see as many metrics um there's messaging APIs probably not a huge amount of you watching this will be using things like messaging APIs you maybe may do but the thing that's going to really impact a lot of people is this sort of stuff here. Okay so I'm just going to read out this section here.

These features are temporarily unavailable for ads delivered to or from Europe targeted to European locations delivered to people in Europe or from advertisers or pages based in Europe. So basically you've got anything to do with Europe you can't use the uh these features that I'm about to talk about. Within the messages traffic and conversions objective conversations and leads that's more of an optimization as opposed to a destination related issue.

So if you've got messenger as your destination you're not going to be able to use these optimizations but for example they say down here you can still run ads that click to message using the following substitutions. So it's not a case of you can never run a Facebook ads that end that takes someone through to messenger that's not true. So you could still use the link clicks optimization can be used instead of conversation slash leads.

So what Facebook are basically saying that if you've got messages as your destination in your ad campaigns you're using messages and objective traffic or conversions as an objective you can still run a campaign that's trying to get people to click on the ad you just can't run a campaign that's trying to get people to take these actions which is what I would recommend you use if you're running those sorts of campaigns and that's what you're after you would want to be using these. It's kind of like the same as if you're running a website conversion campaign and Facebook saying you can't run a website conversion campaign optimizing for purchase or lead instead you need to run a traffic campaign or a conversions campaign that optimizes for link clicks which is effectively the same thing or very similar at least instead. It's an optimization thing.

Now there's a few points I want to highlight here. Facebook say here changes to your campaign may affect performance. Well yeah we know that and unfortunately making this adjustment that what they talked about is likely to result in fewer messages, fewer conversions and a worse performing Facebook ad campaign.

But at least if you did have let's say a messages campaign or something you know one of these other options here running before and it was performing really well you can at least keep advertising with this setup for the time being. So that's one thing I wanted to talk about. There is a temporary solution the Facebook layout here and you can start on that just know that it's limited I think in terms of its effectiveness.

Right other thing I want to talk about that I think really interesting is this word here. As Facebook say these features are temporarily unavailable for ads delivered and then it's all everything you're in Europe. Right.

Okay how temporary is that temporary unavailability? I would assume at this point that it's permanent. Now I think that Facebook might find alternatives so you might not just be limited to this stuff down here right.

You may be able to do other things going forward as Facebook find alternatives to these setups but I would assume that this exact setup that you may have been using previously is not going to come back. If it does fantastic isn't that great but we want to prepare for that not being the case. I would start with this sort of setup and potentially look at just different funnel structures and all together.

So instead of running a messages campaign for example you could run a conversion K-PAC based campaign that's optimizing for leads through your website or this all this sort of stuff. They say temporarily as if maybe the EU will change their new privacy rules or they'll slacken them and they'll be allowed to bring this stuff back. I think that is very very very unlikely.

I think if if we know anything about what's going on in the digital advertising space governments continents in this case even private organizations are clamping down on privacy related issues and they don't want these big online advertising platforms to be able to track your every move. So I very much see it going that way as opposed to backwards but it's certainly interesting. Oh and one thing actually I should specifically highlight because it's a little bit different to these is sponsored messages are just not available so if you're running that sort of campaign you're just not gonna be able to do it.

To be fair I don't know many advertisers, I know lots that have tested out sponsored messages, but I don't know many advertisers that have sort of pinned their flag to that mast and that's what's really worked for them they've scaled campaigns with that setup that seems to not be super common. Okay so that's the effect on the setup so if you did have one of these setups you have messages at destination with these campaign objectives and you're optimizing for conversations or leads you can't do that anymore you're gonna have to basically switch to link click optimization but that would be the easiest change to make sure you can keep going up and running. Hopefully that makes sense it's a little bit difficult to get through because it's like if you've got this and this then you can't do this you know.

Custom audiences so unsurprisingly if we can't actually get run campaigns that optimize for these actions you can't run ads to custom audiences and then resulting lookalike audiences from people that have taken those actions. So for example we can't run custom audiences anymore that are include like people who sent a message to your page right it's being clamped down on because message data is really being clamped down that's what the privacy rules are it's all about message data really. So you can't run that Instagram audience same if you can't run people who sent a message to you and then of course lookalike audience based off the back of those are not gonna be allowed either which which makes a lot of sense.

There's some other stuff in here with special ad audiences that's unsurprising that may or may not affect you but it's the fact that you've got messaging events related to pages and profiles you can have it with that sort of stuff as well. And then finally some of the metrics is going to go away so for Facebook said so far they may well get rid of this is that historical data will continue you can see that the historical data will continue to be available but it may they say may no longer be logged going forward. I think that's almost certainly going to happen.

So those are sort of the the three you know how this here will affect what you can see from these we don't exactly know yet hasn't exactly been been seen through and worked out you may have seen various changes in your ad account but it seems to be a changing thing all the time as with as with a lot of things going on with this but the three main areas are you can't use this sort of campaign setup anymore you're gonna have to switch to this one here is that going to negatively affect your results most likely it is therefore do you want to add another string to your bow with perhaps a lead generation campaign instead of relying on messenger or perhaps sending people to your website generating leads that way I would argue yes that is something that you want to go ahead and at least experiment with and then some of the targeting options are curtailed as well you know people who said not being able to target customer audiences of people who've messaged you and then lookalike audiences based off of those custom audiences is a pain what's the workaround go broader so perhaps you could use anyone who's interacted with your facebook page anyone's interacting with your business on instagram and those are custom audiences that we use anyway to be honest those custom audiences and then the resulting lookalikes aren't what we tend to really focus on um when we're creating campaigns we're more likely to create lookalike audiences based off of um previous customers or um what would be another example email list website visitors things along those lines that tend to perform slightly better so not super concerned about this stuff um the loss of data the custom audiences it's not ideal but but this is a much bigger change and we've been through how you go about adjusting and working that out there are a lot of things going on in the facebook advertising world right now as i mentioned ios 14 is going to be a really big update i i'll include a link in the video description below to a video talking all about the ios 14 update and how that's likely to impact things um even though they've affected facebook advertising in different ways they're both along the same vein and that's the idea is to protect facebook and instagram users privacy or at least that's what's talked about um in apple's case we feel that you know there may be some competition elements and things like that but you know it is what it is so i think these sorts of things are going to keep happening it's not all doom and gloom whenever there are changes there are opportunities this might scare away your competition you might be left with a much larger share of the the market in your industry there are always opportunities and why do you want to stress that you don't need to panic it's just an unfortunate change that you might have to adapt to but that's you know that's what you get from operating in a really dynamic industry there are tremendous positives to it but one of the things is you need to adapt to change and that's what we're having to do okay before you go a couple of things i uh i want to mention the first is a free webinar i've created called three killer facebook ad strategies to double or more your revenue you'll be happy to know that none of them feature messenger campaigns message campaigns which is very important right now because they obviously wouldn't work but in the in that webinar i basically break down three different sales funnels that we use for our clients all the time very much try and tested generated more than a million dollars multiple times with each and would strongly recommend that you go ahead and check this uh this webinar out it's completely free links in the video description i also in that webinar by the way explain what type of sales funnel you need to use depending on the products or services that you offer which is really really important something that's often overlooked you can't advertise all products or services the same way it's not going to work and particularly if you've been running message campaigns and they were working and now you need a different setup that webinar is so the thing to watch so go ahead and watch that out completely free i think you'll be very happy that you did other free thing i wanted to mention is our facebook ads mastermind group so we're just showing 60 000 members in my group right now amazing community one of the biggest communities of facebook advertisers in the world and it's full of people just like you right want to get better results for facebook and instagram ads they're asking questions getting them answered discussion in there um best practices are talked about when there's changes made i do free live trainings in the group if that sounds like something you want to be part of go ahead and join link is in the um video description we'd uh we'd love to have you in there and um i think we're very valuable if this video has been useful please let me know please comment below if you've got questions comment below i try to get as many as i can i'm sure there's going to be quite a lot of questions around this topic because it's uh it's a change and it's a little bit confusing um and uh and yeah subscribe to my channel if you are new and i will talk to you soon thanks a lot guys bye for now bye
