Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about how many Facebook ads you should be running at any one time. I get a lot of questions from people who say things like how many Facebook ads should I run and I'm going to sort of discuss how we think about the volume of ads you should be running at once, how you should be changing that over time and some other questions to do that because I think that's going to be really valuable for a lot of people with those sorts of Facebook advertising related questions. Now when it comes to thinking about your Facebook ad campaign structure I don't really think about it in terms of number of ads okay so I get a lot of questions people who say things like um you know what should my budget per ad be and that just kind of doesn't really make sense because I just don't think about budgets in terms of per ad you could have one campaign that you spend half a million dollars on that has three ads in it you could have another campaign that you spend five thousand dollars on that has 20 ads in it that the volume of ads is not dictated at all by the budget or the audience size or anything like that the volume of ads is all about optimizing your campaign for optimal performance okay so what I've got in front of me is an example Facebook ad account an example Facebook ad campaign I'm going to go through the structure of this very very quickly and explain how we set it up and that'll answer that question of how many ads we're running at any one time so we're going to assume that you're advertising a fairly simple product or service let's say something that costs less than a hundred dollars and you're using a direct to offer strategies the strategy that I recommend most advertisers use um and it's very very simple you put an ad up for your product or service you get people to click on it come through to your website and inquire about your services or buy now there are other strategies I do recommend um for lots of other scenarios and you can check out a free webinar of mine that I'll include a link to in the video description below that talks all about um Facebook advertising strategies it's actually called three killer Facebook advertising strategies to double or more your business and I demonstrate three different sales funnels in there so if you're wondering about different strategies and different sales funnels to use go ahead and check that out completely free link in the video description but in this I'm gonna uh the way I'm gonna structure this video is talk about a direct to offer campaign this structure can be used with lots of other types of campaigns that you'll find out about in that webinar as well but this is the simplest way to demonstrate it so we've got one example campaign right we're going to turn on campaign budget optimization and then within that we're going to have let's say four different ad sets what I would say is three to five different ad sets and each one of those different ad sets is going to be targeting a different audience roughly could be a little bit more could be a little bit less once we've had a campaign running for a while we might narrow down the number of absence okay then we get into our ad level so let's take a look at ad set number one we have in ideal world four ads running in this ad set now I like to have four ads running for a number of reasons okay so firstly it's not too many if you were to put 12 16 different ads in one ad set Facebook will have a really hard time optimizing that campaign and working out which ad is likely to deliver the best results just because there's so much data for it to chunk through it's going to take a long time you're going to stay in the learning phase a lot longer so no more than five ads live at any one time in one ad set is what I'd recommend okay so that's obviously part of the question there I like four three or four for a few different reasons it's not too many we've already discussed that but you can tick a lot of different boxes so firstly it's really important to test lots of different ad creative when you first create a Facebook ad campaign it's very difficult to work out ahead of time which ad creative is going to land with your target audience is image a going to work or image b going to work best is a video going to work better than a carousel ad better than a slideshow ad better than an image ad you know we've got a lot of experience with Facebook advertising we run dozens of campaigns for our clients at any one time constantly spending millions and millions of dollars on Facebook advertising and even we are often surprised when we put up a whole suite of ads which one delivers the best results it's not that obvious to work out there are nuances between different markets so the answer to that sort of problem is to test a lot of different ad creative so as I said I like to have four different options because at the beginning you could test four different ad formats so you could have example ad one being an image ad example ad two being a carousel three being a video and four perhaps being a different image ad or a slideshow ad you can very quickly work out okay it seems that our market seems to respond better to let's say image ads in this case everyone thinks it's all about video and for a lot of businesses businesses it is but not all the time let's say in this example that an image ad performs best results okay what we would then go and do is let's say image ad is example ad number one is the image ad we would pause two three and four and then we would create some new ads add them to this ad set with other images and test those alongside each other so part of the reason why I like to have three or four different ads going in one ad set at any one time is to be able to test different ad options and improve performance you know if you create one four ads one performs the best you pause the other three you create some more ads that are similar to the best performer you may find that out of that next batch one of your ads outperforms the original best performer if you go through that process four five six times you might end up with ads that have a cost per purchase that's half or a third of what you originally had okay because you're weeding out the underperformers and just carrying on with the best performers so that's a really key component of always making sure you have multiple ads running at once there are also some other aspects to having let's say four ads in an ad set at any one time live and that's that different people respond to different ads so whilst you may see in my previous example that image ad works best perhaps you get great results from image ads and video ads and you want to keep them both running alongside each other and that makes sense because some people are gonna are more interested in videos and that's what's going to grab their attention and it's going to hold it and you're going to convert with those people better but other people haven't got time for that they don't want to watch a video they want to know exactly what's going on in an image they're scrolling through their facebook newsfeed really fast they see an image they get the idea they're either interested or not they take action different people respond to different ads that's another great reason to have three or four let's say three to five different ad creatives um running at any one time a really important thing that's not talked about enough is that you're not advertising to robots here these are real people with real preferences and differences the other thing and this i find really important about having multiple ads running at any one time is ad fatigue if you just use the same ad for weeks months even years although you very much struggle to get to years never make any adjustments to it never have other ads running alongside it you're going to run into ad fatigue and that's where people in your audience are just bored of your ad it doesn't have the impact when it comes up in front of them because they've been there they've seen that they've either decided whether they want it or not you can help overcome ad fatigue by refreshing ad creative and running multiple different ad creative at the same time so if you've got four different ads and let's say you know person within your audience sees ad one on a monday ad two on a wednesday ad three on a thursday ad four on a sunday that's going to have a much greater impact because each each different ad variation is fresh and they're going to pay attention to it it's going to have a much greater impact than if they just see the same ad four times in a week and your results are going to be a lot better for it so three to four different ads per ad set is about perfect when it comes to the number of ads that you want running number of facebook ads you want running at any one time it will vary so you may see that you just have one ad that performs really really well you just can't beat it okay keep testing and keep adding in along ads alongside that but it's absolutely fine if you perhaps only have two running or three running or one running for a time period once you create new ads so don't don't think i have to have three or four running at any one time all the time it is more flexible than that but as a general rule that's perfect there are also other cases other scenarios whereby um you know i don't know you might be running a particular discount offer across a range of products and you really want eight ads running in an ad set for a limited time only again that's fine uh just don't make a habit out of it because it's a lot for facebook to to optimize so in this one ad set we've got four different ads okay if i go back to the campaign structure we've got four different ad sets you might be thinking wow have i got to create 16 different ads four times four is 16 so you've got four ads in each ad set that's 16 different ads and the answer is no and this is really important when i set up a campaign with this structure i'll include a link below that that sort of gives more detail about the campaign structure and why it works really well so check that out if you're interested when i have this campaign structure i like to use the same four ads in each of the four ad sets because what i'm doing at the ad set level is i'm testing targeting options i want to know which targeting option delivers the best results now that means to do that properly you have to isolate the variables if i have different ads in ad set two versus ad set three and different targeting options and let's say ad set two really outperforms ad set three i don't know whether ad set two performed really well because of the different targeting options or because of the different ads it could be one of the two could be a combination who knows it's really hard to pick apart that data whereas if i keep the ads consistent across the four ad sets i can then very easily take a look at things and go aha that lookalike audience performed much better than that cold interest targeting option that we found great we can make adjustments accordingly so in a campaign like this i'm going to have three to four ads running at any one time the same three to four ads across all the ad sets that we're using including warm audience ad sets by the way a lot of people like to create warm audience ad sets where they then tarp they tailor the ads and say things like you forgot to buy these pair of jeans that you add into your cart yesterday there is some there can be advantages to doing that but for the most part people find it really creepy particularly in industries that aren't marketing related industries where people are a bit more used to it a bit more accepting of that sort of thing if you're operating in a non-marketing related industry people do not like that breaches privacy it doesn't breach privacy policies but looks like it does and they just get creeped out by that sort of thing so i like to use the same ads for my cold audiences and my warm audiences and use those ads as more of a reminder to get them to take the action they had previously started doing perhaps if they click to the website etc etc so i hate to use the same ads there don't get too fancy and cute and clever with it it doesn't tend to work very well so how often we refreshing these ads so we're running three or four ads at any one time i would say on average we are refreshing ads probably once maybe twice a month now bearing in mind that the campaigns that we're running for our clients the average ad spend is probably around about 10 maybe 15 000 a month we have some companies spending literally over 100 000 a month some down at you know two three four thousand something like that so the average let's say it's ten thousand dollars a month that means that we're going to have to refresh ad creative more often than someone who is spending 500 a month or a thousand dollars a month on their facebook ad campaign because we're going to generate that many more impressions and we're going to run into ad fatigue that much faster so with this structure aside from testing to try and improve performance just regularly refreshing things once a month on ad creative is absolutely fine once every two months is probably okay and bearing in mind you're not turning off the best performing ads after a month so let's say we've got these four ads here example ad one does really well we might leave that ad running for six months but we'll be adding in other new ads alongside it let's say on a fortnightly or in your case if you're operating with a lower budget perhaps a monthly basis that's when you're taking out some of these other ads pausing them for performance and adding a new one to test against you can do it more frequently if you want if you want to speed up that testing process and improve your performance and a lot of people will so by all means go ahead in which case you might want to do it on a on a weekly basis i would recommend more frequently that because you need enough data to make decisions but let's say on a weekly basis um but in terms of what do you need to do if you want this to be more passive and more hands-off i would say once a month once every two months in terms of refreshing ad creative is absolutely fine okay so hopefully that helped answer the question of how many ads should you run at any one time and and hopefully now understand why i don't really think of budgets in terms of how much you spend per ad it's when you're using campaign budget optimization which i'll include a link to by the way in the video description if you don't know what that is um facebook will allocate budget according to performance so you might have one of your ads or two of your ads spending 80 of your budget that's absolutely fine if that's a really high performing ad that's what you want that'll get you better results now just before you go something i want to quickly mention
