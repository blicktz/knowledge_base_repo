My meta ads agency has run more than 5,000 Facebook video ads for our clients and the single most important part of a Facebook video ad is the hook. If you get the hook right, it massively increases the chances that that ad will be successful. And in this video, I'm going to show you how to come up with tons of highly effective hooks for your Facebook video ads quickly and easily.

Okay, so I'm excited about this one. I've got my notes in front of me because there are lots of different hook options that I want to run through and I don't want to miss any out. But let's quickly start by just explaining what exactly the hook is.

So the hook is the first three seconds of your video ads on Facebook and Instagram. And it is by far the most important part because if people aren't hooked, if they don't watch those first few seconds, they're not going to watch the rest of the ad. And if they don't watch the rest of the ad, they're not going to hear about your product or service.

They're not going to convert. They're not going to take the action that you want them to take. So it is by far and away the most important part of your Facebook ad.

And it can make a big impact on performance if you can improve your hook. You can absolutely 10X the number of people that actually watch your Facebook video ad by improving the hook. You can change your hook rate from 3% to 30%.

This is possible. And I'm going to explain more about hook rates and percentages and how you track this later on in the video. But I just want to really emphasize how important this hook is.

At the end of the day, if people don't notice your ad in the first place, if they aren't hooked, nothing else matters. It's not going to convert. So what's the purpose of a hook?

Here's how I'd recommend you think about it, right? So the hook is designed to sell the rest of the ad. It's the first three seconds.

It's very, very short. You're not selling your product. You're not selling your service.

What you are doing is grabbing people's attention and then convincing them to watch the rest. And the rest of the video ad is what's going to get people to convert. You want your ideal prospects going, oh, that's interesting.

Or yeah, that applies to me. And then deciding to watch the rest based off the back of that. And because the hook is the most important part of a Facebook video ad, it's the part that we test the most.

I don't have specific testing recommendations later on as we go through this video and how I'd recommend you structure that. But I just wanted to emphasize that point. Okay.

So let's dive into the hook variations. There are lots of them, lots of different categories of hooks and a lot to get through. So the first category of hooks that I want to go through are call-outs, specifically that use sort of labels, descriptors, things that people will self-identify.

And this is literally the person within the video ad saying these labels, these descriptors, that your target audience will go, yes, that's me. And then be far more likely to watch the rest of the ad, which is the whole point of the hook as we've been through. I really like this as a hook option.

Very easy to do. Not high production value. It's just a case of making sure you say the right words and having a little think about it.

Now, of course, when you're looking to go after your target market, there's lots of different ways people can self-identify and lots of different labels they might have. Some might be more or less pertinent to your offer. So you'll have to have a little think about that and think, well, does this one apply?

Does this not? But let's go through the different types that we could use when it comes to call-outs using labels, right? So the first one we could do is characteristics, people's personality traits.

So you could have things like lazy, anxious, motivated. Does someone self-identify as one of those things? Now, of course, we're running Facebook ads here.

So you've got to be careful with advertiser policies. If you start a Facebook video ad with are you suffering from anxiety? That's far too on the nose.

That's not going to work. But you can kind of say the same thing, but come at it from a slightly different angle. So instead of saying, are you anxious or are you suffering from anxiety?

You could have something like, young men suffering from anxiety tend to find that. So you're not saying, are you to the person, but you're describing who you're hoping to target perfectly. Assuming, of course, you then have a product solution that helps young men who are anxious.

But that would be a way of using a characteristic. A lot of people think you can't use those in hooks. You absolutely can, but you have to do it just like I described.

It's not, are you suffering from anxiety? It's young men who are anxious, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. You know, you make like a more of a statement or something along those lines or young men who are anxious often struggle with ABC.

Okay. So the next one is location based. So this could go from really broad to really specific.

So you could have Americans being like the most broad term, the whole country, or you could go with Texans for something more specific, or you could go with New Yorkers, or you could get really specific and talk about like a suburb of, of a city. And you can literally have the hook in your ad being like Texans, did you know, da, da, da, da, da. And then you go onto the rest of your ad.

And if someone is from Texas, lives in Texas, they identify as a Texan, that's far more likely to grab their attention. There are other planes in which you can do this other sort of types of call outs. You could be based on income or wealth, you know, high net worth individuals could be relationship status.

So you could say things that are going to specifically apply to parents of small children or people with elderly parents or people that are just about to get married, you know, they're engaged or they're newly married. And there are, again, you have to be careful to not violate any advertiser policy. So you can't say something like, are you engaged?

But like how I described previously, there are often ways you can go around addressing this. Profession is another one. If you're looking to specifically target lawyers or dentists or whatever it happens to be, you can use call outs that specifically speak to those people.

Again, for this to be effective, like with all the hooks that we're going to go through, someone needs to go, yes, that applies to me, or yes, that is me, or yes, that is interesting to me. So when you're trying to work that out, one of the things to think about in terms of a spectrum with your call out hooks is how broad versus how specific to be. So I talked about that briefly with the location based, there is always going to be a sweet spot for every business.

Like broad would just be everyone in your market. Like let's say it was my business. It would just be a hook that is Facebook advertisers, like all Facebook advertisers that that's on the really broad side of things.

Really specific might be e-commerce businesses spending more than $100,000 per month. And that might be too specific because in my business's case, we work with lots of other businesses that aren't just that, right? Aren't just e-commerce businesses spending more than $100,000 per month.

So there's often a sweet spot for my business. It might be a compromise. It might be something like spending more than $5,000 per month on Facebook ads.

That's typically our sort of minimum range for our done for you services. We have other offerings that are suitable for smaller businesses than that, but for our done for you offering, that's typically our minimum. So we might start with a hook like that.

That's a compromise. It's not being too specific and just going after a certain type of business because we do serve all different types of businesses, but it's giving a bit of information to make it a bit more specific. Now, it's really hard to work out how broad versus how specific to be before you've done a bunch of testing.

So my recommendation would be create a whole bunch that sort of fit into different areas, test them and see which performs best would be my recommendation there. Now, before we get into some more video hook options that you can use, HubSpot, who I'm partnering with on this video, have created a fantastic free resource that contains 50 high-performing Facebook ads. There is a link in the video description below where you can download these Facebook ad examples.

They've included ads from Nike, Hulu, Venmo and so much more. My favourite part is that it's sorted by industry to make it easy to find exactly what you're looking for. Using this free resource to find high-performing Facebook ads to model from is one of the absolute best ways to create Facebook ads that deliver great results.

You don't need to try and reinvent the wheel, especially when you're learning. I'd strongly recommend you check it out and use it to level up your Facebook ad creative. Check the link in the description below and thanks to HubSpot for sponsoring today's video.

Okay, another type of hook that you can use are questions. So you start by asking a question that you are very confident that your prospects will say yes to, your ideal prospects will say yes to. Okay, so I've got some examples.

For my business, do you struggle to get your Facebook ads to work? Now, we know that the people that are potentially going to work with us, hire us, are going to say yes to that question. If they say no, well, they've probably got it.

They don't need my help to begin with, right? So that's a good hook for our business. I'll give you some other examples.

Do you spend too much time cooking and cleaning? Let's say you had a service that helped people out with that and that might be a question that people are going to say yes to and therefore are more likely to consume the rest of the video ad. Do you dream of changing careers?

If your product or service is related to that, that might be a good hook and you can think of other examples for your business specifically. So then we've got conditional statements. They're a little bit different to the questions.

Questions are just quite like do you or are you or have you, you know, about a thing. Conditional statements have an if component to it and that's why they're different. I would normally prefer to use a conditional statement because I feel the buy-in from the person hearing it is likely to be greater if it describes their situation.

But we can absolutely test both. They're very valid. Let's give some examples of conditional statements and explain why they work, right?

So for my business again, if you spend more than 100k per month on Facebook ads, we guarantee you a 30% improvement in your ROAS in three months. So if, if you meet this criteria, then something about us, business, offer, a few different ways to do that. But it's if then that's, that's the condition.

Another example, if you can't walk your dog in the park because of reactivity, we have the perfect program for you. If you have this problem, we have the solution. You'll see, if you see my retargeting ads pop up, you'll see I use this one quite a lot because I do like it.

It takes a little bit more thinking around the questions and they are linked, but I think a little bit more powerful. And then we can use outstanding results. That could be a really good hook because if that's interesting, if it's different, if it's something that people go, oh, wow, look at that.

Again, they're far more likely to watch the rest of the video ad, which as we know is all important. And again, this is one that I use in my ads quite a bit. Now, what we typically use is client results screenshots.

So when we have a client where the results are just incredible, you know, we're going to be a 40x ROAS or something like that, which we are able to achieve from time to time, we will take a screenshot if we can or use a video of it and we will stick that right at the beginning of some of our ads, because we know for anyone that's running Facebook ads that's struggling to get great results, they will see a 40x ROAS and be like, what? That's incredible. And then they'll go on and watch some more, most likely.

So it works really well for us. But here are some other examples because obviously lots of different types of businesses can use this. Here's what I came up with.

See how this client added 100k of value to their home with our solar panels. Trying to sell solar panels. One of the benefits might be that increases the value of the property.

That could be a hook to be like, wow, really? It could add 100k to the value of a property and they only cost, you know, 15 or 10 or whatever they cost, right? That sounds great.

Here's another example. How this Texan mum lost £50 in six months without exercising. Now, on the face of it, that sounds like an outstanding result.

In six months, £50. She's a mum, so there's implied there that she's busy, doesn't have much time, etc, etc. And again, that would be, that's kind of combining a few different ones.

You've got the outstanding result in there and you're also using the location-based callout and you're using the descriptor of where someone is in life, the fact that they're a mum. So you're kind of combining a whole bunch there. And once I go through these, you'll start to think through these of examples of ads and even ad headlines and things that you see and you go, oh yeah, they're using that and that and that and that, like the example that I just gave there.

So obviously these results need to be true. You don't want to get in trouble for making false claims. But if you can add these in and hopefully you've been able to produce some fantastic results for your customers, clients, etc.

And then you can absolutely go ahead and add in examples like that and they can do really well. I've got people going, wow, really? How?

I want to know how that's possible. How are those results possible? And therefore they consume more.

Okay, so hooks don't just need to use words. They can use visuals as well. And I'm going to get into that in a second.

Before I do, I'm going to quickly let you know about Facebook Ads Mastery. So Facebook Ads Mastery is my brand new course with school community. So it's exclusive material, not out on YouTube or anywhere else, and that you can get access to.

It's literally the training stuff that we use now to train new staff to get fantastic results for our clients. So it's our best possible material showing you how to get the best possible results with Facebook and Instagram ads. Like I said, it comes with a school community.

There's over 600 business owners just like you in there that you can connect with and ask questions of. Myself and my team are in there all the time answering questions, providing feedback to ads. We do live calls and live trainings.

So basically just trying to provide as much value as you possibly can to make sure everyone gets the best results possible. It costs just £97 per month. There is a link in the description.

You can click on that, go through and check it out. And hopefully I'll see you on the inside. Okay, so like I just said, hooks don't need to just use words.

They can use visuals as well. And the best hooks are going to combine words like a call out with more specific visuals. Okay, now we always need to be conscious of Meta's advertiser policies, because there are some things you can do to grab attention with visuals that Meta's not going to like.

There's a reason why when you're scrolling through Facebook and Instagram, you don't see Facebook video ads start with people doing this a lot, right? Just going mad or doing something, because Meta's not going to like that. That's seen as too much, even if it would help from a marketing standpoint, by the way, if you could be that overt with your movement.

But we can still do certain things that do grab attention. And that's one of the most important things of a hook is to grab attention. And that's, I think, often the call out, the words used is going to do more of the getting someone to go, oh yes, that's me, I'm going to find out more.

The visuals is more about attention grabbing, and that's kind of how I think about it often. Although the visuals can look to do both, and we'll go through some examples. So if we've got attention grabbing visuals or things we can do to grab more attention.

Bright colours. Now that sounds super basic, right? But if I'm wearing a bright red t-shirt, as opposed to like a navy one like I am now, then that's going to grab more attention in a video ad.

And you'll see that a lot of my ads, I am wearing a bright red t-shirt for exactly that reason. So that's just a really simple way of making something more colourful to grab more attention. Can you use a more colourful background?

Sometimes yes, sometimes you can't. If you have options, something that just stands out more. There's kind of a trend, and this is happening more and more, and I've done this to some extent, where you record your video ads in nature, where the background is quite spectacular.

Again, it's an attention grabber, right? It might not be applicable to your product or service. I mean, I'm selling Facebook ads related stuff.

Sometimes when I'm out for a walk with my dog, and I walk in, you know, beautiful Cotswold Hills, and I have like a fun background, and it's like, it's just to help grab people's attention. So clothing, I talked about background, even hair colour. You may or may not want to dye your hair.

I'm certainly not going to dye it anytime soon. But there are things you can do to make things more odd, more unusual, more bright, and stand out more clearly. Movement.

You can't do this at the beginning of a Facebook video ad, but you could have someone just sitting in a chair and getting started. You could have them walking. Again, a lot of my video ads, I'm going to be walking because there's not only then the interesting background, there's then the movement, which helps as well.

There are different ways you can implement movement. You could do that with the editing. You could move the camera.

A few different ways of doing it. I've got some video ads live right now where I'm like sat at my laptop, and then I'm calling my cameraman over, who then walks with the camera to come over. That's creating a lot of movement, but it's that initial like, yeah, yeah, come over here, come over, check this out.

That movement helps. Now the next one, and this is a great way to grab attention, even if it sounds quite basic, and that is attractive people. More attractive people get more attention than less attractive people.

And it can be awkward. I've reviewed so many Facebook video ads. It can be awkward to say to a business owner, I don't think it should be you in these video ads.

Oh, okay. Either because you could find someone much more attractive, or someone much more charismatic, and much more comfortable on camera. Some people just aren't naturally very good at that, and it'd be very difficult for them to develop that skill.

And you think, look, we could hire an actor to do this for you, find someone much more attractive. It won't cost a lot of money. And I think you're going to get significantly better results.

Because attractive people, they just get more attention. We all know that's true. Markets have used that forever.

And it is what it is. So if that means that you're hiring someone else to do your video ads instead of you being in there, that's absolutely fine. From a business standpoint, I do think it's also better to not have that tied up with the business owner.

If you ever want to sell your business, it's very difficult. If you're the one in all the ads, you're going to have some sort of ongoing commitment there. And you don't want it to be constrained by you all the time, unless you've built your business around a personal brand, which we have in my case, therefore I'm in all my ads.

But it is very useful if you don't have that, if you're like an eCommerce business, for example, to be able to use lots of different people that aren't always you allows you to create more ads. And it means that you're not the bottleneck. Okay, so the absolute master level of using attractive people in your Facebook video ads is to combine that with using an influencer.

So a lot of influencers are attractive people, not exclusively, but they are. But if you can combine the two, so it's a more attractive person, which is going to get more attention. But also if it's an influencer, someone that your target market knows about, those are nearly always the scenarios where we see the absolute best hooks, best performing hooks, best hook rates are when we've got an influencer in the video ads.

And we know that that's a scroll stopper. Someone goes, they recognize that person, they go, oh, and they check it out purely because of the person in there. Now, of course, you could combine that with them using the call out method within their hook as well to really grab someone's attention.

And then they're far more likely to consume the content, far more likely to convert, purchase, become a lead, etc. I've actually got a whole separate video about using that as a creative strategy. I'll include a link in the video description.

Right, so those are the attention grabbers. There's other things we need to talk about when it comes to the visuals in your hook. The next thing is we've got the setting.

So you want the setting to make sense. And again, speak to your ideal prospect. So if you are selling to dentists, it'd be a really good idea to record the video ad in a dental practice.

It's just immediately going to speak to those people. They're going to almost subconsciously, but obviously also consciously, if they give it any thought, think this is for me, and you're likely to improve your performance. You know, if you're selling meal prep, I think is one of the examples we gave previously to busy mums, do that in a domestic kitchen, potentially with, you know, kids kicking off in the background and all sorts to make things difficult.

That is the right setting to sell that product or service. And you want your audience to immediately identify with the scene, with the setting, they're more likely to a consume it and then be convert if you do. Likeness.

This is an important one. People are more likely to watch content from people that look sound, act like them. They're also more likely to buy from ads that include people that look sound and act like them.

And they simply do that because if someone is of a similar age, same gender, looks like they have other elements of their life that are similar, let's say, you know, you're someone who's in quite good physical shape and the other person, the person in the ad is in quite good physical shape, you immediately think they're like me. Therefore, if they have got a solution to a problem that applied to their life, it's also a lot more likely to apply to my life. If you try to sell a product aimed at young women, for example, and you've got an older man in your video ads, it's just obviously not going to do as well.

And you can break that down to be really quite specific. Now that does mean if you have multiple customer avatars, like your product service has quite broad appeared and you're like, well, someone who kind of looks sounds acts like this would be interested, but also someone who looks sounds like this is interested. Absolutely fine.

Use different people within your video ads and create a whole bunch of different versions. And you can have multiple avatars and you'll see like businesses that often have their products, services have broad appeal, the ones that you see on TV commercials and things like that, that have really large budgets, and they will have lots of different types of people within their ads. Likeness is really important.

Okay, so the next thing that we need to think about when it comes to our hooks are what actions are taking place within those first few seconds. You know, we've got all the various things, other things lined up, but we want the actions that people are taking to make sense. So we used the example earlier of, let's say it's a business that sells some sort of dog training related thing, right?

And one of the problems that they address, one of the things they have a solution for is someone can't walk their dog in the park because of reactivity. They're sort of reacting negatively to all the other dogs. If at the beginning of your Facebook video ad, you have footage of a dog being reactive in a park and that causing issues.

Ventan! Oh Jesus Christ! Ventan!

That is going to resonate with someone that has that as a problem and they are more likely to pay attention, particularly if you combine that with some of the other things that we might want to include in our hooks, like call outs, and they're thinking, well, this is exactly for me. I have that problem. I can see it taking place in this ad.

They're more likely to consume it, more likely to purchase and become a lead. Okay? You know, other examples might be you could have someone in, let's say you're a local business, you could have them walking past a local landmark or, you know, I've seen ads local to me recently that do this really well.

And again, if someone lives in that place, they're going to be like, oh look, that's just, you know, that's just down the road. That's where such and such is. Oh, they're far more likely to pay attention because of the action that's taking place.

You're walking past interacting with something local that the people can see. So you can use those options that we've discussed to create tons of hook variations, particularly when you start combining various elements from different types. I mean, literally hundreds, thousands of different hook variations.

So here's what I recommend you do. When you next record your video ads, record like the meat of the ad, the core content of the ad, but then record a whole bunch of extra hooks and then add in the different hooks in editing to create sort of different ad variations and then test them. So you've got basically the same core ad, but maybe with 10 different hooks that you then run as an experiment.

And if you do that and you do that repeatedly, you'll quickly get a sense of which hooks work best for my market, which perform best. And like I said, because that is the most important part of the ad, if you can get those bits performing really well and performing well, that is such high leverage because so many more people watch the rest of the ad and then you're likely to get many more conversions, sales, leads, whatever it is you're looking for. It can be a complete game changer when it comes to your return on ad spend.

I'd also recommend that, you know, come up with all the options, go through what I just discussed, see what you can produce, but keep an eye on other people's ads, because every now and then you will see something you think that is such a good hook. I am definitely going to use that in my business. So I think it's natural for people to even advertisers to skip a lot of ads or, or not really pay attention.

It's like if something's, you know, particularly if you can see that it's obviously been running as an ad for a long time, because there's tons and tons of social proof on it, so it's clearly working, and you can be like, oh yeah, really interesting what they did is they're hooked there. Could I do that? Yes, I actually could.

Let's go ahead and implement something like this. Now I know this sounds like quite a bit of extra work, right? Adding in all these hooks and creating lots of different ad variations.

I actually think in some ways this can be less work than creating five whole different Facebook video ads. You create like three video ads and then 20 different hooks because the hooks are so quick and easy and short to record and the editing afterwards shouldn't be that, that difficult. But in terms of what's the best bang for your buck, I think that because this has such an impact on your performance and actually doesn't take that much extra time to create a whole bunch of hooks, this is right at the top of the list for me in terms of priorities and things that I would work on even if you have limited time to work on your Facebook and Instagram ads.

Now I mentioned at the beginning of the video about hook rate as a specific metric that we will track. So let me quickly show you how to actually go ahead and do that. Okay, so to show you how to do this, I'm just jumped into a quick example Facebook ad account.

I'm in ads manager and there's no campaigns in here because it's an example ad account. But you've got this column section here. So you've got columns and then you've got default options.

But what you can do is go down to the bottom and then you can customize columns to display various metrics that you specifically want to track. Now hook rate is not one that Meta provides by default and hook rate very simply explain what it is. It is the number of three second video views divided by the total number of impressions.

That's how you work it out, right? So we can create this even though Meta doesn't provide it. So we can do this thing called create custom metric up here.

And then we can call this literally hook rate. There may well be other options in this example ad account because I use this to demonstrate things all the time. And then we select the metric, right?

So I want three second, uh, it should pop up. No, it hasn't. Uh, let's go with video views.

There we go. Three second video plays. And then we're going to divide that by impressions.

Okay. So we've got three second video views divided by impressions. Basically what percentage of people that saw the ad made it through the three seconds, how many were hooked?

Hence hook rate. Okay. Uh, we can access, you know, you can just add a description who can access this only you, whatever, whatever, whatever.

Anyway, create metric. Okay. And now what we can do is we've got this hook rate new in here and we can add that in.

If we just tick the box next to it, you'll see down the bottom here beneath all these other various pieces of information, we've got hook rate new, and we can go ahead and drag that higher up. That's how we go about creating it. We can click apply.

Now there's no campaigns in here, so it's not going to show you that, but let me just show you an ad account with this as an example. Okay. So here's one of our ad accounts that has actually got video ads running that are retargeting ads for our Facebook ads mastery, uh, of course, for the community that I already mentioned.

So we've got these three ads, um, at the top here, and we've got this hook rate information. So we've got this one is a 16% hook rate. This one's got a 14% and that one's at 11%.

I could go back into the hook rate metric and just change, you know, the 0.11 to a percentage and display it that way. But you know, either way, same thing, right? Um, so you can actually track this, right?

So you can have different ads, different hook rates. You can test and you can see alongside obviously your cost per result and your return on ad spend. And often they will correlate, right?

The higher the hook rate, the better results will be not always, because especially if there are different ads, um, you know, if you've got the same core of the ad, but with different hooks, then the better hook rate nearly always results in better results. But if you've got different like body of the video ad, um, then you can have variation there, but you can track this and you can see, wow, this hook gets an 18% hook rate. This hook only a 6% hook rate.

This one a 14% hook rate. And you can use that information to go about optimizing your campaign. So just a quick thing you can do within ads manager to create this custom conversion and go about doing it that way.

Now, once you've got your hook rate up and your Facebook ad results have improved significantly because of it, you're going to want to scale. And if that's the case, I strongly recommend you check out this video, because in that video, I walk you through my favorite scaling strategy, the easiest way to scale Facebook and Instagram ads successfully without breaking them whilst maintaining a really good return on ad spend. So go ahead and check it out.
