Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to get Instagram followers with Facebook ads and Instagram ads. Now this is something that people have asked me about quite a lot and they said how do you go about running Facebook ad campaigns, Instagram ad campaigns to get Instagram followers because it's not as straightforward as you might think. So I've been doing some experimentation over the last couple of months and I found some strategies, some tips that work really well in terms of getting Instagram followers with ads and that's what I'm going to share in this video.

So I think you'll find it useful and before I get into that I want to quickly mention that at the end of this video I'm going to be talking about a couple of free Facebook and Instagram marketing resources that I think you're going to find very very interesting so make sure you stick around to the end of the video to hear about those. With that said let's get into it. So here I am inside Facebook ads manager, I'm inside an example ad account and we're going to go about putting a campaign together.

I'm going to show you the steps putting a campaign together to get you Instagram followers. Now the first thing I'll say is that there isn't a campaign type, a campaign objective specifically for Instagram followers like there is with Facebook page likes. So if you want to get lots of Facebook page likes, it's relatively straightforward.

You run a Facebook page like campaign and you use that campaign objective and then Facebook will put your ad in front of people that are most likely to like your page. It's a very very effective way of getting Facebook page likes. That doesn't exist for Instagram followers.

There is no Instagram followers campaign objective so you have to get a little bit more creative and that's what that's what I've had to do and that's what I've worked out here. By the way I will include a link in the video description to that video on Facebook page likes if you also want to grow your Facebook presence and get a whole bunch of likes on that platform as well. Okay so what we're going to do is we're going to create a Facebook ad campaign.

We're obviously going to run it on Instagram. We want Instagram followers so Instagram is going to be the placement option that we choose to use that makes the most sense keep them within the app and let's go ahead and give this a go. So I'm going to create a let's just get rid of that.

I'm going to create a example campaign. I'm going to switch to quick creation by the way so that's guided creation. I prefer quick creation for all sorts of reasons but that's just a personal preference.

So what we're going to do is we're going to call this example Instagram followers campaign. We are going to leave buying type as auction and we're going to use campaign objective as traffic. Now because there's no way we can track the conversion event that we're after so the conversion event we're after is someone following us on Instagram.

We can't track that within our Facebook ad account okay so because of that we can't use the conversion objective and we can't optimize specific event. What we're going to have to do is select traffic, send as many people to our Instagram profile as possible and hope that those people, a proportion of them, go on to follow you on Instagram. That does happen by the way.

As I said I've been experimenting with this I've proven that it does work so that does happen but that's why we're going to use the traffic objective. Campaign budget optimization leave on we're probably just going to start with the one ad set and daily budget just set to whatever it is you're comfortable with and then I'm just going to give this oh you know what I'll call it example ad set because I'm going to add some stuff in there in a bit an example ad and let's save that to draft. Okay so the campaign level is taken care of we've got the right campaign objectives selected, CBO turned on, auction boom, nothing more we need to do.

Now we can go to the ad set level and the first we need to work out here, you can scroll past all this sort of stuff and get down to audiences. First thing we need to do here is work out who do we want to target okay what's the best audience to target. Now in my experience I've tested a whole bunch of different audiences the best audience to target is a one percent lookalike audience based off of people that already interact with your business on Instagram.

Basically your existing Instagram followers if you can advertise and put an ad in front of people that are just like them those people are highly likely to follow on Instagram as well your cost per follow as it were is going to be much less advertising to those people than other groups and that's what I found to work best. So let's go ahead and get that set up so click on as manager up here then select audiences and I'm going to show you how to create that one percent lookalike audience I mentioned. So you want to click create audience, custom audience and then you want to come here to Instagram business profile that's the Facebook source we want to create the custom audience from and then I'm going to go ahead and use everyone who engaged with your business in the last 365 days unless you've already got thousands and thousands of Instagram followers tens of thousands hundreds thousand Instagram followers you want to leave this very broad because you want the custom audience to be as large as possible the larger the custom audience the more accurate the subsequent lookalike audience will be when that lookalike audience is built off that custom audience because it gives Facebook more data you know if Facebook are trying to find the ideal prospect for you if they have 5,000 people in the audience it's going to really help versus 500 got more data to do it with okay so you can see there are more specific criteria here so people who visited your profile engage with an ad send you a message very very specific um but I'm going to go with everyone who engaged with Instagram and I'm going to do in the last 365 days which is the maximum time span as well so I'm going to call this uh Instagram oh let's let's call them it's not followers it's not accurate Instagram engages 365 okay people who've engaged with my business on Instagram within the last 365 days and then you can see the option here create a lookalike audience that's exactly what I want to do so the custom audience have been popped in there now where do you want to create this lookalike audience okay that's a really big question now if you just want Instagram followers in the sort of country that you operate in or the countries that you operate in which makes a lot of sense obviously go about putting those in here so for example I could put in you know United Kingdom in here I could go ahead and create a one percent lookalike just off that I could also add in um you know United States um Australia Canada Canada those are sort of major countries that we do business in as a Facebook ads agency the majority we have clients in some other countries but the majority of our clients come from those four countries so I could go ahead and select that if that's what I wanted to do um you could also really broaden out where you want your lookalike audience to apply or you could even look to broaden this out significantly um if you add in let's say some less expensive countries to advertise in that are English speaking so that would be countries like um India Pakistan um Philippines you know these sorts of countries where you can get the CPMs cost per thousand impressions are much lower you can get followers for a much lower price and if all you want is as many followers as possible um for the lowest price possible then that's what I'd recommend really broaden this out I mean you could add in a load of African countries that are English speaking I mean I'm assuming you're creating ads in English of course so you want to pick English speaking countries but you know you can add in a load of less expensive locations to really get you as many followers as possible if you're looking to get followers in a country like India and they're probably going to cost you 10 to 20 percent as much as followers in countries like the UK the US etc okay so that just really depends on on your strategy if you're really looking to build a profile and you want the credibility of having a large Instagram following that's important to you go ahead and broaden it out if you really want these people to become potential customers of yours and you know that your customers are far more likely to come from certain countries certain locations then narrow it down and go ahead and just select the the countries that you operate in the most okay then you can go ahead and click create audience now that obvious that audience is populating it's going to take a little bit of time to uh you know to do so to go through the process usually takes Facebook about 30 minutes but then we can go ahead and use that audience which is absolutely fantastic so now we can jump back over into ads manager and go back into our campaign so here we have our example Instagram followers campaign we just created if I click into the campaign level I'm taking to the ad set level let's go ahead and edit this okay so let's scroll down to the audiences section and here we want to pop in our here we go our look alike based one percent look alike for Australia Canada US UK one percent Instagram engages 365 now one thing I'll quickly mention about that look-alike audience is that if you just operate on a local basis and you want all your Instagram followers to be within that geographical area firstly you're probably going to paying quite a bit more per follower so just be aware of that and secondly um you're going to want a much larger look-alike audience so go with a 10 percent look-alike audience okay you may have seen that that one percent look-alike audience across the four countries was 3.3 million people but if you're just based in one city let's say plus 20 miles or something like that you're going to want to make that audience as large as possible because obviously the people within that location there's far far far fewer than there is across all those countries I just listed okay so just a quick note if you're a local business to make sure that you do that okay whenever you're adding in a a local a look-alike audience obviously you want to make sure you add in your location so we've got the UK in there we obviously want the United States we want Canada um and what was the other one Australia okay so we've got those four locations added in there whenever you're using a look-alike audience you can keep age gender completely open Facebook is going to know based on the data that you've given them that if you know females age 35 to 45 are most likely to follow on Instagram or males aged 18 to 23 are most likely to follow on Instagram Facebook's going to know that from your lookalike audience and that's what they're going to primarily target so you don't have to worry about adding in criteria you also make you don't want to add in any detailed targeting criteria either don't go and narrow this audience down further keep it nice and broad okay give Facebook a lot of leeway connections you don't have to worry about automatic placement is not something we're going to use so we're going to go ahead and select manual placements we're obviously going to get rid of everything that's not Instagram you can run ads on Facebook get people to go over to your Instagram profile and try and get them to follow you there from what I found I have tested that a little bit it just didn't work the cost per follow was much more expensive than obviously advertising on Instagram which is not surprising in the slightest you want Instagram followers advertise on Instagram and now what I'm going to recommend that you do is get rid of Instagram explore get rid of Instagram feed and just go with stories now I've tested this so I've tested feed by itself against stories by itself and stories perform significantly better it not only performed better in getting a lower cost per click so it cost me less to get someone to my Instagram profile but it also when I tested that and took all of the numbers these people were slightly more likely to follow me as well which is fantastic so very very limited placement options for this type of campaign but that's what you want to do you just want to go ahead and use Instagram stories scrolling down there's nothing else we need to do link clicks absolutely fine that's all we can optimize for okay and that's your ad set setup now we want to click into the ad the third and final option and what I'm going to do here instead of creating an ad from scratch I'm going to show you the ads that I've run and so you can take a look at those so I've got those up in another tab so here we go we have here an ad that was run and so you can see the okay so let's talk about the rest of the ad and then let's get into creative so we have oh one quick thing to note up here Instagram account just make sure that your Instagram account is in there and by the way if you're watching this video go ahead and follow me on Instagram Ben Heath marketing I release videos a few times a week short little ones that give you Facebook and Instagram marketing tips I'll include a link in the video description below okay and then in the primary text I have absolutely nothing when you're running just a stories ad there's no real advantage to having much in the primary text I mean it would appear down here next to the learn more button but it's what's in the video that's going to grab people's attention okay now the website URL very very important this is as you can see instagram.com forward slash benheathmarketing that is my Instagram profile so you want to grab the link to your Instagram profile and pop it in there because when people click on this learn more button down here they're going to be taken to my Instagram account and you'll see in a second when we get to this I'm basically telling them why they should follow me display link is left blank learn more I haven't done a lot of testing on the call to action I'm pretty sure learn more is what's going to perform best so that's what I go ahead and use you could test a few different options um but bearing bear in mind that when it comes to testing um variables with a an ad campaign that's trying to get you Instagram followers it's very difficult to work out exactly what delivers the results because all you can track is link clicks you can't track who actually goes on to follow so I ended up doing things like I'd run one option for a few days see what the results were like run another option for a few days see what the results were like because of course just because you get a lower cost per click with one option doesn't mean those people are going on to follow so you need that time difference to be able to tell those difference if that makes sense if you see what I'm saying so I for example when I ran the feeds as the only option the Instagram feed is the only option I ran that for four days how many followers did I get right then the next four days ran it with just going to stories how many followers did I get okay stories significantly beat feeds and that's how you can run those sorts of experiments so just be aware that when you want to test things like oh I'll test the learn more button versus something else it's not as straightforward to be able to test that with this option because Facebook doesn't have an Instagram followers campaign objective yet hopefully they do in the future but we will see everything else can be left as is very very simple ad let's have a look at the ad creative itself so starting again now hi my name is Ben Heath I'm the CEO of Lead Guru which is a social media marketing agency that generates millions of dollars every year with Facebook advertising and Instagram ad campaigns if you want

introducing myself I'm the CEO of Lead Guru which is a social media marketing agency that generates millions of dollars every year with Facebook advertising and Instagram ad campaigns so this is who I am this is what I'm about I'm the CEO of a social media marketing agency you should follow me because I know what I'm talking about we generate millions of dollars every year in revenue from Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns if that's something that's interesting interesting to you if you would like to know how to do that yourself go ahead and follow me and I tell them exactly how to do it click on the learn more button um in fact I can't remember exactly what I said here let's just wait for it to come around uh yeah if you want to see how we do it make sure you follow me on Instagram just click the link below basically the button and I'll take you to my profile and I'll talk to you soon very very simple I've just recorded this out walking on a dog walk as you'll see I record videos doing that every now and then very easy way to just grab my phone and do it um the vertical profile also works well on uh with with a for Instagram stories that you can record on your phone and that's it so I tested that as an option and then I've got another one here um so all the other videos are exactly the same but I took a little bit of a different approach instead of just saying this is what I'm about come and follow me which I'd recommend you test I did this instead it's gonna start again hi my name is Ben Heath and if you want to see how my company Lead Guru generates millions of dollars every year with Facebook ads and Instagram ads go ahead and download my free five-part Facebook ad template you can find it in my Instagram profile just click the link below make sure you follow me whilst you're there and grab it so you can see I've taken a little bit of a different approach there very very similar in terms of I'm out walking you know the dog with a phone just quick 15 second video recording but instead of saying we generate millions of dollars therefore you should follow me because I'm going to give you content instead I say why not download my free five-part Facebook ad template to see some of our best performing ads and how we've been able to achieve those fantastic results I'm giving them something free that they can then they have to go through to my Instagram profile and then my Instagram profile in the link that you're allowed to put in it is a download of my free five-part Facebook ad template so if you go and check out my Instagram profile it said link will be included in the description you'll see it just there you can go ahead and download that if you want as well something I'd recommend doing and but it's giving something free and what I actually found interestingly is that this second option slightly outperformed this first option here only a little bit not massively it wasn't groundbreaking but slightly outperformed it okay so this is the one that that has been run more um if you have a free lead magnet or something like that then great go ahead and try putting it in an Instagram stories ad like this give that a go if you don't the first option is absolutely fine and you can absolutely model from these ads and use them for your specific industry in any way that you want okay so um you know if you're a health and fitness expert or uh you know a sales coach or whatever it happens to be why do people want to follow you what value are they going to get what have you done what can you show them how to do that's what you want to very quickly get across in your Instagram stories ad as it's 15 seconds long my recommendation would be to record a whole bunch of these they take so little time you can do it you know with a sort of nice video setup like I've kind of got now with a background and all that sort of stuff or you can just do it out on a walk um like I've done here you can keep it very very simple and straightforward okay what results did this get so as I said I'm you know I can go back into my facebook ad account show you the data but it doesn't really mean a huge amount because as I said you can't track cost per follow what I found is that let's take this option because this one performs slightly better when I was targeting countries like UK US Australia Canada um I could still work out what my cost per follow was because I could work out how much I'd spent and then how many followers I'd got um it cost me about 20p so about 25 cents if you're operating in US dollars per follower okay which you might think is relatively expensive I mean I have two two and a half thousand followers not a huge amount um I probably generated over a thousand of those with this strategy as I said I've been experimenting with it um so if you wanted a thousand Instagram followers and you're advertising those markets you might be looking at let's say 200 250 to get that now you might think that's really expensive if that's the case and you want a couple thousand followers 5 000 followers 10 000 followers go ahead and open it up to those less expensive countries when I added in countries you can see I've tested it here worldwide when I've added in countries like India and the Philippines and some African countries that cost per follow came down to about 4 p 5 cents so significantly less about 20 percent um I barely ran that I just wanted to see how it would perform because um to be able to tell you guys in this sort of video it's not something that I want you know my Instagram profile to be full of people that are from those countries because I know they're very unlikely to go ahead and use our services but that's in terms of cost what you can expect if Facebook do bring out a Instagram followers campaign objective I would expect that to come down enormously okay and different industries will have lower costs I mean I'm talking about social media marketing which is probably about average um I'd have thought as I said if you're anything to do with nutrition health and fitness industries where there's way way more people that are interested in that that cost is going to come down a lot in comparison to what um I've been able to achieve here but hopefully that's useful that is a viable way to get some Instagram followers so if you're looking at your profile and you've got 55 followers and you think oh that's just embarrassing that's not going to do anything for my business I'd like to have 500 600 1500 5000 you can run ad campaigns in order to acquire them um it may work out actually being a lot cheaper in terms of you know if you put a value on your time than trying to do it organically which as we all know is very very difficult to do okay hopefully that's been useful before you go something I'll quickly mention and that's a free webinar I created called three killer Facebook advertising strategies to double or more your business now I call them Facebook advertising strategies but obviously as I'm sure you'll appreciate when you run a Facebook ad campaign Instagram is often included in that as well and this webinar basically breaks down three different strategies that we've used for our clients we generated more than a million dollars with all three they perform incredibly well very much tried and tested and I break down each three of these strategies so I explain what we you know exactly how they work I show you how they work why they work I also explain which type of business wants to use which one which is very very important you know if you sell a 30 dollar product you've got to advertise that differently to a ten thousand dollar service so explain all that in this webinar it's completely free link in the video
