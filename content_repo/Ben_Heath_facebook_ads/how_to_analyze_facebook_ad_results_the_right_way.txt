Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to analyse your Facebook ad results. I'm going to show you which metrics you need to track, you need to keep an eye on and what data you should base your adjustments and the optimisation of your campaigns around to help you get better performance. Now before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash a like on this video, click that like button and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and you haven't done so already, that would be very much appreciated.

Okay so Facebook ads analysis, how do you analyse your results, how do you improve performance? Let's get into it. So I'm in an example Facebook ad account right now and what I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly create an example Facebook ad campaign and then I'm going to bring up the various metrics and data points that you need to pay attention to, when you should pay attention to them, when you should make adjustments and decisions based on what you see and cover that sort of stuff.

Now I want to quickly say that you know Facebook ad campaign analysis is not that difficult, it's not as difficult as most people make it out to be. Facebook ads manager looks very overwhelming, looks very complicated and it can be but if you know what to focus on and know what you can ignore it becomes a lot more straightforward. So hopefully that's what I'm going to do for you guys in this video.

So I'm just going to call this example ad campaign. I'm going to change the campaign objective to conversions. Now the campaign objective you select is going to dictate which metrics you should track, the data that's displayed and all that sort of stuff.

And that's why I'm going to go with conversions because then you're going to see the data that's far more representative of what it is that we're going to be going through. Okay, so there's our example conversions campaign. I'm going to minimize this and I'm going to keep looking at the campaign level.

So now of course Facebook's default is things like results etc etc. So the first metric and the single most important metric that you need to keep an eye on particularly when you're running a conversions campaign is your cost per result, your cost per conversion. If you're generating leads, what is your cost per lead?

If you're trying to generate purchases, what is your cost per purchase? And the first thing I'll say about that metric is that it's so important that if that is a good number for you, let's say your business can afford to pay $50 a lead and you're currently generating leads for $20, $22, none of the other metrics, none of the other points that you can analyze need to take place. You don't need to bother with any of that.

If your core metric, your cost per result, your cost per conversion, I shouldn't say cost per result because if you've got a different campaign objective your cost per result could be something else. If your cost per conversion is nicely profitable for your business, you know, if you can afford to pay up to $15 in terms of cost per purchase and you're generating purchase for $6, that's fantastic. And if that's the case, base all your decisions around cost per result.

So when you're assessing different targeting options, which one produces the best cost per conversion? When you're assessing different ads, which one produces the best cost per conversion? Pause the underperformers, go with the best performing ones and just base everything around cost per conversion.

Just ignore all the rest of it. You don't need to worry about that, at least not initially. Okay.

I'll explain that a bit more about that in a second, why that little caveat comes into place. It's when you're not really generating conversions or you're well above your acceptable cost per conversion, either generating leads, purchases, app installs, whatever happens to be. That's when you need to really focus on these other metrics and these other data points and make adjustments accordingly.

Okay. So I'm going to get into that in a second. So that's the first one, cost per conversion.

The second one, and this is why I caveated the you don't need to worry about anything else, is frequency. So I'm just going to quickly go ahead and change the columns to delivery. And you'll see this number in here, frequency.

Frequency refers to the number of times on average that a person within your target audience has seen an ad at this stage within the campaign. You'll also see that you can look at frequency at the ad set level. You can also look at frequency at the ad level.

Let's jump back to the campaign. Why is this important? So this is probably one of the only other metrics you need to track if your campaign is performing well.

If your campaign is delivering a great cost per conversion, this is probably one of the only things you need to keep an eye on. Otherwise, as I said, just base all your optimization decisions around cost per conversion. But of course, it sort of makes sense that once your frequency gets above a certain number, campaign performance is going to drop.

You know, if everyone in your target audience has already seen your ad a couple of times, well, they're not going to be bothered. They're going to take a look at it. They're just sort of going to mentally ignore it because they're going to go, oh, I've seen that.

Carry on scrolling. We want something else. Okay.

So frequency is an important number. What do we tend to see? We tend to see that with cold audiences.

So with people that have not interacted with your business before, when your frequency reaches a two, maybe even a 2.5 in that sort of range, that's when we start to see results drop off. Now, there are a bunch of things you can do to combat frequency, like creating new ads, targeting new audiences. And I'll include a link in the video description below to another video that talks all about how to combat ad frequency, high frequency numbers, and how you can do what you can do to combat ad fatigue and really get over those issues.

So there are solutions. But keep an eye on frequency. If it's with cold audiences, you start to get to see it like it's a 2.4, something like that.

Think, okay, I'm now going to need to make some changes. Otherwise, base everything around your cost per conversion, as I've mentioned. With warm audiences, so people on your email list, people who visited your website, stuff like that, you can usually get away with much higher frequency numbers.

What that is for you really depends on your business and actually how warm that audience is. So for example, someone in my Facebook group very much follows the content that I produce on average. I can probably get away with frequency numbers above 10.

Other businesses might struggle with warm audience frequency numbers above a 6. I've seen some campaigns can have warm audience frequency numbers go above 20 and a still campaign still does very well. So what I recommend with your warm audiences is just keep a real close eye on what that frequency is in relation to your results.

So when you start to see your results drop off from your warm audience, and they usually drop off quite quickly when they do it, then go, aha, my frequency is an eight. My results in my warm audience are really starting to turn off. I've got ad fatigue, I've got a frequency issue, I need to do something about it.

Okay, so that's one of the most important metrics to track is frequency. Okay, let's go back into, I don't want to get a breakdown. No, let's get back into performance, which is the default.

The next thing I'm going to talk about, and this again now, we're getting into the realms of your campaign is not delivering, and this is the stuff you want to track, because otherwise, as we've already talked about, you want to be basing on cost per conversion exclusively. But let's say your cost per conversion is way too high. You're thinking, right, well, I need to get into this now, I need to analyse the various elements and work out what's going wrong.

So what I want you to do is break down effectively your sales funnel. So we've got here default is performance. One thing I want to do is I want to go to performance and clicks.

And then you'll see here that at the end, you're going to get a bunch of data in here, one of which is going to be link clicks and cost per link click specifically. Why is that important? I don't want you to optimise for the lowest cost per link click.

That's what a traffic campaign is. And as we know, traffic campaigns do not deliver as good results as conversion campaigns, the vast majority of the time. So I don't want you to go in here and think, oh, let's pause these ads with lower link click, more expensive link clicks, let's pause these audiences with more expensive link clicks, etc, etc.

That's not how I want to do about it. What I want you to do is take a look at the ratio between your link clicks and your conversion rate. So let's assume you're sending people through to a sales page and you're generating tonnes and tonnes of link clicks, but very, very few conversions.

What does that tell me? That tells me there's probably something wrong with your sales page. The ad campaign was doing its job.

It was getting people, it's getting people interested in the ad, it was sending people through to the website, people who are likely to purchase, but they're not purchasing because the sales page is not doing the work that you want it to do. What would be a low conversion rate from link clicks to purchase or link clicks to leads? Well, that very much depends on what it is that you're offering.

If you're trying to advertise a lead magnet and get people to opt in for an email list, you probably want a conversion rate from link clicks to email opt-ins that's at least 20%, ideally something in the 40% range, something really, really high. If you're an e-commerce business and you are start and you are sending people through to your website to make a direct purchase, if your conversion rate from link clicks to purchase is less than, let's say, 2%, you've probably got an issue. You want to be in that sort of 2% to 5% range, ideally.

So it really depends on what you're advertising and you're going to have to work that out for your business specifically. The way I do that is I'd look across all your various campaigns, things you've done on Facebook, perhaps look at other sources, you know, what's the conversion rate from other sources and try and find, work out what it should be. Potentially even contact people in your industry.

Ask, you've got friends that offer similar things, ask them what their conversion rates are on their sales pages, on their landing pages. Because as I said, if you're an e-commerce business and you're converting at half a percent, so you need to send 200 people to your website to get a purchase, you're in trouble. That's not going to work.

That sales page probably needs some work doing to it. Perhaps you need some testimonials, perhaps you need some more benefits about the product, perhaps you need an explainer video, all sorts of things you can do, but just analyse the various elements. Okay, so that's one thing I wanted to to highlight if your campaign isn't delivering and something that we definitely track is your link click to conversion ratio on your Facebook ad campaigns.

Now, something that's kind of related to that, but I'm going to have to customise my columns to bring this up, is specifically to do with e-commerce. I'm going to go through, add these in and explain what they are. So I'm going to add in my add to cart, add to cart even.

Let's go with total and let's go with cost. And you see that when you add, by the way, if you're not familiar with customising columns, you can do exactly what I just did. Come in, you can add in all sorts of different data and metrics points.

So I'm going to get rid of these extra ones. I just want to have a look at my total add to cart, my cost per add to cart. I'm also going to do the same with purchases.

Now, if you're running a conversions campaign and you're optimising for purchases, this purchase data will be displayed in your columns anyway. So you won't need to specifically do what I'm doing, but it doesn't hurt to show you how to do this. Right.

So I'm going to apply this. Now at the end, we've got here, add to cart, cost per add to cart, purchases and cost per purchase. This happens quite a lot with e-commerce businesses where we will see very high add to carts, but not many purchases.

And this is a really important piece of analysis to do on your Facebook ad campaigns. An important data point to track is that if you are seeing tons of add to carts, but not many purchases. So let's say you're seeing 10 add to carts for every purchase.

That's too many. You're always going to have more add to carts than you are purchased, but it shouldn't be a 10 to 1 ratio or anything close to that. If you see that sort of data, you need to make an adjustment to something.

Usually your checkout page, potentially delivery fee. You know, if you're getting lots of add to carts and you're whacking on a big old delivery fee or telling people it's going to take them two or three weeks for them to have their thing delivered, that's really going to get in the way of people converting. And that's why your purchase might be very low.

So as I said, if you're running your campaign, you're happily going about things, you're seeing that your cost per purchase is just way off where it needs to be. This is where you need to get more detailed, more granular into what it is you're doing. If you see that actually your campaign's generating lots of adds to carts, that's good to know.

Generating lots of add to carts. That means the campaign is doing its job to a certain point, right? People are interested.

They're clicking. They're initiating checkout. They're adding to cart.

They're going through your sales process, but something's falling down. Perhaps it's your checkout page. Okay.

And I said, it could be delivery, it could be the design of it, it could be that something's not working even properly, or it's loading very slowly, all sorts of issues that really get in the way. So these are things to very much focus on and break down in a quite granular way. Another metric that you can see right here that I think is important to keep an eye on, again, if your campaigns just aren't doing well and you can't base things really around cost per conversion is your CPM.

CPM, as you can see, refers to cost per thousand impressions. CPM is how Facebook thinks of the cost of Facebook advertising. So when people will say like, will it be more expensive for me to advertise in the US versus for me to advertise in India?

In CPMs, absolutely. The US is going to be a much more expensive market to advertise in. But if you're selling an expensive product, in results, in cost per conversion, it might be less expensive to advertise in the US because of course, a much higher percentage of people may be able to afford your product or service because the average person in the US earns a much larger salary than the average person in India, for example.

Okay, so your actual cost per conversion may be much better. But when we talk about cost, we're talking about CPM. And when I'm sort of evaluating the cost of something when it comes to Facebook advertising, I'm talking about CPM, separate from conversions.

Okay, so just wanted to make that clear to start with. Right, what affects your CPM? Because that's how Facebook thinks in terms of cost.

One of the big, big, big things is basically how people are reacting to your ads. What used to be termed as the relevant score, but is now broken down into three different metrics, quality ranking, engagement ranking, etc, etc. And if your ads are not resonating very well with the target audience, perhaps it's annoying them, they're hiding your ad, they're not engaging with it, it's not grabbing their attention, they're not looking at it, they're not clicking on the links, they're not doing all that sort of stuff.

That's going to affect your, what used to be called relevant score, your quality ranking and things like that. And that is going to reduce, okay, off that, that is going to increase your CPM. Because Facebook rewards advertisers that put ads on their platform that people are interested in, that are engaging, that aren't annoying, and all that sort of stuff.

If they didn't, Facebook may get into trouble in terms of their ads are annoying their users so much their users stop using the platform. So Facebook is highly incentivized to reward advertisers that produce ads, that get lots of engagement, that people enjoy and all that sort of stuff. And one of the ways to express that, I mean, yes, you could, we could jump over to the ad level.

And here we go, you'll see, we could have a look at our quality ranking, our engagement ranking, conversion rate ranking, and that is important. I'll get into that in a second. But, where was I?

One of the great ways of seeing that in a specific number is your CPM. So what does this mean? Because certain places are much more expensive to advertise to, certain industries are much more expensive to advertise in.

You know, if you're advertising like premium insurance or high-end financial advisory services, and you're going after people with really high net worth, yeah, they're really expensive to advertise to because so is everyone else, right? So it's not really useful to take a look at your CPMs and be like, well, they're expensive in that case. What you want to look at in terms of CPMs is the difference between various elements in your campaign.

So which ad set, which targeting option is delivering a much higher CPM? If one's, let's say, at $40 CPM and other one's at $15 CPM, well, perhaps you should ignore the more expensive one. Again, with the caveat that your cost per conversion is the first thing you optimize around.

Perhaps you've got a bunch of different ads and some have much higher CPMs on than others. And you're trying to work out why. Maybe those ads aren't resonating, they're not landing, they're not delivering the sort of results that Facebook wants from an engagement standpoint, and therefore your CPM is much higher.

Perhaps pause those and look to create more ads that are similar to the best performers. So that's how we would use CPM. We'd use it as a relative tracking metric to assess how much Facebook is liking the various components within our campaign and pause the underformers and optimize accordingly.

As I said, if I jump to the ad level, you can see that you've got these three that used to be the ad relevance score that's sort of broken down, quality ranking, engagement rate ranking, conversion rate ranking. This is something that people pay a lot of attention to. I don't too much.

They don't really give you the, I just found it much easier with a relevant score, a number out of 10. Now they give you above average, below average, average, etc, etc. We've got all sorts of campaigns.

We've got campaigns that haven't worked, that had above average. We've got campaigns that are working incredibly well, that are below average. So I don't really pay attention to this too much.

Okay. And there are just a million other metrics that you could be tracking and things you could be basing your data around. But honestly, those are basically the things that we look at and that we pay attention to.

Sounds very simplistic, but to be honest, with Facebook advertising, with digital marketing, even with online business in general, simple usually works much better than overly complex. It really does. So just a quick recap.

You want to start with your cost per conversion. That's by far the most important thing. If that's good, you base all your decisions around that, nothing else.

Always keeping an eye on frequency. Very important. Facebook ad fatigue is a real thing and something you need to avoid and mitigate when it comes about.

And look at your conversion rate between your link clicks and your cost and your number of conversions. Where is that? What should that be?

Does that tell you that your landing page or sales page is not good enough? Take a look at the difference between ad to carts and purchases. Is there an issue with your checkout process?

You get lots of ad to carts for not purchases. There's something wrong there. Maybe it's not the Facebook ad campaign's fault.

Or maybe it is. Maybe you need to provide more proof in your Facebook ad. It may be the form of a testimonial or review.

Perhaps you need to get some more demonstration into a video, something along those lines. And then finally, your CPMs, right? So your cost per thousand impressions.

How much does Facebook like various components of your ad campaign? And how does that impact how much you're paying to reach people? And how does that impact how you should optimise your campaign?

So hopefully that's been useful. Before you go, a couple of three things I want to very, very quickly mention. The first is a webinar I've created called Three Killer Facebook Advertising Strategies to Double or More Your Revenue.
