Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about how many Facebook ad campaigns you should run at any one time. Something I've had a lot of questions about recently, people are looking to sort of structure not just a campaign itself but also their whole ad account and make it work. So that's what I want to cover in this video.

Before we're going to touch, I want to very quickly ask you to smash that like button, please click that thumbs up button, that would very much help me out and be much appreciated and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay, so I'm in an example Facebook ad account here and I'm going to talk through this process of how we approach this using some examples. Now, how many campaigns you have to some extent is obviously going to depend on the strategy that you use and before you get into the number of Facebook ad campaigns, it's very very important that you are very clear about what strategy or which two strategies for example you're going to use when it comes to Facebook advertising.

If you don't know that and you don't know what you should be using, I go ahead and check out a free webinar I've created called Three Killer Facebook Advertising Strategies to Double or More Your Revenue. There'll be a link in the video description below, go ahead and check that, it's completely free, 60-70 minutes long, you will be very very happy that you've watched that at the end of it if you don't know exactly what your strategy is going to be. I think that would be well worth your time to check that out.

But so obviously for example if you're going to use a lead magnet webinar campaign there's going to be a strategy there's going to be a couple of campaigns in there. If you use a direct offer strategy there's going to be a campaign in there. For the purpose of this video I'm going to use a direct offer strategy which assuming you are say a one product or a one service business under that strategy you would just go with the one campaign and that'll make a lot of sense when you go through that through that webinar.

Now so I'm going to assume that your starting point if you have one product or one service is one campaign and it we're going to expand from there and explain how that works. You obviously need to adjust that if you're using like a lead magnet strategy which naturally will have two campaigns and so just make sure you multiply whatever we go through by two if you're using that sort of process okay hopefully that makes sense. Now if you only offer one product or one product range I really like to keep things very simple and go with one campaign live at any one time.

So that might look like exactly what I've got set up in this example ad account here in this draft CBO campaign. Now people used to structure things where they'd have different campaigns and let's say one campaign and an ad set in each campaign and that's how you separate out a lot of your targeting options. I don't like doing that I like including the targeting options cold and warm in to one CBO campaign and allowing Facebook to divert budget according to performance okay.

So in this CBO campaign we would have say five ad sets maybe four cold audience ad sets a couple of those being look-alikes and then one warm audience ad set for retargeting. We'd include that in the one campaign. Now if you are offering very different products or noticeably different products or services that is where I would be looking to introduce multiple campaigns and here's why.

If you've got the one campaign and let's say you've got five ad sets and you've got you know a few ads in each ad set Facebook's going to optimize your campaign for the best results possible. One of the metrics is going to use to determine that if you're running a conversions campaign which again I'm going to assume you are for the the purpose of this video is what your cost per purchase or cost per lead is. Now yes they'll use ROAS return on ad spend and things like that which can help with including things in the one campaign but let's say for example you've got two different services one is and you're generating leads for both of them on your website okay so you are sending traffic to different landing pages two different services looking to generate leads to a conversions campaign on one and looking generate leads to a conversion campaign for the other.

If you've just got the one campaign for both of those services and one of those services is let's say a $50 service that's really easy people to quickly sign up for you're going to get really low cost per lead and then the other service is a much more expensive service perhaps it's you know $1,500 it's worth a lot lot more to your business you'd much rather have customers sign up for that but it's obviously much more involved you're going to get far less leads and leads are going to cost you more when you advertise because it's a much bigger ask. If you include both those offers basically within the same campaign or within the same ad sets Facebook is going to favour the offer that is much easier for people to sign up for that's got the lowest cost per lead. So that's why in those scenarios when you've got different products or different services I'd be looking to have one per campaign so the way I like to sort of would summarize it is I have one offer or product range per campaign and I go with the product range because you don't need to have a separate campaign if for example you're selling apparel and you're selling um jumpers and you've got 30 different jumpers that you sell and they're somewhat similar price points but they're just differing like design or or you know or colour or or something like that yeah you can include those all in one campaign and actually I'd recommend you do that because even if you have separate ads for each product which you may or may not do you may have carousels or catalogue sales whatever but if you do have separate ads for different products Facebook's going to help you work out which are your best sellers I'm going to focus on those which is helpful but if you are selling if you're in a power business and you're selling a jumper range you know um and you're also selling shoes okay I would have those in different campaigns I'd have shoes in one campaign I'd have uh the jumper range in a different campaign that's how I'd separate out things you want to think about the number of campaigns you run in terms of how can I put Facebook on my side here so we want Facebook to optimize as much as it can where it can that's why we go with a CBO campaign and we put our warm audience ad sets in with our cold audience ad sets because we want Facebook to optimize budget across our warm audiences and our cold audiences effectively it's why we're going to use broader targeting options than we would have done four years ago because we want Facebook to find people within our audience that are going to uh that are go that are most likely to deliver the best results it's also why within a product range like within a whole range of jumpers we're going to put you know you might have six eight twelve different and you know we would normally have that many but in this scenario you might that many different ads in one ad set and Facebook will work out amongst those okay which is going to produce the best results and um and and that's helpful data for you to have but if you've got very different products Facebook is going to optimize for the one that delivers the lowest cost per conversion a lot of the time and that might not be what you want as a business that's not putting Facebook's optimization process on your side if you have you go look we're going to pay more in terms of cost per lead for people interested in this service but they're worth a lot more to us you want to have that in a separate campaign and you want to be able to control the budget accordingly it may well be that you only want to spend twenty dollars you know in the original example we gave with the service business with the two different services you might want to be spending twenty percent of your budget on the lower value service and eighty percent of the higher value you don't want necessarily Facebook making that decision because they're going to favor the lower value service because they can get leads for you um nice uh nicely and easily so in terms of how many campaigns they have live at any one time i think about it one when we're using the direct offer cam strategy one conversion campaign per offer or product range okay um hopefully that makes sense right and there's some gray area there and so we've sort of discussed the product range and i want to i want to talk about the offer side of things a little bit if we were going to run a black friday sale or uh you know spring sale or a christmas sale or a valentine's whatever happens to be we would have our own campaign for that okay and that's why it's offer or product range you might be selling the same product but that would get a separate campaign when we turn on let's say a black friday sale campaign we are going to turn off our original one okay that's important so running at once might still just be the one it'd be the one campaign for that product range even though we're running a different campaign because we're running a special offer um but we're going to use a different campaign for that because we want Facebook to run that campaign and learn in the conditions of that campaign so it might be that amongst your target audience there's differences in the people that buy full price throughout the whole year and people who buy with a 50 discount for black friday for that week of black friday okay there might be differences in terms of what the best frequency number should be it's probably going to be a lot higher over a short time period for that black friday campaign might be differences in terms of what time of day you put ads in front of people maybe in the rest of the year you can only really target them in the evening but in the right black friday people are just living on their phones computers and buying anyway so you can do it all day maybe it's slightly different in targeting people who are more likely to be interested in deals and discounts things like that for black friday so what i'm getting at here is if you were to go and introduce your black friday offers into your existing campaigns they might not do as well because Facebook's like okay we know how to sell this product or service through this campaign we've got lots of conversion data this is best operating procedures but with the black friday discount that changes best operating procedure and you want to make sure Facebook learns afresh doesn't take the old learning and likewise by the way once you then end your black friday sale and you go back to running your regular campaigns you don't want to be running your black friday to have the black friday campaign optimization sort of obscuring best practices for those ads so keep them separate okay so the simple rule you know i've explained around a lot but the simple rule is one campaign per product or offer i do not often use separate retargeting campaigns so most of the time 90 of the time we're going to have a retargeting ad set in with our main cbo campaign so like this for example is going to have a retargeting ad set so for that product or product range or service we're going to have both combined whereas a lot of people will have retargeting and cold audiences separate we're not going to do that um but we'll just separate out the campaigns per product or offer one thing a point i want to clarify on the offer side of things we've got separate campaigns for say black friday things like that is we will reuse that the next year right because again the learnings have taken place you probably don't need to change as much because that's how you've got it all set up we will probably reuse that next year we'll change up the ad creative usually and make sure that looks nice and fresh and things like that unless we had something just just crushed it the previous year um and if you're just getting started facebook advertising the idea of thinking years out might be like what that's crazy i don't operate on those time horizons and i completely get that but you will years come around and you know we work with companies where we're running our fourth or fifth year of black friday sales and you can use a lot of what you did previously to help improve performance for uh for this year okay so hopefully that has clarified things hopefully that's made the task a little bit less daunting i see ad accounts all the time where i look in them and there's like 155 campaigns and they spend you know twenty thousand dollars and you think we wouldn't get anywhere near 155 campaigns twenty thousand dollars it means you've no idea what's going on this is a complete mess keep things simple wherever possible is going to help things particularly over the long run okay hope that's been useful so uh before you go a couple of things i want to mention the first is that free webinar i already mentioned beginning this video go ahead and check that out right you need to get your
