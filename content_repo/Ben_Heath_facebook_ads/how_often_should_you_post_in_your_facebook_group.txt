Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about how often you should post in your Facebook group. Now I've created lots of videos around how to grow a Facebook group, I've uncovered and developed some strategies that work really really well and I include a link in the video description to a video on how to grow a Facebook group and you can see here that in front of us we've got my Facebook Ads Mastermind group and there are currently just under 34 000 members in it and Facebook groups are fantastic assets to build a lot of people that want to generate clients and customers online and they want to use Facebook as a marketing tool they'll build a Facebook group and I would recommend you do but they start building a group and then they think okay how do I actually manage this group how do I nurture it how do I turn the people in my Facebook group into people I have a relationship with that eventually want to become paying customers and clients of mine so obviously posting in your group and being active is very very important so as a minimum I would recommend that you post in your Facebook group two to three times per week as an absolute minimum okay I'm going to get into what you should be posting in a second but I think terms of volume two to three times per week is really important if you can go beyond that and get up between somewhere around one post a day I think that's ideal that's absolutely fantastic now some people will go far beyond that they'll be posting three or four times a day that may be too much depending on your industry but that's probably not a problem but I think minimum two to three times a week ideal about once a day so if I take a look at my Facebook ads mastermind group what am I posting in there well the first thing I'm doing is I'm posting all the content I'm producing into my group because I know that the content I'm producing is things that my group members are very interested in so I'm releasing about five Facebook advertising related videos every week at the moment they all get shared in my group I publish one new blog post every week that gets shared in my group and every Wednesday I'm currently doing live training specifically to the group which is obviously more sort of group specific content but it's all going in there so roughly one once a day I'm putting a piece of content into my group now I appreciate that I'm in a somewhat well not unique but a privileged scenario in that I have a whole team around me that helps me edit my videos and put them together I have people who help me create blog posts and things like that so I'm able to produce a lot more content than most people particularly most people who are just getting started you may not be able to produce a piece of content every single day and that's absolutely fine I definitely didn't do that when I first started this group but I would say whatever content you are producing you know let's say you're creating videos for a YouTube channel or using them as Facebook ads or you're writing blog posts whatever it is that you're creating content wise share that in your group that's the sort of easy low-hanging fruit the other thing I think people should be posting in their group particularly at the beginning this is something I did a lot of is posts that are designed to generate engagement so let's say you know I have a group on Facebook advertising I could ask people what do you prefer to use campaign budget optimization or to not use campaign budget optimization and that's going to spark a debate and get lots of people leaving comments and questions and talking about the pros and cons that's fantastic you want a group with lots of engagement that's what starts to build the relationship between you and group members and is very very important so I think at the beginning in particular if you're not producing any content or much content get in the group and every now and then ideally let's say once a day pop something in there that's going to get a lot of people talking a lot of engagement and things like that it doesn't just have to be you providing value and sharing content and things along those lines that is a great way to talk about um various things within your industry that you know is going to be important and helpful to your group members okay so that's one thing sort of the engagement post as it were in your group the other thing is I would share news and any sort of big events that take place in your industry so things again that you know your group members are going to be interested in so this is probably stuff you're already aware of you're already probably reading articles about changes in your industry I mean in my industry digital marketing changes are made all the time and sort of big things will come up and then hit all the news channels and we'll read them and we'll check out um you know whether that's pertinent to us whether that's a big change and if it is something that we think is significant and going to affect our facebook group members we will share it in our group so again another quite quick and easy thing to do anything that's really big in your industry big news and some industries have a lot more news and others get that shared in your group another thing I like to do is celebrate milestones so as you're growing your group and you reach a certain milestone let's say a thousand members or ten thousand members put a post up to say look at what we've done guys isn't this fantastic I really appreciate all your involvement etc etc another fantastic and easy thing to put in your group and it creates that sort of nice feel good factor and it it gets your group members feeling like they're on a journey with you as opposed to you being the business and then being the potential customers is something that's really sort of uh being involved with each other now that's not something that's going to come up very often I mean I think we did it for a thousand members we did it you know we're at 34 000 now we did it for 5 000 10 000 20 000 or 30 000 to think of in the sort of milestones we've used but every now and then pop those in there really helps another thing I like to do and I did this a lot more at the beginning when this was more manageable was to do just straight up q a videos now these can be lives which I do a lot of now in fact I scroll down you can see this was a previous live that I recorded and this just pinned to the top of the group right now because this recorded the day before I'm recording this video to you guys right now so there was a live training on how to grow a facebook group actually ironically that's the title and then I did a q a at the end of it okay so live q a's are there questions that people in your industry in your group are going to have that you have the expertise to be able to answer and don't just think this applies to like marketing or b2b or anything like that every industry has you know there's so many things that I'm interested in as a sort of person and completely separate from for anything business related like I'm quite into fishing okay so if I was part of a fishing group on facebook and there was a real expert who was going to do a live q a i would love that because I'd love to ask them about great fishing spots and all this sort of stuff okay so this can apply to tons and tons of industries but q a posts are a great way to get engagement and again if that's something you're able to commit to once a week something like that that's going to help you get to that ideal that I feel is one post every day and help mix up the post obviously because if you've got some pieces of content some q a posts some engagement posts every now and then you're talking about a milestone and it mixes it up nicely and you're able to really help people out that way the other thing I'll quickly mention is that your facebook group shouldn't just be a place where you just post at least not at the beginning and it's also somewhere where you should engage with other people's posts now I try to do this with my facebook ads mastermind group but with you know 33 952 members that gets more and more difficult all the time as you can imagine and so I get to it when I can when I have time but at the beginning I was in it all the time answering questions and engaging with other people's posts that makes it feel like it's a back and forth relationship not just you just sort of bombarding them with content and and information and stuff like that but also giving back and then finally how often should you sell in your group now this is something you really have to answer yourself personally I run let's say a three-day flash sale for my courses maybe once every three months and every now and then I'll talk about our facebook advertising services in my group maybe once every month not often at all some people are selling three or four times a week that really will depend on your industry and what it is that you are looking to achieve I want to grow a really big group fantastic community and therefore what I'm posting is far more likely to be content oriented than than selling at this stage that may well change at some point when I want this to generate more revenue but what I'd recommend is when you're thinking about okay how often can I post something that's sales related product sales related start fairly infrequently and slowly ratchet it up and just see how your group responds people will let you know if they're annoyed by you overselling your products and services so just ratchet it up carefully so just to quickly recap we've got a minimum I think of your own group you want to be posting in there two or three times a week once a day is probably ideal some people go beyond that and and that's fine in certain industries but I think once a day is perfect and I've given you a whole list of different types of things you can be posting from news articles to engagement posts to pieces of content to Q&A's to your own products and services lots of different varieties you want to mix it up to keep it fresh and you can grow your group into a fantastic community that is very very valuable and of course if you're interested in
