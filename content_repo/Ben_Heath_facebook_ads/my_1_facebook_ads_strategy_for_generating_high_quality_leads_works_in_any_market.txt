Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to peel back the curtain and show you my exact lead generation process. I've created dozens of Facebook ad campaigns that generate high quality leads for my own services and for my client services and as a result I've developed a very specific strategy that works incredibly well. And I'm going to go through that strategy step by step in this video.

So if you're a service provider or you're looking to generate leads for your business then pay close attention to this video and make sure that you stick around and to the end because what I'm about to show you could completely change the way you market your business. Okay so let's get started. Now the first thing I'm going to do is run you through the lead funnel structure.

I'm going to explain the steps included in this lead generation process. I'm going to go through and show you examples of exactly what I use at each stage so you can model from those. You should find them really really useful.

Now this is a lead funnel that I've used generate leads for my own business. I've used to generate leads for clients businesses. It works really really well if you are a service provider.

Now I would recommend that you do watch this video until the end because the lead funnel that I'm about to show you might seem quite similar to others I've seen online in the past but there are some key differences and those differences will make all the difference to the results that you get from this lead funnel. So make sure you pay close attention and watch out for those differences. I'll be sure to explain this.

Okay so let's go through the lead funnel structure. So I've got a powerpoint presentation here. I'm just going to make that a little bit bigger so we can take a look and don't worry about all these slides.

Don't worry I'm not going to go through all those. I'm just going to explain this. So this is sort of the basic five steps that are included and this is the journey that your prospects are going to take as they go through this lead funnel and end up as a customer of yours.

Now the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to have a Facebook video ad. We're going to be advertising a video to cold audiences, people that don't know your business at all and that's step one. As I said I'm going to go through each of these in a lot of detail.

I'm going to show exactly how to create this video. Don't worry it's not as difficult as you think. That video is then going to direct people.

It's going to end with a call to action that directs people to a landing page and on this landing page as you can see in step three they're going to be offered to they're going to be asked to opt in for a lead magnet to give their email address in exchange for something of value. Again I'm going to explain the landing page, going to explain the lead magnet in detail. Now the difference already, one difference in this lead funnel than most people is most people say advertise a piece of content like a video, something valuable and then retarget those people with a direct call to action takes people to a landing page.

By getting people to go straight from the Facebook video to the landing page means that you don't need two Facebook campaigns and it costs a lot less. So that's a key difference that I found that makes a big difference. And once people opt in for the lead magnet they're then going to be taken to a thank you slash sales page.

You have to think that at this stage in the lead funnel people have just opted in for your lead magnet. They've just given you their email address in exchange for something of value. We want to continue that momentum and capitalize on it and progress people to the next stage of the lead funnel.

Now most people really don't use thank you pages enough. They will just have a thank you page after someone opts in for their lead magnet that says thank you very much for opting in and that's it. But this is the perfect opportunity to get people to the next stage which is why it's going to be a sales page and this is a big key difference between this lead funnel and other ones that you may have seen online.

What we're going to do is we're going to encourage people right there and then on that thank you page before they've even had a look at your lead magnet to book a free phone consultation directly into your calendar and that means that you can then obviously progress people to your major services when you're on the phone with them. Now one of the advantages this lead funnel has over a lot of other lead generation efforts is that once you've got all these stages set up it runs completely on autopilot. So you'll have a Facebook campaign sabotaging a video, people will watch the video, they'll click on the link in the description of the video, they'll go to the landing page, they're locked in for the lead magnet, they'll go to the thank you page, they'll book a free phone consultation directly in your calendar.

All you'll have to do as part of this lead generation process is you'll get an email saying oh someone's booked a slot with you you know tomorrow at two o'clock, you need to give them a call tomorrow at two o'clock. It's a fantastic way to generate leads for a service business and it makes the lead generation process so much more fun, less of a grind and so it works really really well. Okay so that's it let's have a look at the examples of each stage and then we'll go through them quickly.

So if I bring up here and I bring this screen across I've got everything prepared. So obviously we're going to start with the Facebook video app. I'm going to show you this is the one I've used primarily for my own business and obviously I've brought up the video it wouldn't look like this in an actual when it's being advertised in people's news feeds it would look a lot more like this.

If it loads properly so you can see yeah you know when they're scrolling through their Facebook news feed this is the sort of thing they will see. So I'm going to show you go through this and explain exactly how to set up a video like this as I said not as difficult as you think. They're going to click on this link down here that's going to take them through to the landing page and this is the example landing page.

Again I'm going to go through this this encourages them to opt in for the lead magnet and I've got an example of that somewhere. So here we go here's the lead magnet and again going to go through this but lead magnet that I've got here is a five-part Facebook ad template and let me make sure that's in the screen there five-part Facebook ad template so it basically helps people create Facebook ads quickly get a better results from their Facebook ads. I've got you know as you can see some examples in here I explain what's included again going to go through this and remember once they've opted in for the lead magnet on this page before they even make it to the lead magnet before it's emailed to them they're going to be sent to a thank you slash sales page.

So you can see here that it says thank you for downloading my five-part Facebook ad template your requested download should be within your inbox in the next 10 minutes. I mean we obviously send it immediately but what we really want to do is get people on this page because we want to progress into the next step. So watch the video below this video will automatically play I'll show you that I've just paused it for now but I'll show you that in later on.

Interesting working with us some stuff here then schedule a free call so they click on this and they're taken to this page where they can book a free Facebook advertising phone consultation with me and they can set their time zone and book in a slot again I'm going to go through all this so those are the five component elements let's go back to the beginning now and go through the video ad I'm going to go through my example explain a little bit about it and show you exactly how you can create your own how they're not as difficult to create as you might think so let's do that now. Okay so we're going to go through this video first and then after that I'm going to show you exactly how to create the Facebook advertising campaign that promotes this video and you need to create things in this order so I think it makes the most sense. A few things I'll go through before we watch this video firstly and you can see that my face you know I'm face to camera this is a face to camera video and that's really important I think for service providers because the vast majority of service businesses you know you or someone within your company is going to be interacting directly with your clients with your customers so they want to know that there's a real person they're going to be interacting with you can start to connect with them on that one-to-one basis getting in front of the camera and showing you're not just some nameless company you're a real person you're going to take responsibility for stuff I think that's really really key they're not as difficult to create as you think I'm going to explain what you need in terms of video equipment and stuff like that when I've just gone through this they're not very difficult so first thing I really really strongly recommend is you get in front of the camera as I've done here now the second thing I'll note is the length of the video so you can see that it's only three minutes and 14 seconds long and that's really important you know as a digital marketer I'd love attention spans online to be much much larger than they are but they're not to cold audiences to people who don't know who I am I'm going to create a short video I think two to four minutes for this style of video is really important remember at the end of the video there's going to be a call to action that encourages people to opt in for the lead magnet if I create an hour-long video not enough people are going to make it to the end of the video now this video I'm recording right now is obviously going to be much longer but that's really looking to deliver value to target market I'm not necessarily looking for this direct progression and whereas with this video I am I want them to go to the next stage of the sales funnel so keep your videos nice and short now this video the whole purpose of it is obviously to get people to opt in for a lead magnet but you need to deliver a lot of value and deliver a lot of value at the beginning of the video you need to tell your target market about something that they want to achieve or how to avoid something that they want to avoid just think why do people in my target audience want to watch this why is it you know why is it worth their time so in my case I'm a Facebook advertising content creator and service provider uh you know that's what my business does it we create Facebook advertising campaigns for our clients and manage them so obviously this video is about Facebook advertising specifically it's called why you're wasting your time with Facebook so the value in this video is that most people are wasting their time with Facebook because they're doing it completely wrong this video is going to tell you why you're getting it wrong and how you can change things so that it could actually make a difference for your business so that's the value of the video that's the hook that gets people in that then allows me to advertise my lead magnet and now just a point on that the title why you're wasting your time with Facebook is quite interesting it's obviously quite controversial most people wouldn't think that you know a Facebook service provider would create a video like that and that's part of the reason why this video has worked incredibly well so you know i think this one's got over 130 000 views it's added um tens of thousands of people to um our email list of rocks in for our lead magnets perform very well but that is kind of controversial isn't it why you're wasting your time with Facebook now i'm not saying that Facebook is a waste of time i'm saying that you person watching this is wasting your time because you're getting it wrong if you can be a little bit controversial if you can hook people in like that that's something that i would recommend anyway i've talked about this enough let's get started and let's start um you know going through this video now so i'm going to uh to quickly play it forgive the audio quality it won't be good i'm playing a video that i'm recording with a laptop so uh you just have to forgive that you can always come to this video and check it out i'll make sure i include a link to this in the video description so you can have a look if you're trying to promote your business on Facebook then you're probably wasting your time and in this video i'm going to explain why and what you need to do on Facebook to actually get results my name is Ben Heath so you can see right at the beginning i'm explaining what this video is about um what people need to you know where the value is going to come from in this video i'm going to explain why and what you need to do to actually get results and now i'm going to start introducing myself which is a london-based digital marketing agency okay so the vast majority of small business owners and marketers so all they did was quickly introduce myself establish a bit of credibility founder and ceo of a digital marketing agency um that's why you should listen to me when i'm you know you should listen to the rest of this video just establish a bit of credibility if you can do that you can say look i've been a you know a plumber for 25 years this is how you you know make sure your drains don't get blocked or whatever it is and then get that in there and then now i move into the meat of the video and start delivering the content and start explaining why people are wasting their time and what they need to do to get better results promoting their businesses on Facebook aren't really getting any results and they aren't really getting any results for two reasons number one no one's watching and number two no one cares okay so let me start by explaining number one no one's watching unless you are paying to promote your content on Facebook very few people are going to see it and that's true even if your Facebook page has 60 000 plus likes just like ours does you have to remember that yes Facebook is a social network but it's also an advertising platform they make money from their advertisers not from their regular users so of course they're going to give their advertisers content a lot more priority and that's what's going to show up in people's news feeds and this isn't a bad thing on their part Facebook is a for-profit company and just like you and me they're going to prioritize their paying customers the good news is that it's not that expensive to advertise on Facebook but i will say that if you're not willing to put at least a little bit of money behind your promotions then to be honest you're wasting your time okay so let's move on to point number two no one cares just paying to promote your business on Facebook i'm just going to stop it at that point obviously that's sort of halfway through the value section of this video and one thing you'll notice is that it's quite professionally produced again not very difficult to do but i do think that's important particularly if you're working b2b you know people other businesses want to work with businesses that they deem to be professional so you can see that i'm not unlike in this video where it's a much longer format i'm not mumbling over my words i'm not getting anything wrong it's been nicely edited and that there's there's things that pop up on the screen the lighting is good well the audio for you on this video won't be decent but the audio is pretty good and i think these are points that you do want to tick if possible again i'm going to explain how you do that but that's just a good a good point to note at this stage let's carry on isn't good enough you need to promote something that people actually care about i see so many small businesses posting things on Facebook that are all about them and their company but no one cares about that stuff no one cares about your company updates the Facebook news feed is a really interesting place with tons of distractions so if you're going to grab people's attention you need to promote something that people actually care about and for the most part people care about a couple of things they care about things that are entertaining and they care about things that will help them achieve something they want to achieve so that would be something educational some businesses can promote things that are entertaining and i'm sure you've seen examples of that but the majority can't it just doesn't make sense and they need to go down the educational rules and that's okay because if you have something interesting and valuable to show people they will listen to you and once they're listening to you then you have the perfect opportunity to sell to them so to stop wasting your time with Facebook and deliver actual results you need to pay to promote your content and you need to promote content that is highly valuable and that your target market cares about now just so right just at that last section i was just summarizing the value that i've given in the content and you can see that i haven't gone into a lot of depth you can't when you're creating a short video like this um and this is the perfect sort of thing to go out to cold audiences that perhaps don't know that much about about Facebook and about promoting it um it's it's kind of top level it's kind of introductory i'm saying that the two things you need to do is is pay to promote your stuff on Facebook organic um reach on Facebook is more or less dead and you need to pay to promote stuff that people actually care about don't just put up an ad that says please come work with me it's not going to work so that's the value in the thing now i'm moving into the call to action section at the end which is absolutely key this is what's going to drive people to the landing page and get them to opt in for the lead magnet now there are a lot of people online that will say you should advertise a video like this and then you should just end it with thank you very much talk to you soon and then you should retarget with another Facebook advertising campaign a direct ad for the lead magnet now the reason why this method works a lot better is you only need one Facebook advertising campaign to do it this way instead of having two which obviously costs a lot less when you're talking about halving your cost per lead that's a huge adjustment um you know it's going to have a massive impact on the success of your campaign so this call to action here is really really key so pay close attention to this now just before we wrap up i want to quickly tell you about something that will help you get much better results from your Facebook ads and that's a five-part Facebook ad template that i've created that you can download right now for free in this ad template i've included some of our best performing ads that we've created for our clients in a number of different industries i've broken each ad down and explained what we've included in each and why so if you're looking to promote your business on Facebook then you'll find this really really useful you can obviously model from the examples given and it should really help you guys out as i said you can download it right now for free all you need to do is click on the link in the video description above that will take you through to our website and you'll be able to download it there if you enjoyed this video please give it a like and share i would really appreciate that and i'll talk to you soon bye bye okay so let's stop that before it moves on to the uh to the next video and get rid of that so you can just see that it just says here click the link in the video description to download the five-part Facebook ad template so you can see that out of this video you know it's three and a bit minutes long a good 30 35 seconds of it is dedicated purely to the call to action and to the lead back there and hopefully you'll notice throughout that video i'm not shy at all you know i've really i'm not shy about the content i am an expert in my field if you're a service provider you're almost certainly an expert in your field so when you when you know your stuff when you're confident about what you're talking about you can say look this is the way it is this is what's going to help you out and this is how you should be doing it simple as that so you know i think that's an important point to be confident in delivery and i'm not shy about the lead magnet i know the lead magnet's great the five-part Facebook ad template has helped tens of thousands of people that have downloaded downloaded it and so i'm not shy about really promoting that and pushing that as you can see at the end of the video now a couple of things to note so in order to create videos like this you might think and how on earth can i create a video like that first thing i would recommend is script out your entire video it doesn't take very long and write out exactly what you're going to say plan it and make sure it looks professional as i've done there so that video is entirely scripted out that's why the delivery comes across um quite quite well second thing is you need a bit of equipment so you need a couple of box lights very cheap to buy on somewhere like amazon that's what gets the the nice lighting um makes you look like you're not recording it in a dungeon like videos without without lighting can can often do um so get a couple of box lights that create that nice soft light get a lapel mic again very cheap to get on amazon that improved the audio quality um and then that's been recorded with a dslr camera um anything that record can record in full hd will more than be adequate adequate then the only other thing i've got which is somewhat optional to be honest because you can just do it against the white wall is i've got a a sort of camber sheet up behind me with a with a stand that enables you to sort of put that up there and have that that sheet behind you um so and that could just make the background look a bit better than just being directly behind uh you know in front of a white wall or something like that so that's in terms of and that's all the equipment you need you're talking about you know a hundred bucks to buy all that sort of stuff oh maybe the dslr camera will be will be more but you you might already have one of those you almost certainly have a friend or relative that has one of those that you can borrow if you don't want to buy your own um otherwise all the other stuff is um around about 100 we'll do it oh and then with the camera i've got a tripod and that's probably fairly obvious but that that's it and that's all you need that's all the equipment you need script out every um line and the way i do it is i have my laptop in front of me obviously off camera and i will read instead of memorizing it all i will read a line you know read it to myself to memorize it i'll look up the camera and i will deliver that line to the camera um and then that will mean that the videos are sort of in sentences in chunks and what you can see i'll just go back so you can look is that i'm moving around the screen for each sentence so let's just quickly play this so you can see what i mean majority can't it just doesn't make sense and they need to go down the educational and that's okay because if you have something just moved around a little bit on the screen now all i've done is i've stood on one spot to do that and i've got a video editor to move me around so each um each sentence i'm moving around slightly and that's just a simple audience retention trick so if you can add that in you know the moving around the screen just keeps people interested a little bit longer they're going to watch more of your video which is important because remember the video is all about getting people to the end to find out about your lead magnet and go to the next stage of your of your sales funnel um okay so that's the the basics of the video itself now let's quickly take a look at the text we've got in the ad so obviously it wouldn't be in this format it would be in the news feed but this is all the information it contained they'd watch the video and you can see right at the end i say um you know click the link in the video description to download the five-part facebook ad template so let's have a quick look at this video description so here we have if you're trying to promote your business on facebook then you're probably wasting your time and in this video i explain why and what you need to do to actually get results so what i'm doing here is i'm just summarizing the video those are the first two lines that were included in the video itself i've just put that in there and then immediately i'm moving on to the pivot to talk about um the lead magnet and the five-part facebook ad template i've also created a five-part facebook ad template that you can download right now for free this template includes some of the best performing ads we've created for our clients in multiple industries and if you're looking to promote your business on facebook you'll find it very useful so again we're just selling the lead map here why do people want to take the time to click on the link and then give over their email address oh they want to do it because they want to get this lead magnet says to download this free ad template click here so this is the ad um you know this is obviously not what it looked like but this is what's going to be included in the video ad that's it's very simple i'll include a link to this in the video description go through this model from it that sort of length my delivery what i'm talking about model all those things obviously don't copy the content it won't work for your business and make sure it's specific to what you provide um but you really model from this and so you can get the idea in there and it does perform very very well okay so that's the video itself now we need to create the promotes this video before we move on to the next stages okay so here we are now inside our facebook ad account i'm going to show you how to create the facebook ad campaign that is promoting that video i want to go through and create a new one so you can see exactly how it works and and you know all the buttons to press and there's things to include and things to exclude and all that sort of stuff now and one thing i will quickly mention you can see on this screen is the results that that campaign has got so you can see it's this one here that this is the campaign the video has been promoted in it's generated so far 16 108 leads now we've got other campaigns obviously that's over the last five six months or so performed incredibly well now those leads are email opt-ins so people who have opted in um for the five part facebook ad template as a result of that video so obviously those haven't converted into um phone consultations as we are in this um lead funnel structure there's no way you know we could have handled 16 000 phone calls in the last six months but that just shows you once you get this right once you get that video right that first step it can work so so well okay so with that said let's now uh create a campaign so you want to come over here and click create and apologies if this is a bit slow because i'm recording this um it's likely to be to be a little bit slow so let's go with lead funnel campaign for the name okay buying type we're going to leave as auction campaign objective really really important thing i'll quickly explain so a campaign objective i've actually just written a blog post about this you guys can go to my website and check that out all about the the 13 facebook campaign objectives um the campaign objective basically what you're telling facebook is this is what i want so it automatically defaults to traffic you can have you know app installs video views and what that means is within the target audience that you select facebook will put your ad in front of the people that it thinks are most likely to do one of these things so traffic it's who facebook thinks is most likely to click on your link um page likes it's who facebook thinks it's most likely to like your page and the facebook algorithms are very very um sophisticated they've got a lot of data on all their users a lot of which has been in the news recently um and um what that means is that selecting this conversion objective can make a big big difference to your campaign because facebook will optimize for that objective so it's really important that you get this right now what we're going to optimize for here obviously the end goal is to end up with phone free free phone consultations with prospects but we're going to optimize for a lower stage in this lead generation funnel and we're going to optimize for leads just as i had with that campaign there we want to get as many people to opt in for our lead magnet because those people are the ones who are going to reach our thank you slash sales page as possible so that's what we want to tell facebook that we want so you want to come down and select conversions key result we want to change from purchases to leads now in order for this to work in order to have conversions um as a campaign objective and then to go after the key result of leads you need to have the facebook pixel installed on your website and on the thank you sales page you need the lead event code so i've created videos check out my youtube channel i'll include a link in the video description about how to install the facebook pixel on on your website um depending on what side of what sort of website you have whether you know it's a shopify site or a wordpress site you can google around how to install the face pixel how to install lead event code you need those two things you need to get that right for this to work so don't skip that out make sure that you do that but i'm going to move on on for now so create an ad set so i'm just going to give this a name like i normally do i just call it placeholder and then we'll create the ad in a second that's all you need to know about the campaign stage so go ahead and click save the draft and it's going to take a little bit of time and then so that's the campaign stage there's sort of three levels to a facebook and campaign if you're not familiar you've got your campaign stage you've got your ad set which is all about who you're going to be advertising to and where on facebook your ads are going to appear then you've got your ad which we've already covered in this case that's the video and the accompanying text so that's all the stuff that we want to know about our campaign our lead funnel campaign conversions auction campaign spending limit if you want to make sure you don't spend too much then you can set that up don't worry about this for now but minimize that go into lead funnel campaign and now we need to edit our ad set so go ahead and select edit okay so here we are now inside our ad set now this is where we decide two things we decide who we're going to be advertising to and we decide where on facebook we want to advertise so let's uh let's get started so the first thing you need to do is in this conversion window it's obviously we are running a conversion campaign objective that's what we want the campaign to optimize for and yes website and we want to use the lead event code you could optimize for purchase add to cart there's a few different options depending on what your business does but in this case service based businesses looking to generate leads we're going to use the lead objective which registers when people opt in for our lead magnet and then land on that all important thank you slash sales page okay so select lead in there for now let's just keep it really simple and exclude those daily budget it really is up to you and what i usually say to people is start off small establish if something works and then look to scale up um if you want to start with you know something like five dollars a day ten dollars a day that could be a decent starting point if you've got a much larger business with with staff you need to make payroll and this needs to mean something obviously start larger um but don't get too hung up on the budget start with something that you don't mind losing if it doesn't work out and then establish at that level um get to a point where it's you know it's working well for you and then look to scale from there i'm just going to leave that as is start and end date i don't bother setting an end date um because i know i'm going to come back into this campaign and adjust it regularly you could of course if you know you want to end it before a certain event absolutely fine go ahead and edit that okay um now we get into the audience section custom audiences i'm going to create another video all about custom audiences because they're a whole topic and other stuff basically custom audiences are people that already know your business so you can advertise to people for example that have visited your website um that are maybe on your email list and your previous customers stuff like that you do all that in custom audiences not going to go into this into that in this video i don't want to make it too long but they're really really powerful if you do have you know website visitors a previous customer list um something like that then look to use custom audiences and of course lookalike audiences which spring off of those but again i'm going to create a separate video all about that the majority of you are going to be advertising to cold audiences and and this strategy most of the time you are going to be advertising to people that don't know about you don't know much about your business so we want to focus on the cold audience element of things now locations so if you operate nationwide multiple countries then obviously include the countries that you want to uh to advertise to most service providers operate on a local basis so you can come in for example and you could enter in um so i live in west london so i could put in west london in here um in fact i don't want to put obviously in anything too specific but i could put in london within 25 miles i could be a lot more specific i could put in my my physical address um and then do within five miles 10 miles of there whatever um but yeah so obviously for people to become customers of your in the end of yours in the end they need to live or operate within your area of operation so just enter that in here and if you are you do operate nationwide then go ahead and set the whole nation just like our business for example is not any nationwide or international we work with clients in english-speaking countries we've got them in america obviously the uk canada australia um but what i would often recommend is you start with one country to begin with if you do operate over different countries so perhaps for example in our case because we're based in the uk we would start with the uk and then look to add canada and the united states and other countries as we go on but whatever your uh your physical location is in your area of operation that's what needs to be put in here so i'm going to write um put united kingdom in there age range hopefully you've already got a pretty good idea of the demographics of your um target market so hopefully you'll know that you know most of your customers are males aged 30 to 50 for example something along those lines um so for our business for our um advertising purposes we have quite a wide range it could be either men or women we usually select 30 and over and we cap it at around about 55 so we want to work with business owners and marketers that are fairly senior in decision making um positions in larger companies and still relatively tech savvy otherwise they wouldn't be interested in anything like this in the first place so around about 35 we do change that for various things that's usually about our our age grade both men and women um okay and then the key with facebook with who you're going to advertise to is really in the detailed targeting so again i'm going to create another video all about using facebook's audience insights tool which i'd recommend you do so you get there by the way you get to audience insights just by clicking on these three lines at the top and going across to audience insights that's a great tool for finding um cold audiences to target finding different targeting options that you might want to test and also you can clarify some of the demographic information about your your business so let's say for example you're not sure what um age or gender your your target customer mainly is we could go in and say for example add in an interest that you know is closely related to the service that you provide and facebook will be able to tell you with an audience insights oh you know what 78 of your market is female therefore you should probably start by uh by targeting females i'm going to create another video about that let's move on so what you want to do here in the detail targeting is add in an interest or maybe a behavioral um category something that you know um is likely to contain great prospects for your business so for example i know that people that are interested in facebook for business is a great targeting option uh for my business because you know people that are interested in that are interested in generating business through facebook they're interested in advertising on facebook which is exactly who we want to be advertising it but um you know it completely depends on your business what could be in here i mean obviously if you're some some are fairly straightforward if you're a fishing instructor you know you could enter in people interested in fishing you know if you teach a violin or something then there's that b2b side of things can often be a little bit more difficult um so in that case maybe you could go after specific companies and you could see you know who works for specific companies or what their job title is there are some different types of options so what i recommend you do if you don't already know is browse through the options go through the options have a look and really think about you know okay are my um prospects you know are what what education level have they been to university have they not um what financial level are they what's their income what's their net worth are they you know are they parents um politics probably less likely to play a thing you know but but are they getting married you know my services to do with weddings relationships obviously going to be a massive thing i can select engaged that's going to be really important so there are tons of great options go through these here this is very very um dependent on your individual business now one thing to keep your eye on is potential reach so you want um a reasonable audience size when i'm you know when i create videos talking about advertising other types of things on facebook we're often going for much larger audiences but most service providers have a you know a very limited number of the amount of people that they can work with so you don't need massive audiences in here and the advantage of that is you can afford to be very specific so you know if you're operating just on a well if you're operating on a national a countrywide or international basis then you can be very very specific because you don't need that many people in your target audience i mean how many phone calls can you possibly have and with with prospects if you're operating on a local basis you have to keep this broader because of course the audience sizes are automatically going to be smaller because you're only advertising to a local basis i would say that for most service providers anything above 50 000 is absolutely fine now of course if you're you know if you you know you're running this facebook advertising campaign and to generate leads for services for you know a business with hundreds of employees and you need many many many thousands of leads on a regular basis then um you might need a larger audience size but um anything around about 50 000 i think is absolutely fine if it is larger that's not a problem at all and one thing i will say is you know if you find you know let's say i've added in a targeting here so let's say instead of facebook for business which is already pretty i'm specific and pretty good let's say i added in something a lot broader that we might target like facebook page admins so let's add that in there 5.3 million facebook page admins in the uk okay that's far broader than we want to do so we've got a few options we can either exclude people so let's say you know you've got a target audience but you know you know what there's this whole group of people within that that just are not going to be right for my service you want to exclude those absolutely fine or you can narrow the audience so for example we might want them to be facebook page admins but we might also want them to be interested in facebook for business now this isn't going to make a huge amount of sense um because everyone who's interested in facebook business is well i'd be amazed if anyone's not a facebook page admin but you can see how you could use these for your own business to narrow that audience down and that's brought us right down to to 53 000 for example but you might have certain parameters let's say for example you're a you know b2c service provider and you want people who are interested in your service but you only want to work with um you might for example narrow down your audience to people who only earn over a hundred thousand dollars a year or higher than that something along those lines just to to get that audience down to make sure that people in it are your ideal prospects but don't sweat the potential reach too much like just don't worry about it people get so hung up i'm gonna add facebook for business back here people get so hung up on on getting just the right audience size uh we'll get this right don't worry about it and of course hopefully when you're going through this you'll not just find one option that you think is good you'll find three or four different options if that's the case then what i'd recommend is don't include them all within one ad set create multiple ad sets um with the different options because what you want to be able to see is okay if we advertise to people that are interested in facebook business versus advertising people that are basic page admins versus some other targeting options that we might use and we want to know which one works best because you might find that you know one's costing you one pound per lead magnet opt-in one's question three pounds per lead magnet opt-in and so it's really important to uh to break those out expand interest when it may increase conversions at a lower cost per conversion there are some types of campaigns where i like including this because we want much larger larger audiences um with this in particular we don't want to select with this sort of campaign this lead funnel um structure we don't want to select this because what we don't want to do is we don't want facebook to get us loads of people to opt in for our lead magnet who might not necessarily make good clients for us um when it comes to you know progressing them further down our lead funnel so i'd leave that unticked for now ignore connections okay here we get onto placement so there are definitely people in the industry that disagree with me a lot of people more and more are recommending that you go with automatic placements it's something i regularly test but i find that the vast majority of stuff that comes from facebook the the leads the interaction the engagement the purchases whatever sort of thing it is you're advertising come from the facebook newsfeeds so i still like to deselect um i've reselected that deselect all the other options and my uh computer's being a bit slow and simply start with the facebook newsfeeds of course if you want to test various placement options you can and you can very quickly find out within a couple of days of running a campaign where you're generating your leads from which placement and you can go back in to your ad ad set and edit these options you can remove them but i like to start with just the newsfeeds all mobile dice is absolutely fine leave that unselected okay optimize optimization and delivery so we want to optimize the ad delivery for conversions that's what we want facebook to um to do for us so for example you know it could be landing pages could be link clicks etc um i would leave that deselected for now conversion window leave that seven days click or one day view i don't think it will make that much difference and then big strategy lowest cost you know of course that's exactly what we want to be able to get not 100 sure why they've got a secondary option we want to get leads at least price possible leave that as is and everything else is absolutely fine this ad set is now ready to go so what i would do for example to show you the naming convention is i would come back in and we've got um what have we got we've got uk we're targeting the uk we're doing 30 to 55 and we're doing facebook for business now if i was to create three or four different ad sets i could now see that against for example the same but let's say that was fixed with page admins and i could see really easily oh you know this one's generating leads for x amount this one's generating leads for twice the price let's reallocate the budget to the best performing ad set those optimizations and adjustments you make once the campaign alive are really important so don't just ignore your campaign once it's up there and this becomes more important if you want to test you know 12 different ad sets as we'll often do for our clients so let's go ahead and do that okay now click on this ad set to go in and now we need to create the ad of course we know exactly what the ad is going to include um but um right lead funnel campaign let me just select this stuff here and now we want to create new ad so i'm going to go with why your voice with facebook video because that's what this um ad is going to be we've already been through it so i'm not going to spend hard any time on this i'm just going to very quickly show you how um to set this up how i'd recommend you go about setting this up so here we go so it's popped up here why you're wasting your time with this video now you can of course create your ad right here within ads manager so you could you know select video you could go ahead and upload your video add the text in here and make sure you've got the you know website url you're linking to the landing page on your website um but that's not what i would recommend i wouldn't recommend creating your ad in here and that's because of social proof now let's say for example i've talked already about you may want to create three or four different assets in fact i would recommend it now if that's the case if you create ad within each each um ad set those are going to be different ads and all the likes comments shares and stuff like that are going to be spread across you know in that case four different ads if you've got four different ads and that that's um magnified if you want to create a couple of different ad variations so let's say you want to keep your same video but you want to use um two different text variations with the two different copy variations you might have eight ads and all that social proof is going to be split across eight different ads now if you use existing posts instead i find it much more effective you want all that social proof on uh on one ad post so that when people see it and it's got you know dozens of comments and likes and shares they're going to pay more attention to that it's it's you know it's effectively the same as like a trip advisor review you know if somewhere's got loads of great reviews you're going to pay more attention to it and consider it more as a you know hotel to stay at or whatever same with a facebook ad it's got lots of social proof people are going to give it more time because there's an endorsement from all those other people so what i recommend you do instead is upload your video to your facebook page obviously include the text publish that post and then you can come in here and you can select use existing posts and then you simply need to um select a post so you'll see tons of different videos in here and said this was uh published probably five six months ago and scroll down here we go i think this one's about right in there so let's go ahead and select this one if you're trying to promote your business on facebook that's the one why you're wasting your time with facebook so you can see for example that this one post um has got 1.5 000 you know likes hearts and all the other different options 358 comments 261 shares and what that means is when that ad shows up in someone's news feed looking just like what you can see here people are going to pay more attention to it they go okay this is you know people obviously like this that it's acting as social proof so that's why i'd recommend use existing post and it also means that this step is super easy i don't need to do anything else obviously for this campaign to work properly remember you need the facebook pixel installed you need the lead event installed so make sure that's taken care of and you don't need to worry about any of this and then you can go ahead and select publish just a note on the facebook pixel by the way guys um if you have no idea how to do this and the the idea of setting this up technically is terrifying just go into upwork.com find someone to um to do it for you they'll probably charge you know 10 20 something like that very inexpensive well worth doing and once we're talking about upwork.com i'll quickly mention about um the video is when i said i hand my raw footage over to a video editor i'd recommend you find them on upwork.com great place to find find freelancers that are very inexpensive come with tons of reviews so you know you've got quality and would really recommend you do that as opposed to trying to do it yourself it can take forever so upwork.com if you need help with the facebook pixel and for your video editing needs in fact to be honest a lot of the things that i do where i need little jobs for um i will go to upwork.com to find people really really good i'll include a link to that in the video description so now i'm not going to do this obviously because i've already got campaign running but you would now go in and select publish and your campaign would be live okay so that's now facebook advertising campaign covered hopefully gone through the options you can go back through this video and set yours up now we need to move on to the next stage which is the landing page that's the place that people are going to arrive at um you know from the link in your video ad where they're going to opt in for your lead method so let's let's jump into that now okay so this is the landing page that people are taken to from the facebook video ad and i'm going to quickly go through this because what's included in this page and the layout of it the structure of it's really important um this page is converted north of 60 which means more than 60 of the people that have landed on it have gone on to opt in for the five-part Facebook ad which is really really high industry average is probably about 20 to 40 that's the the sort of range that most landing pages get anything over 40 you're doing really well so uh so feel free to model from this page i will include a link to it in the video description so come here take a look at this page model from it we're creating your own landing page and whilst you're there opt in for the lead magnet you know the five part facebook ad template is really useful if you're advertising on facebook you'll uh you'll find it helpful and you can kind of as well so first thing you'll notice is there's no header navigation so there's no menu up here you can't get to the about page services page contact page whatever and that's on purpose so with these pages what you want to do is you want to minimize distractions you want people to take one very specific action and that's opt in for the lead packet which they can do by giving their name and email address here um if you have links up here people will click on them they'll navigate around your website to have a look and they won't make it back to this page and they won't end up opting in so where possible get rid of as much navigation and distractions as possible having said that i'm going to quickly scroll down to the footer we have got some links down at the bottom of this page home contact login terms conditions privacy policy etc because we're advertising this page on facebook we're directly linking to it facebook doesn't want you to send um people to what's called dead end so places where they can't basically get out of when they navigate there so having some um links in the footer is necessary make sure you whenever you're advertising on facebook you always want to make sure that you're not reaching facebook's advertiser policies they will suspend your account and if you do it multiple times will ban your account um i've come across that many times so would strongly recommend that you read through those advertiser policies at some point they're not actually that long it's not horrendously onerous like it sounds you can get a really quick good idea okay can't do this can't do this etc etc um we've made that mistake where we haven't uh done that before and run into issues so i'd recommend you do that so that's why these links are in here ideally i wouldn't have them on but yeah what can you do okay then we get into the uh the meat of the page itself so first thing we've got is a free download it's a rule in digital marketing that you can't say something's free enough it is actually free this is completely free so we've got that up there then we've just got the title in red to really grab people's attention five part facebook ad template that's what it is and then i'm not going to go through this i'm not going to read through all of this but you'll see that the text beneath that um it's short and sweet that we've only got four bullet points but it's really benefit rich remember you have to sell your lead you have to um really convince people to opt in for it they don't want to give you their email address they're worried that you're going to spam you everyone already already receives tons and tons of emails every day um so they don't want to give you their email address you need to overcome that by really sort of selling um the benefits of having it so in this which you know including the facebook ad template is our value first strategy um that helps you generate low cost leads and sales we've got in here you know uh five elements of any facebook ad convince your target market to click and most importantly convert so these are things that people want they want low cost leads and sales they want you know ideal customers to know that their ads are for them they want um you know to convince uh target market to click and convert so think about what your lead magnet does and we're going to get on to the magnets in a minute and the benefits the people that your target market will have will get i should say by downloading it include those in there really important take a lot of time on these guys if it takes you you know two hours to write four bullet points that sounds crazy but that's fine these are really really important and then we've included an image always think that's a nice little touch probably doesn't make a huge amount of difference but having an image in there probably just makes it real that they're getting something in exchange for their email address then obviously we've got the the opt-in information don't ask for any more information than you need so if you you know at this stage you don't need a phone number that's going to come next um so we just ask for a name and an email address the reason why we do it this way is because if you ask for too much information here number one you'll decrease your conversion rate on this page but number two it's just too early you know all the people have done so far all that people have interacted with with your business they've watched a video on facebook they've clicked on a link and landed on this page it's too early to start saying come work with us give us your phone number and we'll call you back etc etc so just ask for a name and email address one step further we'll be able to to add those things in then we've got get instant access in a great big ugly orange button something i would recommend um you want people who land on this page you want their eyes to be automatically drawn to this button it doesn't go with the sort of design of the page with the blacks and reds and blues and it's just orange and but you do want it to stand out that does that has been shown to help the graphic designers and web designers if you probably don't like the look of that but put in a big old ugly button so that people are drawn to it then beneath that we've just got a link to our privacy policy um i'm not sure whether or not you have to do that i think with the new gdpr stuff coming in you will have to and but we've always included that like to include that people want to know what you're going to do with their data so you click on that you can see we're not going to do anything bad with it at all we're just going to use it for its intended purposes and send you a template and stuff like that so that's the page pretty straightforward and what we use to make this we've got a wordpress website and we use the optimize press plugin to create this so i don't know how to do any you know how to code anything um in fact no one in my team does if we do need anything like that we get external help and but we don't need to code anything to set up a page like this we can just do all this with an optimize press drag and drop write in the text super easy super straightforward hook this up um to mailchimp which is our email service provider and so that the template is automatically delivered when people enter in their details it makes the whole process a lot easier i'll include a link to optimize press in the video description once they obviously get this they'll be taken to the thank you sales page they'll also be emailed the lead magnet we do need to quickly go over that because if you don't have that part right the whole strategy falls apart so let's do that now so here we now have our five part facebook ad template as our best performing lead magnet um as you saw from the campaign a while ago this campaign alone 10,000 opt-ins for this thing we had a previous version of that video before i re-recorded it had over 400,000 views and that had even more um opt-ins so um so this has performed really really well and of course for this strategy to work people need to opt in for your lead magnet so it needs to be something that people actually want it needs to deliver a lot of value so again when you're thinking about creating your lead magnet think right what can i give in an automatic format so it can automatically deliver if you're not actively delivering the service that can um you know what i always like to say about lead magnets is help your customers or your prospects achieve something they want to achieve or avoid something they want to avoid so it might you know something that's really annoying them and you've got a solution create a lead magnet for it but if you've got something that oh i really want x so in our case it's achieve something they want to achieve we know that our target market are advertising on facebook or interested advertising on facebook they want better facebook ads because that's going to produce better results for their business and this five part facebook ad template is designed to do exactly that now a lot of lead magnets there's a bunch of different formats you can use you can create you know uh reports um guides templates similar to this one you could use a video training um you could run a webinar although i'm not a big fan of a of a webinar i think it's too involved um with your lead magnet it needs to deliver a lot of value and ideally it will be consumed quickly and easily because what you don't want is you don't want your prospects thinking well i'm not going to opt in for that because um i don't have time to go through it and that's where i feel a webinar comes in now if you want to know more about creating lead magnets i've created a video and it's all about how to build an email list with facebook where obviously you need to talk about lead magnets a lot because that's um the strategy that's used and at the beginning of that video the first sort of 15 20 minutes is all talking about lead magnets and i give a whole bunch of examples of different businesses and the sort of lead magnets that they could create so i'll include a link to that video it's called how to build uh facebook ads 2018 and how to build an email list with facebook advertising it's the title of the video check that out watch the first 20 minutes or so because that goes into um a lot of detail on lead magnets i want to keep this video as short as possible because you know we're only at stage three out of five and it's the risk of getting too long so let's quickly go through this so i've mentioned designed to deliver a lot of value so the way this um lead magnets five-part facebook ad template sort of works is what i've done is i've used uh you know so i i'll go through the pages i start by sort of introducing the um our company a little bit explaining a little bit about us why we're credible so um i know that most people advertising on facebook their business is split into sort of three different categories you've got local service um you've got i'll scroll down to be too long you've got e-commerce product businesses and you've got the oh that's where i am um digital slash information product businesses those are the sort of general three categories so what i do is for each one i've got an example ad so for the local slash service which is what most of you watching this video will be interested in um i've used an example of a theory design company that we've worked with i've got i've included an ad example i've broken the ad into its component parts and text image headline etc etc and then i've explained what each component part does why we've included it how it works really well etc etc um now this is really useful because people can go in and they can go okay you know i'm you know i'm not an interior design company but i you know run uh i'm a hairdresser for example and they come in and they could see okay well they've you know they've used this method here of calling out to the target market which is explained in point one call out to your target market great so i could do that let's say my target market you know i'm a barber's i'm just after men so fine i could call out to men uh maybe i specialize in xyz i can call out target market so you can come in here and you can use the examples and tactics given and that's what we've got included that's what this lead magnet is all about so it's you know quick and easy to consume people can come through and have a look and and work it out i'd recommend you guys come down and come in opt in for this download it and go through it delivers a lot of value does so nice and quickly and it moves people on to the next stage as i said if you want a lot more details on creating lead magnets then check out that video i mentioned about building an email list first 20 minutes all about lead magnets you can find a lot of details there we're going to move on to the fourth stage of this lead funnel which is a thank you slash sales page and that's the real um i say so you know if there's one thing that really makes this lead funnel stand out from any other sorts of funnels that you may have heard people talk about online i think it's this thank you slash sales page it works incredibly well i've been through many many different iterations anyway talked enough let's get into it now okay so here we are now on the thank you page slash sales page that we've been talking about that people are taken to after they opt in for our lead magnet now i do need to quickly say if you go ahead and opt in for the lead magnet which i would recommend and you're not taken to this page that's probably because we're too busy and we're not looking for extra service work and in that case you won't be taken to this page once you opt in for the lead magnet you'll be taken to a page where you're asked to um ask if you'd be interested in purchasing one of our online courses about facebook advertising you know fortunately uh my business has reached a stage where we often have more people wanting us to create facebook campaigns and stuff like that the business that we can handle when that's the case we won't direct people to this page obviously don't have time to do the phone calls and to get take on new business we'll send them there instead and which is a great thing you can do with this strategy you can either pause the facebook campaign if you want to save money or you could offer something else once you do reach capacity um okay so with that said let's go through this page so again you'll notice there's no header navigation uh something i would recommend important you don't want still don't want any distractions on this page and then we start talking about what's included so the first thing you need to do is acknowledge the previous action that they've just taken so you don't want to land on this page and go hang on a minute where's my where's my template where's my lead magnet what's this so here we've got thank you for downloading my five-part facebook ad template your requested download should be within your inbox within the next 10 minutes now of course we have it set to send immediately sometimes it can take a few minutes for it to turn up but that's just acknowledging what they've previously done they can read that and go okay cool everything's fine and i'll go take a look at my inbox at my email inbox and the template should be in there then we've got big letters beneath it watch the video below to find out how we can help you get better results from facebook so you know we've kind of set it up that you look you're gonna have to wait a few minutes anyway in the meantime why don't you watch this video um they can't see how long it is it does i'm gonna do it in a second i'm gonna refresh this page this video will automatically start playing definitely something i would recommend so they'll probably glance at this and then start watching the video it's only 50 seconds long i think um and that's the pivot you know they've just done something we're going to capitalize on the momentum thank you very much for downloading the template watch this video below to find out how we can help you get x so obviously you can use this exact same text you can copy that get you know instead of get better results it would be whatever it is that your service helps people do remember the whole point of this video i'm going to go through in a second the whole point of this video is to get people to book a free phone call that's what we want that's what i found is by far the best way to progress people um when you're looking to to generate you know to to sell your services and generate new clients um when you're advertising online the the number one hurdle you have to come across um is that sort of connection people normally hire service providers or at least want to hire service providers that they know or someone else knows or their recommendations you have to overcome that hurdle and that's what we've done you know by this stage they've seen um a video on facebook they've opted another video of you hopefully face to camera like i've done here and you know you've started to develop that relationship with these prospects now you can sort of see why this works so well okay so let's go ahead and refresh this page and quickly go through um this short video and the elements in it hi guys my name is ben heath i'm the ceo of lead guru and i wanted to quickly say thank you very much for downloading my five part facebook ad template so you can see from the start there i've you know said hi introduced myself reintroduce myself they should already know by this point remember these people have already watched the video on facebook of me face to camera um but i'm just sort of

exactly what it is that you're looking to achieve and see if we can help you get there so hopefully you fill out the form below and we'll talk soon but either way i want to wish you the best of luck with your business and with your facebook advertising campaigns in particular thanks a lot guys bye bye so that's it really short video the whole thing is as you can see there 52 seconds long another call to action to quickly mention um i say there fill out the contact form below um when we first were testing out this strategy and we had a contact form beneath the video where they give sort of name email address and then we'd reach out to them i found it's much better to get them to book a slot directly in your calendar as i'm about to show you um it's much more time efficient you don't need a you know either yourself or a support staff member to book all the the phone calls have them do it automatically and i just didn't bother re-recording this video because it worked anyway people scroll down instead of filling out the contact form they clicked on the button and then went through the process but i would recommend if you were to be recording your video and from scratch then instead of saying fill out the contact form below say click on the button below go through to a page on our site and book a slot directly into my calendar that's what how i'd uh how i'd recommend you do it okay so let's now move on to the uh the stuff beneath it just very quickly so all we're really doing here is just reiterating the points that we put in the video just because well there's a couple of reasons why i've got this in there number one autoplay won't work on a lot of mobile devices um so this video won't automatically play and you can't guarantee that the people who opt into your lead magnet will actually um watch this and listen to this of course a lot will but some won't so we want to reiterate some of the points in the text beneath the video so you can see here we've got interested in working with us as a digital marketing agency we've worked with a wide range of b2b b2c and b2b companies helping them generate low-cost leads and sales online so that's establishing our credibility for what we've already done then say i'd love to talk to you about marketing your business online and on facebook in particular simply click the button below to schedule a call with me and we can have a quick chat to find out exactly what you're looking to achieve and how we can help you get there so the tone of this is look we're just gonna have a quick phone call it's informal you're not signing up for you know a five thousand dollar a month retainer or anything like that no obligation just really chilled and really relaxed situation where we're just gonna have a chat i can tell you how we work if you might be interested you can tell me what you're looking to achieve in your business and that's how i'd recommend you you pitch it you don't want to be too aggressive at this stage there'll be plenty of time to sort of close the sale over the phone as it were but at this point keep it keep it relaxed and then again at the beneath this we've got a great big orange button on here that stands out and we want people's eyes to be uh to be drawn to this what often happens particularly on mobile devices they'll see this page they'll their eyes will be drawn straight to the scheduler free call and they'll be like oh what's that about and then they'll read up here and have a look oh okay oh it's about you know facebook advertising services fine great i will have a quick phone call with them and you can capitalize on that momentum that we've been talking about the bottom of the page i've got some um foot navigation just like we did in the previous page it's just um i i think it comes to us a little bit more professional to have a bit of navigation on this page okay so let's now click on this button and go through to the next page which is of course an important step so when i click on this button they'll obviously be taken to a scheduling page to schedule a free call and i really really strongly recommend that you uh you do something like this by the way guys use this sort of software have them book it directly and i'm about to show you it's so much better than having all that back and forth and time spent arranging appointments are you free you know three o'clock on a wednesday no can you do 10am on a thursday um saves a lot a lot of hassle just quickly on this page i have entered in the header navigation in it so people can move around my uh my website the reason why is because this page is linked to not just as part of this sales funnel but you know with the rest of our website as well so people can be getting there from different um areas if it was just as part of this sales funnel i'd probably think about removing this um but because you know people might be getting there from different areas the fact that that would all of a sudden disappear would be a bit strange so i've got it on this page it's not a big point if someone's made it to this stage uh most people that make it to this page will go ahead and book a phone call um so you know as you can see super super simple page book a free facebook advertising phone consultation with ben heath little picture of me um and then it says come down here and you've got this so as you can see this is powered by acuity scheduling that's the software i use really good piece of software i think it's 10 15 a month costs absolutely next to nothing um and people can come in here what what i'm able to do is embed this into my site you can see this is on on my website and then people can come in here and they can you know you've got gmt they can set their time zone to start with so as i said we've got clients not just in the uk but in america canada etc um so they set their time zone and then what they can do is they can come in here um you can see nowadays i don't have much um much time availability but the black days are days where there is some availability to have a phone call with me so you could click for example on the 25th of april and you can either book a phone call with me at three or four o'clock and obviously you can set this up within acuity so that as your week gets booked up you can go back into acuity and be like out you know that slot on thursday afternoon got to get rid of those few phone calls and and do it like so and so of course the availability is completely up to you how many phone calls a week is completely up to you um i've set this as 45 minutes most don't go that long most are probably 25 minutes because what we're really doing on these phone calls is they're telling me about their business what they're looking to achieve and then i'm going to say how we work and we we sort of see it if they go together it's not a an intense scenario we're not trying to sell aggressively i'd recommend you don't do the same but it's a really good way of getting that first aid for a lot of businesses you know we do we we often don't meet our clients for a lot of businesses the point of that phone call will be just to see if they're the right sort of client for you and then obviously to set up a face-to-face meeting a lot of business will do it that way in which case your calls you know you could put that at 15 minutes and it's not going to take long at all and that means you could do a lot more obviously um but yeah but that's it so use security scheduling there are other options um other pieces of software that do similar things i know but but you know they go through here i'll just quickly show you the process let's say 24th you click at two o'clock continue they enter in their details first name last name phone number email address etc um they then complete appointment and then what will happen is i'll get an email saying you know oh an appointment has been booked in for three o'clock on on wednesday and that's fantastic so for me when i want to generate leads for my services that's all i do i just turn the campaigns back on all of this is set up so it happens automatically once once the facebook advertising campaign is on um they're automatically you know people obviously advertise that video they click on the link in the video description like they're told to they go to the landing page they opt in for the lead magnet they land on the thank you page they click on the button beneath the video they come to this page they book a free phone consultation with me and i haven't had to do anything myself i could be building other areas of my business i can be lying on the beach whatever i want and this is the point where i get the lead through um so once you've got this set up it is it is fantastic you know and think how warm your leads are by this point they've seen a video on you on facebook they've come through to your website um they've opted in for a lead magnet so they're on your email list they've then come through to a thank you page watch another video about you they've clicked on a button to schedule a free phone call with you and then they've gone ahead and scheduled that phone call it's a fantastic sales funnel for uh for generating services works incredibly well and that's it guys that's my you know the five steps to my lead funnel that's exactly how i generate leads my business that's how i've generated leads for clients it works incredibly well if you can get all the elements right and it it's not that difficult it doesn't take that long to do and you know you've got to create obviously facebook video and then the landing page and the lead back that these things can sound daunting you know and if it does take you a month to put together trust me it'll be well worth it because once you've got this up and running we've had this process running for well over a year now it makes our lives so much easier our lead generation process works on autopilot and it really allows us to scale um to scale our business so what i recommend you do first of all is go through the things in order so go ahead and watch that facebook video ad of mine the example again go through that um really sort of analyze it think about how you can use how you can modify that sort of structure and use it and how that would apply to your own business and then go through the process so click on the link in the video description and like i said in the video go through to the landing page take a look at that um opt in for my lead magnet that'll mean you're on my email list don't worry i won't spam you at all i'm just basically going to send you um really high content high uh quality facebook advertising content like the video you've just watched um go through to the thank you page and see that thank you page now what i will say is please don't book a session with me unless you are actually interested in our services um just just to give you an idea of the companies we work with they're usually in the sort of high six figure a year and seven figure and up mark um so if your business isn't that level then then it might not be best for you to book a phone call with me because you know we just won't be able to help you guys out basically um so yeah so please don't do that unless you are serious about working with us but go through the process see how it works and then look to implement it for your own business so one thing just before you go i'd really um really an ask of mine that i'd really appreciate is if you could leave a comment below this video just letting me know what service it is that you provide i'd love to know all the different services that people are gonna um offer and market with this lead funnel and then of course you could maybe come back in in a few months time and say you know this has worked really well it's you know generating leads for x amount and all that sort of stuff i would really appreciate that that would really help me out also please give the video a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to my youtube channel for more great um great content like this you know i'm really enjoying producing this long
