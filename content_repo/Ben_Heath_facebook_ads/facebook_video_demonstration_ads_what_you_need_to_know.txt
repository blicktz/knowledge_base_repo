Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook video demonstration ads. It's something I'm a big fan of and I wanted to cover some of the important things to be aware of, how you can go about getting them made and all that sort of stuff so you can get the best results possible when using this type of Facebook ad format. Before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to hit that thumbs up button and of course subscribe to my channel if you haven't done so already, that really helps me out.

Okay so I put some some simple slides together just to help explain what it is that I want to to walk through it and what it is that I want to to talk about. Facebook video demonstration ads, if there's one one type of ad that a client will say, one type of ad creative I should say, that a client will say oh we've got a bunch of these or we've got one of these, that's probably the single most exciting thing I can hear is when someone says oh yeah we've got some great videos made demonstrating our product, how it works, demonstrating our service, how it's implemented, all that sort of stuff. Whenever we hear that it's like great we know we're guaranteed to be able to get a certain level of result with that type of ad creative.

Now I'm not saying it's always going to be the best type of ad creative for your business, that's not always the case but often often it is particularly if your product or service is something a bit new, a bit innovative, a bit different to perhaps what your competitors offer which is a great place to be and helps all marketing of course right okay. So the first thing I want to say is that video demonstration ads work. So if you're thinking about what can I do with my ad creative, perhaps you've got a bit of ad fatigue, perhaps your results aren't quite what you want them to be and you're sort of scratching your head and going what can I do next, what can I put together, how can I get great results.

If you haven't already really think about video demonstration ads on Facebook and Instagram, they can work really well okay. Most businesses can use them now a lot of people think that Facebook video demonstration ads are just something that you could use with a product and perhaps a product that people don't understand like how could you possibly do it with anything else but actually if you think about the vast majority of businesses can use these. If you offer a service you could show either how the service is implemented or how your customers, users, whatever, use and benefit from the service after you've implemented it okay.

So if you sell coaching for example you think how could I demonstrate that you could probably put together a nice video of you say on a zoom call or meeting with someone face to face and then show some video footage of how they then improve their lives based on the coaching that you give them. If you've got a service where you're I don't know a roofer for example you could show how your team works and how respectful of the property they are and and how beautiful the work is after it's done. Of course products really speak for themselves and how that would work a lot of people know that okay you just you know you show the thing being used you show how cool it is how much time it's going to save people how much better it is than the alternatives.

Most businesses can use video distribution demonstration ads of course there are exceptions but don't think I'll immediately just go yeah I don't sell a cool little you know e-commerce product therefore I can't use this. No that's not necessarily true. A lot of services, a lot of other product type businesses even if you're offering something that's seen as a bit of a commodity you could still create a video demonstration ad that perhaps shows a different angle or how your customer you know maybe perhaps you've got fantastic customer support you could show how your warehouse puts things together and ships them out on time always there are things you can do around this very often okay.

Now one of the biggest pieces of advice I would have with this is to hire a professional to help you record the video and edit it as well. Yes you can do it yourself and some people can have better skills than others but for most people it's worth it. If you're planning to spend anything more than 10 grand on a campaign which a lot of people will I would say it's worth hiring the professional because you know they're often not that expensive particularly on the video editing side of things where you can hire people from from less expensive parts of the world and still have fantastic quality then the return on investment you get from that I mean professional video editing might improve the conversion rate you get from that ad by say 30% as an example okay well if it does that if you're spending more than even a bit on a Facebook ad campaign it's going to weigh more than pay for itself and if you have a campaign that you spend 50 grand 100 grand on which is probably what you plan and want to be able to do provide it produces the right results it's going to pay for itself and it's well worth doing so it can be a little bit of a leap of faith it's absolutely brutal I know if you hire a professional get video content created and it doesn't really work that does happen that is a risk something you should be aware of but I think for the most part if you're going to be committed to this strategy and this way of doing things which I think a lot of people should it really is worth hiring a professional so just go ahead and do it yeah I'm gonna talk a little bit more about that in a second so I would say that in terms of video length that's a question I get a lot about video demonstration ads is a lot of people want them to be as short as possible and I would say yes that's right but as short as possible provided you can still get across everything you need to get across like don't miss out a fantastic feature of your product or service because you're trying to get that video under 30 seconds or really trying to get that video under 40 seconds for example make the video demonstration ad as long as it needs to be but absolutely no longer than that so no fluff be quite quick cut to the chase show the great stuff about it that's going to be different for certain businesses some businesses that might be literally a 12 second video ad if it's a simple product does something really awesome and clear that's great for others that might be a 90 second or a three minute video even for something that really needs a lot of explaining okay using multiple customers in a video ad is beneficial and you know when I say customers they don't actually have to be customers you could have even people working for your company that are sort of posing as customers or actors or whatever to demonstrate how it works but what you want is you want your prospects to be able to connect with the person that they're watching so let's say you sell a product or service that has a really wide audience like anyone that owns a home might be interested in this okay if you could show in your video demonstration ad perhaps a middle-aged woman using it alongside a younger man alongside perhaps a mum with kids if you hit those different avatars then it's more likely that someone watching that will go oh that person's just like me I'm a mum with kids that person's a mum with kids they're using that product it helps her in her life therefore I'm going to be interested you know I'm more likely to resonate I'm more likely to see how this product or service would fit into my life and make it work better okay so that's something that you want to want to think about if you can is to get multiple looks in there and obviously in a Facebook video demonstration ad you could also put in a testimonial or two from a customer absolutely fantastic if you can do that often we will have separate ads for that but absolutely fine if you combine them and often can work really well if you combine them but when you're getting the the video ad putting together and you're sort of planning out okay what sort of what scenes are we gonna create here just think about actually could we have so just one person doing it all could we have three different people that are going to cover more of our target audience in this demonstration ad something to think about um you want to tick two main boxes when you're creating these video demonstration ads you want to show the process right so show how the service is implemented show how the product works like what does it actually do but also show the benefits okay so if you're a roofer you could show uh you know your team putting the roof on how quickly they do it how they respect the the client's property all that sort of stuff but also show the benefits show this fantastic roof afterwards no more water damage um doesn't it look brilliant in the street with this brand new roof all that sort of stuff okay same with the product don't just show that okay this gadget does this but maybe does this gadget help someone get something done much faster so they can go and you know sit in the garden put their feet up um have more time for themselves do they are they able to produce a better quality whatever it is like dinner if it's something in the kitchen there's you know what are the benefits associated with that product or service also think about showing that not just how it works you want to tick both boxes something to think about when you're planning these out and when you are going to get this done when you're going to get a video demonstration ad put together i'd recommend recording as much video content as you basically can often that's the way people will charge so if you hire like a professional videographer you might hire them for half a day or a day really plan that out and get as much content as you can because it'd be great if you could walk away from a recording uh day with enough content for seven eight ten different ads even if you can just get three ads out that's fantastic better than one you're much more likely to get that return on investment to see great results and have one of those really land with your with your customers so really think about how you can make that happen so as i said that might be something like a couple different people in your company are involved in the filming of this and they're doing the same thing but they just look they're different people they look different right so that then helps you create multiple versions that you can push out less likely to get out fatigue all that sort of stuff so something that's well worth um thinking about in advance okay so just some fairly quick simple easy tips but some things hopefully help you plan these out the main takeaway i want you to get from this video is to go ahead and do them there are tons of examples you can find and actually pay attention to your facebook instagram feeds and just see how many ads are
