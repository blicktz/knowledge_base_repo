Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and I thought I'd try out a new video format. So I get asked dozens of questions every single day to do with Facebook advertising related topics, whether that's on my YouTube channel, on my Facebook ads, on my Facebook advertising group, wherever it happens to be. And I do my best to answer those questions on those various platforms, but I thought it'd be useful to also create some short videos where I just explain my answers to those questions.

Because if one person's asking, I'm sure there's a lot of people that want to know the answer as well. So that's what this is all about. This is the first one of those.

Check out my YouTube channel for some more that are going to be coming shortly. So the first question I've got here is, should you run Facebook brand awareness campaigns before you run direct response campaigns? And the answer I'd give to that question is no.

I don't think it's important to run brand awareness campaigns before you run direct response campaigns. Instead, I would look to run brand awareness campaigns alongside your direct response campaigns. People don't have that long a memory on Facebook.

So if you're advertising for, let's say, a month on a brand awareness basis, and then you're going for a more direct response, so you're after leads or sales in the following month, there's not going to be that much recall from that first month to that second one, and your results aren't going to be improved that much. But if you can run them alongside each other to the same target audience, and have people see your brand awareness campaigns in the morning, or the day before they then see your direct response campaigns, or even see your brand awareness campaigns after they see the ads in your direct response campaigns, that can really boost your results, and we've seen that happen again and again. So what I usually recommend to my clients, they take around about 10% of their budget, their total Facebook advertising budget, and dedicate that to Facebook brand awareness ad campaigns, and it can really help boost the results you get from your direct lead generation ad campaigns, and conversion campaigns you're looking for purchase if you're an e-commerce site, for example.

So, hopefully you found that useful. If you did, please give it a thumbs up, and I'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.
