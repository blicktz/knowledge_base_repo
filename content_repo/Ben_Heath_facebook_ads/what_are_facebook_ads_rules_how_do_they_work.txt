Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook ads rules and explain what they are, how they work and how they can make your life as a Facebook advertiser a lot easier if you know how to use them and implement them properly. Now before I get into that I just want to quickly mention that at the end of this video when we're talking about a free Facebook advertising related resource I think you're going to find very very interesting so make sure you stick around to the end for that. Okay with that said let's go ahead and dive into what we're going to talk about so we've got an example Facebook ad account up here and you may have noticed that when you're in ads manager you're taking a look at the various settings that there's a section right in the middle here called rules I'm just going to select that and I'm going to click on create a new rule so basically a Facebook ads rule Facebook advertising rule is designed to automate certain activities so you can set up rules that basically say if this happens do this which if you think about it can be very very valuable particularly if you're running lots of different Facebook ad campaigns for either lots of different businesses if you're a service provider or perhaps you're just managing lots of different stuff within your own Facebook ad account personally and what you'll find if you you know run Facebook ad campaigns for a while is that you're doing the same activities again and again and again manually all the time and perhaps you want to automate certain things okay so let's just have a go and have a look through some of the various options the amount of combinations in here are enormous I would encourage you to get in here and have a play we're just going to go through some of the most common and talk about what we often use and also how you can go about setting up a schedule because that's a really valuable thing that you can do when you're creating a Facebook ad campaign at the ad set level it looks like you can only set up a schedule to turn ads on and off if you're using a lifetime budget which is not ideal I'm a big fan of using daily budgets with Facebook ad campaigns but actually with rules you can set it up so that ad campaigns are automatically turned on and off at certain times of the day certain times of the week etc which is really really handy and a nice workaround so the first thing you need to decide is apply rule to so what what what what is this rule supposed to apply to is it going to apply to all campaigns all active campaigns I'm an example ad set so example ad account so I don't have anything active right now but you can see I can do active ad sets active ads etc etc okay then you can select the option but the action that you want to be taken if this rule that we're about to set up is met so do you want your campaigns to be turned off a classic example being if cost exceeds x amount I want my campaigns off I'm no longer profitable do you want to turn your campaigns on perhaps there's another criteria and we can get to in a minute you can just send a notification so you're notified of a certain okay I've set up a rule so that if my cost per purchase goes above 30 dollars I'm notified because I don't make any money above 30 dollars something like that you can also adjust budget so you can see here there's lots of different criteria of um oh if my cost per result drops below three dollars go ahead and up the budget by x amount or if my cost per purchase increases above a certain amount decrease the budget and you can do the same with lifetime budgets you know you can set this up for daily or lifetime so you can see the sort of thing that you can do depending on certain criteria let's just assume for a second we're turning off campaigns then you set up your conditions so cost is an absolute classic one but there are tons of variables in here um I'm probably going to focus on some of the most common so cost per result is absolutely most common a lot of people want to automatically increase their budget if their cost has dropped um you know this is particularly the case if external events affect your facebook advertising results a lot so a classic example being uh let's say for example you were selling sunglasses and that was the industry that you're in you're selling sunglasses through your e-commerce store well I imagine that the weather is going to have a big impact on your facebook advertising results so you might want to set up you can't set up a rule to say if it's sunny outside improve you know increase my budget but you might want to set up a rule that says you know if my cost per purchase drops below five dollars I want you to double the budget and you will probably find that the days in which your cost per purchase drops below five dollars are particularly sunny days where people are sort of squinting and you know they're using the sunglasses a lot and they've left them somewhere or they've sat on them and broken them and they need a new pair um things like that another example could be the opposite where your cost per result has gotten too high and you want to either turn off your campaigns or decrease budget so for example if you're a service-based business and you're um wanting to leave your campaigns running but you know that it's gonna be really expensive for you to advertise during the black friday sales or in the last two weeks of december with christmas and new year um you can set this up so that again your campaigns are turned off or your budget drops if your cost per result exceeds a certain threshold but as i said there's tons of other options you could do it based on instead of cost per result you could do it based on return on ad spend so perhaps you need to maintain a 3x return on ad spend to be profitable and if your ROAS goes over a 5x then fantastic you want to scale up big time great you could also do it in frequency so frequency is the number of times on average that someone within your audience has seen your ad you may want to turn off your campaign once your frequency has gone above let's say a 3 because we often see campaigns start to drop off at around the 2.5x mark because of ad fatigue and things like that so perhaps you want to do that all sorts of other things you could get it to turn itself off when it's had a certain amount of spend you can take a look at all these sorts of options okay now you can also select it's greater than smaller than you can get really specific and then the time range what do you want this data to apply to okay should it apply to as you can see here the lifetime so this is the number of days worth of data you'd like your rule to apply to so the total number of days that it's been operational or you could be much more specific so you can just count the last seven days you know it's particularly important if you're doing a cost per result for example should this cost per result apply to your lifetime because let's say for example you want your campaign to reduce its budget during the last two weeks of december because your cost per purchase will be or yes your cost per lead will be really expensive well if you're applying this to the lifetime's worth of data and this campaign's been running since like february the average over the lifetime is not going to do that okay so what sort of data do you want it to apply to very very important attribution window when you're getting started with rules just don't worry about that i've got other videos on attribution windows for all sorts of things you can check that out if you want to be on my youtube channel but for now let's keep that simple okay so that's some of the options you can have a good play and start to think about how this would apply to your business then you can set a schedule now i think this is one of the most valuable aspects of using rules so continuously so the rule applies no matter what all the time or you can run a custom schedule so if i click here edit custom schedule and you can see i've got some some stuff in here i'm just going to deselect that deselect that for the time being so when would you want to use something like this well let's say for example you're a b2b business and you only want to run your ad campaigns during business hours so nine to five monday through friday okay well you can set up custom rules to turn on and off your campaigns automatically without using the schedule function and having to use lifetime budgets is a much better way of doing it so how would you go about doing that so let's say i just select monday and i want to turn this on at uh let's say 9am so i select 9am for both options here and click close now i don't want this to be so let's say turn on campaigns i don't want campaigns to be turned on if they meet certain criteria so i can get rid of that i just want them to be turned on so now this rule is set up to apply the rule to all pause campaigns all pause campaigns or if i had certain campaigns i could be more specific i want campaigns turned on if they meet no criteria just that you know there are no specificity of which they have to meet certain criteria to turn on just turn them on when edit custom schedule monday 9am close so that means that my all with this setup right now all my pause campaigns are going to be turned on at 9am and then what you could do is you could save this rule so i'll get to this stuff down here in a second but give it the name rule a name click create great and then you create another rule that turns off all your campaigns at 5pm on a monday and set it up for tuesday morning tuesday evening wednesday morning wednesday evening i know it'd take a few minutes to set that up but it's just 10 rules probably take you five minutes and if you only want to be running ad campaigns during specific times well worth doing okay so that's one of the obvious ones why you'd want a custom schedule and one of the things we use this for a lot is the businesses that don't want to run ads during certain times of the week we can set up rules to turn on turn off campaigns personally i don't use a huge amount of um here we go of these sorts of criteria in our ad campaigns things like so let me click it there we go things like turning ad campaigns on or off um if results get worse or better or increasing budget or decreasing budget if results get worse or better and the reason why we don't do that is because we're a facebook ads agency right so we're inside our clients facebook ad accounts every single day our account managers are absolutely on top of it so they know what's going on we don't need these automated rules they're going to make more of a value judgment themselves and say they'll be looking at the data they'll be looking at today's data yesterday's data the last seven days last 14 days last 30 days putting all that together and going do we think it's a good time to increase budget do we think it's a good time to decrease budget etc etc but obviously we're in a quite a unique scenario in that we're a facebook ads agency doing that we have lots of staff in facebook ad accounts all the time you may not be doing that you may be wanting to set up your facebook ad campaigns and focus on other areas of your business which is absolutely understandable in which case these rules for increasing budget decreasing budget turning off campaigns turning off campaigns if certain criteria met most likely cost results and makes absolute sense last thing i mentioned about these rules is that you can set it up so you're notified okay so if you're a little bit worried about just leaving this and you know i'd like to know what was going on still facebook automatically sets it up so i'm a subscriber here you can see ben heath my name's in there and i'll be emailed if one of these rules gets met so if let's say for example i've got a rule which doubles my budget if my cost per result drops below five dollars i'd probably quite like to be emailed to just let me know and remind me that that's happening okay because i might want to change it undo it when it comes around might happen in six months time you might have forgotten about it so i think that's worth doing but then you just give your rule a name so i'm just going to call this example rule i'm going to click create and then you can go into manage rules and in manage rules you can see all the rules that you've got set up so we've just got the one example rule it turns on campaigns etc etc very very straightforward but a very powerful tool and if you really have a think about how this can apply to your business the most common one we use as i said is is to use this basically to form a schedule but there are other ways you can do that then you can see the value in it so hopefully that video has
