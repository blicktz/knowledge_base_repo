In this video I'm going to show you how I fixed a local business Facebook ads and took them from losing a lot of money to fully booked within just a couple of months. Okay so case study time I think you guys are going to find this really really interesting and potentially really valuable because you'll be able to see what we did for this business how it might apply to yours and help improve your results as well. So let's start by giving a little bit of context around this business and so you understand the the detail the context and then you'll understand the change we made why it was so effective all that sort of stuff.

So we're talking about a physiotherapy business family owned had been for 20 plus years and they'd sort of slowly built they'd done well but slowly built to 11 locations all based in around the south west of England so kind of like a regional chain as it were. Most of their customers for those 11 locations had been acquired through word of mouth a lot of them were quite close to each other so it was a case of they'd sort of reach capacity with one location be oversubscribed then open a new one a drive away not super far not not right next door but one of those where some of their existing customers would immediately move over to the new location because that's closer and easier and so they were able to sort of do that quite organically and quite slowly is how their previous growth strategy had been and when you do it that way takes a lot of time to build that word of mouth had taken 20 plus years to scale but they reached a stage where they want to scale much faster. So like I said family-run business been going for more than 20 years and what had happened is sort of the younger generation had got involved with the family business and and this is very common is actually I started doing this with my mum's interior design business when I was like late teens early 20s I got involved helping her out and then wanted to scale much more aggressively something similar happened with this business younger generations were like right there's a formula here that works let's let's go for it.

So they recently opened two new locations sort of along that line in a new city so where I said before they were able to leverage some of their existing client base and move them over to the new locations to help get started wasn't really the case still in the southwest of England but but just a little bit further away and was was effectively a new market. So they struggled to acquire clients for this new location and they'd mostly just got their customers through referrals through being around through establishment through a long time and hadn't done much sort of cold customer acquisition previously but they decided you know did some research they thought meta ads would be a good option for their business to be able to fill up these new locations advertising to cold audiences I think it definitely was a good idea. So they tried running meta ads themselves for about nine months no success really struggled and they tried selling direct offers or just directly advertising their services found that very difficult and that doesn't surprise me at all I'll get into more details of why in a minute and what what we recommended you do instead.

They also tested a lead magnet first strategy in this case it was free guides so things like free guides on how to resolve lower back pain and like various ailments that they would actually be able to treat as physiotherapists but they found that when they did that they could generate leads they could get people to opt in struggle to get those leads to convert to clients the follow-up process wasn't great or things weren't aligned actually don't think that was the ideal sales funnel structure for them again which I'll talk about more in in a minute. So what they did is they've been watching my videos learning how to do this themselves join my mentorship program having given it a good go themselves and not really gotten it anywhere and they wanted to improve their Facebook ad results that's why they joined they thought if we can get the advice and the help and the support we'll be able to improve results I'll talk more about what happened later. So what did I change what do we recommend as part of my mentorship program in terms of the things to improve the results well I want to set some context around why we did what we did here and and that's looking at the dynamics of the business this is just a quick aside but whenever you're taking advice on Facebook and Instagram advertising it's always really important to think is that person that's giving this advice is that applicable to my situation do they have experience in lots of different fields lots of different verticals because a lot of people giving advice on ad strategy they just know how to sell the one thing and that's their thing and therefore they advise that to everyone and us as an agency we work with all different types of businesses all over the world we know that different businesses need different structures so this is a local business and that changes the dynamics significantly when it comes to advertising and the ideal strategy.

I really like advertising local businesses it's often a lot easier to advertise local businesses and there's far less competition for a start if you're trying to be the best um jewelry based business jewelry e-commerce business let's say advertising on Facebook and Instagram like good luck you're going to be competing nationally internationally against really big companies and know what they're doing like that's going to be really hard how hard is it to have the best ads for a physiotherapist in a local town where you might be only competing against three or four other businesses that are actually running ads maybe less than that depending on the size of the place maybe a few more but the bar is not going to be that high relatively easy to be the best advertiser in that space and dominate that market and because of that with local businesses the offer is incredibly important I think what's happened over the last few years when it comes to talking about offers in Facebook and Instagram ads is that so many people have read Alex or Mosey's hundred million dollars offers book they've come up with these crazy offers there's so many of them in the marketing space honestly offers that are completely unrealistic and over the top and people have become somewhat jaded with those sorts of offers and that's why I wanted to differentiate here and talk about the fact that this is a local business because that does not apply to a local business whereas if I tried to come up with some crazy ludicrous marketing related guarantee that is unrealistic alongside all the others advertising to cold audiences for our done for your services let's say as an agency that would just seem silly and just get lost in the noise but a local business you can have a better offer and have the best ads for physiotherapists in your area very quickly and easily so we felt like this business needed a new strategy needed a new sales funnel didn't like the direct offer at full price not a huge fan in this case of the lead magnet strategy either so here's what we recommended we do instead advertise a discovery session with a massive discount so it's effectively like a tripwire strategy some of you might be familiar with that term it's it's something that requires a very small and easy commitment tripwire that then makes it much easier to sell things higher ticket later on so they were they were offering existing assessment and treatment plans kind of like their discovery session equivalent and that cost 85 pounds so I recommended an 80% discount which as you can probably imagine got some pushback initially we really sort of were like I think this will really help like I think this is gonna gonna work out what I'll run you through the numbers and how this worked out in a minute but yeah that got some pushback as a lot of good offers do so the new price is gonna be 17 pounds now just to be clear we're not advertising at 17 pounds we're advertising it at 85 pounds 80% off like making that very clear part of the reason why there's a lot of pushback from the from the business owner on this one was because they this business lose money when they offer that assessment and treatment plan discovery session for 17 pounds because they want the cost of the physiotherapist to deliver on that which is gonna mean they lose money but the typical thing that clients are offered after that will be a 12 session treatment plan at 65 pounds each now some depending on what the issue is right some is going to be less some is going to be more but we worked out that's roughly the average so the average customer value after that initial session after that discovery session is 780 pounds plus of course word of mouth and referrals and this should not be underestimated with local businesses that's how this business had built to this point to begin with and they've done really well but word of mouth and referrals is so is much much bigger thing when it's a local business people feel much more comfortable recommending a local restaurant or a local anything entertainment related or something like a local physio if my friend's got issues and da da da da da right and that is really powerful it's powerful in all forms of business but more powerful with local than it is with national or international businesses so what how that factors into your marketing strategy is you might be willing to acquire customers a little bit more aggressively pay a bit more for a customer if they're a local customer because there's a decent chance that that one customer turns into more provided you do a good job with your service okay let's um hash out i'll talk about through some more details when it comes to what we recommend strategy wise and the offer so this 80 off discount on the discovery session i wanted to make it time sensitive so only available until the end of the month or something along those lines right have some urgency in there and urgency is one of the things that's going to help convince people to take action and i also wanted to include the other element that convinces people to take action and that's scarcity so they're advertising that there are only about 40 discounted assessments available because we worked out okay of the you know let's say in this location there's four physiotherapists that can offer this how many can they realistically do right well they can only do you know one or two of these a day alongside their other stuff so that's not a made-up number that was that was roughly correct uh 40 discounted sessions available and a lot of advertisers don't include information around scarcity but that's nearly always there and easy to include because if you're a service-based business you have capacity constraints like there's no way you could take on a thousand most likely new clients next month right some businesses a really small number so you can say that it helps encourage people to take action they don't want to miss out that fear of missing out makes them go oh cool it's only 40 of these in my whole town of you know 100 000 people right okay quick let's uh let's go and jump on on one of these um even product based you can say the same thing stock there's all sorts of reasons the only the only time when that's not true is going to be you know sass or something along those lines create scarcity like i said um now this client was concerned that an urgent and scarce offer wouldn't be on brand that it would not have any longevity because you're like right well what happens when the end of the month comes around and i really don't think that's something that a business like this needs to worry about having urgency and scarcity is absolutely something that luxury businesses and premium brands embrace if you think of the fanciest restaurants they have waiting lists really hard to get a table um if you think of luxury products rolex watches for example you've got to be on a wait list for some insane amount of time to even get one in the first place so like don't don't worry about that it's not it does it i think people worry it's going to come across as salesy and a bit sleazy and like no no no the the most luxurious companies in the world ferraris you have to buy i think to get a new ferrari you have to have already owned ferraris previously like there's all sorts of extra steps you have to jump through all this scarcity and if one is available you're going to jump on it immediately and things like that so that's nothing to worry about and the point about longevity that oh if we only run a sale that ends at the end of the month we've done what do we do after that do you run a new sale you can absolutely do that a lot of business owners think that that's a problem because they assume that their prospects are paying much more attention to their ads than they actually are most of your ads are going to be ignored they're going to be skimmed past they're not sort of really taken in so yes there might be a few people that see that you're running a sale last month and then running another sale this month but not many people are going to actually clock that and you can just create an offer variation you can just tie it into something else another reason to create a sale so you could have a spring sale and then a summer sale and then a my business turn seven sale and then a um it's international physiotherapist week sale and it's there's so many that you could have obviously black friday christmas any like event you just tie it into you can have a sale for every month of the year quite easily and it looked different and it'd be presented differently and it makes sense in the prospect's mind because you're going oh okay yeah that's a get in shape for summer sale that's a lose some weight before you head into the holiday season say like let's say new year whatever for physiotherapists right so all sorts of things you can tie those into and you can run these significantly lots of businesses do that i don't think you need to worry about it okay so going in a little bit more detail on why we went with this tripwire strategy and why it worked i'll show you the results in a second is that they found that selling full price to cold audiences was too hard i'm not surprised it's a reasonable commitment people know they're likely to go on a journey with a with a physiotherapist they're not just going to have the one session to be done it's most likely going to be an ongoing thing so sort of if that barrier to entry initially is high it's just a little bit there's some inertia there that you have to overcome um we didn't however want to go the other end of the spectrum and offer a fully free assessment because if we did that i think we'd end up with really low quality leads in a lot of cases that just we had virtually no chance of upselling the sort of 12 session or so package afterwards and that would waste a lot of time and cost us a lot of money so we wanted that nice middle ground i felt like with the tripwire strategy like a scarce and urgent offer where it would hit in their market would be those people that have had issue an issue for a while it's there they can live with it but it's uncomfortable it gets in the way maybe they've stopped going to the gym or stopped doing the the sport they really enjoy and something like a tripwire an 80 off offer where there's only a few slots available and it ends at the end of the month in a week in a few days something like that then it's just the sort of thing to get that person to go right okay whilst it's here i'll go ahead and get this looked at and see if i can do some rehab on my knee that's been giving me issues etc etc and it did it worked really well this sort of offer though interestingly not as effective for prospects with acute issues so i've just sprained an ankle i'm going to go to physio to help like rehab it or something like that this sort of offer is not really going to draw those people in as much because those people are probably going to work with physiotherapists anyway whether it's full price discounted that's just not that that market but that was okay because we were looking here to there's plenty of people that have chronic ongoing issues that they know they should get looked at but haven't yet that was going to fill these practices up no problem and the other ones less control over they'd come in as and when um and actually what you find is if once you've got a customer base for a business like this those people then make the referrals to the people that do have acute issues like i have it all the time i play six side football and if someone gets hurt that's when someone recommend oh i worked with a physio give this guy a call he'll help out you know that's when it happens but you have to have the customer base who have the experience with the practice to then be able to make the recommendation when something like that pops up so this is important you need to understand your customer and their mindset like where are they at what do we need to do to get them to take action who are we going after within our marketplace here and that informs your your marketing and hopefully that demonstrates what we did there so we directly advertise this tripwire offer we're not putting a lead magnet or something in front of the tripwire i just don't think that's necessary because 17 pounds it's an impulse purchase people would pay that for all sorts of things without giving it a second thought so we can just go ahead and directly advertise something relatively inexpensive like that so in a second i'm going to talk about the ad creative and what that looked like for this business specifically because that's very very interesting but first i want to let you know about hyros hyros is the best tracking and attribution software for facebook and instagram ads it's a software that all the big players including myself use i use it to track the results i generate from my own ads i also use it for all my organic content as well which is really useful so someone comes through and books a call for our done for you services for example i can see exactly where they came from with a lot of accuracy and that allows me to make decisions in my business which is really really helpful and let me quickly show you how important this is so i'm in my hyros dashboard and i've isolated one of our meta ad campaigns and i've created a report for it so we can see the data and you can take a look at this so this campaign spent just under 2 000 pounds generated 15 000 pounds in revenue but here's the really important bit reported versus revenue and in this column we can see 12 000 pounds now what that means is that out of the 15 000 pounds that this campaign has actually generated hyros has been able to report on the full 15 000 12 000 pounds of which meta was not originally able to see so if we're just looking within our meta ad account not using hyros we would have seen that 3 000 pounds of revenue was generated from this campaign and that is not true at all that is a much much lower roas number than the actual 15 000 pounds of revenue that was generated for a number of years now meta's ad tracking capabilities have not been as accurate as they once were because all sorts of privacy regulations have come into effect and it's only heading that way it's only becoming more and more difficult to get accurate data and track our results as we need to be able to do this is a relatively extreme case and the reason why is because meta has a seven day maximum attribution window and this is an ad campaign that's retargeting for one of our services that people usually take a lot longer than seven days to make a decision on so someone clicks on an ad they often won't convert within seven days meta simply not able to see that data and that's where hyros comes in the important thing is that you need accurate data and hyros takes care of that so if you want to get better results from your facebook ads without actually having to touch your ads go ahead and sign up to hyros there is a link in the video description okay so let's talk about ad creative and the ad creative we use for this business because i think this is really really interesting so we recommended creating a bunch of different stuff and this client was really good at actually going ahead and implementing and doing that remember these were part of my mentorship program so it wasn't like we do it for them it was we coach and and consult and tell them and show them how to how to do it and provide feedback all that sort of stuff um so a few different things were tested and then what worked the best by far were post-treatment customer reaction video compilations which is quite a long thing to say you've almost certainly seen this sort of thing already this actually tends to perform quite well as organic content which is great because if it's engaging enough organic content then it'll certainly work as an ad where you can control the distribution but it'll be things like someone would come in for a session and let's say they've got an issue with their shoulder and they've got limited mobility and then there's some adjustments we made and things would be loosened off and all sorts and then the person would be like oh wow i can now you know just at the end of the treatment they'll be like right moving they're like oh i'm gonna do that in ages you know that's not painful for me to move that make that movement anymore but capturing that reaction that sort of quite visceral the person's relieved they're really happy and being able to stack those so compilations of those not just the one and what we found worked best but a number of those in a video ad performed really really well i've actually talked about this before we've used this in a few different businesses where you can where you get that sort of reaction to things i've seen restaurant change do this where people like are reacting to a mouthful of something like there's lots of lots of versions of this um but it worked for this business and i'm not surprised this business is actually quite happy to be able to implement this but i have had pushback from other business owners where i've talked about doing something like this and they talk about well how on earth do you get permission um i don't think it's that difficult so with a business like this you could say do you mind if we record the session for training purposes most people are going to say yes and then provided they have if they don't have one of those like great reactions at the end then you know you don't bother asking the next question but the next question is then oh that was it seemed like you got a lot out of this it was really helpful uh would you mind if we just take that little bit of you sort of uh moving your shoulder or moving your hip or whatever and just using that in our marketing material again some people might say no a lot of people are going to say yes and you can even incentivize it you could say by the way it's 20 off the next session if you do let us do that because it's really helpful for us tons of reviews and things along those lines not too difficult we just got to be willing to to do that uh like i said best performance so far and actually interestingly in a lot of the ad creative these video compilations um we didn't even explain the offer so didn't have like a section where talking about the 80 off the initial uh assessment and all that sort of stuff that information was in there it was in the primary text it was in like a shortened version obviously in the headline and then detailed in the on the landing page but um but yeah but that was a way that was i think because the the videos themselves were so compelling and just so engaging as a creative format we didn't need those in there it didn't uh negatively hurt results in fact the ads without that performed better which is really interesting now it's not what i normally recommend for most businesses but i think in this case it was uh good to note uh like i said info including the ad copy and landing page so let's have a look at the results so the cost per sale for the initial assessment was 29 pounds now obviously they're only paying 17 pounds you're paying 29 pounds in advertising cost so you might be thinking okay losing money but we need to have a look at the uh the sales funnel and whole uh one in three clients who booked the assessment the initial assessment went on to become a a longer term customer which is an average of a 12 session treatment plan sometimes more sometimes less depending on what it was but but an average um i think the business might be able to improve that over time as well like once they do more of these and sort of get into the habit of that but one in three is a decent start so if we look at cost to acquire customer the cac uh it's 29 pounds times three so we need three people to go through these initial assessments to uh put become get one longer term customer and then we need to deduct the 17 pounds that they've paid times three because that's money that's sort of received as part of the the customer acquisition process so you're looking at 36 pounds to acquire a customer that is worth on average 780 pounds with that initial treatment run good chance they'll come back in a few years time or whenever they next have an issue good chance they'll refer etc etc now we do need to factor in in here the numbers won't be quite as good as that as 36 pounds cost to acquire customer because three people had those initial assessments so that the time of the therapists needs to be included um but you can still see that this is a really profitable sales funnel based on these numbers as 22x whereas even factoring in those costs you're still looking at more than a 15x return on ad spend so absolutely fantastic and absolutely something you can scale which is what this business did and the physiotherapist at both locations fully booked within 60 days and that's one of the great things about local you work it out and you can scale and boom you can get uh you can get all booked up and with a business like this one of the interesting things about running ads to acquire customers is that the requirement for budget is very much front loaded so you open a new location and it's empty but once you start filling up um calendars and you build that customer base and they refer and they come back over time that requirement for advertising goes down and down and down like the other locations for example a lot of those are completely full with no advertising at all it's just referrals word of mouth and they've been around a long time now i'm not saying that you know after the 60 days you turn the ads off you never turn them on again that would be unrealistic but that requirement for ad spend is going to go um down and down provided you deliver a good service that's a really important point here because word of mouth can work in the opposite can compound against you if you deliver a poor service and then it's going to work the opposite you're going to need to spend more and more of a time to get people in because there's some people being put off and don't use them and and that sort of thing but provided you deliver a good service this business obviously was that's how they've been able to build their locations um to date then you don't need to spend as much over time and you can invest that money for a business like this into opening new locations which is uh which is a great thing and then this business is once again constrained by capacity as opposed to the ability to acquire customers which is a great place to be because they wanted to be able to do that they wanted to be able to have a formula for opening new locations and filling them up quickly which will allow them to scale much faster like i said the next generation really want to explode the business and i think they might be able to do so and we've helped them get there or help them along the journey to getting there and we can do that for you as well so if you'd like me my team to help with your facebook and instagram ads a couple of different options i want to very
