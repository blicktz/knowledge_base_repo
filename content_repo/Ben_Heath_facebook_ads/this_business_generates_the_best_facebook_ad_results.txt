Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about the business type that generates the best possible results with Facebook ads. I know it's not dropshipping, it's not affiliate marketing, it's nothing that's popped up overnight. It's something that you're very familiar with but you might be surprised to hear the answer that I'm going to give in a minute.

Now before I get into action I want to very quickly ask for you to hit that like button and subscribe to my channel if you haven't done so already. That really helps me out. Okay, so what business type produces the best results of Facebook ads and the difference between the type of business you have and the results you see from Facebook and Instagram campaigns is enormous.

I'll explain that more about that in a minute but I think this is a really important question. It's really important for people who want to offer Facebook advertising services or own Facebook ads agencies like I do. You want to work out which type of business you can most easily produce the best results for.

It's also really important if you're into marketing, you've got some Facebook advertising skills and you're wanting to start a business. You're thinking what type of business should I start? What's going to deliver the best results?

Where am I going to have the most success? And the type of business that produces the best results of Facebook ads always, just no questions asked, is low competition businesses that have a high average customer value. Now you can probably start to see why that would be beneficial.

Low competition, it's not that hard to stand out from all the other Facebook advertisers advertising a similar thing. High average customer value, each time you get a customer it's worth a lot to your business. Now I'll give some examples and explain.

High average customer value businesses are often service-based businesses. You almost certainly going to spend more on a service for the most part than you are on most products. Now there are exceptions like you know houses and cars and things like that but for the most part services are going to cost a lot more than products do.

So they tend to be services and low competition Facebook advertisers tend to be local businesses. So you end up with businesses like roofers. I famously talked about interior design companies before a lot.

These you know it could be b2b as well but these sorts of businesses where when you hire that business to do whatever it is you're going to do you're likely to spend thousands tens of thousands of dollars with them. But there aren't tons of alternatives that you could use. So let's take the example of a roofer okay.

How many roofing companies are there in your local area that you could potentially work with? Well it's probably a handful depending on where you live there could be lots. But that's not going to be anywhere near as much as say if you're selling a e-commerce product on Facebook you know.

If you're selling apparel or jewelry or you know some of the more popular e-com product ranges you might be competing against 10,000 20,000 Facebook advertisers selling the exact same thing to the exact same audience. You're trying to reach the same people. Now you might be differentiated in terms of your niche and all that but that's not what I'm talking about here.

Your customers if you're selling say jewelry on on Facebook ads could buy from 10,000 other Facebook advertisers most likely. However if you're you've got a leak in your roof and you want a roofer how many other roofers could you hire? Might be 10.

Might be you know if you're in a large city might be 30, 40. Okay how many of those roofers are advertising on Facebook? Two or three?

Probably. That's it. So if you're a Facebook advertiser and you're thinking right I can compete against 10,000 other people advertising shoes or I can compete against three roofers and I can guarantee there'll be marketers in those 10,000 that are far far better than the than the roofers in your local area.

The competition there makes it so much easier to succeed and to stand out if you're advertising roofing services in a local area where there are only 30, 40 businesses that could provide the services that you provide to the customers you're advertising to. Only three or four of those are advertising on Facebook as opposed to this other side of things where you're you know if you're selling shoes the customers could buy from 50,000 different companies 10,000 of which 20,000 of which are advertising on on Facebook. So that's that's the competition side of it that is just absolutely massive and what that means is that you don't have to necessarily build a massive brand in order to get competitive advantage.

You don't have to come up with epic ad creative with influencers and all this sort of stuff that you often have to do on say the larger e-commerce scale because as I said if you know you I'm sure you've had this experience where you're into something you search for it online. You know I did this recently with a with a home gym you know with a pandemic and everything I wanted to set up a home gym in my garage. And then my whole news feed just home gym equipment boom boom boom throughout.

So you've had that experience right you have to do a lot to stand out in that environment because there's so many other providers whereas with the roofer you don't you could literally probably advertise your services advertise a free survey for example and it can work because you stand out people will click through they'll become leads. The other part of it is the financial side of it I'm going to do a little bit of massive but nothing too messy in case you know I know a lot of marketers sort of naturally don't like the math side of things. Let's say you're a roofer average customer value might be let's say $12,000 I don't think that's unreasonable you could you go from relatively inexpensive repairs that are going to be less than that but to full roof replacements that are going to be considerably more than that.

Let's say your average customer value is $12,000 okay. I would say that for a roofer if you're advertising in a country like the US and you should be able to generate leads quite comfortably for $50 each that should not be much of a challenge in fact I would say that a high quality Facebook ad campaign most likely produce better results than that but let's say $50 each and let's say you convert one in five which again someone who's really good at their job has competitive pricing is probably going to produce a higher conversion rate than that but let's be pessimistic around it okay. So generating leads $50 each you're converting one in five so that means your cost per customer is $250 because you need five leads per each customer.

Would you be willing to pay $250 to acquire a $12,000 customer on average? Absolutely now of course out of that $12,000 you've got cost of materials you've got staff to pay etc etc but that campaign is undeniably going to be profitable like it's it's almost impossible for you to not make that profitable unless I don't know you mess up the roof and you have to pay damages or something it's so difficult for that not to work whereas if you launch a campaign for an e-com situation where you've got high competition low average customer value it's very very easy for that campaign not to be profitable in fact you have to often work really hard to make that campaign profitable once you factored in cost of advertising cost of goods and all that sort of stuff whereas with the roofer that's not true at all you know I've got I've talked about I've got a case study in fact on my website you can go to leadguru.co.uk where we worked for where we've put together information on an interior design company that we ran a campaign for and I can't remember the exact number but it's in the 60s is the return on ad spend that we produced so for every this UK-based company for every pound we spent on Facebook and Instagram ads we generated more than 60 pounds in revenue and again that is really quite easy to do because if the average customer for that business is something like 50 000 pounds you know that's still spending that comes out something like 800 pounds per new customer so your budget to acquire a new customer is very healthy very very healthy but it's still massively profitable which is fantastic and and the thing is you know let's say let's go back to the roof for example where you've got twelve thousand dollar average customer value if you were advertising a service that had an average customer value of 120 so that would be uh one percent of the average customer value you know twelve thousand dollars down to 120 that's one one percent of the average customer value but it's not like you're going to generate leads for one percent of the cost so your cost per lead isn't going to go from fifty dollars down to one percent which would be fifty cents okay no chance there's no way you're generating leads now you might generate leads for twenty dollars so you could 100x your average customer value but only increase your cost per lead by two and a half times i mean that is such a big such a fantastic situation to be in not to mention that a lot of these businesses that are low competition high average customer value they're local they're service providers there's i mean there's just tons you know i i've mentioned a couple there but you could have lawyers in all sorts of fields um you know accountants bookkeepers although that can be promoted remotely so that increases the competition but there are so many anything to do with the property you know kitchen fitters bathroom fitters um landscaping um things that people spend thousands often of dollars on that you need a local company for there's going to be very limited competition um these businesses just perform super super well so not only are you looking at better lower competition levels um much better finances you're also so well protected going forward if you've got like an e-commerce business and you're operating at a 2x ross and that works for you right now if the cost of facebook ads increases at all you might be in a position situation where your campaigns are no longer profitable whereas the local service business the uh high average customer value low competition business could see a doubling in their customer acquisition costs not really bat an eyelid when we work with these sorts of businesses we're never scaling based on always the row has gotten too low it's always based on their capacity it's always like okay we start working with a roofer we get them enough business so that they're just maxed out over the next uh three months we have to turn the campaigns off that happens all the time it's always the way those go because those campaigns sit at a 40x roas you know they're not they're not worried if that goes to a 32x roas okay um it's just all about them getting capacity in their own internal systems and and and things along those lines so it's not you know it's not super exciting it's not super interesting to think of the the local service business being the one that produces the best results of facebook ads but it's absolutely true if you're an agency owner these are the best types of businesses to work with 100 these are the ones that you can come as close to guaranteeing results for as possible um and if you're let's say a marketer you want to launch your own business you're probably more leaning towards like an e-commerce setup or something i would encourage you to think about starting the starting a local high-end service business that's absolutely if i was you know couldn't operate in the facebook ads industry as an agency which is obviously my core of expertise and i was just cut down to nothing that's absolutely where i'd start how i do it obviously i don't have the skills is i would partner with someone i would partner with someone that is a roofer that is an architect that is a landscaper and i would say let's enter into business i will handle all the marketing i will ensure that we have a steady stream of leads and customers you can handle the deliverables and there's lots of people that have those skills that have landscaping skills or have um architect skills but they no idea how to market a business and that's another thing why not only is there low competitions which is just stand out but you see a lot of the marketing that say if you look at the marketing that your local local roofing businesses do it's awful not always there are exceptions but a lot of it is so old school you look at their websites and they haven't been touched in a decade and they just look terrible it's so easy to get a competitive advantage there so that's really what i would encourage you to do and i often get asked like what would i do if i started again and couldn't operate in the facebook ads world um i would run facebook and instagram ad campaigns for a you know high-end landscaper um who i partner with they'd handle all the actually doing the work i'd handle all the customer acquisition and i think that would work incredibly well in fact i know it would but given the experience that i've got the challenge will be finding someone to to take you up on that but you know there's a lot of people in those spaces that would just love to not think about customer acquisition and just get on with the um doing roofs all the time or um you know fitting bathrooms all day long as opposed to oh do i have to post on linkedin and get customers and go to networking groups and all that sort of stuff okay so maybe that's a little bit long-winded but i really wanted to to break this down because i'm gonna have more content on this in the future because i think the type of business that you have um makes such a huge difference to your facebook ad performance and i'm not saying by the way that you shouldn't run facebook ads for e-commerce businesses on uh that's not true at all like you could have fantastic success what i'm saying is to get those campaigns profitable and to get them delivering a high roas is much harder than for these local high-end service providers um you're never going to get a 60x roas with a with a econ business i mean just no chance no chance you're probably really happy with a 4x roas a lot of the time that's probably profitable now of course with e-commerce businesses because you're not advertising locally you're advertising to uh much wider audiences there's the opportunity to scale there and you might be saying yeah but if i just have a local business in my town how can i scale it well you could also then open another one in the next town over and another one in the next town over and you could expand that way but but there is you know scaling can't happen as fast um so there are definitely advantages to to running facebook ads for e-commerce business but what i'm saying is the best results from a roas return on ad spend standpoint it's local high-end service providers often things to do with the home or high-end local b2b services where you know like the roofer can pay 250 to acquire a customer if you told a lot of businesses that it's going to cost you 250 to acquire a customer they'd be like what i could never afford to pay that okay so uh yeah that's what i recommend okay before you go a couple of things i
