Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook campaign budget optimisation and compare it to ad set budget optimisation, what's commonly referred to as CBO versus ABO. I'm going to talk about the pros and cons of each, which budget optimisation strategy you want to use and which one at the end of the day is going to get you the best possible Facebook ad results. This is a question I get asked all the time, I thought it would be useful to create a whole video on the CBO versus ABO debate.

Now before I get into that I want to very quickly talk about something that I usually wait to the end of the video to talk about and because of that I'm aware that a lot of people that watch my content aren't actually aware of this and that's that my company Lead Guru offers done for you Facebook and Instagram advertising services. So we are an agency, we work with clients, we create manage and optimise Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns and if that sounds like something you might be interested in you can book a free call with one of my team members, there's a link in the video description below, just a 30 minute call, no obligation. We do ask that you have at least a 3k per month minimum budget, that's the minimum requirements to work with us but if you're interested in having a professional agency manage your campaigns, take your results to another level, we can certainly help with that.

So go ahead and book that call if you're interested. Now with that out the way let's go ahead down there and get into the topic of this video which is campaign budget optimisation versus ad set budget optimisation. Which one do you want to use, which one produces the best results.

So I'm in an example Facebook ad account and we're going to create an example campaign to demonstrate campaign budget optimisation, ad set budget optimisation and all that sort of stuff. So if I come in here and click on, I'm in ads manager by the way in case you're unfamiliar with this view, I click on the green plus create button and we'll go with the convergence campaign because that's what we're creating the vast majority of the time. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to first jump to ad set budget optimisation because that's Facebook's default.

So if I go to the ad set level here and we can see that there's a budget section and we set the budget at the ad set level as you can see just here and what that means is Facebook is going to spend that much, in this case £20 per day on this ad set and they're going to spend across the different ads according to performance. So let's demonstrate that because it'll be a little bit more straightforward. There's only one ad in there at the moment and that could be a little bit confusing but let's go ahead and add in a couple different, we'll have three ads in this ad set which is somewhat typical, we will often have something like that in our ad set.

Okay let's minimise this down. So now this one ad set has three different ads in it and we could go with new conversion ad one and just to make this, I think when you demonstrate things visually it makes it easy to understand doesn't it? New conversion ad two and let's call this new conversion ad three.

So of our £20 per day with ad set budget optimisation Facebook is going to allocate budget according to the best performing ads, the ones that get us the lowest cost per conversion. That might mean that 90% of the budget goes to add one, 8% of the budget goes to add two, 2% of the budget goes to add three, it could be they all get about a third, a third, a third, all sorts of splits. Okay depending on ad performance.

So that's what ad set budget optimisation means. Now if we jump to the campaign level and if I click into edit and scroll down to the bottom you will see that there's a section down here called campaign budget organisation which is turned off by default. We'll explain more about that in a minute because I think that's very interesting.

Now if we turn it on what will happen is that instead of budget being set at each individual ad set and that budget being spent in each individual ad set we now consolidate the budget and we're saying to Facebook not only do I want you to allocate budget across ads according to performance, I also want you to allocate budget across ad sets according to performance. So once again if we minimise this down we've only got the one ad set in here right now but if we call this new conversion ad set one and then if we were to go ahead and duplicate this and again let's create a couple of extra copies, have three of each, we would typically have say three to five different ad sets in one campaign and then say three or four different ads live at any one time. So let's give that call that new conversion ad set two and we'll call this one new conversion ad set three.

Okay so much in the same way where the ad set budget is allocated according to performance across the ads now at the campaign level we're allocating budget across the ad sets as well. So let's say for example in these three different ad sets we were testing different targeting options, some targeting options are going to perform better than others, some are going to perform worse. Great Facebook's going to work that out and spend more time on performing ad sets.

So campaign budget optimisation was something that was introduced later on as I said it always used to be, if I scroll back down to that section, it always used to be ad set budget optimisation for years and years and years and then Facebook introduced CBO, I don't know, must have been three years ago or so now. And the advantages of allocating budget across ad sets according to performance seem fairly straightforward. Firstly you're going to end up with better overall Facebook advertising results because if more money is spent on your best performing elements your average total cost per conversion is going to be better or cost per you know it's going to be cost per result so that could be a traffic campaign, video view campaign etc etc.

And Facebook quickly realised this when they first introduced campaign budget optimisation and then they started making campaign budget optimisation not long after they introduced it the default option, then they started saying that campaign budget optimisation was going to become the only option and then they seem to have backtracked since then. This that must have been two years ago they said it was going to become the only option. Any day now it never did and then not only did not do that but Facebook went back and defaulted to the ad set budget.

I don't think they did that strictly for performance reasons. I think they did that because of advertiser pressure. There were tons of advertisers that were very used to using ad set budget optimisation particularly professionals have been doing it for years and years and they didn't want that functionality to go away and I agree the functionality shouldn't have disappeared but I think it's interesting that campaign budget optimisation is not the default when and this is the first sort of big part of the video in general for most Facebook advertisers campaign budget optimisation is going to be the best option.

So you do lose some flexibility in terms of being able to allocate exactly a certain amount of budget to each ad set and there are times when you want to do that and I'm going to explain more about that in a minute but the advantages of campaign budget optimisation are real and for most advertisers what they want to go with. Okay a few reasons. Firstly you're going to get a lower cost per result on average a lower cost per conversion and you're going to do that because more money is going to be spent on your best performing elements.

Secondly with campaign budget optimisation you don't really have to worry about audience overlap between your different ad sets. Why? Because the budget is centralised and with that Facebook's delivery mechanisms are smart enough to work out okay there's significant overlap between these audiences and let's not bombard people whereas when the budgets are separate Facebook has less control over who may be seeing ads a whole bunch of times in different ad sets okay so something to be aware of when you're running ad set budget optimisation is audience overlap can become more of an issue with CBO you negate that fantastic.

The second well I suppose a third major advantage of campaign budget optimisation is the ability to have one sort of master campaign that has both cold audience ad sets and warm audience ad sets in it. You can do this obviously with ad set budget optimisation but what I love about CBO is that it's the budget is adjusted dynamically so let's say you've got four different ad sets or in fact let's let's go back to our example of three different ads let's minimise this down okay let's go back to our examples three different ad sets so let's say that ad set two and ad set three are cold audiences so interest targeting perhaps a look-alike and then ad set one is warm audience people like our website visitors people on our email list that sort of thing warm audiences are typically much smaller but typically very very effective so you absolutely want to make sure that you're spending as much as you possibly can on your warm audiences without burning them out and fatiguing them and results just dropping off because they've all seen your ads a whole ton okay with CBO that happens automatically you'll see when you turn on CBO campaign a good chunk of the budget is initially put into warm audiences and then it reaches a stable level without CBO if you're setting the budget manually for your warm audiences it's so easy to overspend it's so easy to fatigue that audience and burn it out also warm audiences change over time so you might start running your Facebook ad campaign with a thousand website visitors over the last 30 days but if you scare your campaign to do more advertising your brand grows that might reach a hundred thousand visitors over the last 30 days well having to with ABO you would have to manually try and track the budget as that audience size changes obviously you can spend a lot more the larger that audience becomes with CBO again that's going to happen more and more automatically so you may find that a higher percentage of your budget in a CBO campaign ends up being spent on your warm audiences dynamically automatically over time as those warm audiences grow again a fantastic thing to be able to to have and to take advantage of so those are the major advantages of CBO and I think if you're using a direct to offer strategy where you're directly advertising your products and services like a lot of Facebook advertisers are CBO for the vast majority people is going to be the right way to go so with that said let's um let's go ahead and jump into an ad set and then let's go to the to the budget level and talk about ABO and talk about some of the advantages so with ad set budget optimization the major advantage is you have more control and that's what a lot of Facebook advertising features and debates are it's the advertiser having more control versus Facebook themselves having more control now as Facebook has gotten better and improved as an advertising platform often giving Facebook more control gets you better results so things like broader targeting has definitely become more and more of a thing over over the last few years as Facebook's machine learning process has improved but there are times where we'll use ad set budget optimization if for example we're targeting different countries using different ad sets in one campaign well there's often times where um you know we're working with a client and they're like look we need to spend this amount in this country this amount in this country this is a budget coming from up high we don't have a choice in which case fine if we're wanting to um allocate you know you might have different product ranges and different ad sets there are all sorts of reasons where you might be really strict about allocating um budget in certain ways in which case ad set budget optimization is great what we will very rarely use ad set budget optimization for is testing it's one of the things that people often do is they'll go oh i can't use CBO because i want to test two different targeting options you can do that in CBO it may be that Facebook doesn't give much budget to one of the ad sets one of the targeting options but that's in my opinion nothing to worry about you can if Facebook has allocated far more budget to one ad set there's a reason why they've done that that's almost certainly going to be the best option for you to go with um you've got your answer you don't need to effectively waste more money on the worst performing option by enforcing more of an accurate say uh split test that's going to be more statistically significant so we rarely do it for testing we do it to have more control there are also scenarios where we will do it depending on the strategy being used so as i said if we're using a direct to offer strategy or let's say a lead magnet strategy where we're looking to build an email list first we're always certainly going to use CBO if we're using something like an omnipresence content strategy then we want real flexibility and real control over exactly how much is spent on each ad set therefore we're going to use ad set budget optimization and if you're not familiar by the way with what omnipresence content is with various different facebook advertising strategies you might be watching and thinking i just advertise my stuff there are other strategies um i'd strongly recommend you check out my facebook ads insider score so i'll include a link in the video description below it's like the most comprehensive facebook advertising course you can imagine almost 100 videos it covers absolutely everything you need to get fantastic results with facebook advertising and in that we actually teach six different strategies those are the three basic ones by the way director offer lead magnet webinar and only presence content are three basic ones we have three advanced strategies and the advanced stuff a lot of that uses ad set budget optimization because it's more advanced we want more control we want to manipulate things but i think for the majority of facebook advertisers particularly people who are fairly new to this space and definitely beginners you want to go ahead and turn on campaign budget optimization you want to give facebook more control if you're using direct to offer uh an opt-in first lead magnet style strategy that that sort of sales funnel cbo more advanced stuff like only presence content and then some of the other advanced stuff that you'd find out about in in facebook ads insiders um then um you may want to use ad set budget optimization but hopefully that has cleared up that question like a lot of facebook advertising um options and settings it's not a this one's always the best or this one's always the worst it's this is best for this scenario for your business for your sales funnel for your strategy or this one is depending on your circumstances i would say the majority of facebook advertisers are going to be using simpler sales funnels and strategies that are going to want to use campaign budget optimization but not all and some of the advanced facebook advertisers certainly aren't okay so if that's useful before you go a couple things
