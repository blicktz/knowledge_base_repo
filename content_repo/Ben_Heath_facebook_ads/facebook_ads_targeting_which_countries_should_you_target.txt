Hi guys, it's Ben Heath and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook ads targeting and specifically which countries should you be targeting? Which countries should you be running your Facebook ads in? Now obviously I'm not talking about companies where you may need to advertise in a particular country or perhaps on a local basis because that's the only places that you can deliver your products and services.

I'm talking about countries, companies that could advertise worldwide. If you could ship worldwide you can provide your online course worldwide, training consultancy, coaching, service even, whatever it is worldwide, which country should you therefore select when you're running a Facebook ad campaigns? I think the answers are going to surprise you a little bit based on the data that we've seen recently and so I think you're going to find this very very useful.

Now before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash a like on this video please click that like button that would really really help me out and that'd be much appreciated and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay so which countries should you be advertising in? So I've got an example Facebook ad account in front of me to help sort of demonstrate this a little bit and I'm in an example ad campaign and I've got an example ad set lined up.

Now I'm based in the UK as you can probably tell from my accent so the UK comes up as a default. Now what a lot of companies will do when they could ship worldwide is they'll just choose to go with the standard large fairly wealthy English-speaking countries so you've got the UK in there you've obviously got the US which is a massive market you've got Canada and you have Australia. Some people will go one step further and add in say New Zealand, Ireland as other options again similar sort of demographics to a lot of these countries but obviously the populations are much smaller you're talking I don't know five million people I think something along those lines whereas in a lot of these countries particularly the US much much larger populations.

Some particularly US based companies are going to be more US focused that's obviously the largest market by far out of out of these and some may just do US and Canada but some sort of variation of this is often what's what people go with and that's not a mistake you know if you could ship worldwide if you can sell worldwide um it's certainly one of us and obviously assuming you're an English-speaking business you operate in English you're writing ads in English lots of stuff other languages are going to obviously need different uh targeting options this isn't a mistake but and I would definitely recommend including those four countries if you can um fulfill your product or service worldwide but there's some other countries that I'd strongly recommend you adding in at least on a test basis at least for a short run to see how they perform and these might surprise you somewhat so again I'm assuming you're creating ads in English I'm not assuming you're getting ads written in other languages otherwise you may want to advertise to other countries but there's a few I would recommend you look to add in um so you've got India you have the Philippines I always get the doubles wrong so I assume that's right no probably not two peas two p let me try that again two peas on the Philippines by the looks things one I would go with um I would go with Malaysia I would go with Nigeria South Africa Singapore Hong Kong and Hong Kong now that is a much larger list than most people would go for and there's some different options here so with countries like Singapore and Hong Kong these obviously very wealthy nations on a per capita basis um with large you know a lot of people that live in these countries are going to speak English so they're sort of sort of um extras not huge population quite small that's kind of like adding on Ireland and New Zealand um it's it's not going to be a core focus what I really want to focus on for what I'm doing here and what I'm really trying to get you to do and expand your advertising horizons is in some of these countries up here like India Philippines Malaysia Nigeria what you have in these countries are very large English speaking populations vast majority of people in India speaking in it speak English it's the um the language of business and things like that we've got loads of English speakers in the Philippines Malaysia Nigeria South Africa a lot of people don't want to advertise these countries because they think well the people in these countries aren't as wealthy as people in um other countries like Australia Canada UK etc and that's true you know you look at the per um GDP per capita numbers and and definitely that is is the case so there's different you know wealth levels between these countries and within these countries and things like that you can't just lump them all in together I appreciate that but what I'm trying to get across is whilst the individuals in these locations are going to have less purchasing power than perhaps say people in the US and the UK and Canada and stuff like that there's also a lot less advertiser competition for people in India the Philippines and things like that when you are running a Facebook ad campaign you want to maximize ROAS you want to maximize your return on ad spend you can do that by finding the absolute best prospects which you may well find in these countries or you can do that by really reducing your cost of advertising so let's say that people in India are 20 as likely to buy as people in the US because your product is going to be too expensive for a lot of you know Indians and just not going to be able to purchase whatever it is that you're advertising but if it costs 10 to advertise in India what it does in the US you might have double the ROAS in India than you do in the US 20 less likely to purchase 20 is likely to purchase but only costs 10 as much you can see how you get to to double the ROAS so what I would strongly recommend and what we found is that a lot of these other nations could be fairly hit or miss so sometimes they work really well sometimes they don't seem to depend on the product or service being offered but what I'd strongly strongly recommend is give this a test quite inexpensive to do you could run this for three four five days maybe a week would probably be ideal see how it performs and then adjust accordingly the advantages to finding out that yes you can advertise your product successfully in India or Malaysia or Nigeria is enormous a lot of these countries have massive massive populations I mean India 1.4 billion people Philippines I think is 200 million plus Nigeria is 200 million plus I mean these are enormous English speaking populations where the people in those countries obviously want to buy purchase products and services so I think a lot of UK US Canadian Australian advertisers other companies should not exclude these markets from their advertising I mean look at the difference it made so we've got 810 000 by adding in these countries if we start removing these and go back to what we had before that's going to come down uh what do we have we had these for like that there we go it's come down all the way to 320 000. So the upside of finding out that yes my product sells really well in India is enormous you can scale you can spend a lot more and you may acquire customers much more profitably one thing I do want to say about using the expanded country list okay is you only really want to do that in my experience when you're running a conversions campaign if you're running a traffic campaign because it is much less expensive to advertise in some of these other countries you are going to see that Facebook's able to get you lots of cheap clicks or able to get you lots of cheap video views but obviously when you're running conversions campaign Facebook's only going to put your ads in front of people that are likely to convert so just make sure when you do this you put Facebook on your side those are countries that I've seen success with and we've run a number of campaigns for companies where we are using worldwide targeting and then we're sort of narrowing down when we see the results yes there are certainly other locations on the planet that you could probably advertise in profitably those are some of the big ones um that are worth testing as I said large population English speaking um much less expensive to advertise to so I'd recommend going and and giving that a go but if you do find others that perform particularly well for your business then by all means don't feel like you need to limit yourself to that list so potentially a bit of food for thought if you're running like an online course or even an e-commerce product try it for five days stick in some of the countries I mentioned see how it performs might make a big big difference to your Facebook advertising performance okay before you want to go a couple of free things I want to mention the first is a free webinar called three killer Facebook advertising strategies to double or more your revenue now this webinar is something we've put together based on the work we've done with our clients we know that these sales funnels these strategies that we feature in this webinar are absolutely true tried and tested they're proven they deliver fantastic results I'd strongly recommend you check this webinar out I show you exactly how these sales funnels work I also show you which of these sales funnels you should be using depending on the products or services you offer because that's very very important there's no one size fits all to Facebook advertising you need the right sales funnel for your specific offerings so go ahead and check that out completely free link will be in the video description below other free thing I want to mention is my Facebook ads mastermind group so Facebook groups got almost 50 000 members as of the recording this video which is absolutely fantastic it's an amazing community I do free live trainings in there that are exclusive to uh to that group if that sounds like something that you want to uh to be part of you'd be interested in you can ask people questions get them answered there's activity going on in there all day every day very valuable community again completely free to join and the link is in the video description below if you found this video useful it's a quick one about countries to target please give this video a like give it a thumbs up um comment below to let me know comment below if you've got any questions and of course subscribe to my channel if you haven't done so already best of luck with the Facebook ad campaigns guys give this a go and let me know how it goes and I'll talk to you soon bye for now
