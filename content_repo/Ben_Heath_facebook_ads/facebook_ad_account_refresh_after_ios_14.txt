Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about doing a full Facebook ad account refresh, when you want to do it, why it might be helpful and if you've seen Facebook ad results drop off after the iOS 14 changes, you're struggling to get them back up to where they were before, this is something that you definitely want to test and explain why and sort of how this works in a minute. Before I get into that I just want to very quickly ask for you to smash that like button and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. Okay, ad account refresh, so I'm in an example Facebook ad account, you can see there's nothing in there, no campaigns anything like that, we regularly delete stuff out here because it's an example one for me doing my videos, for internal training, all that sort of stuff right, we have a few of these and I'm not saying that with that account refresh you have to delete everything out of there but what you do want to do is get to a point where you are using all brand new elements, so brand new audiences, brand new ads, all that sort of stuff and I'm going to explain why now and how you should go about doing this and how it works.

I was talking with a really good friend of mine who operates in the Facebook advertising industry and we were trying to work out why some ad accounts have really struggled after the iOS 14 changes and it's happened so sort of immediately afterwards and stayed for this time period and we talked about the fact that okay the iOS 14 changes come in and we're seeing a reduction in the data that Facebook's able to track and it makes sense that that would hurt Facebook advertising performance and that's all true but we were talking about that should take a relatively you know that should take time to come in it shouldn't just be like an immediate drop-off because of course if Facebook's got less data on its users going forward yes that might hurt ad performance but they've still got all the data on those users right now like the day after the iOS 14 or the week after the iOS 14 changes came into effect that the latest round of changes at the end of April and there shouldn't be an immediate drop-off if it was a data reduction issue now aside from obviously the reporting side of things I'm talking about actual results because there's lots of ad accounts that have seen a drop-off in reporting but when they check their Shopify data or their CRMs they're still generating similar amounts of data so I'm putting that part of it aside but actual drop-off in real results when verified with a third-party data source and I think why would that be that it can't be a lack of data because Facebook has had all this data so Facebook still knows exactly who to target all this stuff because they've been accumulating data on those users for years and that stuff's not going to start to become out of date for a long time so it can't really be that and what we we basically talked about was the fact that it must be algorithmic okay it must be Facebook's delivery system being significantly impacted and I think that would help explain why we've seen a drop-off for certain clients but some we haven't seen really a drop-off at all and I actually put a poll out in my Facebook ads mastermind group and I think the most popular response was that there had been a drop-off but some people hadn't seen a drop-off at all like a good percentage some people only seen a small drop-off and then there are a few that have seen a big drop-off and the big drop-off is what I'm really talking about here we're thinking why is that and what what my friend said to me is he's saying that um we know that various elements within a Facebook ad campaign within your Facebook ad account are basically assessed by Facebook and Facebook has an opinion on them okay so let's say that you've targeted a certain audience you've accumulated data by advertising that audience Facebook basically has an opinion of how well that audience responds to your ads and as we know Facebook wants to reward advertisers that produce a good experience for their users by lowering CPMs by increasing reach all that sort of stuff and likewise they effectively want to punish or discourage advertisers where there's really no engagement ratings there's low quality rankings um and you're going to see higher CPMs you're going to see worse results and Facebook does that because they want to ensure that users aren't annoyed by advertising the platform makes a lot of sense it's a good job that they do this for all our sakes so Facebook's been collating opinions not only on say how your business performs when it advertises to a certain audience but also how your ads perform when they're advertised um and it's basically yeah that's a good way of thinking about it opinions around various elements now if after the iOS 14 changes some of that seems to have gotten confused mixed up ads that you know we've we've had campaigns that we've run that have been go-to's for clients we've worked with for a number of years and they worked every single year right really well worked every year and we've tried running them again just nothing and you think well that's that's really odd this was a go-to that we know worked yes it fatigued so we had to turn it off for a while but we knew we could bring it back those ads and things like that and I think what was what we talked about it makes a lot of sense is that algorithmically those old elements have gotten confused so what I would encourage you to do when I talk about ad account refresh is make sure that you don't have to delete your exist your old campaigns leave your your campaigns in there but turn everything off that's old and basically start with everything that's new so don't use any old ads completely fresh new create creative could be very similar and you could even probably recreate some ads from the past but make sure it's new ids ad ids post ids all that stuff right with your audiences okay go into your audiences tab and don't just use the same lookalikes or um you know the same custom audiences on your retargeting go in and actually re-upload your email lists or recreate the website visitor custom audience that you can create a lookalike audience from and I'll include links to things around lookalike audiences and custom audiences in the in the video description below in case you're not familiar with that but even if it's just recreating the elements that you've already got I think that's worth doing we've tested this with a few clients and seen an improvement in results I think what you're doing there is even though let's say you've got a lookalike audience based off your email list now if you were to delete that audience and create a re-upload the email list create a new lookalike audience based on the back of it now they're effectively the same thing right there's no sort of difference in technique there but Facebook will have to form a new opinion under the new conditions around that audience because obviously algorithmically how that's going to work is that's that's a new thing that's a new target audience to be advertised to and therefore new opinions have to be formed we think that that's if that's the issue behind some of the drop-off after the iOS 14 stuff is that Facebook's opinions on your you know it's a bit of a weird way of putting it but I think it works opinions on your ads your audiences things like that are confused well how about you just give them new stuff to create new opinions on okay hopefully that makes sense so you don't have to get to the point like in this example ad account where you've deleted everything out but pause all your existing campaigns um and create new elements so new ads and new audiences obviously new campaigns as well and try running those even if it's the same even if you've got the same lookalike audience based on purchases as you've always had but just literally recreate it and run that new version I think that that will help some people that that may be where we've seen some of the issues with a campaign reset with a refresh so I've talked about just refreshing campaigns before so that would involve um pausing your existing campaigns duplicating them and then running the new version but I think what some people are running into with that the issue there is that once you pause the old version you duplicate it and run the new version Facebook is still going ah yeah but that's that same audience so those are those same ads so you know we're not gonna treat it well basically we're not gonna test it out we're not gonna do all this stuff whereas if you have new ads and new audiences I said even if they're the same but the ids are different so the way Facebook will treat it and delivery methods will be different they have to form a new opinions new engagement rankings new quality rankings things like that um that seems to be helping more if you've already tried a campaign refresh and it didn't work or it worked for a little bit and dropped off or it worked just a little bit but not as much as you want you still got just a big drop off I would be looking to do an ad account refresh so don't delete all your old stuff because you don't want to lose all that data but recreate all the elements bit time consuming I know but I know people will be very willing to do that if you've seen a 40 drop off in results and you just cannot get it back and your business is reliant on Facebook I'm sure you'll try just about anything to get your results back up um to where they were so if you do do this let me know in the comments this seems to be um a little bit hit and missed like quite a lot of this iOS 14 stuff but if it does hit that could be absolutely fantastic for you um and yeah I'd be very interested to know what what did it and what didn't when should you not be using a Facebook ad account refresh I think that's an important thing to talk about if you haven't seen a substantial drop off in results post iOS 14 I would not be looking to do a full Facebook ad account refresh I think that is I was gonna say dangerous that sounds like a bit bit bit that sounds a bit hyperbolic to be honest but it's not it's risky it's risky to you know recreate all your lookalike audiences recreate all your custom audiences if you've got a campaign that's still performing or it's maybe dropped off just a bit but not a huge amount you could end up with a worse situation um than that but if you've seen a big drop off and you don't have a huge amount to lose I think it's certainly worth testing certainly worth trying um you know that may have made it sound a little bit dramatic I think most accounts could do this and they'd be fine but just you don't want to mess with something that's working well is basically what I'm getting at here okay so hopefully uh hopefully that makes sense okay couple of things
