Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from LeadGuru and today's Facebook advertising question is, should I advertise on Facebook or Instagram if my target market is 18 to 23 year olds? Now most people would think that Instagram would be the better advertising platform if you're going after that younger demographic. And you're likely to see that 18 to 23 year olds are a lot more active on Instagram than they are on Facebook.

Many of those may not even have Facebook ad accounts. But what I'd recommend, and I recommend this with a lot of Facebook advertising questions that I get, is test both. It's very easy within Facebook ads manager to test Instagram as a placement option and to test Facebook as various different placement options.

And you'll very quickly see which produces the best results. You can go into ads manager, you can look at breakdown and look at the breakdown by placement and see what your cost per purchase or cost per lead or whatever it is that you're advertising is on those two platforms. So very quick and easy to test, that would be my recommendation.

What we tend to see when we run campaigns for our clients is that it's less dependent on the age of the audience, although that is a factor. It's more dependent on the type of business and the products or services being offered. So we tend to find that fashion based apparel brands, things that are very visual, perform very well on Instagram.

Most other businesses, particularly service based businesses, anything a bit more serious, a bit more B2B, tends to perform better on Facebook. But as I said, test. You might find out that the one you didn't expect is your winner.

Great, you can then focus on that going forward. So hopefully you found that useful. If you did, please give this video a like and subscribe to the channel and I'll see you soon.

Bye bye.
