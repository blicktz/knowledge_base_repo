If you're new to Facebook ads or you've been running Facebook ads a while and you're not getting the results that you want, there is one ultimate Facebook ads tip that is more likely to massively improve your Facebook ad results than anything else and in this video I'm going to share it with you. So the mistake that a lot of Facebook advertisers make is they try and work everything out for themselves which of course is possible but it takes a lot of time, a lot of money and a lot of effort. It's much better to model from people that you know are successful that can massively shortcut your path to success.

Now you may have heard this before but in this video I'm going to break this down and show you more detail and show you exactly how I would recommend you go about doing that. And just to emphasize how important this is, even me, I've spent more than a hundred million dollars on Facebook ads. I've been advertising in this space for more than 11 years and even me, I still do this.

If we're going to look into a new market or something like that, we're going to find the people that we know are successful, take a look at what they're doing and model from them because it massively shortcuts our path to success. I will look for you. I will find you.

And I will model from them. Okay, so that's the overview. Now let's get into the tactical.

Go to the meta ads library. It's a completely free tool that meta provides. You can just go to Google and search for meta ads library.

Click on the link and you'll come through to a page that looks like this. Okay, and then we've got search ads here. Now there's a few things you need to select before you go ahead and start searching.

The first thing is the country. Now this is defaulted to the United Kingdom because I'm in the United Kingdom. And the important part to note here is that the country you select is the one in which the ads are shown, not necessarily where you are.

So I'm based in the UK, but I might want to see what an advertiser is running ads wise in the US. Therefore, I need to go in and change this country, just to be clear, because people have made that mistake before where they're potentially based somewhere else and they're looking thinking, none of my competitors are running ads. No, no, they're just not running ads in the country you're in.

They're running ads in the country they operate in. Okay, so select the right country. And then we've got ad category.

I'm going to go ahead and select all ads. I'm going to talk about the other ad categories. You'll see that those are the same as the special ad categories.

But I'm going to go ahead and select all ads. And then you want to find specific advertisers. So what do you want to do here?

Start by looking at your competitors and ones that you believe are pretty successful. Maybe you see ads for popping up against. So let's say someone in my space in the Facebook ads world, Facebook ads agency world, wanted to take a look at my ads to see what we're doing.

So they could come in and search for me and Heath. And this will pop up. And obviously, just make sure you select the right one.

Like I have, unfortunately, some copycat accounts. But this is the right one. The following sizes are significantly larger.

Okay, so you click on here, and you come to this page. Oh, one thing quickly mentioned on this. Obviously, my company name is Heath Media.

But what you're looking for here is the Facebook page or the Instagram account. And that's all under my name, Ben Heath. It's just something to be aware of in case you're trying to find an advertiser, like a business, and you're thinking, oh, it's not popping up.

Maybe they're not. They don't have a Facebook page. They almost certainly do.

You just might not be finding it. You might need to work out what their Facebook page is, and then come back and search in here. Come on in a sec.

Take a look at this. So this is in my mentorship program, right? And the results from Wind's channel, and Tara has said this.

In two weeks of joining, my ROAS went from 0.7 to 8.03, and I've only implemented maybe 30% of the feedback that's given me so far, which is just, that's just incredible. That's awesome. So Zoe up here, she joined the mentorship program with 35,000 raffle tickets.

I was thinking she wasn't going to sell them. And she ended up selling out completely with two days to spare. And we've got loads of others in here.

We've got tons of people just sharing information around how they've done well, great results they've got. If you're interested, you can click on the button beneath this video. That'll go through to a page on our website.

You could book in a free, no obligation call with one of my team members to find out more information. Hopefully we get to work together. Hopefully you join and you'll be sharing fantastic results like Tara and Zoe have done just here.

Okay. So now that we have me selected within the Meta Ads library, there's a whole bunch of information that we can get from this page here, which is absolutely fantastic. It's great that we have this as a free resource.

This has mainly been created for privacy reasons and try and create a lot of transparency around their ad platform. But it's also great for us meta advertisers to be able to use this for competitive research and things along those lines. Right?

Okay. So firstly, we've got 20 ads running. That should probably be a little bit of a lesson in itself that the successful advertisers are usually running more ads, doing more tests than the ones that are less successful.

Just a little aside there. But then we can specifically see the ads that are running. We can see a whole bunch of information.

So from this screen, we can see the primary text. We can see the headlines down below. We can see the ad creative in a lot of cases.

And you can see all the various options and they're done chronologically. Right? So we've got launched in November 24 up here.

We got launched in October 24 down here. And then we can click in and see more details. So if we can select this ad, for example, we can click on see ad details.

And we can see more specific information. You know, started running on October the 25th. So very specifically when this ad was first launched the platforms that it's running on, you know, is it Facebook, Instagram, audience network messenger?

Yes, it's all of them. Sometimes you'll see less if that's not the case. This ad has multiple versions.

This one has headline variations, primary text variations, things like that. You can read through the exact primary text. We can watch the creative.

And listen to this. And this is an ad for our done for you Facebook ad services. So that we're playing with being really direct.

I've got a whole video about video hooks, by the way. And that's an example of like an aggressive video hook to try and grab people's attention. I'll include a link in the description in case you want to check that out.

And we've got the headline that's operating. We've got the call to action button, all that sort of stuff. And you can see, like I said, ad has multiple versions, and you can have a look through.

Then there's some extra information. Now this is going to be dependent on where you are advertising this extra information. Okay, so we've got this European Union transparency.

So if I go ahead and click on this, we can see that this ad, so this is ad for our done for you services, primarily a retargeting ad. So we're putting it in front of our warm audiences. And we're targeting our most lucrative markets, like we welcome clients all over the world.

But there are ones where we get the majority of our customers from. And they're going to be sort of the big English speaking countries, right UK, US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, there's like a classic, you know, sort of Western, larger English speaking countries. Now obviously Ireland is within the EU.

So because Ireland is within the EU, extra information is provided. Now if you're advertising or your competitors are advertising to EU countries, you will see some extra info, which is really handy. Firstly, where you're advertising, the age, gender targeting, you can see the reach of this ad is just 512, which is the reach of this ad will actually be much larger, but it's just, you know, of the people from within, in this case, Ireland.

So relatively small country, small population, not much of a budget is spent there. So it's only reached a handful of people. And you can see the breakdown.

Other countries, you won't see this breakdown. But because this one is being shown in the EU, then then we get a little bit more information from here. Okay, so this is the ad itself.

Obviously, you can take a look at the details of it, you can go through the creative, you can really study that you can look at the headlines and the primary text and that stuff. Really, really useful information. You can also do this.

If you click on the call to action button, you get taken through to the place that people are taken to when they click on that ad. So basically, you can then see that business's sales funnel. So this is really helpful for strategy.

So here you can see that, you know, we're coming through to a page on our website about our done for you services. So if this was a competitor of yours, you could come in and you could take a look at, okay, where do they send people? Do they send people to a lead magnet page?

Are they sending people to a direct book a call page? Are they sending people to a woman where they purchased the product? Is it the homepage of the website?

Are they sending them to a testimonial page? Like, where are they going? And then you can click through and then you can also follow the steps, right?

So like, okay, they click through here and then they click on like, get started now. And then they, okay, there's an application to see if they want to work with them from a, from a done for you standpoint. And you can get some really useful information going through a term that's commonly referred to as funnel hacking, like go through in detail their sales funnel.

So you've got the whole picture of what that business is doing right from the ad all the way through to purchases that they're using upsells, all that sort of stuff. Really, really useful information. Doesn't take very long to do this, but boy, can you learn a lot of stuff?

Like you can cut your, your learning curve down by months, even years by going through this exact process. Now we'll get back to the video in a second. Before I do, there's something really important I want to quickly let you know about.

Hyros is the best tracking and attribution software for Facebook and Instagram ads. It's a software that all the big players, including myself use. I use it to track the results that I generate from my own ads.

I also use it for all my organic content as well, which is really useful. So someone comes through and books a call for our done for you services, for example, I can see exactly where they came from with a lot of accuracy. And that allows me to make decisions in my business, which is really, really helpful.

And let me quickly show you how important this is. So I'm in my Hyros dashboard and I've isolated one of our meta ad campaigns and I've created a report for it so we can see the data and you can take a look at this. So this campaign spent just under £2,000 generated £15,000 in revenue.

But here's the really important bit, reported versus revenue. And in this column, we can see £12,000. Now what that means is that out of the £15,000 that this campaign has actually generated, Hyros has been able to report on the full £15,000, £12,000 of which Meta was not originally able to see.

So if we're just looking within our meta ad account, not using Hyros, we would have seen that £3,000 of revenue was generated from this campaign. And that is not true at all. That is a much, much lower ROAS number than the actual £15,000 of revenue that was generated.

For a number of years now, Meta's ad tracking capabilities have not been as accurate as they once were because all sorts of privacy regulations have come into effect and it's only heading that way. It's only becoming more and more difficult to get accurate data and track our results as we need to be able to do. This is a relatively extreme case.

And the reason why is because Meta has a seven-day maximum attribution window. And this is an ad campaign that's retargeting for one of our services that people usually take a lot longer than seven days to make a decision on. So if someone clicks on an ad, they often won't convert within seven days.

Meta's simply not able to see that data. And that's where Hyros comes in. The important thing is that you need accurate data and Hyros takes care of that.

So if you want to get better results from your Facebook ads without actually having to touch your ads, go ahead and sign up to Hyros. There is a link in the video description. Okay.

So one thing you can't see in here, in the Meta ads library, other than the stuff, the smaller information that we can see within the European Union transparency section, is that you can't see the results that an advertiser is getting. Okay. So you might be thinking, well, hang on, shouldn't I only be finding ads to model from that I know are working?

Like, how do I know these are working? I don't want to go ahead and model from ads and put in all this time and effort to replicate something that isn't actually producing results for this business. Well, I've got a trick for working that out.

So what you want to do is when you come through, you find an advertiser, when you're competitors, you see they're running ads, is you want to scroll down to their oldest ads, the ads that have been running for the longest. Why do you want to do that? If an ad has been live more than three months, definitely more than six months, the chances that that ad is successful is very, very high.

Why? Because if that ad wasn't working, the business would have just turned that off. Yes, you might find some rare cases where businesses just continue to lose money on an ad for six months plus on end, but that's very rare.

Most of the time, those are going to work. Those are going to be the most successful. So you take a look at these ones at the end and you think, okay, what format are these?

What creative are they using? What primary text? What headlines?

What hooks? What call out methods? What's their sales funnel structure?

What have they been advertising the longest? So you can see the oldest ads that we've got running in September. So those are, you know, three plus months old.

These are ones you could potentially model from. I think these are actually advertising a webinar of mine. Now I obviously refresh my ads very often because like it's literally my whole thing, right?

Is ads, but you most businesses won't do that as much and they will leave previous best performers running. You absolutely want to come in and have a look at that and model from those primarily because like I said, those are far more likely to be successful. A couple of things to note around this.

When you are modeling from other ads, make sure it's ones that you can actually replicate. Like you don't want to attempt to model from something and create your own version of an ad if they have much larger budgets for creative and you're going, I'm not sure we can actually pull that off. That's fine.

If you see ads like that, that's fine. Just go, we can't do that. We'll keep going and we'll find some others.

And you don't just have to look at the one competitor. You could look at multiple competitors. You could look at large competitors.

You could look at smaller competitors and find the ones that are working for them and keep going until you find where you go, oh yeah, we can pull that off. We have the production capability to do that. We could, I could make that creative.

I could do something along those lines. So that's an important thing to say is to just keep going until you find the ones that are more realistic. Another thing to point out is that when you do find ads that are working really well, don't directly copy.

A, they're not going to like that. You don't want to make enemies within the industry. It's just not beneficial.

B, it's probably not as likely to be as successful for you because there's going to be differences between your businesses and theirs. Therefore you don't want to copy. You want to model from.

So how about same ad format? Okay. They're using video ads that are face the camera with aggressive hooks and their ads are about 15 seconds long.

Great. Use all of that, replicate all of that, but don't literally recreate the exact same video. It could be similar, not exactly the same.

Same with your ad copy and your, and, and your, your primary text and your headlines. Okay. They're focusing on the fact that our product really helps people save time in the mornings.

And that's why they should buy it. Hmm. Okay.

All their ads have been running a long time seem to focus on that. Maybe that's their best performing benefit associated with their product. We can use the same thing.

We can talk about, we're not going to copy it word for word, but we can talk about the same benefit that is, is true about our product as well. And one other thing to note is that all these are active ads. You can see they've all got this green active at the top here and meta's default is putting in a filter for us, active status, active ads.

Now that's because we selected all ads and I'm not running ads within any special ad category. If however, you are looking for ads specifically in one of these special ad categories, if your business falls in one of these special ad categories and your competitors likely fall within one of these special ad categories, and you're going to have to, they're going to have to run ads from within these like housing, employment issues, et cetera, all these options here. And when you do that, you have the opportunity to see inactive ads as well pop up here.

Don't make the mistake of finding an ad. You think, Oh, this ad was launched 18 months ago. It's in here.

Therefore they're still running it. Therefore it's successful when actually it might just be inactive as in they ran it 18 months ago, but they haven't continued running it. You don't want to therefore model, um, from that necessarily because they turned it off at some point, they decided it wasn't working as well.

So just something to be aware of. You could literally even put the filter on as meta done automatically with this little filters option here saying active status, um, active ads, just to make sure you don't slip into that, which can happen for businesses operating within a special ad categories, uh, these options over here. Now, given you watch this video, I imagine you are very much interested in improving your Facebook ad results.

If that's the case, I'd strongly recommend you check out this video in it. I condensed my 11 years of Facebook ads experience and share the tips, tricks, strategies, the lessons that I learned the hard way spending tens of millions of dollars on meta ads over the past 11 years. Go ahead and give it a watch.
