Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to give you five steps you can take right now and you can make sure you keep taking as you operate your Facebook ad account to protect your Facebook ad account to make it much less likely that your Facebook ad account is going to be disabled and you'll lose the ability to advertise on Facebook. This is something that a lot of Facebook advertisers are struggling with is to get their Facebook ad account disabled, they can appeal but it takes ages to get it back or maybe they never get it back at all and it's something that if Facebook and Instagram advertising is an important part of your marketing mix of how you're going to grow your business something you absolutely want to avoid is what I'm going to show you how to do in this video. Before I get into that I want to very very quickly ask you to smash that like button click that thumbs up button that really really helps me out and is much appreciated and of course subscribe to my channel if you haven't done so already.

Okay so I've got five steps I'm in an example Facebook ad account here I've got I'm at the ad level because I think most ad account disabling issues result from what you do at the ad level and if you want to avoid your ad account being disabled you need to make sure that you don't have too many ad disapprovals I'm going to talk about that a bit more in a minute but I'm going to go these five steps here I've got some notes that I want to want to talk through. Now the first one is to reduce the number of ads that you get disapproved so an ad account being disabled will usually not always but usually come off the back of a number of ads being disapproved okay Facebook haven't officially confirmed this but it seems to me that there's a certain number of ads that you can get disapproved or perhaps that's not a good way of looking perhaps a better way of looking at it is a certain percentage of overall ads that get disapproved that can lead to an ad account being disabled so let's say for example you created 100 new ads if you were to get 30 or more of those disapproved I think there's a good chance that your ad account is going to be disabled obviously if you get 50 or 60 of those 100 disapproved there's a very very good chance your Facebook ad account is going to be disabled so you want to reduce the number of ads that you get disapproved when you're in a Facebook ad account like I am here and at the ad level creating your creating your ads and there's a number of ways that you can go about doing that now there's the obvious ones around make sure you are aware of Facebook advertiser policies and make sure you abide by them and make sure you don't do anything that that breach the rules I'm going to talk about some more specifics on that later but what I want to mention now that I think is something that's a bit of a no-brainer is to be cautious in how you introduce ads into your ad account so instead of creating 18 new ads you're going to run across all your different ad sets perhaps just create one or two ads put those into your ad accounts submit those for review and see how they do if they get approved great well then you can perhaps duplicate them across other ad sets or create ads that are similar to those that you think are likely to be approved but you don't want to go ahead just add in 18 new ads or 10 new ads see that they all get disapproved 24 hours later or two hours later however long Facebook takes to um to get round to it because that's going to be a black mark against your your account okay so um just a simple easy thing you can do whereby you're being cautious slowing down how you introduce ads into your ad account and just make sure you don't boo 12 ads disapproved that takes down your whole ad account in one go or you do that a few times ad account gets taken down and then you've got a real uphill battle trying to get it back when it's easy just to introduce one or two ads today see how they do do they get approved great then go and introduce them into all the other ad sets or other campaigns or create ones that are similar to that for testing okay that's a bit of a bit of a no-brainer is to introduce ads slowly make sure they're approved first and then go up go on and um and get it sorted okay the next thing is around special categories if you think that you may fall within a special category with your Facebook advertising efforts um even if you're not sure maybe you do maybe you don't it's always best to err on the side of caution and say yes i'm part of a special category and run your ads accordingly now if you're part of a special category then and special categories if you're not familiar at all refer to things like any political issues housing there's a whole bunch of criteria and i've seen i've spoken to a number of advertisers that thought they weren't part of a special category ran Facebook ad campaigns Facebook flagged that they were or potentially should be um a special category advertiser that got their ad account uh taken down so it's definitely something you want to be avoid as a special category advertising within a special category the downsides are that you have some unlimited functionality so you can't target as well and there are various things that you can't do so it's not ideal but much better to operate with those restrictions than to potentially get your ad account banned and not be able to operate at all okay so if in doubt operate as a special category say that you are a special category even if you think there's a chance you might not be it's much better to go that way around so that's a that's an easy one uh make sure you get set up if you want to find out more about special categories i don't have a video on that specifically i will do at some point but for now if you just google uh Facebook ads special categories Facebook have got great support doc all about that you can read through it strongly recommend you do okay step number three is to avoid any obvious attention grabbing stuff and this can happen and this is why i'm at the ad level because you could put this for example in your primary text you could put this actually within the ad creative itself it's something that Facebook advertisers used to do a lot where you might have someone in a video waving a hand turn the sound on all that sort of stuff and you may even have it in your copy so in your primary text you could have like stop in all capitals 11 exclamation marks Facebook does not like any of that stuff they don't want things that overly interrupt their users remember Facebook is very much interested in protecting its platform and making sure that advertisers don't make people go oh i'm not using Facebook i'm not using Instagram anymore their advertisers are awful they're really annoying popping up all the time so we definitely need to avoid that um so Facebook definitely to avoid that sorry and therefore we need to avoid doing any of those tactics do they work yes unfortunately they do can we use them no every now and then you'll see an advertiser getting away with it but it's not something i'd recommend at all so that would be step number three is to really make sure you avoid those overt obvious attention grabbing tactics i know that's good marketing but if it doesn't fly with Facebook you can get your Facebook ad account disabled and that's not what we want we want to protect your Facebook ad account because we know how important that is okay point number four is to be very very careful with bold claims in your copy so this is typically going to be in your primary text it could be an image on an ad it could even be in your headline of course um but when you are putting in the messaging around your product or service often you're going to very naturally want to include things like our product has been shown to produce or um our serve our customers report x happiness something like that what you need to to to work out is how credible that claim sounds whether or not it's true now hopefully you would only be putting true claims into your ad copy or your creative or whatever so you know if you're making things up or lying stop doing that like for many reasons not least of which because you can get your Facebook ad account disabled um but even beyond that even true real claims be very careful making very bold claims if it's the sort of thing where someone watch it and go read it and go what really i can't quite believe that maybe leave it out of your Facebook ad copy again i know that's not good marketing much better to have those bold claims if you can back them up in your Facebook and Instagram ads or in any form of advertising but Facebook doesn't like it particularly if it's on any topics that they might be a bit more sensitive around so if it's anything to do with health anything to do with uh someone's finances very very careful and of course anything political issue related bold claims something you want to avoid if you did want to test a bold claim either go well you know 94 of people did use our product and saw uh you know saw their skin improve for example here's what i recommend you do because i don't just want to say like never use that because it's obviously a really important component of your marketing here's what i do introduce that ad one ad with that copy along with a load of other ads that you think are highly likely to be approved okay so let's say you've got an ad copy variation that you've been running for a few months you know it works why not introduce six or seven new ads with that copy perhaps with different creative different images or slideshows or whatever you're basically pretty confident those are going to be approved and then one ad with a new bold claim to see if that gets approved or not that way the worst case scenario should be the one ad with the bold claim gets disapproved the others will get approved and facebook goes oh you know their algorithms like okay their percentage of ads that are getting disapproved is not increased massively this is not something we need to look into we don't need to disable their ad account then if the bold claim ad gets disapproved okay you know you can't use that and that's annoying but just something you have to live with if the bold claim ad gets approved then you could look to roll it out into other ad sets and perhaps use it with other creative options and all that sort of stuff that's again how i approach it because remember you always got to be thinking how can i make sure that the majority of the ads that i am submitting to facebook for approval get approved that's a just an overall impression that you want to to put it's why so many new ad accounts get disabled it's because they launch you know five new ads four of them get disapproved boom that's 80 of all ads being disapproved ad accounts get disabled you've then got probably weeks of trying to get it back if you can at all um so something to be aware of okay and then number five and it's not something everyone's going to be able to do and not something you might be able to do very quickly it's to spend as much as you possibly can now again facebook would never confirm this but i can assure you that ad accounts with more history with larger ad spend are certainly uh better insulated against getting disabled um whenever you see those ads whereas a facebook advertiser you're looking at it and you're going how on earth do they get that ad approved how is facebook allowed to run that that violates policies here here here and here it's probably because that ad account has seven figure plus spend in it maybe even eight figure plus spend and facebook like a lot of businesses naturally you know the higher paying customers get slightly better treatment and it does happen with the approval process so um it's it's something i more wanted to tell you than necessarily a step to get your ad account um protected although you know if you are you know if facebook is such an important part of your business and you're looking at um protecting that you know facebook ads so important you're looking at protecting that because that's how you acquire the majority of your customers scaling up campaigns to potentially where they produce a slightly less roas but more volume might be beneficial not just from a sales volume customer acquisition standpoint it might also be beneficial from protecting your customer acquisition channel which is facebook ads ad accounts with seven figure spend in them very rarely get disapproved you might have a bunch of ads sorry disabled you might have a bunch of ads disapproved but it's very unlikely it's going to get disabled okay um which you know probably isn't that surprising but something to be aware of and also something to factor into your advertising and that you need to be more careful with a new ad account with less spend facebook's going to be more trigger happy and disable that ad account than one that's been running a year that has tens maybe hundreds of thousands um spent in it and even better if you're running you know we've got ad accounts that have been live eight years seven eight years they've got tons and tons of spend um in them that are highly highly unlikely to get disabled they might still get ads disapproved but the ad account itself is protected okay so the five steps to protect your facebook ad account help you stop getting disapproved and disabled sorry are reduce the number of ad disapprovals okay introduce ads one at a time be very careful with what you put in there um make sure you keep introducing ads that you know are likely to be approved based on previous ads you've run get that disapproval percentage down as much as possible number two if you think you might fall under special category if you have a smallest inkling you're going to fall in special category say that you are better safe than sorry number three is to avoid any obvious attention grabbing stuff waving in videos too much grammar big capitalization stop in ad copy nope none of that unfortunately number four is to be very careful with bold claims particularly if you're in medical or financial industries anything like that even if it's true be very cautious and how you introduce those and number five is to spend as much as you possibly can in your facebook ad in your facebook ad account the more spend you have an ad account the better protected it is against getting disabled in the in the first place okay so hopefully that's been useful before you go a few things i want to
