Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to give you three keys to success with Facebook's app install ads. So I've ran campaigns, Facebook advertising campaigns designed to generate app downloads and app installs for a number of different companies and Facebook's a fantastic place to go after app installs. The targeting options are really specific, the platform lends itself really well to that sort of advertising and I've been able to generate app installs for a low as $1.50 each and that's in really expensive markets that's in sort of European North American markets usually cost quite a lot to advertise on Facebook and consistently across multiple campaigns.

So okay let's get into it. So the three keys to success, the first one is to use the app installs campaign objectives. So Facebook have a specific campaign objective that's designed to help you generate installs of your app and when you select a campaign objective you're basically saying to Facebook this is what I want from my campaign and which is really important because Facebook's advertising algorithms they'll go in and they'll you know analyze the people within your target audience and they'll work out who is most likely to download this app based on sort of all the data they've got on them.

So make sure you select the right campaign objective. A couple of things that I've seen with this is I've worked with companies before that have sent people that they want to use their app to their website first and the logic behind that was we'll send it to our website, the website's got loads of information about how the app works etc etc. You don't want to do that.

With the app installs ad objective users are sent directly from Facebook to the location where they can download the app. So app store, Google Play Store, whatever it is and it's sort of a rule in digital marketing that you want to make things as easy as possible for people because if you do more people are going to do it. If you have that extra step in there of taking people to your website first you're going to see drop-off rates it's going to cost you more per app install.

So definitely use that objective and the same applies with video. That's the other thing I've seen with this and if you're using a video to advertise your app which is great by the way I'm going to get onto that in a minute and don't use the video views campaign objective. That's something I've seen.

You still want to use app installs that's going to get you the lowest cost per app install which is of course what you want from your app install ads. So that's key to success number one. Number two is to use look-alike audiences when you're targeting people.

So for those who don't know look-alike audiences are it's a targeting option within Facebook that consists of a group of people that are very similar to another group of people and this is fantastic for us Facebook advertisers. For example you can upload a list of existing customers or in your case app users and you can say to Facebook look this is my source audience create me a look-alike audience from this source audience and then Facebook will generate an audience within the countries that you want to target of people that are very similar to your existing app users and this is a fantastic targeting option. Facebook have got tons of data on their users and they can really accurately work out okay we've worked out that you know men this age or women this age that are interested in these three things are really likely to use this app and be interested in this app therefore that's who we're going to put it in front of that's who's going to get the best results.

So we found that when we've run various different targeting options you know people who might be interested in the industry other cold audience targeting options look-alike audiences consistently perform the best. Now you do need to have a hundred app users you need hundred people in your source audience to be able to create a look-alike audience and but you know for most mobile apps or desktop apps that's not going to take very long if you know if you want to grow you're going to hit a hundred very very quickly so as soon as you've got to that hundred mark look to include look-alike audiences. Okay then number three is that video ads are better than image ads.

Now this is basically true across Facebook as a platform. Videos are much more engaging you know form of media when videos show up in people's news feeds and either on their desktop or their mobile it's going to grab people's attention a lot more there's going to be even though it starts on silent there's movement that's going to grab people's eye as opposed to regular image ads. It's also a really good way of getting over of explaining what your app does how it works and why these people might want to use it.

You can probably convey you know in a minute long video or a 90 second video a lot of what your app does and the benefits of using it. It's a lot easier to do that than trying to convince people to read a lot of text in an image ad or try and get that message across with a straight up image. So if you can use video instead of image they can be a little bit more difficult to create but those ads are likely to perform much better.

I really like demonstration videos for apps specifically. So if it's appropriate for your app then that could work really really well. Show it being used, show how it works, what it does, that sort of stuff that can work really well.

And a bonus tip is to target the friends of your page likes. So we've already talked about look-alike audiences as being a really good targeting option to use when you're advertising an app on Facebook. But another one is the friends of your page likes and explain why.

So the vast majority of your page likes if you've got a specific Facebook page for your app is likely to be people that use the app. At least people that have it downloaded and installed on their device. And when you advertise to friends of page likes it will show people that their friend likes your page in that ad.

So let's say for example I like app.com as a company. I like their Facebook page on Facebook. If you were to advertise to my friends on Facebook an ad for app.com it will say at the top of the ad Ben Heath likes app.com.

And that acts as a bit of social proof like a mini endorsement from me to those people that this app is worth checking out, worth testing, maybe even worth using. That works really really well. Particularly if your app has a social element or there's user interaction.

If people can see that their friend likes your page which probably means that they use the app. That's really going to help drive app installs and drive engagement. So what we found when we tested this is that they didn't generate as cheap a cost per app install as the lookalike audiences did.

But the engagement from that campaign, that targeting option was really really good. Because people can see that their friends use the app. They might go on and ask their friend about it and use it a bit more.

And it carries that weight because of that small amount of social proof. So if you are looking to scale up your campaigns, you want to go beyond lookalike audiences, definitely look to target friends of page likes. That's something I would recommend.

Okay, before you go, I'd love to know which one of these four keys to success you're going to implement first. So are you going to create a lookalike audience and start advertising to those people? Are you going to try and record a video ad for your app?
