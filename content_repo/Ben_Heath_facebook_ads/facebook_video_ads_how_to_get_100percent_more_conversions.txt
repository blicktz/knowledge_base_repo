Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to talk about Facebook video ads and specifically I'm going to show you a technique that you can use, a very simple technique that can get you up to 100% more conversions. We've tested using this technique versus not using this technique and in that test we generated almost 100% more conversions, almost twice as many conversions by using it as not. Very quick and easy to do, something I'd strongly recommend.

Now before I get into that, before I demonstrate how this works, I just want to quickly mention that at the end of this video I've got a free Facebook advertising resource I think you're going to find very very interesting so make sure you stick around for that and before we go any further if you could quickly click a thumbs up, click a like on this video that would be much much much appreciated, really help me out. Okay so I'm in an example Facebook ad account, what I'm going to do is I'm going to set up a very quick example campaign and get to the ad level to show you exactly how this works. So example video ad campaign, all of the settings I'm going to leave as they are, not something I need to go over here and let's call this example video ad.

Okay now let's save that to draft. So when it comes to video ads, whenever you're creating your video ads you really need to think about your prospects and how they're going to consume your content. Okay so there's lots of, that's led to people doing lots of all sorts of things with video ads but one of the absolute no-brainers that you have to do but I see a lot of Facebook advertisers not do is add captions to your video.

Okay and as I said it's an absolute no-brainer we've tested using captions not using captions we generated almost twice as many conversions with the captions it doesn't take very long very quick and easy to do I'm going to show you how to do it in a minute but it is absolutely essential because the majority of people when they're consuming videos and scrolling through their Facebook feed their Instagram feed they have sound turned off automatically now you can fiddle around with the settings to remove that and turn sound on etc etc but most people have it turned off by default now that means that your video is going to start playing as they're scrolling through with no sound on and if you don't have captions in place they've no idea what your video is about the job of your video the first job it has to achieve the thing it has to do is grab the attention of your prospects in the first place convince them that they want to watch further to check out whatever it is you're advertising and then they can go on to decide whether or not they're interested in whether or not want to take your subsequent steps whatever it is you're asking for in your ad but the very first thing you do is grab attention okay and you can't grab attention very well if people don't know what your video is about and if you've just got someone talking face to camera or something that's not super super visual you need to have captions in place okay so I'm at the ad level I'm going to get to that in a second there's a very very quick way to get captions created for your video very accurate way and that's by using rev.com so I've got a tab open here I'm just going to quickly show you so this is rev it makes it super super simple it's what I use to create captions and they only charge a dollar 25 per minute so if you've got you know for facebook advertising purposes your videos are probably only be you know a minute two minutes three minutes sort of four minutes max long anyway a lot shorter than that so you really are talking you can get captions done for your video for maybe a dollar 25 if it's under a minute absolutely fantastic service and all you do is click on get started just going to very quickly go through the steps and if you've already got a video on youtube you can also use this for youtube obviously the purpose of this video is is facebook video ads but most people just want to upload a file and then you just simply drag and drop your video file in there and in my experience it usually takes rev you know a couple minutes a couple hours max to create your captions that goes with your video content then they'll send you an email to let you know you're done and you can come in and you can check out my files which over here you can see previous files that i've uh i've used and if i was to click on one as an example you can take a look at how it matches up alongside a piece of content you can see they've got the the content in here you can go through and edit anything and then you can go ahead and click download download that file and then you can upload it so if i click download i'll show you what happens you get various file formats now i've talked about rev and things in the past people have been a bit confused so i wanted to go through this so yes you want a srt file but rev will actually produce a facebook ready srt file for you and what that means is it's got the right um yeah so i don't know if you can see that but let me uh let me open that file yes perfect okay so here's the file here so you can see this so this has been called ben heath free template video because that's the name of the video and they've put in dot en underscore us now that's the um part of the file name that you need in order to upload an srt file to facebook and have it actually work alongside your facebook video ads you need the en so that says english underscore us you can have en underscore gb for you know um the uk version of english versus the us version of english you can have all sorts of different languages okay so you just download that file and then if we go back into our uh close that down our facebook ad here and now let's scroll down oh we're at the campaign level here okay so we're going to jump over to the ads ad level because that's obviously we're going to set up our facebook video ad it's just taking a second to load but once that does you just upload your media upload the srt file and you are good to go okay so now that that's loaded i'm going to scroll down i've got single image or video selected here which is obviously what you want and because we're running a video ad and then we need to add media okay so i can add in a video as an example so it says your account has no videos just because this is an example facebook ad account that i use for creating these sorts of um things so i can click the upload button there or i can go ahead and grab any videos off my facebook page for example and so you can see i've got a whole bunch here i could go ahead and grab that video there click continue obviously you'd want to make sure it's the one you want to use and now you can see that there are lots of different options for placement options etc got other videos about all that so if you're interested in placement and customizing your ad created by placement then by all means go ahead and check that out okay then to add captions you want to go ahead and select edit media and edit video and that's uh zoomed in for some reason so let's just zoom out there we go so you can see it all so as i said here you've got options to edit your video you can crop it trim it you can even do it by placement um so in its original spec or by one-to-one you know the various aspect ratios that you might want square on instagram feed but vertical on instagram stories that sort of thing okay but that's uh i've covered that sort of stuff in other videos so check out my channel if you're interested in that what i'm interested in here is captions so just go ahead and select captions then i click on upload srt file and that'd be in my downloads you can see it's right at the top here the srt file just prepared and i can go ahead and upload that you can see it's just taking a second because i'm recording the video at the same time now this is a really important step so what i've been loaded there is is an srt file in english the us version of it version of english right you can go ahead and upload various different languages and facebook will work it out depending on where your prospect is in the various locations as to which language or whatever language they have set up in their in their ad account okay now what you want to do is set up backup language and then select the one you've gone with now this is particularly important for someone like myself who's based in the uk because um people may well have english gb as i said this could be en underscore gb for the british version of the english language and that would mean that if i don't have any backup language set up that they wouldn't see any captions if i was advertising to someone with that set up on their facebook profile okay whereas if i set up the backup language whether someone is anywhere on the planet they are going to be displayed this english um like these captions in this language in this srt file which is absolutely what i want the reason why you have a backup is because let's say i added an english spanish french whatever i would still want a backup for all the people that are in different languages or as i said different versions of english this also applies obviously to us companies and things like that wanting to also advertise in the uk which is quite quite common and you want to make sure you have the different versions set up you can either download separate files or you can just go ahead and set your backup language as english.us which is very important okay now i go ahead and click save and it really is that simple now obviously i'd recommend you go ahead and check your ads i haven't matched up the right video with the file in this demonstration so it won't work here but go through and make sure you check your ad to make sure that the captions are set up and um yeah as i said this can make a massive massive difference to your facebook advertising results and as we've shown generate 100 percent more conversions twice as many conversions by simply taking the exact same video content we've used uh adding captions uploading them you can use a service like rev what we've already discussed i'll include a link to rev in the video description below um not free but very very inexpensive particularly for facebook advertising videos that tend to be very very short and it can make a massive difference so just a quick simple tip for you guys today i've shown you exactly how to do it in case you get stuck at any of the the various points but hopefully that's useful any video ads you run you want to make sure that you add captions no um no questions about that there's no downside to doing so okay at the beginning this video i talked about a free facebook advertising resource that i thought you think you're going to find very very interesting and quickly talk about that now and that is a free webinar i've created called three killer facebook advertising strategies to double or more your revenue now in this webinar i basically break down three different facebook advertising strategies three sales funnels that we use as an agency all the time we've generated more than a million dollars in revenue with all three of these um sales funnels they're very much tried and tested we use them on our clients as i said day in and day out so if you want to know exactly what sort of strategy what sort of sales funnel you should be putting together which is absolutely crucial to facebook advertising success i would strongly recommend you check

about 60 70 minutes long and i think be very very important and it's really important to do that before you start investing tons of money into facebook advertising because you need to know the right approach for your products and services specifically you know that's why we give three different strategies because you need a different strategy for a you know an e-commerce business selling low value products and to a service business selling very high-end services you know if you're selling a 20 product versus a 30 000 service yes you absolutely need a different approach for those sorts of businesses and as an agency we have first-hand experience with that we know that very well and that's something that we that we do know how to adjust to so that's what i really wanted to create a
