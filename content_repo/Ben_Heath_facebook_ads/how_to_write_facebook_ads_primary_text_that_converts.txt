Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and in this video I'm going to show you how to write Facebook ad primary text that converts. So the primary text is what used to be called Facebook ad copy effectively. It's the text that goes above your image or your video or your slideshow on a Facebook ad when it's in one of the Facebook ad placements like Facebook feeds for example.

That's what we're going to be covering. It's a very, very important component of your Facebook ads and I've got some tips and tricks and techniques that we often use to help improve results. I think you're going to find this video quite valuable.

Before I go into that I want to very quickly ask you to smash that like button, click that thumbs up button and of course subscribe to my YouTube channel if you are new and haven't done so already. So I'm in an example Facebook ad account here and I've got an example campaign created and I'm at the example ad. And you can see that we've got here this primary text section.

You know it's in ad creative when you're at the ad level if you sort of scroll down from what we've got up above don't worry about any errors that pop up as said this is an example Facebook ad account. So they're going to be things that aren't set up right and all that sort of stuff. But this primary text this is so different placements display text in different locations right.

So on for example the Facebook mobile news feed which is where you're going to get a lot of your impressions almost certainly the primary text is going to appear above the image above the video whatever ad creative using. It's not going to do the same on Instagram there's no text above the image it's going to be beneath it. So things do look differently and it's important and we'll get into this in a second to take a look at what the primary text looks like in different locations.

But if you assume it's the first or one of the first things that your prospect is going to see as they're scrolling through either Facebook or Instagram but particularly Facebook then that sort of helps frame how you should be treating this and what you should be looking to do. So I've got a bunch of points that I want to that I really want to cover here because I think it's easy to look at this section and just think where do I start what do I do I feel a bit lost. We like to implement whenever it's got anything creative you implement a framework it means you can't go too wrong effectively.

So let me just grab up where here we go I've got it here so the first thing you need to be aware of is that you've basically got three lines on the Facebook news feed on the mobile device that are going to be visible before the fold so before people need to click the see more button or whatever it is to see the rest of the text. So though that initial three lines has to effectively grab your audience's attention I mean you know obviously the image the creative is going to do the same thing but that's what you want to be doing with that. So a number of different techniques you can do that you can use something called the call-out method.

So the call-out method would be where you're talking basically to a group of people who would identify themselves as being part of that group and therefore if you call out to this group it's going to grab their attention. So for example I could have something like I've used example before but it'd be a great example let's say I'm advertising in West London a local location I could have West Londoners check out okay does that make sense if you live in West London which I used to do and you're scrolling through your Facebook news feed something says West Londoners okay you know that might grab your attention right okay um you know you could do it by your state by your region even by your country whatever so geographical location particularly if you're advertising to that area can be a great way to grab someone's attention that's going to mean more than if it just starts with you know check out and then whatever it is you're talking about okay so that's one way you can use a call-out method you can also call people out by other groupings basically what how would someone potentially identify themselves they might identify themselves by the location in which they live they might identify themselves by their profession so you could have something like solicitors dot dot dot you know and then carry on so someone who is a solicitor if that's the audience that you want to reach might really resonate with that sort of thing and you've almost certainly seen ads that are targeting demographic like parents you know it might be like mums with babies are checking out you see the sort of thing I'm talking about the call-out method it's it's it's a scroll stopper okay you're scrolling through boom I'm a solicitor I see that this ad is obviously for solicitors because it's got it right there in the first part of the copy that's I'm more likely to pay attention to that that's going to have a preview performance so that's one thing I want to talk about the call-out method another thing to sort of think around with that very opening of the copy that we love to use that's a little bit different to the call-out method but along the same vein and that's to ask a question so for example if I was selling solar panels or you know installing solar panels you could have something like have you ever thought about installing solar panels now we know obviously that tons of people have thought about installing solar panels they've seen them on other people's roofs they thought okay this could be a good idea it's good for the environment perhaps I'll save some money on the energy side of things over time and so there's lots of people that thought about it what does that question do it helps it resonates with those people that have thought about it someone who's scrolling through have you thought about installing solar panels yes I have actually I never got around to it don't know where to start all the reasons why people don't actually go ahead and do things that they think about but they've thought about it and if you have thought about it that sort of question is going to grab you it's also going to get you mentally saying yes and as we know with any sort of marketing you know you have one question have you ever thought about installing solar panels yes next question could be something like did you know that it costs as little uh typo as you know whatever really cheap price you're able to offer or something along those lines did you know that you can get it installed in the next 48 hours something really simple like that that's going to go they answer yes the first question it's going to get them reading on go no I didn't know that that's fantastic I really and then they carry on it's it's hooking them into the ad and getting them to then go through the process that's the idea of what we're doing here so a little bit different to the call out method but starting with a question now with any facebook advertising you have to be worried about being overly personal facebook doesn't like that too much have you ever thought about it's often fine and if you were finding you'd get ads disapproved you could in stage just get rid of the have you get rid of that you word and we've definitely used have you a lot by the way so it can work but if you are let's say you've got a relatively new ad account and you are seeing ads getting different you could just change it to ever thought about installing solar panels just get rid of that have you um that sort of thing okay does that make sense because you just facebook has issues with what they call over personalized ads or anything that talks to personal attributes and um that's a good way of just getting around that okay so that's the first sort of major major point there is how do you hook people in at the beginning you know have you ever thought about doing this have you ever thought about um purchasing this have you ever thought about changing whatever whatever it is that you offer could they change from someone else to yours have you ever thought you know you could have we've used things like um um things along that get to the fact that perhaps what they're currently using isn't the best option or you know so you could ask questions like do you think there are better whatever providers out there okay because if someone's with a let's say an insurance provider and they're really difficult to deal with you know you take like car insurance for example really difficult to deal with um have you ever you know um have you ever you know do you think there are better car insurance providers out there someone's in that place right there where they're dealing with their car insurance provider that's really difficult had this experience personally you know where had to make a claim it was an absolute nightmare if someone an ad pops up saying do you think there are better car insurers out there my answer would have been absolutely and that's who you want to grab because that's the person that's likely to go on to become a customer so i may not have explained that sort of super well but that's i'm sort of thinking on the fly here and that's uh that's probably a good example of where you would switch over to something or perhaps grab something in the first place so the call out method or questions we're going to rattle through these a little bit faster because i've taken ages on that one but it's really important that very first part has said the three lines above the fold are so so key okay above the fold you also absolutely want to make it clear what it is you're advertising this is it sounds like a silly mistake but i honestly i see it all the time so a lot of service providers typically when i see it with service providers they will be advertising a particular service and they'll be offering you know let's say a free quote or a free consultation and i've seen things up in the primary text that say things like book your free consultation today and you think let me get rid of that you think free consultation for what the issue is that the person writing the ads obviously knows what it's for they know what their company does but they forget that people are scrolling yes it might be obvious from the image you might have put it in the headline but if someone's scrolling through a feed they might not see it i see this all the time and let's say it's for uh you know uh could be anything like interior designers companies we've you know we've worked with a number of interior designers you want book your free interior design consultation today it sounds like a silly error but that's so important because when someone's starting through they need to know this is about interior design it's obvious to you as the advertiser what it's for but it might not be obvious to someone that's glancing at your ad okay so you know book your free instead of book your free quote book your free solar panel quote book your free roofing quote book your free um you know accounts audit don't just say book your free audit book your free uh accounts audit people have to know what it's all about so just make that really clear and find a way to get that above the fold okay so in these first three little lines they're going to appear above your ad creative make sure you get in whatever it is that you're offering here what is the thing in this case interior design consultation does it perfectly you might need a separate line depending on what you started with in terms of call out method question or something like that but get that above the fold very important okay um next thing in general i like copy that's short and sweet i don't think this primary text section should be any longer than it needs to be now how long is that going to be it really depends on what you're advertising and how much of an ask you're making of your prospects if you are advertising a ten dollar product you could have one line of primary text up here something super super simple that talks about how cheap it is but how good quality it is what the main benefit of the product and get it to buy one sentence maybe two lines okay if you're advertising something a lot more comprehensive you need to provide a lot more information a lot more reasons why someone should inquire and become a lead why someone should go through to your website and purchase so in general i would say our average copy length is going to be three to four sentences something along those lines but obviously you know adjust that for your various products services the way i like to think about copy is let's say there's three or four main benefits associated with purchasing a product or service you need to get those in there you need to put those three or four benefits in there they could be in bullet points they could be in sentences but don't just waffle on don't repeat yourself don't add in any extra details so make it as long as it needs to be to get the main benefits across but there's no reason to make it any longer than that okay um i see copy that's too long more often than than the right length i would say because people want to talk about too much the job of the ad in a lot of cases to get someone to click off and come through even if you're running conversions campaign let's get someone to click off the ad come through to your website and then the website the landing page is often going to be the place that provides a lot more information that's going to convince people to go ahead and buy or become a lead or something like that okay um so if we go back to the other example if you say something like have you ever thought um about installing solar panels um did you know you can get them for as little as i don't know 30 per month i've no idea what seven pounds cost by the way that could be insanely cheap i don't know that's a month um um you know and that might be is and then and then and then so you you've you've got the you've got so i'm just kind of giving an example here you've got that question at the beginning basically a bit of a call-out method did you know you get them for 30 pound dollars per month that's a fantastic benefit then you want to write some benefits in here so benefit benefit benefit whatever there is so for example that could be something like um so what would you talk about the solar panels they're environmentally friendly um so you'd say things like you know i'm just typing up bullet points here obviously you'd want to sort of flesh these out i spelled that wrong but you'd say things like they're very environmentally friendly and perhaps they're cost saving on energy bills over time um perhaps there's you know associated tax relief in your country from getting so you know so that's where you'd list the benefits and then you'd end with a call to action and that might be as long as as as copy is for something like solar panels so not too long okay um right next point so i've kind of covered it there in creating that little example is that you want your copy to be benefit rich benefit benefits are not things that your product is or does it's things that um your customers get when they purchase it so solar panels are environmentally friendly as i said you'd want to flesh these benefits out and you want to state perhaps that um we all want to do our bit for the environment you can alleviate some guilt you can make yourself feel good that's the benefit associated with being environmentally friendly cost savings over time okay what's the benefit there um people can you can spend your money on other things you you know won't be stressing about paying your energy bills going forward that sort of thing tax relief everyone wants to save money on well most majority people want to save money on taxes and things like that so those are the benefits make sure you think about those don't just say oh our product has got a fancy red shiny bit and uh you know etc etc why does the red shiny bit matter well the red shiny bit matters because um it looks really high quality and your friends are going to be impressed and take that extra step with writing your copy okay okay and then and then end with a call to action so i've kind of got it in here but just because you're someone clicks on your ad your headline or whatever and go through to um a website things like that doesn't mean you don't want to end with a call to action your copy if someone is reading this primary text you want it to naturally flow into an action so let's let's carry on with this example so have you ever thought about installing solar panels did you know you can get them for a little stifters per month then we've got the benefits section and then um you can say something like you can find out more or something or perhaps book your free solar panel consultation with one of our experts today just click here and then you can pop a link in um or you could you don't even need necessarily this section that's fairly optional doesn't seem to make a huge difference but definitely end with a call to action don't miss that out i've seen marketers feel a little bit uncomfortable about sort of telling people what it is that they should do as in they don't really want to be commanding or or anything like that with their prospects but look at the end of the day if you offer a good product service it benefits your customer to buy it tell them to go ahead and take that first step it's going to help them out great go ahead and do it um and you can be fairly it doesn't necessarily come across as sort of um demanding or bossy more comes across as that you're confident in what it is you're offering what it is you want people to do so always want to stick a call to action in the primary text okay so there's some points there to hopefully give you a bit of a framework give you got a bit of an example here that's going to help you write some great uh great primary text it's not as difficult to do as people think and and with everything facebook advertising guys make sure you test a few different options if you write two or three different options great test those two or three different options see which ones um perform best and that can help inform you for future primary text writing so you go okay well this one worked better than this one here we really focused on these benefits or we had this tone or we had this call out method or you know whatever it was maybe we should do more of that in the future that sort of thing so hopefully that's
