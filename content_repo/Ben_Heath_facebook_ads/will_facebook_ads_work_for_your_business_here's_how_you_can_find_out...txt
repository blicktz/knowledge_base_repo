Hi guys, it's Ben Heath from Lead Guru and today's Facebook advertising question is, how can you tell if Facebook ads will work for your business? This is a question I was asked on my Facebook group earlier today and there's actually a technique that we use all the time that can be very interesting in terms of what it can tell you about what is and what isn't working in your industry Facebook advertising and Instagram advertising wise. So what I'd recommend you do is go onto Facebook and identify some of the biggest competitors in your industry.

Who would you like to be like? What would you like to grow your business to? Those companies that are in your industry that sell similar products and services, take a look at their Facebook page.

When you go onto their Facebook page, on the left hand side down the bottom there's a section called info and ads. You can click on that. Now, if they're not running any ads on Facebook then it will simply say that they're not running any ads.

If they are running ads, those ads will appear and you'll be able to see not only whether or not they're advertising but also they're ad creative, they're copy, all that sort of stuff. So that's a good tool for competitor research. Now, if your really successful competitors in your industry aren't advertising on Facebook and they've got a number of different ads running, that's a good indicator that Facebook is a platform that's likely to work well in your industry and likely to work well for your business.

If they haven't got any ads running then that might be because they haven't tested it. It might also be because they've tested it and it didn't work. So that's often a great place to start.

Go onto your competitors' Facebook pages. On the bottom left hand side there's an info and ads section. Click on that and see whether your competitors are already advertising on Facebook or not.

Hopefully that's useful. I'll talk to you soon. Bye bye.
