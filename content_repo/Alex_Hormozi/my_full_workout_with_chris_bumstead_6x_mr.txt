If you asked NJ, would you rather peace of mind or a seventh ring? You'd say a seven fucking ring. Talking about different objectives.

What is yours? Be rich if possible. Trying to train some legs and I'm going to Mr.

Alex Harmozi's gym. A bunch of old broken men that need a lot of warm up. So we're doing legs.

That's the point. All right, you want to just alternate like we'll go, I'll go one direction, you go the other. I think it's deceptively heavy.

I'll do whatever you do. Do you want to go on that? Yeah, let's go.

What's the heaviest you get in the off season? 270 the heaviest I've ever been. I kind of stopped trying to push food right now and I'm going to slowly bring it down from here.

Because I mean for you to keep winning, it's like you don't need more size, right? I have a little room. Every year like two pounds.

Okay. And I can always like be leaner and I keep putting on weight and I keep making weight. So yeah, it just keeps working.

Jesus. I could have warned y'all now. It's a counter bounce for Russian weight growth.

Okay. Come on, deep breath. Use your breath, come on.

Keep going. Yep. Woo.

Easy. Came out the top of there for some. It's counter intuitive that once you succeed at bodybuilding, everything that comes with the success of bodybuilding prevents you from succeeding at bodybuilding.

Yeah. I feel like speaking and guest posing. Yeah.

Like traveling, podcasts, whatever. Not wanting to wait until you retire to start a business and all this shit. Well, I don't think you should.

No. No. Like starting a business when you, when you retire is like no one cares anymore.

We definitely force growth. We post, we do 450 posts a week. How often do you film that gets spit out?

Every day. Every day? No.

I used to, so we used to, it's like, it's changed over time. Before, in the very beginning it was once every 90 days. Every one full day.

Really? And we do like a hundred posts. Just that was it.

Yeah. And then it switched to every other week. And then it became Fridays.

And then now it's like, you know, I think I'm better if I'm fresher and I do fewer more. Yeah. And so that's what we do.

Or something like in the moment. It's exactly what it is. It basically like, Daniel Messaged me is like, we're ready if you feel like stepping away at any time.

So I'm doing my shit in the morning. If I like lightning strikes, I go down and I talk about it in his top of mind. I gotta ask.

Done any seminars in there with no one in the crowd and filmed it? Yeah, no, I did because we, well, I had the team there, but like, had this theory, I do better live at live things than I do in front of the camera. It's just more, you know, interesting.

And so I was like, can I approximate that? So then we did the whole setup. We did the presentation, the stage, and then they set, my team sat in the audience, and I gave the presentation, but it's not the same.

You're not talking to empty chairs. It was still, it was still mostly empty chairs. There's a team that can't fill a room.

Yeah. We opted out of doing that. We did it like four times and then we stopped doing it.

Yeah. And so then I started doing Instagram lives and that was way more like fun. Yeah.

Also, it's like the room's got 2000 people in it or whatever, you know, so that's nice. I mean, if you can present in front of a fucking empty chair, that's harder than a crowd. So yeah, right.

It's just about the on light. Yeah. I had this tweet that went kind of viral.

It's like, if you're like 16 to 25, like just get in shape. Yeah. Like, because once you're in shape, you can stay in shape, but like you have the time and you'll get different priorities later.

Yeah. So it's like, just do it then. You have all the fab.

Yeah. I'm grateful that I, I was obsessed from 15. I started when I was 14 until I stopped computing when I was 25.

It was right around when I started my gym. I was 23, but I guess I stopped computing when I was 23. When you were 23?

Yeah, when I stopped. Yeah. Got my state record.

Not national. There's 50 states. I think 23 when I dropped, no, 22 is when I dropped at a university.

And that's when I started doing it full time. Were you like a junior or senior or something? I was there for four years, but on my second year of school.

So. So you, you lived. But that was Jack.

But that's a lot of mattering. Right? Which in your actual life, that is all that matters.

Exactly. It paid off. Yeah.

What do you think you do? Lift weights for a living? You're like, actually.

Yes. That sounds great. Yeah.

Literally would spend four hours in the weight room and then like be in the cafeteria all day. Right. That was life.

Right. Yeah. Are you the only member of Raw Athletic Club?

No, this is our public gym. Oh, is it? We just opened it like six weeks ago.

It's a task to our warehouse. Where your private gym is? No, my private gym's not.

Away from there. This is in Nashville? Florida.

It's in Florida. Yeah. We're our partners in Nashville.

We have carbon culture. Maybe that's what you want to know. Oh, I know carbon culture.

Yeah, yeah. I worked at the other gym. Yeah.

Oh, does he do some of the formulation stuff? He's actually our partner in the business. He used to own the manufacturer.

And then we partnered with them. They had to get pricing and help on our payment plan and all the bullshit. Yeah, because I knew he did that.

I remember I got connected. His location operator, when I went in, knew who I was. And was like, you should talk to our owner.

And I was like, all right, whatever. He's like, no, he's blah, blah. I was like, fine.

So I think we had a phone call or something. Yeah. Yeah.

He's a really good guy. He's smart. Yeah, I know.

He sounded that way. Because when I was getting in the supplement business, he quoted us for manufacturing. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. He was one of the, I think his final three bids. We ended up going in another company, but probably should have gone with him.

All right. Bulgarians. He's like, I'm going to go to the next one.

Yeah. So we've got, I've got this thing. You got a proper pad?

I do have a proper pad. Fancy. I usually set up next to this pole here.

Just have something to balance on. Is it a dumbbell or? Yeah, I usually just grab a dumbbell.

How do you do it? Yeah, but I just never held on to something. Oh, well, that's how you cheat.

That's how you do it. Exactly. Here, I'm going to put a little bit of music on.

Because we have a sound system. All in your silence. Well, it's kind of nice hearing you chant.

I'm going to try it out. See, you're my inspiration. Sorry?

You're my inspiration. You'll be like, what motivates you? And I'll just be like, this guy right here.

This asshole comes to my gym and looks more than me. Yeah. That's the motivation.

It is. I used to really like barbell lunges. Like, they used to tear my glutes up more than anything.

Back when I had glutes. They're great. Walking lunges are fucking incredible for leg growth.

You can load them. You're such a bitch to do. Like, I left this whole corridor empty.

For that. Yeah, for walking lunges. Because Layla doesn't.

Because Layla's hardcore. I was like, I'm going to do a lot of work for it. Two plate walking lunges.

Yeah, that's the biggest I did. It was 225. 225?

I was there. I was strong and young. And that's what I was eating 6,000 calories a day.

I just was like, I read this thing. It was like, insulin's the most anabolic hormone. And I was like, done.

And so, more food. There's one Layla and I met. She used to make me a box of pancakes for breakfast.

It was a cake. I'd do half a thing of syrup. And I'd pass out again.

And then I'd wake up. I'd work out. I'd have a 1200 calorie shake.

Then I'd have a burrito. Double meat, double rice, sour cream, chips on the side, guac. And then I'd get back home for dinner.

And I'd have one box of pasta and one jar of tomato sauce. Because a box of pasta is 70 grams of breadcane. Yeah, I eat pasta a lot.

I digest it great. Yeah, me too. And rice.

I do really well with basmati rice. I could just eat unlimited amounts. Can you still eat like that?

No. I can talk about it though. Yeah.

I eat like, I go to a nice restaurant. I have a steak and then chips and something. And I'm like, oh, my stomach.

All right, you want to eat your sidebacks? Starting to feel it? My gluteus.

Yeah, I haven't done those in the long pan. How about the split squash? Yeah.

So usually when I do my warm up, I'll do this guy. This? Yeah.

Not for this. I mean, I'm poor. But I'll do that guy and I'll do that.

The hip flexor one. Like a multi-hits. Up and down.

Glute. I actually do this. This one here.

Up. Like up, yeah. But I think I needed the mobility stuff more than the shrink.

I think. You probably could argue that if you took 20 minutes out of your workout and put that into like constructive mobility, you'd be better off. Well, I mean, I did way more weight than I normally do.

So. Yeah. That alone.

Yeah, literally. Today, especially. So I put one rule for the whole gym is that this machine keeps four plates out.

Always. You want five? Yeah, I think so.

Do we plan on leaving this building or this like home? You know. This is for the next three to five.

Three to five? I like Vegas a lot more than I think I've liked any city I've lived in as an adult. It's just like it's a non-judgmental city.

Everyone pretends to be something and they come to Vegas and they like let their real selves out. Yeah. And I just like being here.

And so also it's not political because it's for tourism. So it has to be just neutral. Super neutral.

So it's not political at all. Which I like. It's great for traveling in and out.

Everybody I know comes to Vegas once a year anyways. So I could see. Honey pill, if I lived in Cincinnati I would never see you.

Right. So I get to like I benefit from those. We have direct flights everywhere out four hours from the beach in the mountains.

Yeah. 30 minutes on the lake. We've got the best food and dining and shows in the world.

It's tax-free. It's dry. Not quite.

Which I personally like. UFC's here. It's their old building.

I mean it's a perfect setup for this. Yeah. It's nice you don't need like warehouse space too.

No. We have to deal with that bullshitting. Right.

Nice. Nice. Those little quarter rests.

Oh yeah. Just your time under tension is gravy. Because you can't skip through the weak parts.

It's like that is the weak part right? Yeah. Well yeah it's interesting because now you have this balance of like I want to push but like the risk reward of pushing goes down a lot.

Literally. Because like you really just want to maintain on as little effort as possible or a little risk as possible. It's hard especially because they added weight cap to everybody in my weight to my category except me.

I got like two pounds and everyone else got six to eight. Why? Just because it was unfair.

People were complaining that people at the height of 6'1 had an unfair advantage. Like statistically or something? No people were just complaining.

I was the only one in that category. Okay. So that happened and then now everyone got better so I actually have to improve and like fine tune it.

But I'm also like the most old broken guy in the category so I also have to be the safest. Yeah. What is interesting from like an investor perspective that's like risk adjusted return.

Yeah. Yeah. Like the same thing yeah.

If you're at fifth place you should take all the risks you can because if you fail you lost nothing because no one cares. Literally. If you win it makes all the difference.

Exactly. I've always found it so interesting with repeat champions. Uh-huh.

Like and most of them are like I mean Michael Jordan's over my continent but he's not happy. He's a miserable motherfucker. He just found some way to continuously drive his way in a miserable fashion.

Yeah. And people look up to that and they want to be that and I'm like he didn't do it right. Yeah.

Well he did but he didn't. Right. I think it's just like my goal is your goal.

My goal would rather be happy and have peace of mind. Yeah. Rather than yeah.

And I think that's all for that. And I think if you asked MJ would you rather peace of mind or a seventh ring you'd say a seven fucking ring. Oh yeah.

So I think. Yeah. You asked Ronnie Coleman would you rather be able to walk or have nine pedals.

You'd say nine pedals. Yeah. Yeah.

And that's where like you zoom all the way out and it's like making a judgment on anyone else's goals in general is stupid because their goals aren't the same in Georgia. Yeah. So I would do it different.

No shit you're different. I had somebody a family member tell me they were like I would never live my life like you and I was like no shit. And I would never live my life like you which is why you have your life and I live my life.

And good thing is you don't have to live mine and I don't have to live yours. It's interesting about how you define champion too. Like I had to think about it like a year ago I was like do I want to be the richest man in the world and I was like no I don't think that's my goal.

So then I was going to ask you that when we were talking about different objectives what is yours? Honestly I want to... Does it just be rich as possible?

No no no it's not. I see wealth as a measure of my personal growth. Yeah.

Because I see entrepreneurship as the most quantitative path of personal development. It's more I want to be the richest man that outs me come not the richest man in the world. Now if that happens to become the richest man in the world cool I'm not against it.

Yeah. But me measuring my wealth against other people's is not the right game for me. Yeah.

But me measuring my wealth against what I believe I can create is a game that I can compete in and will always try to compete. Yeah. And so me seeing like a really hard thing for me was when we sold gym launch my monthly cash flow because I was an owner went to zero and I was like that's a mindfuck.

Yeah. So I was like all of a sudden even though I had a bunch of cash in the bank account I felt poorer. So I was like okay this is weird.

And so I had to like recalibrate and that's so I had this year where I started making content about like the meaning of money and like all this stuff. Yeah. That's when I had to redefine like what where am I the most where do I grow the most?

I grow the most when I work hard on things worth doing. And so then it was like how do I orient my life in a way that I maximize the amount of hard work I do on things worth doing. And then once I saw what those days looked like I had a mentor of mine my first boss ever I'd had like a really good week and I was like that was like probably one of the best weeks I've had in my life.

And she was like not a profound person. She was like I'm pretty sure the secret of life is living as many of those days in a row as you can. And she and it was such a tactical like I was like so that's what I'll do.

I'll think what are the days that I do my best and how do I live that day as many times in a row as I can. And that's pretty much just the path I've been on and the stuff that has occurred has occurred. But that's at least how I think about it.

And your path of feeling like best days are wealth building. Our personal wealth building not like for yourself but your own goals. It's usually me creating stuff.

And so like my arc happens to be business related. So like I draw like my books are picture books. I draw pics about business.

I write books about business. I make videos about business. I make podcasts about business.

Like that's just all I think about. Yeah. And so like if I happen to do that about like electric cars no one would care.

They'd be like oh he's passionate about it. It's just that I happen to be passionate about something that makes money. Yeah.

But it's all I think about. I almost am more interested in business than I am doing business. Like my days I only do do business hardcore one to two days a week.

The rest of my days are making things that help other people do business. So like me like doing this is this doing business. I mean we make media.

Yeah. You know but like also me working out with people that I care about that I enjoy is on my list of things that I do on my best days. That you enjoy yeah.

And so I respect that. I feel like a lot of people now are almost like they there's just so many opinions out there of like what's right to the world rather than to themselves. Like you said when what's like a champion.

I had this thing when I was young. I said I always talk about champion mentality and I had no idea what it meant. And I began to define it.

Yeah. And now I need to consistently reiterate that it's my definition of what a champion is. What is a champion to me is that.

Yeah. The true only thing that a champion does is they make their own rules. Yeah.

Because they don't give a what other people think. They just do whatever they want. I agree.

Doesn't mean I'm winning doesn't mean nothing. It just means I'm doing whatever the fuck I want and I'm doing it the best I can. And so like for example if they change the rules of the game for you that in order to win you had to I don't know fucking kill your liver.

Something. No I'm just making you know whatever. Then you would have to make the decision do I want to win by their rules or do I win in my mind.

Exactly. And I would leave. Right.

I think that is the difference between a champion who wins for the approval and a champion who wins for themselves. Yeah. Yeah.

Is that if they change the rules if your vision of what a champion is no longer aligns with the third party approval then you don't do it. You don't play. And I think there's a lot of wisdom in choosing what games to play.

For sure. Not feeling like you have to. I never want to feel like I have to.

Oh dude my number one rule in life. Like I'll do everything in the world to not have to do anything. So fun story about calves.

So you don't know this about me. But I trained calves every single day for more than 10 years. And I developed tendonitis in my foot from doing so many sets of calves.

So I did seven sets of 20. And then your calves show them. No.

My calves are still fine. But they were. Uh.

They were. I had a girl that I did. It was like why don't you train your calves.

And I was like. I fucking trained them all the time. And so then I went from three days a week.

Doing them at the end. To doing them seven sets at the beginning. As in my calves here.

But this. So I haven't trained calves right now. Like me doing this with you.

Is the first time I've trained calves in like probably a year. Really? Like literally haven't done any reps.

And it was because I got tendonitis. I like. I was struggling walking.

Because. Yeah. There's some muscle in like.

The base of my foot. It's like under my big tail. But I'll do this.

Because I have the champ in town. So. Of course.

Maybe now you'll stretch and train calves again. Yeah. All I have to do is I have to stretch my calves out.

This is a really good calf machine. Yeah. So that's the thing.

It's like. I hate the load. But I love the way this.

The lever is perfect. Yeah. So you don't have to put a lot on it either.

No. Nice. The range of motion moves so much.

Yeah. My calves are going to be crippled. Just from doing like three sets.

They're going to be fucking smoked. Yeah. If you don't train calves they get fucked.

Oh you're destroyed. Yeah. The donkey calf over there is what built my calves.

And um. Standing single leg off a box. What is his body weight?

Yep. Yeah. I started doing um.

I did them years ago. It was one of the things that like broke to my calf. Like growing.

So it's funny. It's like I um. I don't train chest anything.

I told you that last time. Because I just always had a decent enough chest. Yeah.

But like if someone is like doesn't know how to grow calves. I'm like I can fucking tell you how to grow calves. The biggest thing was super deep purity notice.

But like super deep stretch. Yeah. And so what I would do is I'd do like 20 or 30 reps body weight on one one leg off a box.

Underneath of a pull-up bar. And then once I reached failure I would start counting. And so then I would do assisted negatives.

Yeah. Or like you know assisted positives. And like the level of cane that like of like cooling yourself to the full flex.

Yeah. When you're just lower. Oh yeah.

And then you like let it down. Then you you really make sure that you get that last little. Yeah.

That last little bit. I was like I did it with clients once. And I because I had just discovered this technique for myself.

And I like could barely walk. And I did it with these ladies who I was training. They came in on so it was like Friday.

They came on a Monday and they were like they like couldn't move. They're like I couldn't go to the dance this weekend because I couldn't put heels on. They're like literally could not walk.

And so I felt accomplished. Job well done. Yeah.

I felt like I did something. Yeah. Fucking just like controlled negatives.

Yeah. Are such a secret to making anything grow. I'll do those like I'll go up with two feet.

Yeah. And then lift one foot and then lower down. Cool.

Like same concept. Yeah. Yeah.

Somebody gave me a cue that was trying to get your shoelaces perpendicular. Just like the top of your foot. Just because you're there like perpendicular like.

You can't really do it but like or maybe ballerinas can but like it's like. So how's being a dad dude? It's good.

It's chaos. It's good. It's chaos.

It's not for bodybuilding right? Good for sleep. Horrible for bodybuilding but.

No we've got help at night now. Which is like. Oh good.

The biggest cheat code man like. My wife is a saint. So she handles like the hard part of all.

She's not competing anymore. No. She stopped in 2016.

She won the Olympia in 2016. And then she kind of had some health issues and then just. So your kids are a champion breeding stock.

Yeah. They are. They're.

They place used to be. Layla gathered to three patine for reps in the gym. So I'm just you know I'm just putting it out there.

Yeah. You good on this? I can do one more.

You're doing one more. I'm gonna. My cats are gonna.

I already know they're gonna be cooked. All right. Sorry Daniel.

I know you wanted the shot. There's the shot. Still got it.

I'll give you a lefty. Not anymore. I have tendonitis in my fucking toe now.

The old man. Excuse me. The old man.

I'm gonna do the hip thing. Because I. That was the first time I've done legs in a while that I was not in with no pain.

Yeah. Because I do my warm up to get to like a two out of ten pain. I'm like whatever.

Yeah. But that was like a one out of ten. Like I had something.

How many warm up sets you normally do? Of the actual. I just recently started doing like three.

Proper. Yes. And that helped a lot.

Yeah. I was just going straight. And I was like this is horrible.

Yeah that's brutal. I feel like it was like my muscles are just tearing off like it's just not horrible. Yeah no.

There's like a lot of actual science behind even just your nervous system turning on with proper warm ups and everything. Your muscles are literally aren't even activating until then. Yeah.

They're yeah. They're just like what's going on? Yeah.

Please don't do this. Nice. Okay.

Here's. Oh shit easy. This is so sweet.

This is the best cap machine ever used. Dude it's good. This one's sweet because you can have the full stack.

This is where I built this and the and standing uh single leg are the two things that like built my caps. But like this guy like all the way up. And it's just like yeah.

Who makes this? This is Nebula. Nebula?

Yeah. So where do you find this? Not really hard to find.

I used to have all these dealers that I have like on speed dial. They're like kind of serious. I don't know.

I like the way this feels. Yeah that feels really good. If you create these straps you get they're bent over.

Yeah. Yeah it's one of those ones where when you put weight on it it like feels even better. And I think you do 400 pounds and weights on top.

I did when I was at my peak. And you're a big boy. Yeah when I was a big boy.

Yeah. Yeah I had this 100 pound plate that I had. But I haven't done CADs in a year so we'll see.

See what my calf drink can still look. It's probably bad. I'm gonna make a Machiavelli motivation video of you after this.

Nice. Yeah. Yeah.

That's where I like smoke those. Yeah this also goes up too so you can adjust uh. This?

Yeah so you can go up a little higher for. Because I was on lay list setting. Come good luck that.

Yeah. You know I like I mean it's a big piece. But um I try I mean I train on this every day for real time.

That and the single leg are the two things that I did for my kids. Did you have all this equipment somewhere else before you moved here? Yeah my my house in Austin I had had I had like half the I had everything I had about half these pieces.

Do you want to do something else? Oh my legs are cooked but I can do whatever. I'm with the champ so.

I mean we can do a little quick vlog extensions all the day. All right. Unless you're cooked cooked.

No no I can do parts. Like zero rest back and forth. Mm-hmm.

People are like you're taller than I expected. It's like thanks. Because um Trevor you Dr.

Cash you want to name him? Anyways. No.

He's like you have short eye proportions. He's like so on camera he's like you look like you're 5'5". Yeah.

So much my legs are actually super short which is good for like leg moves. Like I have super short femurs really long torso. Are they good for squatting?

Yeah. Did you pull sumo or conventional sumo? Oh god.

This guy. I pulled a conventional and started on my back and I switched to sumo and I hurt my hips. Yeah I was a hundred pounds weaker on sumo than conventional.

I could do so much more volume on sumo. Yeah. And so that kind of made up for it.

But weirdly my deadlift made its biggest gains. This is gonna sound insane. Doing one set of 20 a week.

Like your one rep max did? Because I did the same. I did like the pilot pin chart and you know like 5'3".

Like I did all of the low rep like three sets of four. All the tradition and like my deadlift didn't move for like three years. And I was like competing and like cared.

Yeah. Yeah. I was like so upset about it.

And so then I was like fuck it. And so I don't know if you know Juggernaut, JTS, Chad Wesley Smith. Okay well he was.

In the powerlifting world a little early. Yeah. Yeah so he was big in the powerlifting world like football training and stuff.

And so he had this thing called the Jug Method. This is like 10 years ago. And it was all this super high rep stuff.

He basically took Wendler's 531 which is a powerlifting program. And just like tripled the bullet. So instead of like sets of 5, 3, and 1.

It was sets of like 20, 15, 10. Yeah. But like AMRAPs.

I basically ignored everything in the program. But the deadlifts was like 20s. And I was like well I'll do that.

I'll see how that goes. And I just did sets of 20 and I added 10 pounds a week. And I did it for like 16 weeks.

And added like 160 pounds to my 20. And I was like. So did your Wendler and Max go up too though?

Oh yeah. Well I mean I'm guessing because I was close to my one rep max on my 21x body. True yeah.

Yeah. So hopefully. Yeah.

So like the end of it I did like. I think I did I have a video of doing like 465 for 20. Jesus.

And then I was like this is stupid. That's enough. Oh yeah.

And this is when I was eating like the 6,000 calories a day thing. The burritos. Oh dude.

I was like. You know Milos is the one who said like there's no such thing as overtraining only under eating. And like I will say as a natural guy who did that.

Um. I feel like I can kind of attest to it. Like I trained a lot of oil.

How old were you? 25. Yeah I mean.

I feel like when you're 25 and under around there. You can do it every week. I can.

I lived at a gym. I was a gym owner. I lived at the gym.

Yeah. And I trained. That was all I did.

I ate and I trained. That's literally all I did when I was doing that. It was eight hours a day of food and training.

Yeah. I've decreased my loading. Increased my warm ups.

Everything more like proper. And I'm just in more pain. That's it.

You said you do more warm up. Less volume and you're in more pain. Is that what you said?

That sounds right. Yeah. So that's what I was doing.

I did the 20 rep sets. For deadlift. And I was doing three sets of 20 on squat.

And I got up to four or five for 20. One. Barbell back squats.

For squatting. For squatting. I was 235 natural.

That's big. I mean. That's a fucking.

For natural. That's a lot of fucking reps. Um.

And uh. And then um. I benched.

So bench has been my biggest natural lift. Like. Built a bench.

Every time I touch the bench up. It blows up. And so.

I don't bench. Which is why I do it. But for the six.

I only did it for six weeks. I put 35 pounds on. Naturally.

I have the pictures. What was your 20 rep max for bench? So.

I hadn't benched in like a year or two. Yeah. But I did it for this little cycle.

And so I was doing seven sets of everything. Seven sets of bench. Seven sets of.

Not dead lifting squat. But seven sets of. Rows.

Leg presses. But I did bend it. Leg press.

Seven sets of 20. Yeah. That's how I grew.

I was doing. I started at 245. For seven sets of five.

And six weeks later. I benched. Uh.

395. For one. And I had never like.

I didn't put a. Yeah. Anything on there.

So like. I think the week of. I did like.

335 for. Seven sets of five. Like six weeks.

Yeah. But. But I like.

I. Because I only had that in that one lift. And then I just knew that there are guys who had that on all their lifts.

It's just like. That's my worst lift. So it's.

Your bench. Better than the whole. Horrible bench.

My one rep max ever was 415. You were probably bodybuilding benching. I was like powerlifting benching.

Which is. Yeah. Six inches.

So when you train. I mean do you. Do you have programming that you follow?

This year is the first year I've ever fallen on a program. I love that. Like that.

Like. It's so confirming. I mean.

You know in your field. There's an art to being good. Yeah.

And you. It's. If you think you need to follow a perfect program.

Yeah. If someone took everything I did. Or ever someone who took everything you did and did it again.

Even if you did it. Yeah. But you were following a plane instead of just doing it naturally.

You wouldn't be here. Yeah. It's really interesting.

Because the hardest thing to develop is intuition. Yeah. It's like how can it.

Like when. When you're like I got it today. I'm gonna.

I'm gonna gas it. Like can someone teach you that? I don't know.

I mean. I definitely know. Like for work.

I have seasons where like. I gas it. You know what I mean.

Where I'm like. I'm working. 16 hours.

I'm taking every stimulant I know of. And like. And I'm like not getting as much sleep as I should.

Back and just keep pushing. Yeah. And then there's some days where I like wake up and I'm like.

No. Not today. Not today.

Yeah. I'm like. Yeah.

And so. I was. I was.

I was. I was putting on my. My profile.

I was like. I don't have like. I work.

Like weekdays weekends are all the same. For me. So basically.

I wake up. And if I feel good I work. And if I wake up and I feel like shit.

I change this. The nature of the work I do. Yeah.

So it's like. If I don't feel good. I'll plan more meetings.

I'll take more calls. Because I'm not. Like I'm not gonna be doing deep work.

Yeah. But if I wake up and I'm like. Dude I could cure cancer today.

Then I'm like. All right. Let me write a book chapter.

Really? Let me script out. Like a.

A presentation or something. That's like really deep. And I'll just tell the team like.

Cancel some of my calls or move them. Like I'm gonna be in the zone today. Yeah.

But I also imagine over time. Whether consciously or subconsciously. You know.

That like. When you wake up on those shitty days. Doing certain things.

That you can at least do. At the right capacity. Will put you back into a place where you feel good to.

Oh yeah. Where most people are like. I'm gonna take today off.

They don't feel good. And the next thing you know. It's been a year.

And they've taken a whole year off. What's up Julio? I'm glad you came for legs.

Because legs is what. Like. I could push on upper body.

But like. I hesitated. I was like.

Mmm. Girl I want to ask someone to train legs with me. And I was like.

Yeah. Fuck it. We're gonna train with you.

Oh I got the hot spot. Okay. You guys know Sebum.

He was tied it up. And so. We had some of the drinks.

The Sebum kids are his. His. His.

Uh. His. Hi.

And then you get this probably even more than I do. But like the generic. Hey big guy.

Like hey Jim's that way. Or whatever the fuck. Yeah.

No matter what someone says. And you know. Half the time it's some sort of.

Left-handed compliment or whatever. I just say like. Just trying to catch up to you bro.

And so it doesn't matter what they. But like. I've had so many people who like.

Said something mean. And I'm like. Just trying to catch up to you bro.

And then they're like. Ah. Fine.

Yeah. I was a vegan dick. You know.

And that. That's always been my. My big counter.

Yeah. For some reason I always get people like. Are you.

Like that C-bum guy. And my response is just. No.

But I get that all the time. And then like. Probably 50% of the time.

People are like. Oh. And then I just walk away.

That's it. I'm also equally awkward and antisocial. So if someone comes up.

And like. Do I know you from somewhere. I'm like.

I don't know. Probably not. And then I just leave.

Not from somewhere. So. Training wise.

You just train by feel. And you just consistently. Add weight when you can.

I have a program now. Well. Every year.

But yeah. Until now. I was pretty like.

Consistent in what I would do. And like. Your movement.

I just knew in my brain. Yeah. You know like.

My top movements. When I start. If it's incline chest.

Dumbbell press. It's. If it's pendulum squat.

If it's bent over rows. I'm like. Last year.

I need this much. So I'm going to do this much. This week.

Yeah. Yeah. And you just work to like.

I'm going to add 20 pounds to it. Or 30 pounds. Yeah.

It was. For a while. It was like.

Alright. I'm going to do this for six. And then I got eight.

And I got 10. And then I'll put a 25 on. And I'm back down to six.

Yeah. And then 10. All the stuff that I know.

Is like. Stick to a handful of lifts. Don't do a lot of variations.

Slowly I'd progress it. You know. Reps or weight.

Right. But then like. I just.

Noticed that I had less motivation to train. And so like. I was more prone to skip days.

And things like that. Yeah. And like.

This was. Today was harder than I would normally train my legs. So I'll probably like.

It'll probably fuck my. Like. I'm supposed to train legs tomorrow.

Yeah. So I was just like. I'll stop.

Probably. If you train legs tomorrow. I'll be impressed.

Yeah. Yeah. So I'll just like.

I'll skip that. And maybe I'll skip a second. Like.

Because it's every other day. So I would have trained legs tomorrow. And two days from now.

So I'll probably just skip the next two. And then hit it again. Yeah.

Like. If you don't have that flexibility. Like.

If you were in town. I'm like. Oh.

I'm falling. Like. Why bother.

Like. You know what I mean. Like.

I've had people. There's like. Three.

You know. Fitness dudes. Who have.

You know. Followings. Whatever.

They were in town. I saw this. Kid.

Who's like. Not a competitor. Who's like.

I'm following a program. And so all the dudes are lifting. All the big guys are lifting together.

Just throwing weights around. And he's like sitting Indian style. On the side.

Like. I'm following. It's like.

Dude. You're missing the point. Yeah.

Like. You're not going to get. Be like 40.

And be like. Man. I'm really glad.

I followed that program. For sure. I was 22.

And. You know. Training with those guys.

And then going home. Being fired up about training with them. Will.

Will result to your lifts. Going up more too. Right.

The motivation you get from that will be more. Oh. So much.

Yeah. Like. And the memory.

And like all the positive experience that come from it. Do you listen to music when you train? Yeah.

What do you listen to? It varies. Alternative rock.

Eminem. Kanye West. 90s hip hop.

Yeah. I listen to more or less the same stuff. I'm not a music person.

It's the only time I listen to music is when I train. Yeah. And so.

I like. So bad that a friend of mine from high school gave me this CD. It was rap CD one through six.

And I uploaded it on my iPod. And then. Like.

I went through all of college. And then we were hanging out a couple years later. He's like.

So what do you live. You know. What do you listen to now in your train?

I was like. The new mix that you made me. And he was like.

The what? And I was like. Yeah.

The one that you made me. He was like. In high school.

And I was like. Yeah. Rap CD one through six.

I still listen to it. He's like. Dear God.

He's like. Dude. There's been things that have.

He's like. Eminem's had two CDs since then. No.

No. He's like. I'll make you a new mix.

And so. Spotify's out by then. You just still have an iPod.

Yeah. Right. Like.

I've got a Zune. Yeah. I didn't even have one of those.

It's weird because now. I'm turning 35 in like a couple months. In August.

And I was like. I am. Like.

Like. When I. Before I turned 30.

I was like. Young and successful. Yeah.

And now I'm just a white dude. Yeah. I felt that too.

I was like. Holy shit. You're only 25.

And you won the Olympia. Yeah. Now you're like.

All right. You're the old guy. Now.

Yeah. That's one. You're just.

Yeah. It's. I'm just a guy.

Yeah. What's interesting with. Like with the Olympia.

In terms of like competitive landscape. And whatnot. Is that like.

In the game of business. Everyone is a competitor. Like everyone's in the game.

It's just some people don't know it. And that's what I find kind of interesting. About like the business world.

It's like. You compete against the world. And it's global.

Yeah. And you compete against guys that are 90. And like.

Like. Like. You can't age out.

How old is Kendall Jenner? She. She became.

The youngest self-made billionaire. And then they revoked it. And they did.

Like. Because she wasn't actually. Or.

Yeah. The numbers weren't. She overstated some of her numbers.

Like. Nine months later. After she got in all of the PR.

Yeah. After I. I'd gone into a deep seven day depression.

Because of. How inadequate I felt. As a result.

Compared to this. Little white girl. Yeah.

No. I mean. It was actually like.

It was actually. Weirdly. It was a.

It was a. It was a. Career defining moment for me.

Really? It sounds ridiculous to say. When I saw her on the cover of Forbes.

The 19 years old. As a billionaire. I felt like a failure.

I said. Because I did. Yeah.

I was. I was 20. I think it's 26 or 27.

I can't remember what it was. And I'd taken home. 17 million dollars in income that year.

And I was like. I'm. Hot shit.

Nice. I'm. I'm.

I'm. Cool. And then.

It was just like. 19 year old girl. Billionaire.

I was just like. I suck. At everything.

And that was actually the moment where I was like. She understands. So I fundamentally think that if someone makes more money than me.

Then they know something about business that I don't. She was the one that got me on to brand. Was that she was able to make more than me.

Because she had a brand. And I was like. Maybe there's something to this.

And I. Did I also encourage your philosophy to not compare to other people though? Hmm.

What's. I. To compete against yourself and all that.

Hell yeah. So there's a really good one there. Is that.

There's a difference between. Criticism and. And uh.

Insults. So if you insult yourself. Then you make a judgment.

If you criticize. You just point out a discrepancy. So she's bigger than I am in this way.

Why? That's criticism. Like I could do better.

Judgment is. And because of that you are bad. Yeah.

Alright. Be easy my friend. Yes sir.

Appreciate you. Jonathan. Appreciate you.

Have a wonderful day guys.
