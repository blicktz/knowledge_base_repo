I just spent eight hours with the top 10 business owners on school from last month, sharing the money-making strategies that they used to win the school games. Here are the best ones. The first thing we talked about affected every business in the room and yours, which is how to get more leads and how to turn those into customers.

So it's using a free school group. Okay. So essentially what we do is we create like content on YouTube, Instagram stories.

We're doing a bit of cold outreach as well. I thought it didn't really help with this. So you're doing content?

Yeah. So content? Is one of them?

You're doing outreach to the people who follow and all that stuff on your content? Yeah. And also we would get like school organic traffic as well.

Yeah. Starting to do that. Yeah.

What ranking are you? Ranking. Your free group?

Like, you know, you're in discovery? No idea. Like we didn't optimize for that.

I am. Be worth looking at. How many, do you know how many searches a day we get on school?

I don't know. A lot. A lot.

Like, yeah, there's a lot. But the pro, honestly, there's more visits to profiles. That makes sense.

Yeah. And then they go profile. Way more traffic goes through the profiles.

But Zane, so you have, so you have content, you have outreach. We'll get you. Don't worry about it.

We have content. We have outreach. What else are you doing?

Yeah. It's like the school organic. So people just click in my profile.

And it also being other people's profiles as well. You know, they just join our curiosity. Yeah.

So we then get those people. They join the free school group as well. So we promote on like whatever platforms.

So how do they, so in each of these, so you make content and do you have it in like the description? And do you integrate into the content? Yeah.

So I just like leave the link in the description. Also, I put in my Instagram bio. So actually in YouTube videos where I just promote my Instagram, people would join the Instagram or follow me on Instagram.

And they just join the community. I have curiosity, even though I didn't promote it. It was just in the bio.

With the outreach, we didn't promote the free group. That's only like if people weren't interested, which is like, okay, we've got this free group. You might want to join it.

And then with school, people would just join naturally. Okay. So I would say bio links plus description.

Yeah. Okay. Got that.

And so, and what's in there? Is that the free group or the paid group? It's all free.

Okay. So this, this goes to the free group. Free school.

Got it. All right. What else?

Okay. So when they join, they get the auto DM, which is the first line of our DM script. Okay.

And then we also in the classroom section. So we have like a start here post that tells them to go to the classroom. So DM as soon as they join the free school.

Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

It's all on the free group. Got it. Okay.

And then we also have like a start here, like pinned post that tells people to watch a course. And there's a pinned course as well. So that's in the classroom section.

And the course is essentially like a perfect webinar by like Russell Brunson. Like we kind of break it into a course, but it's like a perfect webinar. Yeah.

And it indoctrinates them to like book a call. And then we just close them on the call. And then we also did the DMs as well.

So you CTA to call. And then what do you do to maintain the value in the community? Yeah.

So our community is actually like, it's extremely like inactive. So I just put a post like now and then. But it's like the members who are inactive are the ones buying though.

It's like. Because they, they, you have like zombies or like dead bodies there. Yeah.

So like the free community, I think it had like 400 ish members, 450 ish. And we've got like 53 sales. So it was very like high converting.

Yeah. Yeah. So it's pretty active.

But the community was dead. But yeah, people. So you converted 14% of people who went to your free thing.

Yeah, exactly. Got it. And did you convert them into just a higher ticket paid community?

Is that what it was? Yeah. So it was 999.

Yeah. Got it. That's why it's dead by the way.

Hmm? Because you just took the most engaged people in the moment. Yeah.

But your high ticket community is engaged. Yes. That's completely active.

Yeah. You basically. If you take your most engaged people and you.

Take them out and put them somewhere else. And you're like talk here instead. Of course.

It makes just total sense. No. It's like the people who are inactive were joining the.

The high. Because they're active there. Yeah.

Yeah. That's true. That's actually true.

No. That's exactly why. Yeah.

Yeah. And we also tested this with someone else as well. So.

He was going to enter the school games. But he just kind of gave up. But he was making like $500 a month.

And we got him to $10,900 this month. So what the funnel was. Was TikTok and Instagram real short form content.

For the school community. Exact same process. And we basically 20x this income.

So literally just drawing. I mean. I was saying this the other day.

Because somebody asked me this question. I think on a Q&A call. But it's like.

How do I convert people from free to paid? And I still think that the single simplest way to do that. Is just.

Like. Depending on the price point. Like if it's a low ticket paid.

Then you just add the onboarding call. To personalize their experience. Which then it's like.

Hey. What are your goals? What are your obstacles right now?

You know what? You might be a really good fit. Or whatever.

And then you can just sell straight into it. If it's higher ticket. Then you have.

Your. You know. Your VSL.

Or your webinar. Or whatever. That you incorporate into their onboarding processes.

And allow them to self-select. If it's a. You know.

$5,000. Or whatever. You know.

Plus offer. That's probably the most. I can imagine that would be the most.

Widely adopted method. This one? Yeah.

Yeah. It's simple. It's the most easy to understand.

Yeah. This is very simple. I almost didn't understand anything else that I heard.

Yeah. But that. Yeah.

I've seen that being used over and over and over again. Like in a lot of. Slightly different ways.

But. Because a free community. If you've got content.

And then you're promising a free community. Conversion rates are through the roof. It's the most efficient mechanism to convert them.

It's a lead magnet. I mean fundamentally. Yeah.

And like on the free community as well. You make like indoctrination posts. It's like you know how Russell Brunson talks about like the internal beliefs.

External beliefs. You know. You just basically shut out all their limiting beliefs.

Okay. We need to make a note to make a training on it. Yeah.

I was. I'm going to simple. I'm going to do a simple version of this.

Which is just. Traffic. Free group.

Yep. Free school. It's the group funnel.

Yeah. Free school. We already have that training.

Yeah. But it's old and in the wrong place. Yeah.

And it's for high ticket. Yeah. And it's for.

Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.

But that works so well. It's probably the most common pattern on school. Is I think someone did an analysis that.

Almost everyone ranking in discovery and leaderboards has two groups. One free. One paid.

It's like the. Yeah. It's the funnel.

It's the tactic. Yeah. And it works.

Yeah. So this like. For everybody at home.

Traffic. Free school. DM to WebE.

Plus all. Basically you just drive everything there. So your pin posts there.

You make content. You soft toss it. Be like hey.

Make sure you watch this. And you're doing the pitch in the classroom. Which kind of is disarming.

Because you're like. Oh this isn't a webinar. Yeah.

It's. It's a module. Yeah.

And we've got some people. To rather than making like one long video. Because this is what I teach you to the students as well.

Is to break it up into small videos. Yeah. And like distribute the webinar like that.

Make it not look like. Yeah. It's like there's four videos.

An introduction. And then three core stories. And the fifth video is.

I've got this thing for you. And it puts everyone off guard as well. Because like I don't sign up to webinars anymore.

Because like I'm in that space. This just puts people off guard completely. Yeah.

Every step of this is like. Extremely efficient. Because like.

I know if you have a link in bio to a free group. It absolutely crushes. Like those groups are the ones that are at the top of discovery.

Because it's just so efficient. We see 80% conversion rates on the pages. Like.

And so. You get them in. And then the auto DM.

Sends like. 100% of people. And then.

You put them to that module. And that module. It starts the funnel.

And the funnel is like module one. Module two. Yeah.

And then you get them onto a call. Yeah. Which is probably going to be the most efficient method at converting free to paid.

Yeah. And some people. They don't even book the course.

They watch the course. They don't book the call. But then when you DM them.

They're like. Oh yeah. Watch the course.

And then they do it. So it's like. So you DM again.

So basically after they watch it. You follow up. DM.

No. So we just DM them anyway. But some people just still watch the course.

And then book. Or they'll book later on. They'll just come back to it.

And as long as you're making the post. Then they're like. They find.

They go back to the course. To get the link. And then they book it.

Yeah. How much is the thing that you're selling them? The paid group?

So it's 999 a month. Okay. But this could work even for a cheaper thing.

Yeah. Like. Like.

You don't have to do high ticket. You don't even. You don't even have to do a call actually.

It could just be. Selling a 99 dollar a month thing. Over DMs.

And maybe even a call. Because for more. I'm just thinking for beginners.

You need. Because you don't have a ton of traffic. And a ton of like.

Like. Privileges to work with essentially. You have to like.

Get the most efficient conversion. Yeah. At every point.

Right. Because you're looking to squeeze. Every last drop.

It's also. I mean. This is also.

From a. From a technical complexity. Like.

This is pretty simple. Like. Click to free.

Free to. You make the five modules. And then you.

Talk to them. And ask them. Well yeah.

This is the most effective. It works amazingly well as well. Because.

Especially with the short form content. This is something I realized recently. So the guy we was working with.

He had like 900 members. He made one post. And like 800 people joined.

And we were like. That's insane. And of course.

We booked like hundreds of sales calls from them. Yeah. It's monster.

This is very simple. I like this a lot. Do this.

This is great. Really good. The thing that I keep.

This is me making a bet. Is that I will bet that there's going to be a lot more. Thousand dollar a month.

Type quote. High ticket. Like shifting over.

Partially because of what you noticed. Which is. If you can double or triple acquisition.

Because it's LTV to CAC ratio. And so you can still drive down CAC a lot. To improve that ratio.

And so. I think. I mean.

The space always has like a vibe. Right? Like you have like the rank and rent.

Which is kind of coming back. Right? I think in the high ticket world.

There's a lot of. A lot of people. Like the pendulum swung a little bit this way.

And I think it's kind of coming back. Just a tiny bit. Where people.

This is why like brand and content. And like value in advance. Is becoming more and more important.

Because there's not a lot of trust. And to be fair. There was.

There will always be less and less trust over time. And the more mature the platforms get. The less just eyeball arbitrage exists.

Like if. You remember. For that five seconds.

That clubhouse was a thing. Like I had. I knew plenty of people who went on there.

And then we're doing like. A hundred thousand a day. On clubhouse.

Because it was just. It was just huge arbitrage of eyeballs. They're getting way more exposure.

Than they normally would. But as platforms kind of. Settle.

Then it's like. Okay. Who's legit starts to rise.

And who makes the best content. And things like that. And so.

Right now. There's not like. Besides school.

There's not like. Another platform. That's really like emerging.

And so. It's my belief that. That's why I trust.

That's why content stuff. Is so important. It's because it'll improve conversion.

Across the funnel. And I think that this whole. Thousand dollar a month.

Like. Instead of being the. Three thousand.

Four thousand dollars a month. I think. A lot more people are willing to stomach.

The nine. Nine. Nine.

A month. Because they can see. And as soon as we roll out more stuff.

With like reviews. And things like that. It'll just make it more.

And more trusted. And I was talking. The other day about this.

But like. If I could. Start gym lunch all over again.

The probably the biggest thing. That I would have done differently. Is.

I would have probably tried to make it. Like 10 grand a year. And.

I would have put all my focus on. How do I keep. 80.

90 percent of my customers renewing. And. That would have been my main focus.

Like. I just want such a crazy. Value.

Price discrepancy. That no one would leave. Um.

And they would refer more people. Et cetera. Et cetera.

Because I would have probably acquired. Two. Three.

Four times the customers. But they also would have stuck. Uh.

Longer. Because like. Over the last however many years.

We've done like. 5500 locations. That have gone through gym watch.

And like. If all. 5500 of those locations.

Were still paying me. I'd be richer than I am today. Um.

And so. I think about that a lot. Of like.

Sure. There's on one hit. Like.

When you don't know how to sell. It's very exciting to like. Start raising your price.

And be like. Oh my god. I just sold 10,000.

Oh my god. I sold 20,000. Oh my god.

100,000. Like. It gets really cool.

But. Once you learn how to acquire customers. You then become completely obsessed.

On the other side. Which is. Oh shoot.

You realize the game. Like. Sam and I have talked about this at length.

Which is. Having to go get customers. I mean.

Of course you have. Like. You want to be able to go get customers.

But not to have to go get customers. And so like. That's the big difference.

And so like. When I look at businesses now. I care almost exclusively.

About. How much does this thing grow on word of mouth. How much.

Like. What percentage of customers stay. Every year.

Once they're like. In and activated. And what not.

Because then. It means that I get credit. For customers I sold two years ago.

And so. Even if you sold 100 customers a year. If you can keep all of them.

10 years from now. You're 10 times bigger. And so the vast majority.

Of like the internet marketing world. Focuses on growing. By simply selling more units.

Because they can't keep anybody. But the people who make the most money. Just don't lose customers.

But you have to like. Learn how to sell. In order to get there.

But like. This is kind of the evolution that happens. And so.

Pricing. I like. My thoughts on pricing.

Has changed from the. The old school. Dan Kennedy model.

Which is like. Say as high of a price as you can. Without cracking a smile.

Like. It swung back a little bit more. To like.

Well. Let's just. Make them smile.

At. How blown away they are. With the value that we have.

And then. They're more likely to tell their friends. More likely to stay longer.

And then. Like. I wildly underestimate.

How. How much word of mouth. Affects.

These businesses. Like. Some of you guys have probably bought.

Coaching courses. And whatnot. Because a friend of yours was like.

I went through his YouTube training. It was actually really good. And then.

That guy doesn't know. That you were told that. He just sees an ad.

And he sees a conversion. And he's like. Oh my ads are killing it.

But it's not that. It's because the product's really good. And so.

Like. In the early days of Jim once. We got a hundred to one return on advertising.

It wasn't because my ads were exceptional. It was because everybody who was going through. Was just printing money.

And so like. That's the. That's the.

The big shift. And those are the guys who make. The most money.

It's the ones who actually have a pretty good product. In the second clip. We talk about pricing.

And I talk about pricing a lot. Because pricing has the strongest. Lever on profit.

More than getting more customers. More than even retaining them longer. Nailing pricing will make you more money.

Than any other skill. I have a question on the pricing. Because I did.

You know. The. What you said.

Charge as higher price. And I tried to increase it. But I didn't follow.

The principle of only increase the price. After sufficiently increasing value. Yeah.

So I noticed. The people are much more. Likely to ask for a refund.

At the higher price. Before it was 77 a month. Now it's 137.

Should I suggest going down to 87. Which is still bigger than the previous price. Or should I keep it?

It's not a huge price change. Okay. Yeah.

Just 77 to 137 is not like a math. I mean. It's a.

There's definitely going to be a jump. In terms of conversion. Or like rather a drop in conversions.

But the. All you're optimizing for. Is conversion rate times LTV.

That's like. That's the whole equation. So we talked about the four levers in this business.

Right? Like you've got traffic. You've got conversion.

You've got price. And you've got churn. Like those are the four levers.

So like to grow the business. You have to increase. Well.

Decrease churn. But increase the other three. Right?

And so. If you know that. Let's say you've got a hundred clicks to a page.

Let's say at 77. You convert twice as many customers. Well.

It comes down to really just like. What's your earning per eyeball? And in the affiliate world.

It's called EPCs. Which is earning per click. And so you just literally want to make the most money per click.

Over the longest period of time. And so now. If the 77 converts at twice the percentage of the 137.

And they churn at half the rate. Then over. When you do that hypothetical max calculation.

You'll be. Like you literally. All of this is just math.

You just plot the. See what it looks like. See where it maxes out.

See what the other one maxes out at. And you're like. Okay.

That's the price. So how would I do that? If I'm sending people straight from YouTube to about page on school.

You look at what it's at. At 137. Or whatever.

And then you know. You knew what your metrics were at 77. Right?

And so you just compare what's the. So you look. Here.

Let's do the math. So. Let's say you've got 77.

17 bucks. Oops. There we go.

That's a seven. All right. There.

And what was churn on 77? Well. I don't have the exact number.

So that's another issue. Obviously. Yeah.

Okay. Like. Let's just walk through it hypothetically.

Give me a ballpark. Like three months average would stay people. Okay.

So that would be 33% churn. Right? Yeah.

And so you divide that by churn. I mean I have bad numbers because I started like. That's fine.

A few months ago. Dude. You're fine.

Don't worry about it. On 137 is probably like two months only. Okay.

Cool. All right. So 137 divided by 50% churn means you just double 137.

Right? And so you've got. What is that?

200 and 74 is LTV here. And then here you've got. What's that divided times three?

251. What was that? 231.

Thank you. 240. 241?

31. 31. Okay.

Cool. So LTV here is bigger than here. But then the question comes into conversion.

Right? Which happens before this. So then you're like.

All right. What percentage of clicks do I convert here? What percentage of clicks do I convert here?

And so. Can someone do. 274 divided by 231.

For me. 1.186. 1.186.

Yeah. Right. So if you can convert more than 20%.

More on this one. Than this one. This makes you more money.

Does that make sense? Yeah. How would I track that if I'm sending people.

From YouTube straight to school about. You've got to just use some like. Fancy guesswork.

But you should have got a feel of like. When you were. Yeah.

Making a video. I wait per day. Link.

How many kind of members joined? Yeah. Okay.

And do you know. If there was a big drop. Or if it kind of stayed the same.

I mean. There probably was a decrease. But not.

You know. More than 20% or whatever. Well 20% might be hard to feel.

Yeah. Because it'd be like. One day you get four.

One day you get three. Like five. Like that might be tough to feel.

But I know that that metric's coming out soon anyways. For us. So once.

As soon as that conversion metric's on there. I've already looked at it. By the way.

Like. Link. Conversion rates across the platform.

There's a. The biggest indicator is the price obviously. Yeah.

Right. Yeah. I mean some free groups convert at 80%.

But. The difference. Between.

You know. Something that's like. 10.

20. 30. Those things can convert like 5%.

But once you get a price. That's. Like.

Over 100. It drops significantly. Yeah.

Yeah. And so. Here we know what each of these is worth.

And so you're just thinking. What percentage of people buy it. And that's the conversion.

And so if 50% more people buy this. Then you're like. Okay.

Well then. 50%. Even.

I'm making 50% more sales at this price. Versus. Uh.

I mean this is just a classic like chart of pricing versus volume. That's all it is. I really want to make sure it makes sense though.

Yeah. Okay. This is how you figure out pricing.

And I would just encourage you guys to be willing to test. Like the. PC.

Who owns. Who just sold profit well. Um.

They did this big meta study. But basically. Uh.

The more frequently you analyze price. The more profitable your company is. Just.

It's like a direct correlation. So companies that never look at their price. Never adjust their price.

Are way less profitable. The ones that look at it annually. Which are less profitable.

The ones that look at quarterly. So just be willing to test price. I got some questions for you though.

Like which one do you think is making. You more money on your traffic. Because your traffic's probably remained.

Somewhat a constant. Right. Well I'm not pushing as hard as during the school games.

You know. Because I was selling every video. And I don't want to do that for long term brand.

So it's hard to compare. But I would say it's more like the optics. Of being less than 100 a month.

It feels like different you know. Than over 100 a month. So which one do you think was more efficient?

Probably 77. Because it's like. I feel like the product has more.

More aligned with the value there. And your audience is younger. I'm guessing.

No. They're not. 25 to 60.

Oh. Okay. Well I'll tell you personally.

We have a portfolio company that we ran. This is like. You guys might find this really interesting.

Hey guys. If you want to be in this room. It's actually free.

For all these people. Because they won the school games. And so school is a community platform.

It helps you build a group. And a community that you can monetize online. Or that you can build for free.

And so we give you the tools. We give you the training. And we give you the community.

So that you can actually recreate that. And as of right now. 54.1% of people.

Who start a paid community on school. Make at least one dollar. And so I say that.

Because the first dollar business. Is the hardest one to make. Because there's so many skills.

That require you to get there. And we've been obsessing. About this for the last five years.

To make it as easy. As humanly possible. If you want to start for free.

You can go check it out. And if you want to ask me a question. I onboard all the new customers.

Every single Monday. So sign up. Start for free.

And I'll see you next Monday. It's school.com forward slash games. So we ran.

We ran. We ran a high ticket upsell. And we tested 50k.

35k. 25k. And 15k.

Wildly different price points. I'm just. I love this shit.

And so it was really interesting. Is that. The conversion rate time.

Basically the revenue we generated. From all four of those. Was identical.

And so on one hand. You might think. Oh why I'd rather just have fewer customers.

At $50,000. But for me personally. I would rather have more people.

That I can. Again. What's my value to price discrepancy.

As provided the cost of goods. It's not like. You know.

Like I don't want to eat into. You know. Crazy margins or something.

But provided the margin on all. You know. All the services are still pretty good.

I would rather have. Four times the customers. To then sell.

Keep. And then also have a crazy. Like.

In terms of word of mouth. From those people. Saying that my thing is unbelievable.

That make sense? Do you know what I've noticed? Like.

High ticket. You can like. Change your price.

And conversion doesn't move. But with the lower ticket. It really does.

Yeah. Which. I think it's because it's more intimate.

Like. When you buy something. That's real high ticket.

You're. It's small. And you're talking to a human.

And everything. But when it's lower ticket. It.

It does seem to make a big difference. Because a high ticket fundamentally. If you believe you're going to get this big expensive outcome.

Then. Logically. 25k.

And 35k. Like. If you go and make a billion dollar business.

They're both worth it. Like. Right.

It just like. It comes down to whether you can actually afford the. You know.

The difference. And so. I think it becomes like a structural.

Conversion difference. Where. What I mean by that is like.

Some people literally can't afford the difference. Between. You know.

15k. Versus 50k. Like.

There's just some people. Who just literally can't afford it. Even though.

They both might want to buy it. But yeah. Here.

You're. You're selling. In a.

You're alone. It's like you. With your finger over the button.

You're like. I mean. My fear is that.

If I decrease it to 87. I would piss off all the people that joined at 137. Yeah.

So. Like. How would you test the price then?

Hmm. Well. The worst case is they could cancel and come back.

Not the end of the world. Because. So.

Just. Just for everybody. You're like.

Just from a perspective. Taking. If you plan on having this.

Business for a long time. Then it's not going to make any difference. Like.

You figuring out what the right price point is for your community. Is going to be the thing that matters most. And so.

Like. You might lose a month. Like.

You're churning already at whatever. 50%. They're going to be gone in two months anyways.

Yeah. So. Like.

I'm just being like really real. Right. So.

Like. You. We want to tweak this stuff to get the right point.

That is high by the way. Yeah. Like.

That's way above. What should I aim for at this price point? Below 20%.

Yeah. Okay. Like.

Good. Is. Good.

Is like. In between five and ten. Yeah.

Like. 20%. Is.

Like average. Is. Yeah.

Because I. I actually analyzed it. Yeah.

I actually put the whole platform's numbers into ProfitWell. Oh. Sick.

Yeah. It took ProfitWell for like seven days. To process it.

And it almost broke it. Um. Because there's like.

50 transactions a second or more. Um. But it's like.

Yeah. The. That's probably around the average.

So what's interesting is it's coming down every month. Because I think people are learning more about what works and what doesn't work. Um.

But the good ones are sub 10. But so if you're 50. That price is too high.

I don't. I don't have data to be honest. Yeah.

Okay. Yeah. This is the main point.

Yeah. You can do it if you just. If you have like four hours and some coffee.

Yeah. So like. Go to your churned members.

And it'll click on their membership. And it'll tell you their LTV. Okay.

We calculated on a per member level. So just go and fill out your own spreadsheet. Yeah.

Um. And you'll figure it out. Like.

It's. The numbers are there. That's what I said.

You just have to use some. Some different. Interaction methods.

Yeah. And for the like general churn. Should I just export like the list of all members.

And compare that to like week to week or something. No. No.

You want to look at your churned members. We'll tell you their LTV. So you want to see all of your churned members.

And their LTVs. Oh yeah. And then look at the average LTV.

That's your LTV. That. From there you can reverse engineer your churn.

Yeah. Because LTV. Would be divided by your price.

That gives you your. You can do the math. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

That answers it. Yeah. Cool.

Awesome. Well this is great. I know that we.

Yeah. Go for it. So just going back to.

Well on pricing too. And we were saying with Jim Lodge. I do believe I could sell what I've built for 30k.

Like I believe I sell it for 30k. Whatever. But I also do have a painting business.

That's my. Is my main focus. And I am also willing to sell it.

Same thing for 97. So. Just to go.

This is what my advice to you would be. Because I understand your business outside of this business. I think that I would try and.

I would want it to be just high enough of a price that they care. And so maybe make it 5,000 a year. Or maybe 10,000.

But the whole purpose is not to make money. I mean sure you'll make money doing that. But the real money is that if you can get those people.

To then open your version of painting under your logo. And basically you can consolidate. And have them use your systems and whatnot.

Then it's like. They kind of basically become partners of yours. As they open up locations underneath of your flag.

And if you have the capital. Then you can front. I'm sure the capital is not too big for starting painting stuff.

I would. I mean do you know. I mean.

It's like 2017. Right. You can afford it.

So like. I would be like. Offer the capital.

You can get 20%. And I'll give you a base. And then I'll show you how to run the business.

Or whatever. And like. You're going to be a co-owner.

Like that's. I think that might be the mega play for you. And then you can still use that.

To have them have skin in the game. And you take that community. And skim from the top.

So it's like. You let the. Like you don't need to take.

You don't need to bet on them. You let them. You hold tryouts.

You know. And put the pull sticks in. And just see who kills each other.

And wins the leaderboard. And I'll bet you. If your leaderboard was about.

Who is the. Who's the next one. Who's going to be able to partner with you.

I'll bet you leaderboard would go. Oh. Take the notes.

It's good. Cool. So you got what you need to do.

I have a question. Yeah. Shoot.

You had that one. Form. That one equation.

Conversion rate times LTV. Was there like an equals to it? Conversion rate.

Where? Yeah. You wrote it on the.

I think you flipped it over on the other page. Oh. Traffic chump.

Bottom. I don't believe that. That's where it was.

But I don't know if you said. That you finished the equation. Oh for the.

These guys at the top. Yeah. I think we're just talking about.

Like possible practice. So this is price divided by churn equals LTV. Okay.

That's what this. That's what this is. And then traffic times conversion.

This is the other two of this is. Then you've got price. As your levers.

And then you have a churn. So these are the four levers of the business that we're talking about. So if you want to make more money in your community.

You either have to drive more traffic to it. You have to convert a higher percentage of that traffic. You have to price it as high as you can.

And you. And this is all balanced with. Churn.

Which is okay. Well. I can raise my price.

But does that also increase churn? And by how much? And so that's why we're fine.

Like. It's balanced between these two. And price also affects conversion.

So there's a bi-directional relation between churn. Price. And conversion.

And then. This is. This is the machine.

Right. This is your business machine. Right.

This is the machine that we have at school. This is what you drive into it. Which is the traffic.

So this is the effort that you guys are doing on a regular basis. This is the inputs. Into the.

Like. This is the big black box of making money. This is school.

And then this is what we're driving traffic. Whether that's Facebook ads. Or whether that's content.

Or direct outreach. Or whatever it is. This then just flows into the machine.

You're looking for the maximum. Like yield. Yeah.

So like. How much dollars per click. Yeah.

In a way. Right. And all of these variables play into that.

And you're looking for like the most efficient. Way to turn the click into some money. And.

Yeah. Couldn't you just put that in school. Like this metric.

You know. And just get that number. So we see it.

Because you have all the stats. No. Which one?

Yeah. Well I mean like. Yeah.

I can calculate that. It's. Like if we had that.

You know. If you go into the dashboard. You can see the MRR.

If we could see that right underneath. Or maybe like. You know.

The churn. So we can see it in real time. Because it's easy to see increases in MRR.

But like this takes more effort. Yeah. It's a good point.

Like. I. You.

Yeah. The next kind of metric we're rolling out. Is like the.

Traffic and conversion stats. That helps. Because now you can see your conversion.

And your clicks. Right. And I already have that data.

I've already looked at it. That's why I had some. Insight.

And then we've already got the churn data too. So I guess. Yeah.

That would be an interesting formula. It would be like EPC. Yeah.

Winnings per click. I think. Yeah.

That could be a cool thing to see. And then. Yeah.

Good idea. In this next clip. We talk about beating your competition.

By doing things differently than them. And how to identify a great market. And other great opportunities.

And how to approach them in a way. That other people aren't seeing. If you're on school.

Especially in like the last couple of months. You've probably noticed. That there's a lot of really good value there.

But it was getting stuffy. There wasn't a whole lot of like. Personability.

All right. Or fun. So to speak.

So it was an obvious niche. And. It kind of happened organically.

Where. The offer was solid. Funnel builders.

Stuff like this. Different business model though. Instead of it being a high ticket.

All up at front. And then we give you the package. And then fuck off.

This one was. Hey. We'll work with you.

And you just give us a subscription. So. Thousand MRR.

And. Is it 999? What's the price?

999. Okay. Cool.

So that was the price. And so we started with. What you guys were talking about.

Free. And a high ticket. So two groups.

Two groups. Okay. Great.

Yeah. This is a recurring theme. But it keeps going.

Okay. And something else that I think. So where was traffic coming from?

Just school. Okay. To this day.

We've never made a single. Nothing. Not even social.

Instagram. My friends don't know. That this is going to.

No one knows. Yeah. Okay.

Got it. So traffic was going to free group. Right?

Yeah. Traffic was going to free. Okay.

However. School games front page. Would bring people to paid.

So we had a link there. It said. Here's the free.

Okay. Interesting. Because that's where.

A lot of people were coming. So it's actually kind of like this. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Anybody have a simpler one of those?

Yeah. I said I was going to answer your question. What's up?

Selling like 15 people. Eight bought within the first hour. Okay.

And so everyone's like. Who the hell is this guy? And then from that.

It sort of was a nice flywheel. And the pre-sale you did inside of the free group. Yeah.

Actually it was friends. Family members. Basically anybody.

That had something that we could offer. Was it a Zoom like? No.

Did you do like a Zoom? No. It was like in person.

Phone calls. Oh. Okay.

A little bit of everything. People in the world. That's the way we knew.

People in the world. Just hitting the floor. Hit the pavement.

Okay. So that was what got it going. Yeah.

But then from that point on. What we were doing was sharing. I mean Sam doesn't like this phrase.

But you know. We'll have to come up with a different one. A valuable post.

Something that had it in there. I wouldn't call it what you were doing. A value post.

I think. I think. This is really interesting though.

Because. I think this industry has gotten real weird with value posts. Do you know what I mean?

It's like people posting value. But no one cares. Yeah.

Because it's not even value. It's just some bullshit opinion or article. And like.

What Goose did differently. Is he. He.

Made things fun. And. Got other people to contribute on his post.

So his posts blew up way more than value posts. There was like hundreds of comments. And they were really fun.

And like alive. And so he bought like personality fun. And like.

I would say personality and fun posts. And that. Those were like.

Crushing. A lot of people engaged. And then a lot of people were like.

Who is this guy? And they viewed his profile. Then they saw his stuff.

Then he got on the leaderboards. And now he's got another thing. Feeding him.

And then he got on discovery. And now there's another thing. So by making things fun.

And. Adding some personality. And being interesting.

And not just trying to like. Post. Articles.

You. Everyone kind of started to know who he was. And then that.

Energy started going there. And then it started looping on itself. There was like a feedback loop.

It was really interesting to see that happen honestly. Yeah. And it'll probably start happening more.

In the future. The gif group is the next one. So we're starting to see this new pattern actually.

Where funny things are working really well. This guy made a group. It's a pure joke.

Yeah. When you get to level nine. You get kicked out.

Yeah. It's really funny. Like.

See how. See what that does to everyone. And silly.

And every. All of these serious business owners. With seven figure businesses.

Are joining. And just laughing. Yeah.

And posting funny shit. And like. I love that.

I think there's. There's definitely something. That we.

A topic we could talk about today. About community culture. Yeah.

Because I think that's how you get retention. And that's how you get raving fans. As if it's.

There's a culture. And a vibe to it. And that's starting to happen.

And work. Honestly. More effective than the logic.

That I'm seeing really start to take off. It's quite interesting. That's probably how I define a culture.

Yeah. Entertainment business. In other words too.

I think what Goose really great at. Is. Making.

Posts that are really engaging. Like. I even.

Like. Again. Plenty of seven figure business owners.

I just like. Like to make it fun. So that's like your.

Thing. That you brought. It's like.

Not the value post. Just like a post that drive engagement. And to make people like collaborate.

Which is huge. Yeah. Excellent.

Um. There's a. There's a.

A theory that I have behind it. That actually. Is something that people can probably start.

To use. Because it's kind of. I didn't realize it.

Until I was looking in retrospect. But it's something that I call. Um.

Broccoli wrapped in bacon. Mm-hmm. Where.

It looks really stupid and fun. So you're curious about it. But by the time you're done reading.

You actually learn something. So each one of my posts. Take like 45 minutes to an hour to make.

Because. Sometimes I have the funny part. Or I have the.

The broccoli part. But I have to come up with the other part. And.

And. So. What we started to find.

In this system. Was right after you got eyeballs. And as long as you had a good offer.

You immediately. Could just start sharing. All of your successes.

Everything that worked. Everything that didn't work. Or even how you felt that day.

If it was somehow valuable. But not a value post. I suppose.

And. Uh. The.

The engagement went through the roof. And this is what it meant. Which might help a lot of people that are here.

Is. One of the reasons we didn't go back and start. Offering up ads.

Is because. At least. I was nervous a little bit about the.

Dilution. Of the quality of the people. Because they were all coming from school.

And those people. Knew how school worked. And were really fucking engaged.

And so. We have. I don't know.

600 members. Something like this. But we're more engaged than groups with 10,000 members.

A lot of them. And. Every time something goes off.

Like. Let's say it's someone. Struggling with a.

I don't know. A heartbreak of some kind. A bunch of community members.

Just swarm on this dude. And help him out. And.

It was that culture. As Sam was talking about. That we.

Somehow stumbled into. And realized. Oh okay.

This is this massive thing. It's not just. Like kind of a niche.

It's totally a niche. Addressing sort of the personal ability. The things that.

You might need from a friend. And then. That was why.

People were signing up for everything else. They just wanted to be able to do that. And run their business.

In like a safe space. So. There's something to be said.

I suppose. About. Being able to.

Reach out to the things. That don't logically make sense. And that was what we ended up doing there.

So. As you said. In conclusion.

The discovery. Ended up being. That backbone.

Where. Probably a lot of us. Should maybe lean on.

A little bit more. If you can. If you can.

Get that. Slightly higher. The number of people.

That are coming into school. All the time. Is just rising.

And everyone's looking like. If you've got one offer here. You've got another one.

Over there. That you can just jump over. The same person.

It's just. A bunch of really high quality leads. And people.

That are waiting to. To jump onto those. I may not have much for you to chew on there.

I just wanted to make sure. No. That was fine.

That was good. Much to share. Sweet.

It's the first one we've seen. That didn't really use external. Yeah.

Yeah. I mean. I know Evelyn.

I mean. She obviously did drive outside traffic. But she crushes internally as well.

Because she. She has truly valuable posts. And a lot of her posts.

Like the difference is. So. For everybody at home.

I feel like the difference between the value post. And. The quote value post.

And a valuable post. Is that the. Quote value posts are like.

Here's six things to. No one gives a shit. Right.

The valuable posts are like. I did work for you. Or I took risk for you.

Or I spent money for you. That you don't have to spend. And so fundamentally.

It's a bargain on time or money. And so like. Everyone's like.

Hey. I spent $25,000 on ads. And these are the ads that I ran.

And this is what happened. If you were like. Oh.

Shit. Well. Great.

I don't have to do that. And this worked for her. Like.

She gives her TLDR at the end. And you're like. That was valuable.

Yes. If you can blend. If you can get a blend of that.

And then people making. Like a parody video. About the community.

Like. Have you seen the ones. People have made for school.

If you can get a good balance of that. That I would say. Is like perfection.

Because you've got the value. But you're also smiling. And feel like.

A part of this group. Yeah. And then you've.

They're like. I can't believe I'm having fun. And I'm talking to people.

That make millions of dollars. Yeah. If you get those two.

It's like. It's experience and results. Yeah.

Yeah. So on this. On the customer success side.

Like in normal B2B businesses. We talk about both. It's like.

You can get someone results. And there's also client experience. Which are just like.

The soft and the hard. And. Believe it or not.

Like. Client experience matters. Sometimes a lot more.

Than even the results does. Like. If you have amazing results.

And a terrible experience. The moment they can find somebody else. Who can get.

Get them the result. They will leave. But.

If you have an amazing experience. And like. Mediocre results.

They're like. Well. I love these guys.

And they'll stay. Yeah. So one of the.

The tweaks that we ended up. Kind of noticing. Is that.

We. On school. It's so great.

Because community. We actually don't really. Have the post as a thing.

Or what we do. We really turn it back into them. So.

The community. Is the community. And we really highlight that.

Versus being like. The overlord. And be like.

Here's what we give you guys. It's like. No.

More and more. In the comments. Comments.

DM. Yeah. That was the thing.

That really just gets super fan. Do you guys. I'm assuming you guys.

Engage a lot. In your own community. Right.

And I think that's like. Most people could do it. Like in terms of the people at home.

Or like. My. My community is dead.

And it's because you're expecting. Like the community. To do the work.

And in the beginning. Like. You need to drum it up.

Like you need to engage. You need to be thoughtful. About your responses to comments.

And things like that. There are small things. They're really nuanced.

I mean. School understands it really well. Because it.

Uses the platform. But like. If you're making a post.

And you're not using a poll. You're fucking up. There's something that you can do.

That just adds a little bit of flavor. To what you're doing. There's also.

Like. We were talking about earlier. Pinning to module.

Like. Every little thing. That school has.

If you. If you're not using it. You're kind of leaving money on the table.

Because there's usually. A lot of thought. That's gone.

Behind the scenes. For that thing. And I'd even go as far as saying.

That you know. We have this free to paid system. But probably what's going to start.

Emerging a lot more here. Is what we did. Where.

There was a lot of drop off. Where people wanted to hire us. From the free.

But they didn't have a grand ready to go. Or they didn't have their offer ready to shoot. So.

They would fall to a low ticket. Which was just like a white label. GSL.

GHL. But. We ended up inverting it.

Because people were like. What the hell does this software do? And you had to go and explain the whole damn thing.

Instead. We just sold the mastermind. Later on.

And then gave them. This as a gift. Like hey.

And you also have the software. And then it just went through the roof. Where people just kept signing up.

So. Inevitably. We had free.

Low ticket. High ticket. And it's just been.

Wonderful. Having that. And it's just this flywheel.

Where people bounce around within it. And they. Of course.

That gift of the software. That gives them the incentive to go up. Because they're like.

I want you to just do this for me. Now I know it's here. So.

Hmm. So I guess they've got the extra piece. On the end of that simple funnel.

They've got. Free. Low ticket.

And hike ticket. Which it sounds like. That's what everyone eventually.

Wants to achieve. From what we've heard. At all of these events.

But just balancing. The traffic source. The free.

And the paid first. Is probably everyone's first step. In this fourth clip.

We talk about something. That I made tons of mistakes on early. Either you've got entrepreneurs.

Who are really good at retaining customers. And don't know how to get them. Or they're really good at marketing and sales.

And don't know how to keep them. If you're one of those people. Who's really good at marketing and sales.

And doesn't know how to keep them. This is all about making sure. That they stay with you.

And I'll tell you now. As an investor. The number one thing.

That I look at in business. Is how many people from last year. Still paying you.

It gets way easier to grow. When you don't lose 100% of your customers every year. That's a promise.

If we want to talk about engagement. We did it. I've just spent weeks analyzing this.

And what I found was honestly shocking. That's a ho. Yeah.

Video ends. Come on. So.

So. What's really interesting. Is.

Classroom content. Doesn't really matter. Um.

First of all. You do not need to make a monster course. In fact.

That just overwhelms everyone. Right. We have an hour.

Our hours are less than an hour. Right. Yeah.

Anime shreds launch with no classroom. Um. And no post more than one sentence.

My some posts were just like six emojis. And they had thousands of comments. Um.

So. It's. The things that really work.

I've seen. And that are very low F. Low effort too.

Is. You. You get your community to share something about themselves.

Right. So. The.

The. Because I've seen these posts that always. Rip.

Really well. Like. They get.

They get more comments than like a well thought out. Article post by the creator who pinned it. So that's like.

You know. Um. One that always works is like.

What's your favorite book? Have you ever seen that one? Just keep popping up in your communities.

Even if some random asks it. It just keeps getting comments. And.

Have you seen this? That one. Because it's just asking members to share something about themselves.

And then other people are curious. What's your favorite movie? If you want even the most simple one.

What's your favorite GIF? That one. That one's popular.

That one. Just. Guaranteed.

Like. More comments than anything else. And it's kind of a little bit more fun.

It's not too much effort to think about. Um. Or.

This one I found is really good. It's like. Um.

Share. Three things you do. Share something you do for fun.

Where you're from. And a photo of your workspace. Right.

Because people want to share. And so they're like. Okay.

I'll take a photo of my desk and workspace. I'm from Germany. And I like to play golf.

Right. That's just sharing themselves. And they do a comment or a post like that.

And then everyone looks at the image. And they notice other things. They're like.

Oh. You've got this desk. Or.

Oh. You're into the guitar. I also play guitar.

And now they're making friends. You're connecting the community together. Like.

We actually do use that one. Um. Of course.

And we tell people. If you see someone's introduction post with that. Comment a GIF as well.

And it works amazingly. Hmm. And it's like the culture of the GIF that they post.

Let's say they put a Wolf of Wall Street. Like GIF on their post. Now everyone will start putting them in.

Yeah. And so these. This I swear is the key to like.

Because when someone comes in. They're all. You just need a simple way for them to engage.

And once they're engaged. And if they meet someone. They're like.

If now they meet someone. They're on DMs. And then that moves to like.

A hangout in real life. Or on Zoom. They associate that value back to your group.

Right. Can I just add something as well. Helen.

Can I just add something. Yeah. Go for it.

Yeah. So if you want people to engage. You can do like all these like little tricks.

Or you can just tell them to engage as well. So like what we've done. Is we've just.

Like indoctrinated people to engage with each other. Essentially. Right.

Like in a good way though. So we talked about the print. The mastermind principle.

From Think and Grow Rich. We explained it to people. And said.

This is why you should engage with each other. And then now. Everyone's just hosting calls with each other.

Communicating. Like that kind of thing. So sometimes you just need to tell people.

It's the same with the Q&A recordings as well. Just tell people to watch them. Give them a reason.

Like tell a story. That makes them want to watch it. And then they'll watch it.

So it just works with anything. It's just sometimes. You just have to add.

Tell them why they shouldn't do it. Yeah. This is huge.

Like. Especially on the Q&A calls. People sometimes have a question like.

Does anybody here know blah blah blah. And if there's like 30 people. And there's 600 in the community.

We're like. Well have you made a post? And always no.

So we like make a post. We'll pin it maybe if it's a good one. And like just telling people.

That they can make a post. They almost feel like. They don't have the permission.

When they join the community. But like no. You can make a post.

You can ask. If somebody here. Knows this or does that.

And just you know. Doing that. Especially if something.

More advanced. That you can't really answer in five minutes. I think that's huge.

Yeah that's. That's good for like. The regular conversation.

I think you need to imagine a blend. Of like sometimes you need to share. Like something you did.

Like you need to always pay attention. To problems your community has. And you as the lady.

It's your job to like. Find the best solution. And you can kind of crowdsource it.

But sometimes you have to go. And explore your own. On your own.

And then you find it. And you bring it back. And you share it.

You're like. Hey we found. We know this is a problem.

We did this. We found the solution. And here it is.

That. That's like good leadership. Then you need.

But you need some fun stuff in there. For sure. I'm honestly shocked.

At how much of a difference it makes. If you have it. It.

I honestly would go as far as saying. It's more important than the value. Like because I've seen.

Seven figure people. Join groups. That are purely for entertainment.

Um. But with other seven figure people. So it's like.

The value happens as an accident. Um. And members contributing.

Like I think one of the most common problems. I've seen is people say. I've got members in my community.

I'm posting five times a day. But no one's commenting. Right.

That. Have you seen people say that? Yeah.

And it's because. The people that have engaged communities. Aren't posting five times a day.

Their members are commenting. It's a difference. And when you write an article this long.

That's just an opinion piece. What is someone supposed to say? Like really.

Like. And you're putting a burden on them. To read that fucking thing.

Like. Who wants to read that? Another follow up.

You can do to get more engagement too. Is. Uh.

I like to never answer anything in the comments. Always ask questions. So everything gets answered with a question.

Which follows a thread. For every person. Um.

And. And you get the research. You get to find out those problems.

You can. Yeah. Asking a question.

It's just. That always. Works so well.

It's crazy. Yeah. I think.

Um. A really good idea too. Is.

If you have something that's like a community review. Like for example. We have music money.

And a lot of. We tell a lot of the artists to. Post their new music.

Post their new beats. And then the community members will review. Be like.

Oh. I think you should tweak this. I think you should tweak that.

And then we have another community. Where it's mainly about like content. Making good content.

And people will post their content. Or post a link to their content. It's almost like.

I don't know if you guys remember. Like the engagement groups. Like back in the day.

Where like. They'll post it. And everybody goes and comments.

And likes on their posts on Instagram. And that increased a lot more engagement. Around the community too.

Absolutely. And just one more thing to add on to that. Like.

I think people underestimate like. How well information travels. In the form of a meme.

Right. Like. A meme can communicate.

Like a 45 minute video. Worth of information. To the right person.

Right. If they're a sponge. You can soak the information out of it.

And so. I just think like. Whenever I see like the videos.

Ryan post. Right. Or like something like that.

I'm like. Oh. That's funny.

Do you see the Fast and Furious? I was dying. I watched it like.

100 times. Yeah. So like.

I think people just underestimate. Like. Alright.

Like. You know. Like what Goose does.

Is like. You know. He makes it fun to read a post.

I think a meme. Just like. Sucks your eye in.

And so it's like. If you can figure out. How to communicate.

Something through a meme. Then you're killing it. You know.

Yeah. I just watched this movie last night. And it's really good.

Dumb Money. Anyone seen it? It's about the GME.

GameStop. Versus. The hedge funds.

And it's a. It's a. Wall Street Bets.

Forum. They have a. They had a very good culture.

You know. They invented diamond hands. And like.

They were making memes. Of like. The Wall Street Bets.

Head. Spanking the hedge funds. Like.

You know. And everyone just felt like. They were in this.

David versus Goliath. Like thing. And they were all.

Part of something. And. That's the most powerful thing.

You can get. Is when you get that. Culture there.

I think school community. In the last month. Has.

Finally found something. There's like. This culture.

Because people are. Contributing these. Parody videos.

That. Must have taken them. A long time.

If you've seen the Harry Potter one. I made the. I made the friends one.

Took me like. Four hours. The Harry Potter one.

Must have taken a dollar a week. That was. Intensive.

You've seen the Harry Potter one. Right? You've seen it.

Yeah. Um. I've seen them all.

To Moisey too. But the power. Like.

Referencing that. Dumb Money thing. That guy just tweeted out a picture.

Just the other day. Of a game. Of a dude leaning up to play games.

And GameStop. Uh. GameStop stock.

Shot up again. From dude just tweeting a picture. Right?

Just to like. No. No words attached.

Nothing. People are like. Oh.

It's back on. I need to. You know.

Buy into this GameStop. And so. That's what the power of a meme is.

Is that the kiddie guy posted that? Yeah. Yeah.

He just did that. You've got to watch this movie. Write it down.

Dumb Money. Not only is it an amazing movie. Just for straight entertainment.

But this guy. Who led that GameStop thing. Is probably one of the best community leaders.

We've ever seen on the internet. Because he bought down some hedge funds. Yeah.

And up front. With memes. Nothing but memes.

And he wasn't. He wasn't promising the world to people either. At first.

He wasn't telling people GameStop was going to go up 100x. He was saying this is going to go up 4 or 5x. And I feel like that's another thing people can do.

Is not over promise. Whenever. And then people are like.

Yes. I believe it can do what you're saying it's going to do. And then everybody believes in it.

And then. You know. Yeah.

Yeah. That is perfect. Exactly what happened in that movie.

And that's what we're starting to see happen in school. Like people are making these parody videos. And then people laugh.

And then we started seeing people posting like. This is the most positive place I've ever seen on the internet. Like that's pretty powerful.

People. So people want to go where the energy is good. Right.

Like if you scroll your Instagram and you feel bad. And you go to Facebook. Bad.

Twitter. World War something. Then you go like.

You know. You go to school and there's some funny videos. And someone making a million dollars.

That is the ultimate. Right. Like people winning.

And people laughing. Yeah. We've seen two outstanding ways that you can drive culture.

Especially if you're like trying to pivot. One of them is categories. It's super passive.

This like. The thing that's right above your feed. Where you can sort of.

When someone comes in. They get a pretty good idea. This is actually Sam's idea.

They get a good idea of what the place is for. So even if you don't actively use them. It's just kind of a good foundation.

We've got a lot of good feedback back from that. Even though I hated them at first. They're super useful.

In like a level one sort of way. And this. Then the more important one.

Is your pin post. Does anyone rotate their post? Actually.

I learned this shit from you. Did you? Yeah.

All right. That was the first thing I ever saw. Who's this dude?

Long hair. Click your post. And he's like.

Rotate two pin posts a day. I do that with myself. And I do that with.

With Justin as well. Awesome. Rotating pin posts.

It's overpowered actually. And so. How long until you saw results?

Immediately. Awesome. Yeah.

Okay. You rotate pin posts. And my favorite thing.

Is when you see people typing. Yeah. Everyone's like.

Oh what are they typing about? Yeah. So what we did with them.

Is exactly this. The pin post. When you first start a community.

Your first. Thought is. Oh.

I need to start here. So that everyone knew. Knows exactly where to go.

Which actually kind of fucks you. After a little while. Because.

The people that are coming back. See the same shit. Every single time they come back.

And so. You kind of want to speak to them. More.

So you post the pin. Of the start here post. In a.

Classroom module. Or you know. Whatever you need.

In the start here classroom. And then the pin posts. Are just the stuff that's going on.

Day to day. You got a crazy idea. Or.

If you can't post that day. You take one of your community members. And you post them up there.

And they're fucking jazzed. To be pinned. Oh yeah.

That. Once. If you pin your members stuff.

That's key. I think. You should always aim to have at least.

One or two. The ultimate is all of the pin posts. From other people that aren't you.

It just shows the community. That if they. They.

It is possible for them to make something. That you're willing to pin at the top. And then.

It's like creating this incentive. For people. To do that.

And. The other thing I would say. Is you should always be.

Just sensing. And on the lookout. For.

Who are the most. Valuable contributors. Are in your group.

Or in your community. So like. You know.

When goose. When goose. Kind of started.

To take off. I sent him a DM. And I said.

Now that you've proven yourself. School hardcore. Like.

What do you think of this. Upcoming feature. Right.

So I started to bring him in. And give him like access. Way more access.

To me. And. And then.

You know. He's been at the office. All week.

Helping design. Screens for the next three months. That's great.

So. I mean. Ted Carr.

Who's hosting a school meetup. Right now in LA. With a hundred people.

He is a key. To our office. So he can just.

And the alarm. Pin code. He can just rock up.

Whenever he wants. And we just talk about. Sensitive things.

In front of him. It's like he's a member. Of our team.

But what I'm trying to say here. Is when you see those people. You need to.

Reward them. Because. All a group needs.

To keep it engaged. Even when it's big. Is ten.

True regulars. People like. It's like a sitcom.

Right. Like. How many people watch.

Friends. But it's just like. Five people.

Right. But. It's those people.

That get everyone else. To come. Because they like the vibe.

And. They like it. So.

You know. We've got people like Ted. We've got people like Goose.

Um. There's Max Person. There's Evelyn.

Right. All of them contribute a different piece. This Ryan guy with GIF is adding a new kind of flavor.

Kirby was adding something. Now he's on the team. Matthew was adding something.

Now he's in charge of our podcast. And so. And there's a lot more people.

But. You've got to find those. When you do see those people.

You need to like. Do something. To make them feel like.

They've. They're a part of the leadership. In a way.

Of. Of the community. What I did is.

I hired one of the best guys. To do a weekly call. So I just pay him a hundred bucks.

And he does one of the weekly calls. So he's like a professional. Software engineer.

And he just helps with like. The technical questions. So he was already posting a bunch.

But I asked him. Hey. Do you want this?

Because he already was attending. Every single call. So might as well get.

You know. A hundred bucks for it. And literally.

For four hundred dollars. A month. I get like.

A professional software developer. That just hosts. A weekly call.

In my community. Yeah. This is how you find your team.

By the way. Like. Honestly.

Everyone we've hired. That's on the non-software engineering side. Is from.

School. Users. Like.

When someone applies. I look. I'm like.

Where's their link? Can I look at their activity chart? And I'm like.

This person doesn't use school. Like. Why.

If they don't care about school. I don't want to hire them. So like.

If someone literally. Cares about your community. And is contributing.

Without getting paid. Then. They're going to obviously.

Believe in what you're doing. Right. Well.

This is changing topics. From. Engagement.

Which I don't know. If we should do yet. But.

That is how you find great people. Yeah. I want to hit on one thing.

With engagement. So. We've.

Tossed around the word culture. Culture. And we haven't defined the word culture.

And so. I'll just share mine. That might be helpful.

Which is. The rules that govern. Reward and punishment.

In an organization. And so. If you think.

Like. We have either spoken rules. Or unspoken rules.

But there are rules. Of how you act. And so.

If you're with your buddies. If you say. Hey.

I got my girlfriend flowers. They just might all of a sudden. Say like.

Oh. You like sucking dick too? You know.

Like. You're like. Okay.

That's the rule. That's a rule of behavior. Right.

Like. If you do something. That's nice.

For your wife or girlfriend. You're going to get made fun of. But it's because they like you.

Right. And so. But like.

If you said that to your parents. Or your. You know.

Whatever. At the dinner table. They would be like.

Oh. That's really sweet. Or that's really nice of you.

Right. And so. It's different rules.

So there's a different culture. At the family dinner table. Than there is when you're.

Out with your buddies. And so. Fundamentally.

Trying to define. What are the rules. That govern.

What gets rewarded. And what gets punished. Within my community.

Will dictate. What the quote culture is. Within it.

And so. About that in terms of those terms. Will probably make it a lot easier.

And so. To your point Goose. I actually think this is.

The categories piece. That you're saying. Really.

Really important. And the main reason I say that. Is because like.

If people are about to make a post. When you see what the. Categories are.

This signals. Or this tells them. This is what we want you to post about.

And so. This is like. This is an innate rule.

To this community. Like. We want you to post about wins.

We want you to post about traffic. We want you to post about monetization. When you post about whatever.

So it might be like. It might have like. GIFs.

Like. Imagine the community. Like.

Same identical community. Internet marketing. Right.

Just something like. Completely generic. And the categories in one.

Are. GIFs. Memes.

Right. Like. Something that makes money.

Or like. Money making. Wins.

And. Just for kicks. Right.

And so like. That. Is one community.

And the other one is. Conversion rate. Value posts.

Question. Whatever. Right.

And so. When you see the two of those. Like.

You have a very different feel. For. Those communities.

Before you even engage. And so like. Right off the bat.

That's the. That's the banner. Literally.

That. The subcategory. Of.

All the topics. That are going to get discussed. And so like.

If you want to shift the conversation. That's going to happen. Within the culture of.

Or within the. Within the community. That you have.

Telling them. What you want them to talk about. The categories.

Feels like one of the most important things. That you can do to do that. And you also.

By. By very nature of having those topics. Means these are what we reward.

Yeah. And what we actually did is. We like gamified the categories as well.

So when. It's like. I think Sam did it with like.

Stone.com. Is he made people like. Ring the bell.

So we got like a. A clip from a game. Like a GTA 5.

Where Trevor says. Show me the money. And every time someone gets a win.

They post that. But rather than calling it. A wins category.

Report. Haha. Show me the money.

Yeah. And every time they got a win. They'd post it.

And it would just make it. Way more responsive. Everyone would come.

Haha. Show me the money. Every time someone gets a win.

And it just goes insane. Yeah. And you can have it be wins.

Or you can have it. Something to be funny. The way you have it.

It's still accomplished the same thing. But one of them is like. I'm more inclined.

To post this. If I don't feel like I'm. Flexing.

You know what I mean. So yeah. I think this was like.

I like would double star that. Personally. And then I think that.

The pinning your members. Feels very important. Like think about.

Like what's. That's like a jackpot reward. Like this is what we reward in general.

And if you pin. Pin certain posts. Then that's a super reward.

This is like. Let me. Let me put this guy on the.

Unliteral. A literal pedestal. And tell everyone in my community.

This is what I want you to do. This is me. Doing a big reward.

For somebody who does this. And so. It orients.

The behavior of everyone in the community. And then I'd say what I do is. Like pinning is probably the first.

Or saying this is a great post. Or this is amazing. Right.

That's key. You see me do this. I do it all the time.

Tell people. Then pinning them. But also sending them a DM.

And then. The only people I DM. Are the people that are like.

The most school hardcore. Basically. And that.

I talk to them all the time. And then the next level of hardcore. Is every now and then.

Will be on. Zoom. And then the next level is.

They'll be at the office. Right. It's literally what I do.

Not by design or deliberately. This is just. How it happened.

But bring those people closer. And give them more. Because by the way.

They also give me. The best feedback. That they're helping design school.

Literally. And you can use them. To help you shape.

The future of this. Of the thing you're building. And when the community.

When a new member comes in. And they see that you're. Really tight.

With members like that. They're going to be like. Oh shit.

If I can. Get my way up there. Like I can have that too.

Do you get what I'm saying? If you. If you do this.

It'll work. It'll work really well. And it's not exhausting at all.

It is the least exhausting business. I've ever run. Because I don't have to talk to anyone.

Like everyone. There's no. I'm never promising that.

I only talk to the people. Who I think. Who I want to talk to.

Really. Yeah. There was a point.

A few days ago. The school games community. Was really dead.

No one was posting. I was like. Fuck.

I'm going to get fired. All I did. Was I added a category.

Called banter. And I messaged Ryan. Who's the gift guy.

Who's top of the school community. And I said. Made this for you.

And immediately. He made a post. There's 300 comments.

In like two hours. From one post. And also on the reward.

Punishment thing. Whenever Evelyn. Posts.

Every single time. She posts. I'll comment.

Evelyn over delivers again. Just like. Reinforce the good behavior.

And the DMs. I probably send 10 a day. If there's ever a good comment.

I DM. And I'm like. This was a great comment.

That was a great post. And then bad behavior. If someone posts bad stuff.

Don't like it. Message them and say. Here's our rules.

Here's what a bad post looks like. Reward good. Here's what a bad post looks like.

Your post. See screenshot. I got a quick.

A quick tactic. That's been like. Working wonders.

For our culture. Sure. I have all my guys.

When they join. Put like. In their bio.

In school. I put like. A 15 minute calendar link.

And then I'm like. Always referencing it. So I'm like.

I'm mentioning like. Hey guys. Like book the 15s.

I put it on my road map. I have like a little road map. Like book three 15s.

With these guys. And I'm doing all the closing right now. So like.

I'll like go on my live calls. And I'll notice that two guys who. Are across the country from each other.

Have so much in common. And I like reach out to them. Like yo.

You should book a guy with. I feel like you should book a call with this guy. Because of why.

X, Y, Z. And then I follow up with that later. Like how'd that call go.

And then I get a ton of like. Insight on like all my members. And like what they're communicating outside of me.

Because like. There's like a little like. Like a power dynamic.

Where like. I'm the head coach. I'm the CEO guy.

Right. So I don't get like a lot of like. Vulnerability.

But I can get the insight from my community members. Through each other. And the concept actually came from.

When I was a frat president. Because we would have our top 10 exec guys. Go on constant 15 minute lunch breaks.

With all the new members. And then that's how we collected mass information. And connected guys like pledges.

Together before the recruitment process. So that they would have friends. Before they even joined the thing.

And so like the result of that is like. I have like buddies like flying down. To like Dallas.

To meet gladiators who. I didn't even like. Like they're doing it on their own now.

Because the reward is so high. They're getting like brothers. So I'm going to.

I want to say it back to you. So the users in the community. Yes.

You tell them to put like a calendar link. For 15 minutes. So and then.

Whenever you see people. That you think makes sense. And they already.

It becomes an innate rule of the community. Which is like. Hey if you like someone.

Just like click their link. And book a call. They might just segment out.

You know one part of their calendar. Where they have. You know opening to just banter.

Whatever. Maybe they do it for their lunch breaks. And they meet new people every day.

Yeah. Whatever it is. I tell them like.

I do like an hour for three days a week. That's just open. Yeah.

And it crushes. So a lot of people do use that. Almost yeah.

So I tested it with like five or six guys. And they all loved it. And so I'm making it mandatory for everybody now.

Who's using the map? Are you using the map? The map?

It's not a school feature. This route. Are you using it?

We have members meeting up constantly in person. That they've met through Music Money. And doing like studio sessions and stuff.

And that's honestly like. Like you guys said. Like they equate that.

Their connection. To being a part of Music Money. And so I feel like they've.

You know people. I just saw the school games map pop up. But they just.

People just share their location. Who's in Atlanta? Who's in Detroit?

You know. It was interesting. When I was in.

I'm in Hamza's group. And he did a post. Like.

What's the most valuable part of the community? And he's trying to remove some stuff. And emphasize some stuff.

And what could we. What's one simple thing we could do to improve it? I was.

The most common answer was. Get more people to plot their location on the map. I was like.

What? We actually took that idea. Just a little bit further.

We're not sure if it'll work yet. But it's incredibly popular. It's been our most popular piece so far.

Which was. Setting up a system. That the community could engage on.

So that it continued that flywheel. Sort of perpetually. And what we're calling it.

It's. It's based off the school games. And we're just calling it rainbow games.

And we just have a pile of things at the end. That you can win. And the structure is.

You'll be assigned teams. Between three to five. You have one team captain.

They coordinate with our community manager. And the objective. Is to.

Compete based off of three metrics. Where they are on the leaderboard. From.

And these are all based on a 30 day time span. So it'll basically be one to one with school games. Where.

Where they are on the leaderboard. What their own personal. Score is.

On how much they've. Grown. In their own.

Relationships. And health. And then the last one.

Is how good their offer is. Based off of where they started from before. So we're using those three different metrics.

People were super jazzed about it. And we had. I think like 30 signups.

To do this thing. That we'll probably. Do this next week.

We don't know all the little intricate details. But I think there's a massive opportunity there. Whereas previously.

Like when you're starting. Probably most of us have run into this. You.

You. Really want to get a few community managers. To like lift up from the bottom.

And help comment. And stir up conversation. But at a certain point.

When it's feeding itself. You can sort of just. Give that momentum.

By doing top down. Where they are. In teams.

Or some form of competition. And reporting to the community manager. So now.

The manager is doing less time. But having more impact. Yeah.

And the more you reward. The top members. Versus trying to dig up the bottom members.

Those top members. Dig up the bottom members. You know.

It actually is less. It's like your model. Yeah.

And it could be something super stupid. We. The biggest request.

That we've had recently. Is I. I designed.

A few. Profile pictures. Because they wanted more color.

In their thing. So I was like. Alright.

If you're on the leaderboard. I'll go ahead and do it. And now.

It's one of the things. That we offer in there. Because people really want it.

And it's silly. And it's. Didn't you guys design.

A whole suite of gifts. For school. Yeah.

Yeah. He made like. A library of gifts.

Forgot about that. Yeah. Sid said he was going to implement them.

That'd be a sweet. Like level six unlock. Like.

If you get to level six. I'll make your profile thing for you. One more question for you.

And just for the context. Right. You said if you.

Go back in time. Make gym launch 10k a year. So I'm.

I'm kind of in this. This new building phase of like. I'm going to make my product 10k a year.

Honestly. Go big head long tail with it. So like.

What were like the two to three. Like specific things. That you would.

Like definitely implement. Into gym launch's model. Back then.

Like with your knowledge now. To actually make people like renew. Year over year.

Yeah. Okay. Because I got to figure out.

Where my content is going to go. Thank you for bringing this up. Because this is what.

It was something that I wanted to talk about. So. Well.

What everyone. In my opinion. What you want to do.

And school is going to very quickly. Be able to facilitate this. So I'm really excited about that.

You have. One time value. And then you have ongoing.

Consumable value. All right. And I think the big issue.

It's my opinion. In the information slash education space. Is that we try.

We have one. We have one thing here. That we try to build for both.

And so. We're like. Okay.

Well. I can get someone to say yes. To 30.

30 thousand dollars. Whatever. And because they can't pay that today.

I'm going to spread it over a year. And I'm going to deliver all the. One time value up front.

And then they're still making payments of. 25 thousand. You know.

Or $2,500 a month. Month three. Month four.

Month five. Month six. But the problem is.

The value. So. Think about it like this.

Value is going like this. But this is price. And this is where people cancel.

Value. And so. When you.

When you sell them initially. They're like. 2,500 bucks.

Which is my first payment. Look at the difference. Between price and value.

I'm stoked. This is great. But the day after you learn.

How to run Facebook ads. When you buy something. To learn Facebook ads.

The value of the content. Teaching you Facebook ads. Descends to zero.

There's no additional value. Right. And so.

This is why. In my opinion. This is where I think.

The industry should go. Or will go. And if I started over again.

This is what I would do. Is. You have one type value.

That you need to be really clear about. So this is. A lot of times.

This is going to be the education. Right. For the most part.

This is. This is the entirety of this. Right.

This is the education. The checklist. The tools.

The blueprints. The whatever. Right.

Now. This usually has. A lot of value.

Because you're teaching someone. Something. A skill.

That's very important. And they're going to have that skill forever. It's a one time payment.

For an ongoing. Permanent. Value increase for them.

But all this stuff. So you've got community. Right.

People consume that on a monthly basis. There's calls. Right.

That they consume on a monthly basis. For us. Like.

For example. We did a boiler room. Which is something that we did.

For gyms. Which was. We would train their sales staff.

And so we would drill them every day. So we basically run their. Sales meeting for them every morning.

To increase the close rates at the gym. They didn't want to do it. Nor were they good at it.

If we could increase the closer at the gym. They'd make more money. They'd stay.

Right. It's consumable. We had ads.

Which for us was consumable. Because I would spend 50 grand a month. Testing ads in like 10 representative markets.

I would take the winners. And then I would give. I would license those winners to a thousand locations.

So there's zero cost in that besides the 50k. And then everything after that was gravy. Right.

And so that was why it was such a high profit margin business. Where still is. And so the idea here is.

If you put on a sheet. What's the one time value that I deliver. And then what's the ongoing value.

And if you were to only do this. Only price this. In a way that most people are like.

Wow. Just these things alone are worth X. This becomes your ongoing price.

And this becomes your upfront. And so that is the concept of big headlong tail. But what you want to do.

Is you want to make sure that what is being built on a regular basis. That is ongoing value. Is ongoing value.

The things that you build one time. Are one time value. Right.

And so then you can create that description. So rather. So probably for most of these.

You know the coaching education businesses. Instead of saying. Okay I'm going to sell you something for $30,000.

It's $2,500 a month. It might be. It's 10k up front.

Then $500 a month. But then no one cancels. Right.

And so then you just play with how do I liquidate. You know. Cost to acquire.

And the thing is. This is where the patience of like. If I did this all over again.

Like. The business model that gets fastest to $20 million. Isn't necessarily the one that gets fastest to $100 million.

Because you might have this price. The old pricing model. Which skyrockets to $20 million a year or whatever.

But then like. You have a really hard time passing. Because churn starts eating away at you.

And so you're like. Shoot. I need to sell more.

I need to sell more. But it's really tough. Especially in a niche to sell more.

Right. Whereas if you're not losing the customers. Then the first year you do.

You know. Eight. The next year you do.

You add another eight on top. You're at 16. Third year you're at 24.

You're like. Oh. Actually by year three.

I'm a little bit above what the other one was. But the first one. You're at 20.

And you think you're hot shit. Because you're beating the other guy who's lower ticket. Right.

But year four. All of a sudden. This guy's now at 32.

And you're still stuck at 20. You're questioning your life. And everybody hates you.

Right. But this guy's like. Man.

The price to value for my stuff is through the roof. Does that make sense? And when you want to sell something else.

You have this massive distribution of people. Who love you. And your brand.

Your reputation are all great. Because you delivered something really valuable. And you charge for it.

And then you live something. Let's be honest. Less valuable.

But then you charge appropriately. Does that make sense? Yeah.

So this allows you to have. Basically price here. Price.

And then it drops to here. For your ongoing. And so you still always have.

The delta. This is how I think about it. Yeah.

That's super helpful. I never had like. The discrepancy between the one time.

And the ongoing value. I would try to bunch. The ongoing.

With the 6k ticket price. But now I'm going to go. Right.

And so. One thing I think is again. A mistake that most people make.

I mean myself included. I've made this mistake. I think it's the best.

It's how most people do this. In this business. Is they take it.

And they spread the payments. Over a year. Or some arbitrary amount of time.

I would rather say. Like. I want to be very clear.

You're paying this for this. And that for that. And so.

If you need a payment plan. We're going to front. Like.

It's. I'm not spreading over a year. Like.

You need to pay this off. As fast as possible. Because that's what you're paying for.

And I'm maybe doing you a favor. Like. I'll split pay it.

I'll three pay it. Or whatever. And that might mean.

That the ticket price. Like. And here's the funny thing.

Is that. Everyone here knows this. Who's in.

In the high ticket world. You sell something for $30,000. You're not collecting 30.

You collect. However many payments. Your turn is.

Times 20. It's like. Okay.

Yeah. But we turn at 25%. A month.

And we're. Our price point's. 2,500 bucks.

So. Really. It's 10k.

That's what you're actually making. So. Whatever you claim.

Versus what you make. Are two very different things. And so.

If that's really what you're making. Then maybe you just charge 7. And you get way more people to say.

Because the thing is. Is when you have a 30k price point. You still have to make the 30k sale.

But you're not even collecting 30. It's like the worst of both. It's like you have a lower conversion.

Because the price is high. But you're not even collecting. On the low conversion.

And so. It's like. Sell at 7.

Maybe. And then. Let's say that.

Turn on the 500. Is. I don't know.

Whatever. 4%. Right.

And so. Now all of a sudden. It's 25.

You're getting 25 months. At 500. So you get 12.

5 on the back. 7 on the front. Now you're at 19.

5 in LTV. And. Because you charge 7 up front.

Instead of trying to confront. A 30k price point. You might sell 2 or 3 times as many.

And now your EPCs go up 6x. Because you had. You tripped.

You doubled LTV. But you might also. 1.5x conversion.

Or double conversion. So now you 4x'd. EPCs in terms of your.

Earnings per click. Or your conversion. What each.

Each person is worth to you. This is in my opinion. The better way to run the business.

Most people just don't do it. And maybe. In 5 years.

They'll find this video. And. Is that what made.

Gym launch sellable? No. What made gym launch sellable.

Was that. I did nothing in it. And it was very consistent.

And we had multiple forms of acquisition. And so. I had to basically paint the picture.

Which was that. Did you know that 30% of gyms. Got a business every year?

And. I mean. They're like.

Oh. I didn't know that. And I was like.

Right. So. No matter what.

Structurally. A third of gyms. Got a business.

Because it's a tough business. In general. And so.

The good news of that. Also. Is that.

Every year. Another 30% enter the market. And so.

We can stay at this place. And we can sell all the new gyms. That come in.

And that means that this business. Will just. You know.

Continue to maintain. And then the opportunity for growth. Is going to come from.

You know. Some of the other things. That I had already like.

Planted seeds for. That were going to be down the line. To increase LTV.

Great. I just want to say. That's beautiful.

That's like. Exactly what I needed. So.

Thank you. I'm ready to like. Go home and work.

So. Yeah. See you guys.

For real. Yeah. That was clutch.

Thank you. Because. With a coaching business.

You answered my question. That I've been asking for like. Six months.

What is the end goal? To me? Yeah.

You've been asking me for six months? No. Not you.

Check your DM. Myself. He's like.

I have tagged you every single day. Every day. Story posts.

Yeah. Oh. Good.

Okay. Great. Number five.

We talk about how to build a community. Within any business. And every single business.

Has a community. They just have bad ones. And good ones.

But every business has one. And so. If you're doing it the bad way.

There's non-existent. The second worst way. Is when it's just dependent on you.

Having a relationship. With every single customer. The ideal way.

Is that every one of these customers. Has a relationship with one another. So that if your.

Break with them. Breaks. They still stick.

Because they've got five other connections. To other people in the community. And that.

Strengthens the bond. That's what creates a network. Within a community.

And then it will always be bigger than you. Because one person can only have so many relationships. And that's what allows your business.

To grow bigger than you. This is just how I would explain it. It's like.

Each one of these people on the right. This is the traditional way. That most people are doing it.

Which is that they try and become. More and more interesting. Themselves.

The guru model. Hmm? That's literally guru model.

Yeah. Here. I'll just write it.

Guru model doesn't work well for community. By the way. If you just post.

It doesn't work. And if everyone wants to talk to you. You're going to be exhausted.

Yeah. Yeah. And so.

Think about this. So like. This is what it looks like visually.

And with your eyes. You can almost immediately see the difference. But the point that I would highlight is.

Look how many tie-ins. These people have to the community. Versus those people.

Those people only have one tie. And so likely. Like if this.

If this breaks. Right. This breaks.

This guy leaves. Right. He gets out.

But if all of a sudden. This breaks. Right.

He stops talking to that guy. He's not going anywhere. Right.

Or this breaks. Like. Nothing happens.

And so. I think a lot of the things that we're talking about here. Are trying to get to this.

Which is like. We're talking about the maps. We're talking about the 15 minute thing.

We're talking about. Encouraging the engagement between them. Like the whole point of all this stuff.

Is to facilitate that. Like why do we want them to share things about themselves. And take a picture of their car.

Take a picture of their workspace. Or share themselves on the map. It's because.

Then they can start orienting themselves with one another. Like that's. That's how they connect with each other.

Because they can find similar things. And so it's like. How can we create a space.

That rewards them sharing things. That they can find similarities. Because fundamentally.

They have a shared interest. But until they know the rules of engagement. They're just going to be like.

Okay. Well I don't want to get punished for doing something. And so.

By having the categories. By pinning. Exactly what you want people to do.

By DMing those people afterwards. Like those are all things that then. Encourage more and more of this.

Which then creates this. And then this. I'm actually really pumped.

That this is the direction. That the conversation went in. Because in a past.

You know. Probably one or two ago. We went really deep on retention.

Right. And so there's lots of like. What I would consider like.

The hard side stuff. Of retaining the community. And I'm glad that Goose.

You're here. For like to basically. Have this.

The other side of the conversation. Of retention in the community. Which is the whole experience.

Right. And what are the rules. Of how this community works.

And what do we reward. And what do we punish. And I think.

Like I'll bet. That the people who are watching this. And probably you guys too.

You might be able to cut your turn. Even more. By doing this stuff.

Somebody had a hand. Yeah. Shoot.

Yeah. I have two kind of questions. How do.

Because I resonate with this a lot. How do you go from guru. Like once you already are operating.

On the right side. How then would you go to the left. You don't decrease you.

You increase them. That's good. Yeah.

Okay. That answers that. The second one is.

For real. It did. Okay.

How do you sell. Because I think a lot of. The conversation is pre-framing.

So I used to work for a lady. She had 4,500 members. And then what she would tell them.

Is if you cancel. You can never come back. For a year.

Right. Which was awesome. Because people would never leave.

Like it decreased churn. And then. The second thing was.

They would have requirements. Like for them to do. Like.

What are your thoughts on that? I've seen the. The you can't come back thing.

Have zero effect. In some businesses. Because they're like.

Yeah. I'd never want to come back anyways. I don't really care.

I don't care. And so like. It's like.

It's kind of one of those. Chicken egg things. Where like.

If you have a valuable community. Then people fear losing it. And so.

Then they don't want to cancel. But at the same time. If you have a valuable community.

Then you've already won. And so it doesn't matter. Okay.

Well. Just one more point. Yeah.

On that question. Would you sell. An outcome different.

Than you would sell a community. Um. Because I wish I could just sell a community.

Yeah. Right. People have a hard time ascribing value to community.

I mean like. In the gym world. We used to say.

Sell the bikini. They come for the bikini. They stay for the community.

Um. And like. The way that you.

You have the offer. In terms of the outcome that they're going to have. Is going to be the thing that.

That's going to bring them in. Right. But then.

All of this. Is the stuff that's going to get them to stay. And so I would say there's different objectives.

Like to get someone to convert. You talk about the outcome. To get them to stay.

They're going to. Like you. You want to reward as many times as you can with that community.

And basically it's too arduous. For one business owner to reward. Every single person.

As many times as they possibly can. To get someone to stick. And it's so much easier to create the system.

That allows. The culture. That allows people to reward each other.

At a way higher frequency. Than you ever could. As a guru.

Cool. And I really want to like. Right.

Like what's the word. Emphasize like the leverage here. On this left side.

Like if you have a lot of client knowledge. You can connect guys. And it will exponentially increase your leverage.

On how valuable your community is. Like for example. Like Justin right here.

Like you should network. I think you should network with. Other Justin over there.

And maybe Pavel. Because you guys both have like. This commercial construction experience.

Right. Like I don't know anything about commercial construction. Because I know like one detail about that.

You guys can get like a quick 15. And then you'll like. Associate that connection.

With like the value of my community. And that connection. And build goodwill like that.

So like I can like. Almost like increase my leverage. Into like that construction space.

For example. Even though I don't know much about it. But it will add so much value to the community as a whole.

And it makes you guys level up too. So it's like a win-win. Yeah this is huge.

I actually sold a few people that way. Somebody asked me like. If I have something on sales AI agents.

And I didn't. So I searched up school. And it loaded up a few members.

That specialized in this. So I was like. If you join today.

I'll connect you to XYZ. Who is doing exactly this. And they join for that.

And then I connect them. You're worried about. It's great.

It's resourceful. No it's good. It's good.

I feel like this is the visual. Like I feel like this is the main difference. Like this is what.

All the tactics that we were talking about earlier. This is the end result of good culture. Like what happens is.

When community members start getting known. Like the leaders of the community. Kind of get jealous.

And they like to remove them. Or like to punish them. So you need to work on your internal side as well.

And be comfortable with people. Leading your community as well for you. Does that make sense?

Like we have. Yeah we have champions inside of the school. I mean.

Like all the names that Sam referenced earlier. Like. You bring the people closer to you.

Who you want to encourage. And create distance for the ones who you don't want. Yeah I literally never even think about that.

Like we're building you guys up. Literally. Like we're trying to give you guys.

The fame. And then. The more we do that.

The better the. The community is. So like.

It. I know what you're saying though. I had this realization all of a sudden.

But. Yeah the people. If you have that mindset.

You'll never have a good community. Because the moment there's someone. That has anything good to say.

You're going to like. Kick them out. Yeah exactly.

I'm not saying I have. I'm saying don't have it. Yeah.

It might happen. It's kind of natural with humans. You know what I mean.

Kind of get jealous of each other. You've got to be mindful of things. That might be not what.

They don't align with your vision. For the community. Like oh everyone.

This thing is just way too complicated. And I think this is a dumb idea. Even if people like it.

I'm not a fan of this. It's not for a personal reason. I just.

It doesn't align with the vision. Of the thing. So you.

You can't let it just go. Out of control. You have to.

Shape it a little bit. But that comes in who you reward. And who you pull closer.

And yeah. I mean when we. We talked about this before.

Even thinking. Like when we were coming up with the idea. Of the school games overall.

Was. We wanted to have as many. Like school games champ.

Like it's the games. Like we want school games champions. Like that was the whole.

The whole point was to elevate it. Because. We already.

Like. Like. Already have the clout.

You know what I mean. It's like our whole goal. Was to like get as many other people.

So we have. Lots. Because think about it this way.

Is like you want to have as many different. Walks of life. And like.

Avatars within the community. That represent success. Like with it.

Obviously within. You know. The wider the box.

The more varied the community. The champions can be. But like.

Like. I would love to. Like.

This isn't planned. This just happens organically. But it's like.

I'm glad that Evelyn is a girl. Who's. You know.

Really really awesome. Inside of the community. And there's also.

Black guys. And white guys. And older guys.

And young. Like we had a grandmother. Who hit.

You know. A million bucks. Like.

It shows that like. Anybody can do it. Obviously we're super super broad.

In terms of what we're looking at. But even within the sub segment. Of whatever niche.

You're going after. You're going to have different psychographics. Different demographics.

That can be represented. And that's. That only increases.

The amount of people. Like. This guy.

Or this. Let's call this a lady. Right.

These might be. Lady people. Right.

And then this might be. A dude. Right.

And these might be dude people. But. If this person can't find connection.

Then there's no. No ties. And then she leaves.

Right. So having different. People that represent.

Even kind of. Slightly different flavors. Like.

Chocolate and caramel. Chocolate and coffee. Like.

It's. Like. You have.

You have chocolate as your community. But it's like. Different type.

Different flavors. Sub flavors of chocolate. Yeah.

We can definitely see those circles. In school community. Like.

The ads people. Yeah. The.

Like. The creators. And there's the creators guys.

All the. The YouTubers. Yeah.

Right. Yeah. Then there's the.

There's definitely. The girls. And there's definitely.

I call them the chads. Like. We call.

We joke around at that. About that. Like.

Oh. That's. The chad network.

And. The chad network. And.

Then there's the. Like. The boomers.

Yeah. Like. For sure.

And by the way. That's a massive population. Bigger than any other.

Generation. The largest business that we have in the portfolio. Crushes.

With boomers. So. The largest.

I have. The largest. The world.

Was that. It's the largest generation in the world with the most money. With the most.

And. And spending power. Like.

You have both. Like. Sell to them.

And. Yeah. You can start to see these different things.

It makes the culture more interesting. Then I'd say the goose and gift people. Like.

They were. I honestly. For a period.

We were seeing posts. Like. How do I.

How to goose. And instructions. And like.

Did you guys see all of these goose posts? It was like. If goose was taking over at one point.

And then when Ryan came in with gif. I'm not shitting you. The amount of.

Our gif usage. On. Across our platform.

Spiked so much. That gif. He called us.

And said. We needed to discuss. A paid enterprise plan.

And now. We have to pay them a grand a month. Because we're using 500 terabytes a month.

It's a testament to culture. Yeah. And it's like.

But then everyone saw that. And they were like. Oh.

I can use gifs in my community. I can use polls. I can be more like goose.

And they're learning these different elements. That they can play with. Yeah.

In their community. Yeah. The other one I would say is calls.

Calls is. Getting. Getting.

The moment you take someone. From just an avatar. And some text.

To being on zoom. It's like. Now you've got a.

A voice. Now you can see a face. Now there's some expressions.

And. There's more depth. So if you're not doing calls.

This is. I'm sure everyone here is doing calls. But I bet you there's.

People at home. That. Are thinking they need to make a lot of classroom content.

No. I swear. All you need to do is have three posts.

That like. Introduce yourself. And share a photo of your workspace.

What's your favorite book. What's your favorite movie. What's your favorite gif.

There's four posts that are easy. And then one call on the calendar. That could be just called coffee hour.

And there's no agenda. You just hang out on zoom. While you have your morning coffee.

Maybe. Once a week. Three times a week.

Whatever. Done. Then let it happen first.

Right. And then you can figure out. Okay.

I'm going to make this little module. Because this is what. Then you can start serving your community.

But it has to be there. Before you know what they want. Right.

And then you start serving. And you keep adding. Things and curating.

And then. It's more valuable. So now maybe you charge.

And now maybe you increase the price over time. And do you see what I'm saying. Like that's all you need to start.

We're actually going to hide the classroom tab. When you create a new community. Hmm.

Well we looked at retention. Making a course has no correlation. To retaining as a customer.

In fact. It's one of the reasons why people turn. Right.

Because they say. I don't have a camera. Right.

I don't have a lighting setup. And I will come back. When I've made my content.

Yeah. No shit. So it is.

And it has no correlation with retention. So we're like. Okay.

Let's just hide that tab. And let's just get. Encourage people to make a calendar.

And do three simple posts. And then bring people in. Down.

Now the engagement's happening. And then you learn. You don't have to write.

Article posts. You don't need to. This isn't sub stack.

Like you don't have to sit down. And like invent. These articles.

All the time. You're not a writer. You're.

You're bringing people together. It's. It's a.

There's a difference there. But it's very hard for people to grasp. For some reason.

Hmm. There was something that. That you were mentioning before about.

I'll take it. To take it one step further. It's come up once.

But. A lot of times. The offer that you have.

This isn't for everybody. But it's quite easy for an offer. To be hard to.

To sell. And the person that needs it. Can't recognize it.

When they see it. But. Fundamentally.

You can kind of always. Understand something like a mastermind. Or a coffee hour.

And so if you sell that. And you give them what they need. You almost always score.

Like. I think we have. Like 98% retention.

For. Across. All of them.

Just because. We reversed. Everything.

So that we're. We bring them in on what they want. But we give them what they need.

And it. Where it just works every time. And it's something that.

Maybe. You guys could. Could also run with.

Because it's. I mean. It's.

It's a showstopper. For sure. And by that.

You mean. They come in for the funnels. They stay for the fun.

No. They come in for the mastermind. They stay for the funnels.

All right. Yeah. It's stickier.

Yeah. We can start it the other way. Yeah.

It just works better. The fun is just kind of like a cherry. Sure.

On top. Like it's. It's sort of.

I mean. You'll see it in kind of like. The captivate branding.

I literally analyzed. Every little fucking pixel. And I was like.

How can I get. More attention. From one glance.

And so it was colors. It was. Bizarreness.

It was. Cussing. Whatever it had to be.

It was just like. Just be whatever came naturally. Not like forcefully.

And then from that point. The fun was like a nice introduction. And a good tone.

Sure. A good cultural tone. But everything else was just.

Yeah. Trying to situate. And that was where our big roadblock was.

And when we reversed that. Like almost on accident. It completely changed everything else.

Yeah. How many people here are teaching someone. How to make money.

Or do something to do with business. What I think you'll find fascinating. Is that most people.

Don't want to start a business. No. Like really.

I learned this after talking to big YouTubers. They're like. Oh.

But now that's a business. And I was like. Yeah.

And they're like. I don't want that. So like.

Most people don't want a business. What they really want. Is they want to like.

Feel good and have fun. That explains the whole world. How many people.

How many people. Are at the fucking library. Versus.

Versus playing computer games. Or like. You know.

Watch it. Watching movies. Or like.

Going to bars. Right. Like.

How much money. Gets spent on like. Going to bars.

And video games. And everything. Versus.

Everything else. It's. It just.

That shows you. That's what people. Want.

More than anything. But I think. Once you become an entrepreneur.

It's even harder to see. Once you become a hardcore entrepreneur. Is you think.

Everyone's kind of like you. But most. I can tell you.

Most people aren't. And no one is. Yeah.

Like. I mean. 9% of people have a business.

And that like. That means literally. Like own an LLC.

So that includes like. Hairstylists. Who are solopreneurs.

So 9%. So if you cut out. Solopreneurs.

And then just go. People who have employees. You're looking at like.

One out of every. I don't know what the stat is. But I would imagine.

It's probably one out of every 50. People. Actually has a business.

With employees. Like it's not a lot of people. This is why I think.

The fun element. Is really important. Because I've seen a lot of people.

Say this. They were like. I never wanted.

To start a business. Or be an entrepreneur. Until I knew.

It could be fun. Right. Like it's.

I think that's how you make. The market bigger. For sure.

Like if you want to. Get more people. People to buy your thing.

And all of that. I think a lot of it. Comes from not just.

More. Training. Or more like.

Explaining. Or more like. Logical.

Concepts. And frameworks. I think it's.

Trying to make it. More fun. And interesting.

To people. Does that make sense? Yeah.

That's why I was excited. About these recent. Breakthroughs.

That we've had. Because. It's.

It directly. Translates. To the actual thing.

You want. Which is retention. Sales.

Word of mouth. By the way. Like all of the.

Things that we. Dream of. But.

It. It comes from. Tapping into this.

Slightly different thing. I love that we hit classroom. We haven't done it yet.

I think it's a great idea. This next clip. Is about strategy.

Which is my fancy word. For prioritization. Fundamentally.

We all have. A certain amount of time. Money.

Effort. People. That we can allocate.

Across. A million different things. And so the idea is.

The people who move. The fastest in business. Make the best bets.

Because they choose. To allocate those resources. To the things.

That get them the best returns. And this is how to pick. Which ones you should.

So we're. We were selling. Before we built the program.

Okay. So as I'm actually. Using time to create the content.

And get the program out. There's less time. To get more people in.

So the revenue goes down. As we're building. So how would you.

Fix that. Don't you guys partners. You're not solo.

Are you? You split the responsibilities. Maybe.

One on growth. One on building. That's a great way.

Yeah. Thank you. Nailed it.

And also. You're going to work a lot. So just a side note.

That you're just going to work a lot. Yeah. We work all day already.

Yeah. So. We also have one more person.

Kirby. Who does like. Community management.

So we divided it even more. Like I'll just think about. Making it better.

Kirby will run it operationally. And Homozy will bring people in. Do you see?

Mm-hmm. That makes sense. So get like.

Potentially more people if needed. If not. Just split the work.

Yeah. If everything is going down. Because you're.

Like you. The point I was making earlier. About the classroom thing.

Is like. I would not want you to. Over produce content.

For the classroom. Since the vast majority of people. They quote.

Want to buy it. But they don't actually consume it. Um.

And they consume the community. Far more than they consume the content. Mm-hmm.

And so. I would like. Try and make it as.

Pared down as you possibly can. To increase the likelihood. That they do consume it.

And get value. Because if they see a ton of videos. They just say like.

Nah. But if you say like. Guys.

The whole thing. You can cover in less than two hours. Then the likelihood.

That they're going to watch it. Goes way up. Does that make sense?

So I would just not. Don't kill yourself on it. Try and think.

What are the actual fewest things they need. In order to be successful. Just make that.

So that you can still focus on. Basically keeping. Keeping the business going.

Yeah. Perfect. Thank you.

How to revive. A dead community. Right.

So one of our partners. They got in school very early on. And it just grew very massively.

Before we had built out our infrastructure. They have 14,000 members. Just dead.

Community is just dead. I think a lot of people on the school community. Haven't even been in there.

Probably in weeks. Months. I think at one time.

There was a lot of like. Bots and stuff. And we hadn't gotten that system in place.

And that kind of probably like. Wasn't good. And then.

So yeah. How to revive that community. So it can be more of a nurture to the paid.

So this is your free community. Eh? Into music money.

No. This is. So yeah.

We. We work with a lot. We have a bunch of different communities.

Okay. This is one of our free communities. It's called Kingdom Minds.

Okay. Yeah. They have like 14,000 members.

And their paid community is doing well. Because we do webinars. Okay.

And we just sell that. But the free community itself is just. Yeah.

Like 95% of people are like at level one. Essentially. Like you know.

They may do an introduction. And then that's all they ever do. So like.

Just. Well. Is there anything you guys have in mind.

Like to bring that back to life. Yeah. If that makes sense.

Did you do the same thing that Zane did. Where like. The people went into the free thing.

You sold all the engaged people. And I think that's definitely part of it. But even the most engaged people.

In the free group of that one. Are the people from the paid group. They stayed over there.

And still were engaged. But it's like. We can't.

Elicit more engagement out of people. They'll. They're like.

Oh. I want to join. You know.

Yeah. Join. Make a profile.

And then they're like. You know. Yeah.

We don't know how to make it. Like a part of their everyday. Kirby.

Do you have anything. That you've heard. Yeah.

I would like. Launcher something exciting. Like a challenge.

Or. Or. Something.

That. Is going to get people excited. But why react.

Why do you want to react to that. What problem does it solve. Well it's just 14,000 members.

And I'm just like. You know. I feel like.

So do a few broadcast posts in there. And then move on. Do you post in there much.

Um. So yeah. We have a school manager.

That's making posts in there. Um. Are they good posts.

It's okay posts. You know. About like content.

Nothing. It honestly. A lot of the game that we've gotten right now.

About like you know. Making it more funny. And entertaining.

Will definitely like. You know. Add that in there.

It's been more value based. And more like. Hey we got a free training.

Which is the webinar. So it's probably a lot more CTA. What problem does the group solve.

Um. It's about. Social media.

You know. You know like why. No no.

Not for them. Like. Why does it exist for you.

Uh. As an upsell. As a funnel to go to the paid community.

And to. So it's the lead magnet. It's the lead magnet.

Well really the webinar is. So here's the thing. So the webinar is the lead magnet.

But we have a web hook. That takes people to the free community. So people were just.

Getting into the free community. After the webinar. So we don't even have their data.

On like phone numbers and stuff. So all we have is their emails. Let me ask this.

If you just didn't have the free community. Would everything still work fine? Yeah.

So maybe. Maybe. Maybe you just have a paid community.

And you just. Run ads to your webinar. Sell people in the paid community.

And that's it. I just. I think the only reason we'd want to get it better.

Is just for. Discover. You know.

Beyond the discovery. Yeah. One point we were top 20.

The community was top 20. Because it was growing so fast. And then now it's like.

I don't even know. It's like. Up there.

So. It's just kind of like. We have this.

A bunch of members in there. Like. I mean.

We could deactivate it. But. Do you have any super users?

No. Yeah. They've already upgraded to paid members.

Essentially. They're still over on the free community. But yeah.

It's just. You know. Our only point of really getting it back alive.

Would be to. Get on the discovery. I think.

You know. Overall. Like.

Raising engagement to get on discovery page. Would be the ultimate goal. I want to add something.

You have a community manager. Right. Do they have their own accounts.

Or do they use your accounts. They use the. The person's account.

The. Yeah. The owner's account.

Okay. Yeah. Because if somebody else makes a post.

But they're a community manager. Nobody will pay attention. Because people join.

Because of. You are the artist. Right.

So. Yeah. Great point though.

I mean. I think if you were going to try and engage it. I think.

Do it. Basically doing something exciting. That is valuable for those people.

Will get them to be excited. And then I would just. I would.

I'd balance that with Sam's question. Which is like. Why do you even bother.

Well. If you do re-engage it. One thing that we did.

That was quite successful. When we were doing the rainbow games thing. Was one requirement.

Was you had to tag. People that were less active than you. That you'd like to compete with.

And it was actually surprisingly successful. Yeah. That's interesting.

Sweet. Any other stuff come up. Questions.

Top of mind. Otherwise I'm going to grab out of this bag. Of.

There was some that were interesting. Because. All the ones left.

We've pretty much covered it. At previous ones. Other ones.

Yeah. They're like standard topics. But there was some that were kind of unique.

This time around. Like. And I think this kind of relates somewhat to what you just said.

Which is. What is the next lever to pull. It's like.

Because you know. There's a million things you could do. Like reactivate this dead community.

But I swear. You. Your time would be better spent doing something else.

Yeah. Like how do you find that next lever to pull. Yeah.

So this is like. So that question fundamentally for everyone here. Like if you could walk away with that being correct.

Would be in my opinion. The most valuable thing that you can do to walk away from here. Because you're going to have.

Two pages. Three pages of notes from today. And what's going to happen is you're going to get on a plane.

And you're going to have a fresh piece of paper. And you're going to go through your notes. And then you're going to write like a list of like three things that you're actually going to do.

And then that's actually what you're going to end up doing from today. That will be the output of this day. And so I just want to make sure that.

And then of those three things. One of them will have by far a disproportionate impact on how much money you make. And so most small businesses or even even midsize businesses.

Don't grow as fast as they could because they spend their time doing the wrong things. And what's what's deceptive about it is. You can make an argument that reactivating this group can make the business more money.

There's a lot of things that can make the business more money. The question is just which of these things will make it the most money. And so by doing that, we have to verse back into we had those four levers that I had earlier.

We've got traffic. We've got conversion. We've got price.

And then we've got churn. So those are the big four things. And so if we want to grow the business, those levers have to change or the business will not grow.

And so for many of you, it might just be you need more traffic. Like the business model is fine. The economics are fine.

And you need more traffic. And so basically, at least my thought process that I have with this is I try and scale as much as I possibly can until something breaks. And then when it breaks, we fix that thing and then go back to scaling the shit out of it again.

I mean, fundamentally, that's what we do. And I teach this for businesses, but I'll walk you through it. So what is going to go to these four levers that we talked about earlier, right?

Which is going to be your traffic, your two Fs there, whatever conversion, which is you tweaking your about page, making a VSL that's better, adding carousel images, tweaking the bullets that you have on your landing page. You've got the price, which you can test, and then you've got churn, right, which has a big list of things that you can do. So these are the four levers.

The things that you're doing have to ladder up to one of these four. If it doesn't ladder up to one of these four things, why are you doing it? All right.

So like if we were to translate your objective with the free group, you would have to say, okay, I think that us reactivating the free group will increase traffic. That's fundamentally what you're doing. You want this traffic source to make you more money from your, towards your high ticket thing.

And you say, okay, how much work will it take me to reactivate this group? Okay. Is there anything else that could get me more traffic than reactivating the group of the things that I have available?

So right now, could me just spending more money on ads or making better ads make us more than me spending the time to reactivate the group? If so, forget reactivating the group, make better ads. Or spend more money on ads.

Does that make sense? So once you figure out, and when we're picking which of these three things or four things that you're doing, the thought process is which of these is the biggest constraint in the business? And so if conversion rate, let's say, for example, on the landing page is super low, then it might mean like, hey, before getting more traffic, I think I can double my conversion on this page because I haven't really spent any time on it at all.

Okay. Well, then it makes sense to spend a day or two. Like, can I really clean this up and make it as crisp as you can be possible with the language that I use?

Can I grab screenshots that are more meaningful that like you probably had more testimonials, things like that you haven't updated? Like, can I put that on there? Can I make an actual three minute VSL that that is more compelling than the one that I just like tossed up there?

Okay. That's probably a day of work. Well, it's probably high leverage because I can double the growth of the business by just improving this conversion metric.

Pricing, like, well, if everybody just pays you more, we already went through that example over here. Um, this could obviously make you more money. And then you have your big list of things that you're doing for churn.

And so cool. Which of these is the biggest thing that's going to train in the business? You pick the one that you're working on.

And then for me, I tend to think through this. More, better, new. And I tend to do it in this order most of the time.

So, like, I will just ask one of our portfolios, like, why can we not just do more of what we're currently doing? Like, whatever we're doing, why can't we just do more? So you'd have to make an argument to me that we should reactivate this group rather than just spending more money on ads.

And you have to make an argument that it's easier and it will make us more money than spending more money on ads. And if you came back to the argument, I'd be like, well, then forget about it. If we can't do any more for whatever reason, we have some limitation.

Like, we can't post more than twice a day on Instagram. Like, we just can't. Or we can.

And just like we've seen that when we post three times, it doesn't yield the same performance. So two is kind of the sweet spot. Fine.

All right. Then what can we do to make it better? Right?

Okay. Because if we can make those two posts just higher quality overall, can we, like, really think through the hooks? Can we make sure that they're tight, that they appeal ideally to the audience that we're looking for?

If we do better, then the quality of the traffic will go up, the more views will go up. Does that make sense? Now, if we can't do any more any better, then we need to try something new.

And you notice that most of the times you can do more of what you're doing. You can do what you're doing better, which is why I so rarely do new things. Once you have something that works, that's the hard part.

Once it works, it's like, how do we scale the living crap out of it? And the reason that most entrepreneurs, in my opinion, especially small ones, get stuck is that they find something that works and then they stop doing it. And then they get distracted by six other new things.

And they get completely spread thin. And what's ironic is that the small business owner is the one who has the least amount of leverage. And you have basically your contribution, your time contribution to the income of the business is more direct than anybody else's, especially at this level.

And so you saying, okay, I'm going to take a third of my time. That might just be like decreasing your business by a third. And so you have to have a very strong argument for why that's going to make sense.

And then for who, once you have a team, then that becomes the next thing. It's like, okay, we know we aren't increased traffic. The way that we're going to do that is like, we can't do more posts on Instagram, so we're going to make them better.

And this is the process that we're going to focus on getting better, which means that once a week, I'm going to take three hours and I'm going to script out. I'm going to look at other people's content that have really good hooks. I'm going to write down all the hooks.

And then I'm going to make content that I think is going to appeal to my demographic in a better way. Cool. Now, who's going to be, you know, if it's you, then you're the who in a lot of these.

If the business gets bigger, then it's like, okay, Jeremy, you're running this. And then we just measure to make sure Jeremy does the job. That makes sense in terms of thinking through this.

And so we just want to make sure that what you are doing is going to map to what's going to drive growth within the business. And I swear to God, so many times people are just doing shit that does not map to this. Okay.

Red's over. One quick question on that. The first four, is there like a certain priority that you would recommend for like, I'm a solo operator.

I'm doing like 50 a month. Yeah. B2C offer.

Is there like one of those big four that you would recommend prioritizing first? Start here. Okay.

Because this is how you have lifeblood in the business. So you have to promote. You have to acquire customers.

Once this is relatively consistent, even at a low level, I then, this is me, how I think through this. Now, not when I was younger. Normally, I would just be like, just do as much of this as you can.

Forget everything else. Now, it's do enough of this so that we can keep working on how do we find the things that people actually want versus what we think they want. And then there's the things that we can remove.

Like, how can we delete things? How can we make this simpler? How can we make it more elegant?

How can we shorten the models that we have? I mean, we're hiding classroom for new people. Like, think about this.

Like, we remove three calls a week. Like, we're trying to take things away. Not because we don't want to add value.

It's easy for us to add the value. But we want them to consume it. And so consumption should be the highest priority for everybody here in terms of making, like, how do they get value?

They have to consume value. Right? So consumption should be the highest priority.

And so we start here until you have enough flow going through the system that we can see what they really want. And a lot of times, these simple things, like the last mastermind, I think we went through a ton of depth of all the things that you can do to reduce churn. Right?

It's like, so you experiment with that. And this might be months while you're doing this. I mean, for context, school didn't hit, like, a, like, let's go hyperscale until, like, recently.

And this was years, right, of getting the product right. Like, obviously, like, there's people coming in every day. And there was enough promotion that we basically, that we could test and keep learning.

But it wasn't like, we don't want the world to find out about it yet because we want to get all these pieces right. Once these pieces are right enough, then you go back here and you scale a living hell out of it. Boom.

Yep. That's great. So right now, the question for you is, if you have really low churn, I don't know if you do, but from what you were saying, it sounds like you have low churn.

Then, yeah, do more. Pure traffic, yeah. Do more, do better at what you're currently doing.

So are you running ads? Yeah. Do you spend more?

Spend more and make them better. Top 20% of my best customers target it towards them. Now that I have that insight and then just keep making that better and then just more.

More better. And then just spend 400 grand a month on ads. Yeah, sure.

I mean, it's like an inside joke in my business. Like, he's just going to say more better. It's like, yep, that's what we're going to do this quarter, just like we did last quarter, just like we did the quarter before.

We're going to do more, we're going to do better. And if we do both of those things, we'll probably make more money. And then if there's something that prevents us from doing more or better, then we fix that and then we go back to more better.

Does anyone have questions about what they need to do for this? Like, you need, you're like, okay, am I, should I be spending more money? Well, if your LTV is good in terms of, and your CAC is low, then yeah, I just keep spending.

I guess for like low ticket communities, you know, recently we had a video where you went like seven things like handwritten letters, onboarding, executing reviews. Yeah. For communities on school, like which one of these would you go after at the first?

Kirby, I feel like you have even more insight. Well, with you, the price sounds like the thing that's moving at a while. Say go.

The price. Okay. Because you've already experienced what that's doing, all right?

You know the average is around 20. You probably want to be on the good side of that. So figure out why you're not.

Like, Matt, I would talk to your customers first. Like, why did you cancel? You want to talk to the people that canceled?

You want to talk to the people that stayed? And you want to figure out what differences they have. And then if you find the people that stayed, did these things, emphasize those things.

If you find the people that left, did other things, remove those. And so it might not be price. I'm just.

Yeah. But you told us. So maybe it's price.

So like balance that. And then, you know, with your traffic, you can drive more of that. And then you can play with about page conversion.

You can play with that. And then when you're bored of those, go back to retention. Yeah.

I know I can drive like easily way more traffic. It's just that I have a leaky bucket. Yeah.

So I want to fix it. So I'm like wondering if I should add the onboarding or, you know. Onboarding, I think for sure is a good idea.

And how would you execute that for low ticket? You do a group onboarding and everybody who signs up gets one group onboarding. Then you attend, you do it once a week.

I think people throw a lot of shit in their community and then they just keep adding. And then they think they need to keep adding to make it better. But it's not true.

Like overwhelm is the main cause of churn. Think about the experience. So how many things in the classroom would you say is like the sweet spot?

Because like right now I have like eight maybe. Honestly, the hardest part I found when improving anything is to figure out what's actually wrong with it. That, well I've been working on the school games funnel recently by the way.

Hormozy would be happy about this. I figured out like what the problem, to try to figure out what the problem was was actually quite difficult. But it was this guy I knew from New Zealand who's a complete stoner that had texted me when Hormozy launched the games.

He couldn't understand what it was. And I was not going to try to explain it to him. But when we came back to improving it, I was like, it turned out that he was the best signal for it actually.

What the fuck is the school games? I wrote it down. That was the problem.

If you didn't know what school was, and you see an ad from Hormozy and he's talking about the school games and some leaderboards and coming to Vegas. People don't know what the fuck that is. So I wrote down what the fuck is the school games.

And I was like, that is the problem. But that took me a lot of research to like find, right? I was talking to a lot of people.

I was doing this with Kirby. It's quite an interesting process, right? And then we were like, okay, well, how do we describe this damn thing in a way that makes sense to like a stoner dude?

Because it helps to use extreme cases. Like Steve Jobs tested products on children because like if they could understand it, anyone could understand it, right? So like defining the problem and then coming up with different ways you could solve it.

I've been doing this with Goose and Kirby in the office all week. We probably designed, we came up with many different ways to describe what it is, many different landing pages, many different bullets. And we just kept talking to users, getting feedback and kept iterating it.

We probably made 30 versions. Some of them were so wrong. It was, I wondered what kind of tangent.

You'll never see it. But, you know, we actually, at the end of about one week, we landed on something and now everyone we show it to instantly gets it. It's like we don't actually have to fully launch to find out.

When you learn how you can use everyone to get like feedback and talk to people and show it to people and get their reactions, you can do a lot of fast iteration cycles without the harshness of like reality. Then when you launch it into reality, you have a way better chance, right? So that's how you improve anything.

Like that's not the games, but that's what we were doing to the games recently. Kirby was doing interviews with all of the winners. That was overwhelming.

Not many people were showing up. So we cut that. We just did one Homozi Q&A a week, right?

Attendance is up. Viewing is up. People are now saying that it's way more valuable.

And, you know, so it's we were unlocking the one day recordings after you got three customers. We were like, why are we making it hard to get the most valuable thing? Now you just need three members.

They can be free. Right? So like what do people value?

How do we make more people experience that? What do people not value? Take it out.

What do people not understand? And reword it. Do you see?

It's all the same. But I will emphasize what Sam's saying is that there's a it's so much more work than you expect it to be. And everyone wants like the one silver bullet that you're going to magically fall on it.

But if it were obvious, you would have already done it. And so it's like it's disguised. And that's what I mean, this is literally what makes business hard.

And so I'll have a business owner on a Q&A call say, like, what should my price be? And I'm like, I don't know. I'll walk you through the process of how I'd figure it out.

But I don't know your avatar. I don't know your traffic scores. I don't know the value prop of your community.

And even if I did, I would say, I'll start here. And I'm going to do the math. And I'll move it.

And I'll do the math. I mean, with a portfolio, same thing I was telling. It was like we tested 50, 35, 25, 15.

We just tested it. I was like, I don't know. We'll find out.

And then they were all the same. And then I was like, OK, well, which business would I prefer? And then we go into that, right?

And so just in terms of thinking through things, like the amount of effort that goes into it, that most I would say that like as I've gone, as I've got moved up in business, my understanding of the level of effort that's required to solve complex problems has gone up 100x. It's just it's significantly harder to solve more complex problems. And that's also why the biggest paydays are on the other side of those problems, because if they're really easy to solve, everyone already solved it.

So it's like four hours and a cup of coffee and a bunch of data. And you're like, all right, let's try this. There's a quote I learned from the software engineers at school.

They say you have to make every detail perfect. But the only way you can do that is to limit the amount of details that you have. So inside of the school games, we have eight videos.

All of them together are less than 45 minutes. One course. We do one call per week.

And that's it. And once a month, you get a download from here. The mastermind.

That's it. Very easy to explain to someone. One call.

One course. One mastermind a month. And there's 13,000 people in there, each paying $99 a month.

And they get the school software. I have a question. So there's a fine balance between...

Because if you're a leader of a big community, right? If you're showing up too much, you kind of almost lose your power, right? And if you do Q&As every single day, nobody wants...

It's not special. So how would you balance Q&A calls, making posts inside of the community, and just showing up and giving people attention like that? I'm sure there's a data answer for this rather than me just guessing.

We could probably find it out of what the best cadence is. I'll tell you, I personally, I think, post twice a month in school. That's not planned.

I just kind of poke around and I see what people are struggling with. I made that niche post because I was really tired of people being like, what's my niche going to be about? And I was like, here's how you find your niche.

And so it's just like, I just listened to what was the... You probably noticed this in your community. It's probably like a problem du jour.

It's like people just kind of glob onto a single problem all of a sudden. And I felt like I was seeing more and more of that. So I was like, all right, I'm going to try and answer this.

And so then you make that. And then it's like, hopefully... And if you put the thing in and then that problem still exists, then you didn't do it right.

So it's like, you have to do it again. You have to make it simple. You have to make it easier, whatever it is.

You keep doing it until that one goes away. And then the next problem will occur. And the good news is that your customers will always have problems.

Yeah. And so you just solve them. I can tell you a good thing that works for me.

So I spend a lot of my time reading what people are saying. I'm trying to understand what things people are struggling with. So I'm not in there just posting a lot.

I'm in there listening the most, more than anything else. Most, it would be like 90%. It would be like a lot of time is spent listening, trying to figure out what is going on.

What should I improve? What problems is the community facing, right? Then when I'm pretty sure I've got those problems, I'll even talk to some power users and I'll validate, do you think these are actually problems, right?

And then I'll make sure I'm clear on the problems first. Okay. Now, if I spend...

Now, prioritize them. What's the most... What is the most pressing problem?

Okay. Number one. Now, just focus on that.

At least I know if I just fix that, I'll add some value, right? Yeah. So now I'll try to fix that.

And I will try to fix that by research, experimentation, et cetera. And then I'll come back to my community and say, hey, I saw all of you guys were facing this. That sucks.

I fixed it. Here you go. And that's how I like...

That's how you add value. Seriously. Seriously.

No, like I have this little template on my wall for emails, which is, hey, I made this thing for you. Here's what it does. What's happening?

Enjoy. Like CTA. Like that's like...

That's my email template. It just makes it really simple. Like, hey, you guys were struggling with this thing.

I made this for you. Here's why it's important. Goodbye.

The hard part is finding the thing. Like I said, how do we make the school games funnel better? Well, what's the problem with it?

That's the real question. And it was some stoner dude who had the answer. Little factor.

Yeah. So you wouldn't have a schedule of like posting daily or a second, like every second day or... Definitely not.

That's like a Henry Ford production line for community. Like, we're not trying to pump out posts fast. That's not what makes it...

That's not a good community. A good community is something that understands your pain and experience and delivers solutions and is fun. Yeah.

You all right? Yeah. And isn't overwhelming.

And doesn't make me read five articles a day. Right? Like value posts.

Yeah. Because I don't want to read a bloody article. That's a pain in the ass.

It's like, I want a solution. Or I want to laugh. One of them.

Yeah. So I have a question. If you guys had to decide on building like an Adonis school or an anime shreds, which would be your choice?

I actually don't understand the question. So the model that they have, like you look at Adonis school and he's got loads of delivery in the calendar section, like every day, twice a day. And it's a higher price point.

And then you've got anime shreds, which is, you know, nothing in the calendar, but loads of posts, like just emojis and random stuff. Like, which is a better model for actually helping more people get in greater scale and then eventually making more money with that? Well, I guess we'll find out.

If you guys had to pick on which would you pick? Well, I've watched both of them. The anime shreds one's super interesting because it broke a lot of like preconceived ideas.

Like it had no classroom when it launched. It was $11 and it grew to 100 grand a month faster than anything. And it became number one on Discovery.

Right. Like real fast. And there wasn't a ton of posting in there from the owners.

It was mostly driven by the members. Right. Plus, I know they're about page conversion rate is one of the highest.

What I'm really curious about is their churn. But I guess that time will tell. It's new.

But I think the fact they started low and then increased higher makes it's a good move for churn. And I also know churn is low when your price is low. So that will be quite interesting to watch over time.

And so can it scale? I know Hamza's trying to scale higher in a donor school. I think anime shreds guys apparently want to scale more.

Both people probably want to do as least work as possible. Right. So there's that.

And then there's the retention. And over time, we'll see how those two models differ. But I think what anime shreds wasn't just the price, though.

I think what they showed us is that if you have like something unique, like the fact that it was called anime shreds and the artwork. Yeah. That definitely added something.

That's kind of what Goose showed us. If you make something a little bit more unique. And that's just like free performance, right?

Like if you can make your landing page conversion double by just theming things and making them a little bit more interesting. That for sure is really good. Like I would encourage everyone to think about that.

But I can't say which model was better. Anime shreds converts way higher, but a donor school is way more expensive. And they're both making around the same amount per month.

It'll come down to EPCs, earnings per click. So fundamentally, if 100 clicks go to Adonis school and 100 clicks go to, and this is, this to be fair, is purely contrasting the business and like the community. Because traffic sits outside of that.

Because if anime shreds 10x is their traffic, they will become 10 times bigger than Adonis school, independent of what they did inside of the box. And so if we're just isolating conversion rate, price, and churn, then you look at what's the 500 clicks, how much are these clicks worth for this business versus this business. And then that literally just gives you the objective measure of which one of these creates the most dollars.

Because I'm kind of at a point where I'm like, you guys start the school games. And great, you've got that platform for us. And then I said, okay, I'm going to copy what you guys are doing with the school games and how you run things.

And I copied Adonis school and gang because that was the guys over the top, right? Now anime shreds looks like he's going up there and I'm at a point where I'm like, which model is better and which one's actually, yeah, because I'm not that good at business. I just see things that work and I copy it.

You're not bad. Well, there's going to be more. There's going to be more.

So if you keep switching, you're going to get in trouble. Yeah, exactly. That's where the sticky point is.

Honestly, like even saying it like that, me thinking about it is like, it's probably neither. It's probably the one that is more like authentic to your community. I've got a feeling as to what it might be, but you know.

All right, what is it? The feeling? Yeah.

Well, my feeling to do with it is it goes a bit opposite there because I'm doing 17 lives a week in my paid at the moment. So, yeah, but my feelings telling me to put it in the free community. But I mean, that might be stupid because I'm trying to listen to what you guys are saying.

You're saying, no, we're just doing one now. And it's like, so I'm a bit the fuck, you know? I think if you want to use all that, like all that.

So last games, a ton of people, I think it was last games. It was like the lives games. It was like everybody was doing like Instagram lives.

It might have been maybe two ago. And the thing is, is like we have to separate promotion from delivery. So from a promotion perspective, you're doing lots and lots of lives.

You're making lots of posts. You're making all this stuff. Oh, no, I understand.

I got you. And so my point is, is like I would take all that energy and put it into promotion. So you get way more people into your community.

And then the thing is, is that if you do 17 lives a week externally, it's okay that people don't consume all of them because if they consume one of them, then they might buy. Whereas if you're inside of the community and you're doing 17, they might be like, oh, I'm missing out on 16 out of the 17. I'm not getting the value.

If it's free, your cost is time. And so as long as you deliver a return on the time that they spend consuming your content, then they got, they have a positive exchange with you. And so you basically, it's like, you can never promote too much.

You can't put too much inside of the community. And so I would take some of that juju and put it externally to drive more through the box. I think Hamza actually did like the opposite.

Like when he increased the daily coffee to like nearly every day, his churn like reduced massively. So I have no idea. He's missing me like every day.

And trying to figure out like all kinds of things around churn at the moment. My answer to him, he kept coming up with ideas. My answer to him was talk to your customers.

I recently was pretty public about this. Is that like, I widened my content for, I think either three or six months. I like started sprinkling in some other, other pieces.

I talked about how I eat and like Layla, you know, how Layla and I run, you know, being married and things like that. And the, the, the problem is that you do get positive reinforcement from it. And so it's like, he made some stuff on relationships and then people were like, oh, this is awesome.

But the thing is, is like the wrong people were saying it was awesome. And so what was happening is my audience was growing, but it was growing with the wrong people. And so I had, I mean, I had this moment where like, sometimes you have these, like, I had a, a friend of mine come into a friend, acquaintance, I would say, flew in and was like, um, and he probably does 10 million bucks a year.

And, uh, and he was like, yeah, you know, um, yeah, I don't, I don't listen to too much of your stuff anymore. And he's like, yeah, I was hardcore for like six years. Um, and then I, I just kind of, um, I guess it didn't really apply to me anymore.

He's like, I guess I'm not really like your avatar. And I was like, you're 100% of my fucking avatar. Like you are exactly who I'm going after.

And then I was like, oh, I'm a moron. And I just, basically, it's like you, you get, you get, it's a balance. Like you want to listen to customers, but you also want to make sure you're listening to the right customers.

And so, um, I reoriented all my, my content, which maybe some of you guys have seen. Um, and it's been a hundred percent back to business has been the theme that we have internally. My guys now, um, is that if it's not business, we don't make it just very straightforward.

Like it can be business adjacent. So like, if I talk about, you know, prioritizing like tasks in my day that can have some element of productivity into it, but it's like, all my examples are gonna be business related. And so, but by doing that, when I looked objectively across metrics for site conversion, opt-in book sales, applications, the portfolio, all of those metrics went up, even though the average view per video went down.

And so it's like, I'm not in this to get famous. I'm in this to make money. That's a quick question.

Um, I wonder if anybody has, I mean, this might be for everybody, but like, has anybody done anything to when they do have a churned customer to get them back into being a customer or send a funny GIF? Or just send a funny GIF? And a DM.

Ask Creditpreneur. Have you seen him? Yeah.

Ask him for his message. He's apparently got some message. He DMs people with a funny GIF and it gets people to reactivate.

He says it's like something like leaving so soon. And it's kind of like the vibe is kind of, yeah, but you want to get the funny GIF. Of course.

Okay. Yeah. And it's just within school.

Yeah. Okay. So no email or SMS or anything like that.

Our sales team has that for ghosted leads. They have a Kevin Hart meme. That's like, I think that might be it.

Yeah. I think that's what he's using. And yeah, it gets higher response rates than any message.

This next clip is about growing the business even beyond you. Meaning, who are you going to bring on your team to help you get to where you're trying to go? And if the people that you're bringing on keep being dumb and making stupid mistakes, it's not their fault.

It's yours. And the good news is it's a skill that you can fix. And in this part, I'll break down how I get the best talent, how we recruit them, how I hire them and how we train them so they can win.

Hiring related stuff. Hiring. Delegating low leverage stuff.

Just delegating low leverage tasks so I can focus on. Even be specific. Well, for me, I know that if I spent 100% of my time on just YouTube making YouTube videos, I can get to like 100K or even 150K a month.

But right now it's like 15 to 20% of my time. So just everything else. Well, what is that?

Well, building the modules, delivering the product, calls, appearing on calls. Just everything about community. Because you kind of need to do all of those things.

Yeah. Yeah. But like there is a lot of stuff like, you know, maybe emails, like sorting, priorities, like calendar, all of those things that could be outsourced.

So like I'm wondering in what order, like do I hire so I can basically spend 100% of my time on the thing I have the most expertise in? Well, building out the modules is mostly a one-time thing. And then once that's done, that'll be off your plate.

The emails are 100% outsourceable. There are plenty of copywriters who can write emails for you. And I'd recommend taking somebody who's in the community who knows your voice and can give you like a good V1 draft.

And then you just tweak it and send it. The calls, you want to basically just show up. Like that's, I mean, more or less, that's kind of how we run this.

Like I show up, we do the Q&A, and then I move on with my life. And I treat it just like it's a meeting. And I do it on my meetings day because I do meetings on Mondays.

And so we do it on that day because it's the least disruption for how I work. And so if you have, so I'm going to have a really big piece about this coming out soon. But basically the difference between maker and manager time.

So if you have deep work, that's what I consider maker time. And a lot of people in any organization, you've got copywriters, video editors, coders. Like they have to just like get really deep into a project.

And you want to minimize time on meetings as much as possible so that they can work. Basically when they're on a meeting, they're not working. There are managers, which is the opposite, which is for them being on meetings is working, right?

And coordinating between things and talking to vendors. And I mean like sales guys, customer support. Those are people who like when they meet is when they work.

And so those are both fine. The problem is when they intersect. And so managers start interrupting makers from making.

And the problem is that makers only have 14 time blocks a week. You've got one morning block and one afternoon block. And that's it.

Like I'm sure when you're making a YouTube video, it's not like you can't split it between two meetings, right? Like you need a whole big chunk of time. Managers though can spread their time in 15 minute increments.

And so they have 20 time slots a day, but a maker only has two. And if you take one maker slot up, it's like you just killed one 14th of my week, right? And so there's a disproportionate cost for a manager compared to a maker when it comes to calendaring.

Now you're the entrepreneur because you're like, why is this relevant for me? Is that you do both. And so what's been, I mean, like if I had to bet like my single greatest return on time habit that I have was that the first six hours of my day since I was poor has always been zero meetings.

And it was just that, well, shoot, but people started calling because I had a brick and mortar, you know, Jim, people started walking in at 5am, right? So I was able to take, you know, like lock my door to my office. And I just was like morning sessions.

I don't, I don't participate in, but as of 10am, I would then start working and being out there. So from four to 10 was my six hours every day. And then from then on, I just knew it was just fires, but that still allowed me to move the ball forward.

So I only got a maker, like basically five maker slots during the week, but then on Saturday, Sunday, I got four more. So I got nine blocks of time throughout the week that I could do like major big work. And so if you can look at orienting your calendar so that, I mean, now I only have one day, which is Mondays where I do any coordination or any calls or anything.

And the rest of my week is truly empty. Like truly, I can show you my calendar. It's empty.

And that takes time to get to, but that's because that's like the team knows that if I have an empty calendar, we make more money. And so for you, you have to try and push as much into that one day as you possibly can. And that also means that if someone's like, Hey, I've got this person that you should meet and it's on a Wednesday in the afternoon and it's one meeting, you just say no.

Yeah. I think I honestly have to do it. That's the only time I can make.

Then you're like, then I guess we're not going to meet. I think I have to do the time study you suggested, like the timer every 15 minutes. Because like, it's, you know, it's kind of hard to go in retrospect, like where did the entire day go?

Like, but like you're working all day, but like what was achieved? Right. Maker time.

Like when you have a maker block, you know exactly what you're going to be doing. You have the one thing that you're working on. And sometimes it takes five blocks in a row to get that one thing done.

Like what the fuck is the school games? Like I'll bet you it took more than one maker block. I know it did, but I'm saying.

And in terms of the people you're hiring, like especially at a small business scale, like do you, is it better to just hire somebody who can get the job decently done or should wait like until there's like a killer? That's a, that's a tough question. I, it's a, it's a super tough question.

I would say that it's going to basically, you can, you can see the arbitrage between how much more you get back for the time. Basically. So let's say we take, let's just do an example.

Let's say you bring in a mediocre email writer. If the deficient, the discrepancy between how good your emails are versus their emails, but the time you save not writing the email goes into YouTube, for example, if you can make up the trade, then it's worth doing. Does that make sense?

I think you would benefit the most from just a generalist person. So someone who's a hardcore fan of yours already emerging in the community is already doing this stuff kind of for free. probably would be stoked to work with you.

Won't cost you too much money and will learn everything as you go with you. And they'll just do everything that doesn't make sense for you to do. Probably like, you probably have a few customer support tickets or emails.

They'll do those. I mean, Mati already does that for me, but. Oh, you already have someone?

The issue is that he's still in school. So it's like part time, basically. Well, quit.

So I probably need one more person. Quit. Just get him to quit.

Yeah. Get him to quit. He's 16.

Yeah. Get him to quit. Is that legal?

Is that legal? Yes. Dude, you're going to learn so much more doing this shit.

But his mom would kill me, I think. Yeah. Don't blame it on him.

Don't blame it on him. That's all. Fight his mom.

David, y'all definitely need group onboarding ASAP, bro. That's like the next thing for y'all. I learned group onboarding from the first day one recordings.

Y'all need those ASAP, bro. Yeah. Another thing is you could get an EA.

Like if you have some like tedious tasks, like when I got my executive assistant in life, saves so much time on my plate. If it's just like tedious things are a little bit simple. I don't know.

You probably have like a bunch of stuff that's like simple stuff that you have to do that you could just pay somebody like, you know, like offshore talent, like, you know, anywhere from like six to eight bucks an hour to do that. Yeah. David, do you have a setter?

Like anybody in your DMs? No. Bro, bro, you need that ASAP too, bro.

A setter in your DMs and group onboarding calls and your community is about to, your term will go way down and you'll get a lot of stuff. Would I give somebody my school password to go? I mean, you'd probably set up a mini chat account or GHL, like one of these other people.

You're talking about, yeah, we're talking about in your social media. Yeah. Yeah.

Like everything from YouTube to the about page. Because it's YouTube. Oh, okay.

Yeah. I do any sales. Do you don't have any following on social media?

Yeah. Well, everything goes on YouTube basically. Like no Instagram, no nothing like that.

I mean, not really. Are you collecting any phone numbers? I don't know.

So even in your free school, you don't ask for the most simplest funnel possible? He's his younger generation, man. They don't do this shit.

I mean, like, people are telling me to add email, right? And like, eventually I probably have to add it. But like, I like my simple funnel, you know?

Dude, I didn't send emails for nine years. Jumon said no emails. Wow.

I say that to point out the extreme of like, whenever people are like, you have to, like, you don't have, like, there's no rule. Did you collect them? Hmm?

Did you collect them? Yeah. I mean, I collect them because I felt like I had to.

But like, I did nothing with them. Like, truly nothing. Then eventually I hired someone and they just sent in emails.

And I just like, was like, I don't want to read them. Like, I'll kill everyone. How many more years do you have in school?

Two in high school. I mean. Well, he's your bottleneck because he's, school is your bottleneck.

Okay. School is my bottleneck for school. Yeah.

Your constraint. Yeah, for sure. Pick one.

Yeah. If you're going to get, if you're going to get into entrepreneurship, then like, whatever. You know what I mean?

I mean, I, I, I try not to, to tell people to quit high school, but like, I just don't think it, like. So you think it's worth it to quit? It's just, it's just the system is so, like, what are you learning?

Yeah. I mean. Right.

Not much. Yeah. Right.

You're like, so I want to not learn a lot of stuff so that I can learn not much for most of my time. I get it. Like, I mean, I, it's very tough.

I get that, but it's still like. Yeah. If you're going to go to med school or like be a lawyer or be an investment banker or work at Goldman Sachs, or like, maybe you were going to do computer science at Stanford, then sure.

Stay in school. But if you're not going to do that, it's useless. If you go, if you're going to entrepreneurship, then like, there is no degree that's required.

Yeah. Just a thought. Even a business degree is crap.

Oh yeah. It's irrelevant. Yeah.

I have a, I have a similar, well, we have a similar problem with delegation. So for the promos and for all the engagement that Justin has to do in the community, it's hard to find time to like balance both of those two, both of those things. And really the big bottleneck is deciding if we're going to have a videographer with us all the time or like hire someone on a project for project basis.

What do you think works better out of the two? Honestly, I think he just needs a videographer that he likes a lot. I got some Laska over there.

That's right. And he's with me all the time. Yeah.

Well, it's, it's been the most difficult part. Like we've been searching for a videographer, like, I mean, basically years at this point. Yeah.

Probably just a year. Yeah. I mean, it's not that hard of a role.

It feels like, it feels like things. Yeah. Yeah.

But, but yeah, it's, it's cause all them, they just, they ended up dropping off really, really quickly. Maybe I don't know. Maybe they just did it.

They don't like, maybe it's a culture fit thing. Could be that. But like, it's been really difficult to find all the roles for sure.

Someone is going to stick with us, travel with us. Who made you want to do this? I feel like anyone in this room would want to do it.

Such a joke. There's so much value is being with Alex every day. There'll be people in your audience.

But does he not want someone following him with a camera? No, no. I mean, we, we definitely would prefer that.

No, but him, it's him whose life is being exposed. Yeah, he wants someone following us, but like, it's, it would be Thomas, but like, Thomas isn't, he's not a videographer. Like, he's a, he's a different role entirely.

So he wants someone to follow him? He wants someone who like, can like, have good banter, will push him sometimes. Like, someone who's like.

A friend. Gang. Yeah.

Has he made a post about it? Oh, yeah. We made, we do do a hiring post basically every single month.

Why doesn't he just learn how to use a camera? Oh, that, that's actually what I used to do at one point. So why the fuck can you, don't you pull out a camera?

I could, yeah. Yeah. You're already friends.

If that's the element and you know how to use a camera, I mean, shit. You do. I mean, the only thing that I'm still like thrown off by is like zillions of people have come in and I'll bet you that many of the people who've applied would have been a fit.

So I just, it might just be a weird hiring process you guys have. I mean, when we, when we've run our things, actually, how did you come in? I applied for Layla's videographer.

And I was like, you're with me. Yeah. Sure.

He had Jason. I agree on the feeling part though. If someone's going to be following you around all the time, like the vibe is more important than the skill.

Yeah. The skill is not the thing. It's just the like vibe of having them with you all the time.

Daniel asked me on the last question in the interview, he was like, well, what's, what's like, cause I was telling him if I was like, listen, I'm going to be like, Hey, we're going to do this big thing and you're going to set up. And then I'm going to be like, nah, just kidding. And it's going to happen all the time.

And then also, uh, they're like, you're going to have plans and then you're going to have to cancel them last minute. Cause we go late. And like, basically it's just going to be chaos and I can be in a bad mood and I can be tough sometimes.

And I just like painted that picture. He was like, got it. I'm here for it.

But, um, he's like, what do you like? I'm really experienced. I think you were like, I'm a really high caliber videographer.

What do you need a professional for? Yeah. What do you need a professional for?

Is what he asked me. And he's like, what's the most important thing for you to me? And I was like, like, I really thought about it.

And I was like, you like me. That's really it. Did you start off?

Sorry. What was your name? Daniel.

Did you start off like absolute pro with, uh, with cameras? No, I had to learn how to use cameras. Sorry.

When you started with Alex, I'm referring to when you started with Alex. Were you already good? Oh yeah.

Okay. No, so I say that because like, I'll bet you that there's, like people in that list. If you have had thousands of people apply who are videographers, like there's definitely somebody in there who's an exceptional videographer.

And so for me, I honestly, like, I am, I am grateful that Daniel has the skill that he has and can like edit bangers and do all sorts of like he's a weapon. He can do lots of things. But like for me, if his skill was half of what it was, but, but I like him as much as I like him, that would have been enough.

This is just like your skills was a bonus for me. Um, but it was just like, we have such a sick vibe on the, on the media team. I think we have a sweet, like the team's awesome.

Um, and so like, I've had a videographer in the past that I, nothing wrong with the guy. I just like, wasn't, I didn't like look forward to, you know what I mean? It was just like work.

So I'm like, okay, sit down and like everyone court stop. And it came out in the, it came out in the footage. And so like, I have to look forward to, there should feel, I should feel no friction or no hesitation to having Daniel around.

Like, I'm not worried if he's around, if I'm saying, so I don't have to edit myself. Um, and like, that is number one. You've got, he's got to like me and I've got, because it's both, it's both ways.

Cause she, like, if you don't like someone, you can capture it very differently. Like on some level, like you can make someone look very different if you don't like them. And, um, and so it has to be both directions.

Like both people have to, have to get along with each other. That's probably something we haven't really looked at. Cause sometimes we want like really, really nice stuff.

It's like level, you know, with this for motion shots and whatnot. And obviously when you look at the application, I prioritize liking a person. And the thing is, is like, I'll bet you if there was something that we're like, Hey, can you learn Adobe something?

You'd be like, sure. I like, it'll take me a couple of weeks, but I'll figure it out. And like, if you have that type of person, it's like, I just, it's so much harder to find somebody you like than it is to find somebody who has the base skill, at least in my opinion with this role.

So I would just, I would prioritize someone that Justin likes and then that's it. And then from there, like the other skills. I remember where you mentioned this.

I was watching some of your content and said, you've been kind of made a system for how when someone was filming you, they're nodding. Yeah. They're bringing you your nicotine and all that kind of stuff.

Yeah. So. Yeah.

All this, I mean, Daniel's always got Nicorette, caffeine, water, Gatorade. He's got, he's a, he's full, full, full service at all times. He's always ready.

I was putting that out there. Yeah. Yeah.

No, it's super awful. And like after every, every recording session, it's kind of like on a foul shot for basketball. Like everyone, everyone pounds afterwards.

Like, it's just like, we always do that. Like wall, like you guys can't see it. Cause you guys are looking at me, but I can see them.

And like, they're nodding the whole time while we're filming, because they know that that, cause when we thought activities, right. What are the things? Cause so Caleb who runs the whole team, he was obviously higher at one.

And so he had the camera first. And, um, that was the first time I had a VR that I really liked. And I was like, oh man, like Caleb's cool shit.

Like this, like this feels, this isn't, this is easy. Right. And I was like, what makes it?

And then, so then Caleb obviously moved up and then he stopped big at the filming session. So we had, you know, two or three guys there at the filming sessions. And I was like, man, this feels heavy.

Like what's like, why does this feel different? And so then we had to backtrack and be like, what, what does he do? That is different than what other people do.

Other people were like the vibe is like vibe. Fuck. I don't care.

What does he do? And what he did was he would nod while I was, while I was going. And after every filming thing, he was like, that was fucking awesome.

Like sick. That was so dope. And then he also listened and he had really engaging questions that he'd be like, so how does that relate to this?

Or how does that really? So the followup questions were great and they could slice that up. And that made for really good content because the, the questions he had was questions that the audience had.

And so it's just looking at like, what are all the little micro things? And then you make that into a checklist. And that's why I think most people can't teach anything is because they don't get it down to like, what are the behaviors?

And so now the team, I mean, the whole team knows that when they film, it's like a whole thing. Did you like buy out a bunch of people or like? No, we do.

So we, so I'll tell you the quick process and then we'll, we'll move to a different topic. But we do the big application, gave a big raw file, told everybody they had 48 hours to submit the raw for that way. Everybody's working off the same thing.

Cause if everybody can just pull from whatever, then the quality of the content is going to be a huge factor. Whereas if everyone pulls from the same raw, the quality of the editor is going to be the thing that shines through. And so this is from the editing perspective.

If we're doing videographers, then yeah, it's going to be way more about vibe, like in terms of our, our dynamic. Um, but for editing, uh, then they would submit. And so from 1200, we got 60 submissions to see, you know, it was like 5% of people actually submitted.

Riley, did you come from, from one of our contests? Uh, no, I just reached out to, but it was pretty similar process, like applied, gave me raw file, edited. Yeah.

And so then they turn it in and then, um, you know, Caleb would look at all of them and be like, these three guys are sick. And then I'll interview those guys. And then however many of them are cool.

Overhaul. That's fundamentally how we do it. Like we test for skill for editing.

We test for skill and then we test for vibe because it's way easier to go like from 1200 down to a much smaller with, from skill, um, from a vibe perspective. Um, what was the process for you for videographer stuff? I did like four interviews or actually five interviews.

Um, one with Caleb, two with Frank, and then one with you. Okay. And then the one with you was intense.

I was like, this is a test. Everything is test. You had like one really tall chair and one small chair.

He's like, pick one. I was like, I'm going to sell a small chair. That wasn't a test.

Yeah. That's funny. Um, so yeah, hopefully that gave you a little bit of insight.

Yeah, for sure. For also, it's also. Yeah.

It's really all about the chair sizes is what matters. Yeah. But also, like I needed somebody who wasn't going to be trying to compete with me.

You know what I mean? Um, I just like, I don't, I didn't want that energy. I wanted somebody who's like super laid back and Daniel's as laid back as I get.

When you didn't, did gym launch, you said that you don't do emails. Like you didn't do emails. How did you nurture your clients then?

Like kept in contact with them? Um, you mean leads? Yeah.

I just got more of them. Okay. I'm being dead serious.

Like, I mean, like there were, there are many things I probably should have done. I just, every time someone's like, do you want to start emailing? I was like, ah, no.

And I didn't want to give it to somebody else until eventually they were like, can we please hire someone to just do this? And I just didn't look at it. I'm just, I'm so particular with written, with written word.

It's the, it's my primary way of communicating. It's like my, like people, despite the fact that everyone on the internet sees me on video, like my books are better in my opinion than anything I create, but it's also because I spend more time on them than anything else. And so when I see someone write, I'm like, this makes no sense.

This is completely unclear. Why do like, why do you exist? Yeah.

But also I think I kind of understand your question a bit and I'm kind of like homosey in this way. Cause if you've got something that working, if you've got something that's working, that isn't email and you can just keep increasing the volume of what you're doing, then who cares? Now is it?

We just kept spending more money, kept making more money. So I was like, I could do that or I could make more ads and crush. Yeah.

I mean, honestly, I think Sam and I are so aligned with this, which is just like, find something that works, do it as much of it as you possibly can and eliminate everything else in real life. That's not that. And that also includes all your personal life stuff.

Like, like this was a theme of the whole last talk. If you guys all heard it, we talked for like an hour, maybe more on this one topic of like everything that you had, like cooking, cleaning, laundry, getting your car filled up with gas, like all of this stuff. If you know that you can make more money with your time than it, than it costs you to get someone else to do that, then you should do that.

And then you'll be amazed at how much extra time you have. If you're cleaning your house or preparing your meals, that's going to be the best thing you learn from this event. It's just, just get someone else to do that.

Cleaning and meal prep and groceries is like the lowest hanging fruit. So I calculated this based on US averages. So just the big three, which is laundry, cleaning and food related.

Those together are 96 hours a month on average. It's like, I just found you two and a half full work weeks of time. But, and also that doesn't include switching costs of like the cost of time of like cleaning it, like cleaning up after you eat and.

Well, thinking about when you're going to do it and what you're going to eat and groceries and what you're going to buy and putting them back in the shelves and taking the bags, like all that shit. I want to like emphasize like the whole like personal chef, like housekeeper stuff. Like I haven't been a coach for long.

My first 6k pay in full, I got like an in-house health team, which is like a housekeeper, a chef and like a dietitian and stuff. It's crazy, but they're not expensive. Like I pay my, I had a maid and I pay her 150 bucks twice a week to come over and I have a meal plan and I give it to her and she shops for the food.

It's all whole foods. They come over, they make it. I have like 20 meals in my fridge at all times.

They're like amazing, good, like Latino whipped up food. It's great. And I was able to take like three more sales calls a day.

That's a big reason why I haven't won the school games. Like that was huge. And you also feel amazing about it.

It's like, it was like, it seemed like it's like super luxury investment. Like, oh, Shark has a private chef, but it was, it's 1500 bucks a month. Like if you do the math, it's 96 hours.

It is $1,500 a month. That's literally like I have a big presentation on it. It's $15 and like 16 cents per hour.

If you can make more than $15 and 16 cents per hour with your time, you should do that. It has nothing to do with luxury. It has everything to do with like, what is my return on time?

And like, you can just ignore every poor person who says otherwise. This is kind of for both of you, probably you, Sam as well. Definitely some.

But I guess like when you're building, you know, a startup, obviously, you know, you might have, sometimes you might have a little bit lack of capital, a little lack of resources. I guess, how do you get A players to work for you and with you? And how do you like structure comp structures and all that?

So like, you know. Go for it. When you don't have any money.

No, no, no, no. Maybe you're trying to get somebody who's, you know, making decent money, you know, already, or you're wanting to get, you know, we're making money, but like, you want to get an A player team. But you're still a startup.

You're not, you know. Yeah. Well, it's really hard.

It will probably take a long time. You'll probably want to quit. But eventually, like, something you'll just, there'll be a chemistry, I think, and a perfect fit with someone.

And you just kind of have to give it enough time until that thing happens. And you also have to offer something unusual. Like, for me, it was offering the, like, co-founder title to Daniel.

Because I knew when I found him that that was what I needed to use. So, and that. Programmer.

Yeah. My, yeah. And, you know, when I found him, it was like the perfect balance.

Because he just wanted to code. He said, I love to code. I can build anything.

All I need is someone who can dream. And he was like, if you've got some, like, money and you know what to build. And you can help us get customers.

And, well, I need to do his code. Like, then we're good. And we had, like, a good chemistry.

How did you all meet, if you don't mind me asking? I did 600 interviews. I was just a very good guy.

Did you have, like, a hedge on it? That's all I did for a year. How did you get the interviews?

Did you work with, like, a... I worked with many different recruiters. Okay.

Hacker News. Like, I tried, honestly, a bit of everything. Plus, I had to hire five of the wrong people, too.

So, it's not like I just got it right. Like, it was the most brutal thing I ever did. Do you have, like...

I hear people talking about doing more interviews. Do you feel like there's ever, like, a sense of uncertainty? Like, after you get to a certain point, you're like, damn.

Option number one, two, and three are good. Or whatever. Like, what do you think?

Like, yeah. Like, some people I swore were great, and they weren't at all. And I'm sure some people were great, and I didn't see it, and I missed them, but how can I know about those?

Like, I'm sure. Like, I'm sure I was. But in the end, like, Daniel, my co-founder, he was like...

There was chemistry, and I think I didn't... I ignored... I was too logical back then, but...

I think I've come to realize now that the chemistry is really important. And I pay way more attention to that now. Ultimately, you're not going to know until you hire them, right?

Yeah. But... You just have to talk to a lot of people, too.

I feel like there's been this case where... I feel like everybody wants to be an entrepreneur. You know, so, like, when I'm trying to, you know, hire people, it's almost like they'd rather...

They're like, I'd rather do that myself, or rather do... What kind of person? Just, you know, I guess, like, high-level people for a growth partner agency.

So, like, somebody who can, like, be a growth partner, essentially, or be a, you know... I think me and Chris's problem is we're unicorns. Yep.

And we provide our people with, like... We cover all the bases, so we need more people like us. Yeah, and then...

Yeah, so we've even talked to some people that we know aren't... Making, you know, that much money. And like, hey, man, I'll pay you triple what you're making right now.

You know, I'm, like, managing small communities. And they're like, oh, I'd rather do my own thing. It's just like, wait, what?

You know what I mean? It's like a disconnect, I think, sometimes. So, I don't know.

Like, it's like... Yeah, the money is not the thing. Right, right.

Absolutely. Because, you know, with us, we're, like, competing with Google, NASA, SpaceX, Tesla. So, everyone's trying to throw money at them.

And they show us their DMs on LinkedIn and stuff. It's insane. Like, the amount of recruiters, right?

Right. So, money can't do it. Like, it has to be something else.

Right? In your case, do you think it's, like, the environment? Y'all's for heart?

Well, what, when I got my co-founder or when we get people now? Like, everybody. Well, the hardest one is getting the co-founder in the beginning because you don't have anything.

So, right, that's the hard one. But with time now, the way we get it is through internal referrals. So, if we have great people and they've worked at places like Coin...

Most of our talent comes from Coinbase and Riot Games because we've got some of their best engineers and they know everyone and when they tell... They're like, hey, how are you going over at Riot or Coinbase? Oh, I'm okay.

Burn out. Dude, this place is badass where I am. And they trust that person because that person isn't a recruiter.

They're probably the best software engineer these other people have worked with. And so, their word means a lot. What about people, like, that aren't coders, though?

Like, what about, like, you know, Andrew or, like, Matt? It's the same kind of thing. Oh, that's a different side of the business.

So, that comes from your customers. So, Matthew, who's running our podcast, he came from the community and, like, he showed... He was making podcast episodes for free.

And then he flew to the first school games. He paid for it himself. He's from Ireland.

Like, who on Indeed is going to do that? I don't know if you've ever tried Indeed. It's so bad.

But, yeah. But you look from them within, I think. Like, Kirby was in my mastermind.

And then he made this free community called Synthesizers. He was on the leaderboards for school community. Right?

So, I was like, okay, he's committed. Then Kirby hired Wichter. Where's Wichter?

There he is. Because he was his most engaged member in Synthesizers. So, you see.

And then Wichter hired this guy called Navas. Because he was someone who connected with him on school, too. And now Navas is referring someone.

I love it. Yeah. I think that's what we're hoping for, right?

Like, whenever you're, like, don't... Like, with that being said, we don't have the best people in the world. But we're kind of rooting through internal...

It starts with one. Yeah. But if you don't get that one, you'll never get anyone else.

We have a few really good people, I'd say. But, yeah. Have you pushed them for referrals?

Yeah. But I think the big thing is getting the high-level people. So, we have really good, like, executors.

Not really good leaders. That's one thing that we have. Like, I'm literally managing, like...

I feel like I have the wrong five meetings a day, almost. You know, for our team. So, it's just, like, excessive.

There's a lot. Yeah. It's excessive.

So, I would challenge the structure, then. The vision for the business has to be big enough that smart people can fit their dreams inside of it. And so, if you want brains, then you need people who...

Like, they need to be able to believe that their dreams can come true within your vision. If it's... Again, if it's like, yeah, we've just got a couple groups that we're running and we're making money, then it's like...

That doesn't, like, really get me motivated if I'm intelligent. Because, like, the best people have... There's no lack of opportunity for the best people.

They have tons... Like, you have to think about this as... It's a totally different game.

Like, if you're accustomed to taking people who are like, I really want a job, all of those people are irrelevant. You have to be people who are like, in some ways, you're competing for them. So, the more you're competing for a prospect, like, selling them...

And so, if you feel like... Like, I'll tell you the funny one. It's like, if you're interviewing people where you're like, sell me on why I should take you.

If you say that to somebody who's actually really talented, they'll be like, I'm good. Like... Like, they just don't...

Like, you have to respond to this offer within 12 hours. It's like, okay. Well, I think you hit the nail right there for me.

Like, their vision has to be... Our vision needs to be big enough for their dreams to fit into it. You have to be able to say, like, what we want to do is we want to make music money into the standard for this.

And then they have to believe with a decent amount of certainty that it's possible. And so, like, how you guys present, like, you are absolutely selling them. And so, like, I think I drew this about on a past one.

But everybody here understands, you know, lead generation, lead nurture, sales, onboarding, and then, you know, retention ascension, right? That's how you do with customers, right? This is the exact same process for an employer.

You generate applications. You nurture applications. The sale is the interview.

You onboard the employee. And then you either retain them or ascend them. It's the same thing.

And so, you basically have to understand the acquisition. Like, this is when we get into scaling. Because everyone's like, two or three people are like, what's scaling?

It's just where the inflow of talent in the business matches the inflow of customers into the business. And you have to have an exceptional conversion process for attracting talent. This is where brand counts double.

It counts once on the front end for customers and again on the back end for talent. And it becomes either a virtuous cycle or a vicious cycle. Either destroys your business, you have a bad brand.

Because what do you think, like, great talent will look at your reviews and be like, oh, never mind. They wouldn't work at a good place. So, I guess, and last question.

I guess, what would be the best way to, like, acquire talent? Is it just building a personal brand? Like, in our field of work?

Because I don't think it's necessarily, like, I don't feel like I can find the right people on LinkedIn or something like that. You know, for what we're trying to do. It needs to be people who are kind of, like, already kind of entrepreneurs or people who are in more of, like, the sales or manager field.

It really depends on what role you're looking for. But I can promise you that very smart people are on LinkedIn. Do you know how I looked?

I got invited to speak at something. I looked at who else was speaking there and I saw who Mosey was speaking there. And I was like, all right, that's my opportunity.

That was the first time we met in person. Yeah. Honestly, so cool.

How long ago was that? One year before I spoke about doing a deal. But you have to, like, be strategic sometimes.

Yeah. And then, so you have to kind of do this old school networking thing, which I fucking hate. Because that's, like, the only time I've ever done that.

The whole Mosey deal is, like, the one deal to never do that again. But, yeah, you kind of have to do that. I had to start going to, like, these software things.

I had to start to meet some software engineers. I had to learn about their world. I had to ask people about why does, what do you hate as a software engineer?

What do you like? What makes a good company? What makes a bad company?

You have to, like, learn everything about it and network and do that. It really sucks, honestly. But if you're serious about it, I knew there was no way I could build school without this person.

So I delayed starting it by a year just to find the person. Yeah. So I was like, I'm not even going to start until I find them.

Like, that's how essential I knew they were. That's why I tell everyone to not do software. It's just because the scale of how difficult it is to actually do it right is so hard that, like, basically no one does it right.

Even if you know what you're doing, most people can't do it. And most people who are, quote, in the info world are like, oh, my info thing is insoluble, so I'm going to build software. And they just think that, like, white labeling go high level means they have a software company.

Like, but, I mean, right? Or they create some widget that someone else can duplicate in five seconds that they did off with an offshore developer that, like, if it actually did work, then that developer would hold you ransom. And then what?

Like, they just don't play it out two steps. And the coach did anyways, and it all sucks. Yeah, don't do it.

Yeah. And someone was like, you don't want us to succeed. That's why, because you're doing something.

I was like, no, man. I saw that. Sam had put five years in it.

I was like, great. Okay. I saw the metrics.

I was like, okay, this is legit. I spent all my money, and it still wasn't enough. Yeah.

I had to spend, like, twice that again. Thank you guys for that, too, by the way. That's going to help a lot.

I'm going to treat this for real. Yeah. I mean, the personal brand thing is just good for recruiters.

Like, if you have one, it's great. It helps a lot. Yeah.

But at the end of the day, if the business that you're trying to build solves a real problem, and you really genuinely care about the problem, if you find someone else who also cares about that problem, they will be more likely to work with you. Like, that's fundamentally it. What are you...

Sorry. Last question. What do you think about creating an offer to train people to do what you are trying to eventually staff for?

Like... How I'm growing? Yeah.

Like, you know, like... Yeah, you know, like... There was a point in time I had a closer program.

I was training closers and I was staffing them. You know what I mean? And then I stopped doing that because there's so many closer training programs.

But right now, I really need growth partners, people who can lead and manage our clients and kind of oversee everything. What do you think about, like... I know there's the growth operator thing, but they're not, you know, like, in my mind.

Like, they don't have all the skill sets necessarily. What if someone, you know, created a program to train people? I don't think you create another business to solve a rule.

Okay. Depends if it's... Like, I know with a software engineer, no one's going to be any decent in 10 years.

Maybe a prodigy in six or seven. But, like, there's just no shortcut in that. Like, I mean, my co-founder's done 20.

So, the years matter. And the same is true with a lot of things. Like, there's just years.

So, like... But some other things might be different. Like, setting.

Okay, you can teach that. Closing. Yeah, you can probably teach that.

But these more high-level strategic things. Yeah, that ain't happening. Like, it took me fucking 10 years.

Like, so... Are you going to wait 10 years? No.

Yeah, so it's like, fundamentally, every skill is trainable. The question is whether it's worth the return on effort and the resources to train someone with it. If you break things down enough, you can train someone to do anything.

It's just that if someone lacks... Has zero meta skills. They don't know how to read.

They don't know how to write. They don't know how to talk. You could teach someone to do all that stuff.

It's just, why bother? So, I'd rather take someone who's already here and then just nudge them, if I can, with, you know, proper training. That just bridges the gap between all of the skills they come in with and then applying that to my business.

You got it. Cool. Appreciate it.

Yeah, always. I mean, the people is the reason that most internet marketers in general can't make money. Sorry, they make money, but they don't make, like, big money.

Is that they just can't... They don't know how to operate people. And that's usually because they need, like, a right hand.

A true right hand who can... Who's as good as them. And, like, Layla will never get the credit that she deserves, and that's fine.

But, like, the reason that all of our stuff is so big is because she's so good at building. Like, she's an unbelievable builder. And so, like, the culture of the team is rock solid.

I mean, the guys will tell you, like, Layla really runs the... Like, Layla runs Acquisition.com. Like, I really...

I was like, she really does. She does not. Like, Layla runs everything.

Like, I mean, I told you I have an empty calendar. I can't have an empty calendar and also have a business that's running unless someone else is actually doing it. Layla takes 15 meetings a day.

She operates. She's coordinating things between different departments. She's checking in a portfolio company.

She's having, you know, one-on-ones with people who are having some sort of emotional breakdown about some craziness, whatever. She handles all that with a smile. You know what I mean?

And so, but, like, I was... When we were talking earlier, like, I capped at $3 million a year. And then when Layla came in 24 months later, I took home $17 million in income net.

And so, the difference was that she liked people. And I tried to avoid them. And that was the problem.

And so, she... Her... Like, Layla's genuine vision in life is to build a company that people love working at.

That's her whole... Like, the whole reason that she... Like, she gets...

Like, her internal mission is to build a company that people love being at every day. And so, her vision just fits within my vision. And so, I recruited her.

To do it. But, like, if we didn't do stuff that she liked, we'd like... She wouldn't build it.

So, I very much... Like, especially the more talented the people that you bring on, the more you like... Like, they don't need pushing.

Like, they know what they're doing. You just need to make sure that they're doing it in the direction. And you kind of do this.

Yeah, the amount of training that you have to give someone is inversely proportional to the skills that they come in with. So, the more... Basically, the less skilled the person, the more specific the instructions.

So, like... Sam could basically just be like, hey, can you just promote school a lot? And I'd be like, yeah.

He's not like, hey, could you make these posts and write this copy and send these emails and run ads and make the hooks like this? Like, that exchange has literally never occurred. Like, I don't even know if Sam sees the ads before they go out.

Well, Mosey texted me the other day. He was like, when does the activation stuff come out? And I said, last Thursday.

No, like, for real? Like... I already did it.

And then he was like, oh, I've seen this. And I was like, yeah, I've already been thinking about that. We've got something coming.

Yeah. Like, we don't even... I've already thought about the next four things.

And we've got things ready. So, by the time Mosey has the idea, I'm like, yeah, we've got it. Don't worry.

Yeah. Do your thing. And then I'm like, cool.

Let me tell you what I'm doing on the media side. It's like, oh, shit. Great.

Like, these are all the things that I'm ramping up. This is the system we're putting in place. Like, we changed our cadence.

Like, things like that. It's like, oh, dope. I don't even want to think about YouTube.

So, like, if I had to tell him stuff, oh, my God. Like... Yeah, but it's good to divide it like that.

Because I can just focus on this stuff. He can focus on that stuff. Right.

Kirby can focus on his stuff. We have very good, like, division like that. Yeah.

The amount of direction you need to give someone is inversely proportional to the skill they have. Yeah. Like, someone could just be like, hey, can you build this company?

And be like, sure. People will complain. Like, if people...

It's always a sign of notice. When people complain, there's no communication. Have you...

Has anyone had this as an issue? Like, with teams? Maybe a lot of you don't have teams yet.

But bad communication, communication. Sometimes it's always the complaint. Yeah, I found it's interesting, that one.

Because you don't really need to communicate a whole lot when you get the right people. Like, when Mosey said, like, a couple of words. And I was like, don't worry, I got it.

Like, already happened. Like, right? But sometimes if you hire the wrong person, there's no amount of communication that can ever make it work.

And it's exhausting. And it just still doesn't work. And I think I understood this.

I think I told this at one of the previous ones. But how you know what a good culture is, is this story of Google in the early days. So Larry Page searched for something and the ads that showed up were not relevant to the words he typed in.

He took a screenshot. He printed it off. He got a red marker.

And he wrote, these ads suck. He walked over to the engineers and he pinned it up on the wall. And he tapped it.

And one of them walked over and picked it off the wall. Stayed up all night that night. And invented AdSense.

Which is there, which has made them hundreds of billions. Chill. So he didn't sit down with him and be like, look, I think you need to do this and this and this and maybe this.

He just said, these ads suck. Right? Is that clear communication?

I mean, to him it was. No, but that's what good talent is. You can just be like, this thing.

Yeah, do this. Yeah. Maybe you don't even have to say, do this.

You can say, this sucks. Sort it out. Like, and then they'll be on it.

Or they might have already preempted what sucks because they've already been thinking about it. So I always remember that when people say, oh, like, you need more meetings or more communication. Like, that wasn't a meeting, first of all.

Right? There was slapping something on the wall. Yeah.

One of the most difficult things, this is like, I think from an entrepreneurship perspective in terms of development, is like, has anyone here had another business before this? Yes? Okay.

Did you achieve in this business what you achieved in your last business? Like, from how long it took you to get to that level in the business before versus how long it took you to get to that level with this business? Was it way faster?

Yeah. And so a lot of the reasons is because you already beat the bosses up to that level. So it's kind of like you're quickly retracing your steps.

And then you get to a level that you don't, to your level of incompetence. The difficulty, the thing that takes the longest in entrepreneurship is figuring out what good looks like at each level. And it's one of those things that's really hard to translate.

Like, you see the billionaires on stage and they're just like, you know, get great people. And you're like, sure. But the thing is, is that connecting what great people to them looks like in their mind and what you think great people are, that is an ocean of heart.

And so, I mean, I tell this story and Sam and I were talking about this last time, but like I, when we started meeting with private equity firms to look at transacting with Jim Lodge, I, we'd have these super long tables that were these boardrooms. And I'd see their team all the way on this side. I saw my team all the way on this side.

And I would just kind of sit there and listen to like the questions that they were asking and the responses that my team had. And to be fair, the team that we had had built a hundred million dollar plus company pre-COVID. Obviously, I sold during COVID, which actually hurt my valuation, but not the point.

So they built a hundred million dollar company, which is cool. But when I saw the town on this side, I was like, oh, that's why these guys are going to make three billion dollars over the next five years. This team.

And it was such a stark contrast in terms of the level of talent. Again, not disrespecting my team. It was just such a difference that it was literally like after that immediately, I was like my whole bar was just reset in terms of the caliber of the people that even existed in the world.

And everything was like, how on earth do I get those people to work for me? And so like right now, some of you have like one person who's like, man, I couldn't live without that person. There's somebody who's literally 10 times better than that person that exists right now.

And it's just trying to figure out what you need to do to get them on your team. But the problem that takes so long is looking at what good talent in general looks like. But even when it gets role specific, like Sam had to do all this research to figure out like how do good software engineers talk?

Like what do they like? What do they want? And so some of you guys are at a point where you need to like start hiring a sales director or something like that.

Like what happens is like this is the entrepreneurial journey of what it looks like. Like you bring someone on, you talk to a bunch of people and then you're like, I think this guy's good. You bring him in and he sucks.

And that takes six months away from the growth that you would have had because your sales team drops and this guy sucked. You put bad processes in. Then you got to fix the process.

You got to fire the people that got hired because he sucked anyways. And then you're like, shoot, I'm going to try again. You bring the next guy in.

And then sometimes it happens again. And you're like, wow, this sucked. And then the third time and sometimes this takes a year or two years.

And then you're like, I now know. And you get lucky and you get one who actually works. And you're like, oh, this is what a great sales director looks like.

And so the next time you go through your entrepreneurial journey, like you go right to there. And then you're like, shoot, I don't know what a good customer success person looks like. And then you try again.

And so it's like however quickly you can work through that so you can start recognizing the pattern of A, what good looks like in general. And then B, what good looks like for a specific role. That's how quickly you move through the levels.

That's been my experience with this. And I wish I try and do everything I can to try and translate that into the stories that I tell with the content. But sometimes it's really tough because they're like, nod.

But like that is the secret sauce. Like that is it is being able to recognize like what a good growth partner looks like. What a good, even a good agency.

I've had good agencies that we work with now. The vast majority of them, 95% of them are dog shit. Some of you guys run them.

So, you know what I'm saying? So like that's the pattern recognition. That's the highest value thing that you end up learning as an entrepreneur is what good looks like.

So obviously like I'm doing a lot of the management for our community. And that includes like making posts from Joe, as Justin. And obviously Justin has like lots of businesses, you know, like construction.

Yeah. It's going to be like a helicopter soon, like shooting, whatever. And how could we maximize his time within the community?

Because right now he's doing two calls. Two calls a month. I mean, if you modeled what my contribution right now is I do one call a week and we do this once a month.

That's my contribution. And then I ad hoc look at, you know, I poke around and I see what people are asking. And then I end up usually just like I haven't committed to anything.

I just write one or two posts a week. Sorry, a month that are just whatever is kind of top of mind. Like on the calls that you do, right?

Like you treat it like a meeting? Like on the calls for the school games, like the weekly or the monthly call, you just kind of sit there and just like treat it like a... They're weekly.

Yeah, they're Q&As. They're like this. When he said like a meeting, he batches it on the day that he does all of his meetings.

Yeah, I do my school call all my day where I have all my meetings. So it's not as disruptive as if he was like, I don't know, writing a book and then he had to switch gears to do a Zoom and then switch back into the book. That's going to take more than an hour.

Or like I can't record, like if we're going to go record, you know, some YouTube videos or something and that's my whole morning. I can't like start recording YouTube videos and be like, hold on guys. And then like go take a call and then go back to record.

Like it just doesn't work. And Kirby's there to make it less taxing on Omorzi. So Omorzi doesn't have to scan the chat or pick the questions.

So like if you're going to do a call, have someone like Kirby on. So you're Kirby in this. Like I would just literally model what Kirby does on a regular basis and just replace roles.

It's the same setup. Can you record them and it turns into content? Yeah, I also record them too.

So Daniel's, I mean actually, shoot, you guys have probably seen some of them, me yelling at the laptop. I don't know if you've seen one Instagram. But some of them have done really well.

But he's right there. I've got my webcam here. And so those get clipped into content for me.

So it's like I'm doing delivery for the people, you know, for the school community. But I'm also getting clips for marketing. And those get hammered out.

So you get double dip. Do you record your course? Yeah.

And I post them in call recordings with timestamps as well in the classroom page. Do you make content with it? Are you guys recording it with another camera like for?

We could make content with it. We haven't done it yet. I'd recommend it.

Because like you'll get the, I'll bet you, you get the most heated. Yeah, you get like super heated. I get, I mean, I get heated on the calls.

Because if you can use it for many purposes, it's a much more efficient use of time. Yeah. Because that one hour made content.

It brought in customers. It delivered value. It made a recording.

Do you know what I mean? And then people also ask, like if you think about this, publicly if you're promoting a snippet, people are like, how do I get on those calls? And then you just.

People really like when like Justin gets really passionate about like things that he's just interested on a daily basis. Yeah. So yeah, those, those, those.

Those moments will probably be the best reels or whatever. Yeah. All my best clips are just moments where I just freak out at someone.

So this next part is super important. It's about client and avatar selection. So one of the big reasons a lot of businesses suck to actually operate is that you have too many different customers who want too many different things.

And so you had to promise lots of different things to everybody to get them to buy. But now you've got to deliver on all those different things to all those different people. And so learning to sell and specifically learning how to sell the right people and say no to the wrong people is a skill that will absolutely unlock growth and profit in the business because you'll get more of the right people because you'll talk to them and you'll ward away the ones that suck.

I have one little question. How did, how did you and Kale meet or, you know, how does a client really same story? That's so cool.

He had a client. His gym was losing money. He was working a nine to five job.

He would work from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. at his gym teaching sessions.

He'd go to his job at 9 30 or whatever work from nine to five, go back to his gym, teach all the evening sessions, five, six, seven, eight. His wife had just had a baby. She was pregnant with her second child.

All of his income from his primary business went into the gym that was losing money and they had nothing left over. And so he called me up or he didn't call me up and be like, he responded to an ad and I got on the sales call and I was like, all right, it's whatever it was. At the time, he was like, he was honestly the first 10 customers I sold.

And he's like, I, I would buy this. I need this. But I just gave my last 10 grand or my only 10 grand to this coach that was going to teach me how to have an online fitness business.

And I was like, do you have an online fitness business? And he was like, no, I didn't, it didn't work or whatever. I was like, well, what if we just made your gym make money?

Would that be more? He's like, yes, I'm fine with just making my gym make money. And so, um, I asked him to put a thousand bucks down and he like put a thousand dollars onto a credit card or something.

That's so beautiful, bro. That's so, that's sick. They made $38,000 in the first 30 days.

I think, I think that's the coolest story in the world. Whenever you give somebody, like give somebody the chance to buy an ad a thousand, knowing you, you probably never even let nobody buy anything. No, everybody started a thousand bucks for the first three years.

Wow. Wow. Cause all gym owners are broke.

All gym owners are broke. And so it was a thousand down thousand a week. So the thing is, is that, and this is what everyone in the entire, like the entire info space still doesn't get because everyone's like my programs.

It's like, no, it's not. It's not. It's not.

The average gym that still to this day goes through gym launch space over $20,000 in additional new revenue in their first 30 days. Average. Average.

First 30 days. We track it cause it's such an important metric for us. And the reason that we have to do that is because they don't have the money to pay me what I want to get paid.

And so it was like, I know that the system's going to, on average, on average, triple your profit. We'll go from 36,000 to 112,000 in profit net of our fees. As in after you've paid us, you'll make 112,000.

That's the average over a year. But when you're broke, it doesn't matter because you're still broke and you can't buy anything. So it's like, put a thousand bucks down and I still needed him to have money for ads.

So he had like $3,000. I was like, keep two for ads, give one to me, and you're going to run this ad, which is a video of Layla. You're going to run this ad to this landing page that I've made.

You're going to put your logo at the top. And then when these leads come in, I was like, you're going to call them like, you need to feed your family, which you do. And so that's exactly what he did.

And so once the, you know, the second payment came in and I gave them like a 14 day delay because most of them didn't have any money. And so they would pay it. They collect cash from the people that were coming in and they could make the payments.

And then I gave them an incentive in the first 30 days to prepay the rest of the thing at a discount. And so that way it turned a thousand dollars down into 16 grand in the first month. And so my LTV to CAC and my cashflow in terms of acquisition was super strong.

And then like we ran that, we ran that for a very, very, very long time. I think like a year and a half ago, I think after, after I sold and Keltic over, he switched it from a front end and a back end to just selling a year for 36, I think is what it is. And so that's what they do now.

And it's just, they bill every 28 days and I think it's 29.97 or something like that a month. So it's, you know, 3k down or whatever. And, um, and that's, and that's fundamentally what happens.

But like, I'm just saying like the reason the niching is, is useful is that when you niche down, you can productize the delivery. Like there's no generic business quote consulting that can ever deliver as consistent of an outcome as a very niche business can. Because imagine if you had to do it generically, you'd be like, okay, come up with an offer, make something free.

And you'd want to run it to a lead gen page. And then when the leads come in, you want to call them quickly. You have to talk in generalities.

Whereas I was like, here's the ad. This is the landing page. This is how you set up your lobby.

When they walk in, say these words, this is the price you're going to sell at. And by the way, here's the delivery for it. Here's the meal plans.

Here's the cookbook. Here's the eating out guide. Here's all that stuff.

You can put your logo on it. You can make it yours. I already spent all the time doing it.

And the sales training they went through was the sales training. I put my trainers at my gyms through, which by the way, my sales training was less than one hour. And so there's all this closer training out there that's hundreds of hours long.

But when I needed to get guys to close, it was 60 minutes. It was like, this is what you say to them. It wasn't psychology.

It wasn't like, so we want to increase our demand. I was like, when they walk in the door, say this. And then after they agree, say the next thing.

And if they don't agree, you don't move on until they agree. Then you go to the next thing. And then here's where you ask for money.

That was it. Because I wasn't trying to make a course to impress people. I was trying to make a training that got someone a result.

And again, I did turnarounds for two years. And so like, I had to give stuff to busy gym owners who hadn't paid me because the turnaround business, they didn't pay me. So I had to make the training for them.

Like, how do you do nutrition? It was one 30 minute video. That was it.

It was like, this is the color template. Weigh them in. Divide their weight by 10, which means you just move the decimal.

I like had to break it down. I was like, okay, so you have 21 food units. Put the first eight over here.

This is all their protein. Then you can tell them you can scatter the rest between carbs and fat. You just do the yellow list.

Got it? Great. Have them take a picture with it in front of them.

That way their number's there. Put it against the wall like this. Like, there's just, there's nothing they could mess up.

And because of that, because all the variables were controlled, they all got a consistently good outcome. That just took a long time to do. Because I had actually done it.

At multiple locations. And then 30 plus turnarounds in different markets. So also when I get the customer who was like, this won't work in my market.

I'm like, I've got five other gyms on your block. But people are very limited. You know, I had one of the gym turnarounds that I did.

I launched the gym. This is important just for your customers. I launched the guy's gym.

And when I decided to switch to licensing, I called back all the guys who I'd done the turnarounds for. I was like, these will be the easiest sales. They literally saw me crack a hundred grand out of their gym in three weeks.

Called one of the guys up and he's like, how do I know it's going to work? I was like, I just did it in front of you. Like you saw me meet with 250 people.

He's like, well, I don't know if it's going to work for me. And I was like, you will never win. But like some people are like that.

And it was like, it's not worth the time. Just move on. It's a really specific situation.

So like, so I started as a B2C offer, right? But my top 10% of guys who like really kill it are the existing agency owners. Usually stuck at a certain range.

And then I install like the closer infrastructure and all that stuff. If I wanted to explore that and make that the 100%, how would I deal with my existing 40 guys who got in at a B2C offer, who have this like expectation that I could like help them? The B2C offer is what?

A make money, like a generic how to start an agency offer? Yeah. Yeah, I would get rid of those.

Yeah. Well, the same thing with this way, just like, again, LTV to CAC, like how much does it cost to acquire them? How much, like when people are trying to decide between avatars, which by the way, the concern you have is that probably the number one most common concern that people have in business.

It's also one of the biggest leverage points that you can have is picking the right avatar. So you're in this overarching space of agency. But if you like almost always, when you go up market, you make more money.

Almost always. And so when you deal with somebody who's a higher quality prospect, they pay more, they're lower maintenance because they already have more skills coming into it. And so forth.

Right. And so if you just look at, because I had a hair salon lady asked me this question. So she was like, I have, I'm getting 17 to one, um, or sorry, 24 to one, uh, selling, um, hairstylists on my extension technique.

So she had some extension technique that was like extensions are like two grand. And if you, and she had a technique to do it in like 30 minutes. So they could make a ton of money in a very short period of time.

And she's like, and I have business consulting or coaching or whatever, which has like 11 to one, um, LTV to CAC. And she was like, so should I focus on like my business coaching offer? Or should I just sell this hair extension?

Just like teaching how to do hair extensions, which is not really a business offer at all. It's just like how to, it's like a hair thing. Right.

And so I just boiled it down to LTV to CAC times TAM. So it's like, if you have crazy LTV to CAC and you have a massive market, which she did, there's way more hairstylists who don't want business coaching and just want to learn more about hair. So it's like, you have both more customers and a bigger discrepancy between what it costs you and what you make.

And so then the only thing is just N. And if there is a massive market, then you can crank N as in the number of units sold by a ton. And so I was like, and from there you can cross out the coaching thing if you want to, the business consulting, but stop running two front ends, focus on this one that you have the greatest arbitrage on, smash the shit out of that.

And then all your focus becomes on Ascension and cross out. That makes sense. So for you, I would probably like, you're going to have to sunset the 40 guys over time.

If you are better at delivering a result, like go where the value is, as in whoever you can help the absolute most is who I think you should sell to. So if you're like, I have three different people I help. It's like, well, which of them, like this happens in, um, I had a lady who had a tile business.

So she sold tiles, like a very generic business. She's like, I sell to homeowners. I sell to, uh, designers, interior designers, and I sell to home builders, three completely separate avatars.

And I was like, okay, which one's worth the most to you? She's like, well, home builders are pretty much just only care about price. I was like, okay, well then maybe you don't sell to them.

Interior designers. She was like, these people, um, they're, they bring me customers all the time. Like they come with their, the person they're doing the living room for or whatever.

And then the rest, you know, the people who just own homes is like, they're, you know, they're kind of like one-off sales, but they have the most margin. I was like, okay. I was like, which one do you like doing the most?

She's like the interior designers. I was like, how many people does an interior designer bring you on average per year? She's like 30.

I was like, okay. So she was calculating it at a transactional level rather than at the resident, at the interior designer level. It's like, so how much does it cost you to get in?

I was like, how do you get an interior designer? She's like, I do outreach for a week once a month and I get like three to five more interior designers who come in. I walk the facility and then I share them what we do.

Um, and this, I mean, this business was doing 7.6 million top line and like 5 million in EBITDA murdering it. Um, and so I was like, cool. So you now are the, the interior designer is now your avatar.

So you need to become the interior designer to you, but you need to make their life amazing. Don't sell to home builders. Don't sell to home homeowners, just interior designers that are people that you've got on your roster.

And then all you do is you go from having 30 interior designers that send you business all the time to 300 and that's it. And there's 300 interior designers in every city. And so all she has to do is she already had a way to acquire them.

I was like, forget everything else. So it's like, you want to just like stake through that. And a lot of times that's where this massive unlock happens in businesses.

Like most businesses go through this because you start throwing stuff on the wall. You start selling stuff. You start looking at the customers you have.

And then you're like, huh, I'm really good at these people. I suck at these people. These ones are okay.

And then you start making your delivery. You make a decision strategically to say no to this money. And this is where people can't do it.

This is why everyone fails. They can't say no to money. So you have to say no.

So when the 41st person comes on the phone with you and it's like, hey, dude, I like really need this. Like, I'd love to have a way to, you know, make money online or whatever. You're like, you should just watch most of these videos for free and then start a business.

And when you have a business, call me. Okay. Okay.

So like, I know my, I mean, what I'm, what I'm best at is the acquisition, fulfillment, and then the operations of existing agencies. Like my two best clients. Give your course away for the money people.

Give it away for free. Okay. Give it away for free.

It'll be, and then you'll be like, look, I've had 40 people pay me whatever they sold, you know, you paid. It's like, and I just want to over deliver in value and I'll give it to you for free. And so use it.

Cause I really just want to work better with agency owners because the zero to one stuff, you can just, just do it. Just do the work. It's not that hard.

Once like that way you can self-prove that you're legit. And then I will tell, help you scale it from that. And then like tangible items, like actually sunset them.

Like, what does that even look like? How long was the sale for the 40? How long did you sell them for?

It was the duration. It was like, uh, I was starting off. It was like an inner circle, just like six K like lifetime.

Right. So this is the problem with lifetime deals. Yeah.

You have a one-time, one-time income with a forever delivery. Um, like, right. So the, the real, real, the ethical way to do it.

Refund. I think pull the rug refund. So if I make the decision, just hard conversation, refund, integrity, restore.

That's going to suck. But okay. How many of them are there?

What's up? How many? 40.

I am. Send them to someone else. Maybe.

That way. Are they still, how long has it been? It's been like two months.

Oh, okay. I mean, I would like, this is the, like, this is the tough part, you know? Like you either, I mean, the alternative is you, but like the thing, the thing I don't like, because if you had said it's a 12 week program, then I would have been like, fine, live it out.

Like finish it out. But you're like lifetime, you're just going to have these people forever. You're going to have two months in.

Yeah. Yeah. Because that's at least going to be 12 months.

You got 10 months. Yeah. So you got to trade off.

Like you could probably get away with it if it had been a year. Yeah. But you were only just starting.

Yeah. To go all in on school. I had to ref, I had a calculation of how many of my mastermind members I had to refund.

I had to refund $2 million to go all in on school. That was losing 700 grand a month. How about that?

Did he say losing? Yeah. Losing.

Yeah. I refunded $2 million to focus on something that was losing 700 grand a month. Dang.

Why? Why? I don't know.

Nah, it's worth it. Like if you do all the math, it was a no brainer. Yeah.

Balls of steel. Yeah, it's just if you want to just play in the big league. I mean, these are mistakes.

Like people make mistakes in the beginning. Lifetime is easy to sell, but it's because you don't think about ramifications. But saying no to money is always what is the biggest thing that makes you like that.

After I did that, I had a massive jump because I could focus on school. Right? Right.

And, you know, people offer me like a lot of money too to go and like speak at an event, probably nowhere near as much as Hormozy, but 100 grand in first class flights. You just say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Then you don't even bother saying no.

You just don't even reply. Yeah. And that, if you don't have the discipline to do that, then you'll get pulled in a million directions.

Also, when you feel that sting of the 240 grand you have to give back, it'll help you say no to everything else. Because you're like, I just refunded all these people. I'm definitely not going to mess that up now.

Like, I just spent all this money to get this attention back. Like, why would I mess it up? Yeah, it does something too for your like personal power or something.

Oh, yeah. When you say no to money. You don't need it.

Yeah. You're like, you show, it does something to you. It gives you some kind of power.

There's no better feeling than turning money down. I mean, making money is also pretty good. But.

Especially with clients you don't like anymore. Yeah, right. I would prefer to never see you again.

Here's your money. Yeah. Really.

I got like a little taste of it because I was like, I'm like the gatekeeper, the main closer. So if I didn't think I could coach the guy, I'd be like, no. But refunding is a whole different kind of thing right there.

Yeah. Totally. But you'll feel super convicted.

And when you get on the phone with people, you'll be like, this is for agency owners. And I'll help you scale or whatever, you know, whatever you're good at. And if you're not, then you're like, that's why I have this thing.

I used to sell it. I'll just give it to you, man. Just follow the steps.

Realistically, though, you're probably not going to do it. So at least this way you can save your eight grand, which I probably could have sold you. It's a big conviction.

That's sick. Sweet. I have the same thought as him because I have a program called Start and then Scale.

Sell to the scale people if you're better at them and you like them better and they're worth more. 100%. I did have a question.

If it's better offline, that's cool. How do you, for instance, like somebody joins at 30, gets to 200. How do you market that testimonial without a financial claim?

So how can I actively share these stories? So getting into the like nitty gritty with FTC is beyond my scope. But for the most part, it comes down to timelines.

That's the thing that like most of these platforms hate. It's like X in Y time. But if you just say X.

I thought about this quite a bit. Yeah. And I've noticed that the only people that ever get in trouble, they did way worse shit than make a claim.

Right? Because I know the people that got into trouble and I know what was going on. And I'll tell you how it happens every single time.

Yeah. It's they don't give refunds. Yeah.

Their disputes go up. They piss so many people off that enough complain to the Attorney General that eventually so many complaints go to the Attorney General that they investigate them. And then they find everything like the first thing to go is always you get kicked off of Stripe.

Yeah. That's like the canary in the coal mine. No one that doesn't get kicked off Stripe, they never get in trouble, even if they're making wild claims on ads.

But then when these people get pinged, they've got to like say, oh, everyone's doing it. Everyone's breaking the rules because they're trying to show like that they're not a criminal. Yeah, we just crossed, we just stepped on this little rock.

The refunds thing is bar none for sure. Like I, there was a guy, I'm sure we both know him, but who, who got dinged by the FTC. Ding's a very nice way of saying it.

And I knew for, like, I, I, I was in a room like this because I was, I was in the back room and he was speaking at the same thing as me. So like kind of funny. And he was like, how do you guys like stop all these chargebacks?

And I was, I was like, what? He was like, yeah, all these people, like they're just, these assholes are charging back. And I was like, well, I mean, I was like, we don't have, we just refund people if they ask for it.

He's like, oh no, we don't do refunds. I was like, I mean, at all? He's like, we say no refunds.

I was like, but you, you, you actually don't give any refunds. He was like, oh no. I also, I mean, Sam said this, I think like three ago.

And I just love this. It's like, you don't want to become someone's project. Like you don't want someone waking up thinking like, how can I destroy shark today?

Like, how can I ruin this guy's life? Cause, cause that six grand was the last six grand he had. And it meant a hell of a lot more to him than it does to you.

So just give it, it means more to him. Just go get another customer. Bro, it's always worth it.

You just give them money back. And they come back too. Like we noticed that they, a lot of people come back when you didn't make a big deal about it.

Or they'll buy something else. Yeah. Cause you know what it's like yourself.

You buy something, you ask for a refund. You're like, how's hard this going to be? And if it's easy, you're like, damn, I'm, I like this company.

Right. Yup. So planet fitness, believe it or not, I obviously a fitness example.

Cause I know a lot of the big businesses there, but planet fitness figured this out, which is, so you might not know this, but a planet fitness to make money has to have 10,000 members. Like a brick and mortar has to have 10,000 members to make money and they still crank. And they can do that in a market that only has 50,000 people in total, which is insane to think about, but they don't have like zero churn.

They have like 5% monthly churn, which is, you're like, wait a second, how would you do that? They cycle through the entire town over and over and over again. And so what they figured out was rather than being like the dicks on the way out, they said, they call it the friendly goodbye.

And so it's like, they, they're like, oh, you want to cancel? No problem, Steve. No worries.

Let us know when you're, you know, you want to come back. Like we'll, we'll get you going. Like very friendly on the exit.

And so then Steve, when he like gets the next gig or gets to the next job or he feels fat again or whatever it is, he signs back up cause it was no big deal. Also crazy how many people don't actually use the membership. They like pay for it and then don't.

92% don't use the membership. Yeah. It's the only, it's the only way the business model works.

If they did, they'd have to charge $200 a month. Yeah. It wouldn't be room.

Yeah. I mean, the reason micro gyms are priced that way is because people use the membership. It's the same script.

So like, like the worst thing that, and so like, I mean, I could talk about Planness Fitness, but I'll stop. How would you choose between the friendly goodbye? And then the one that he mentioned where it's like, if you leave, you have to pay the entry fee to come back.

Those are different. One is a refund. One is like someone trying to cancel, which I see as separate things.

One saying, Hey, I want to cancel your service. One is like, I paid you. Please give me my money back.

It's not very friendly to say you can't come back ever again. And that's also not really true. I think because someone can just make another account.

How are you going to know? Well, for high ticket, I can imagine, but like, I just, whatever. I mean, I've all the people that I know who have done it and don't have good communities.

It does nothing. If you have a great community, then it matters. But then does it matter at all?

Because the great community is the reason that it happened. So TLDR, I don't know if the tactic does anything. Remember, I had this on a way smaller scale.

It was like my second close, like 10K. I was all excited. And he's on the coaching call and he just wouldn't knock on doors.

He said he tried it for 30 minutes. Because one thing he teaches door-to-door marketing to book jobs. So I was really hesitant on what to do.

And I just, he just bring down the energy. So I let him out of the group, I refunded him. And then I posted my free Facebook group.

Hey, I had a client, wasn't really ready to knock on doors. You know, if any of you guys are actually willing to do this, we have a spot open. And it brought my ideal clients.

I actually booked close four off that post. You're like, and every week you're like, I had a spot open up. Yeah.

Yeah, I mean, tell the truth. Yeah. I got one question about like, I've heard you guys talk about like off-boarding interviews or like, you know, like taking, you know, somebody wants to, you know, wants to cancel their membership or wants a refund.

You're like, yeah, for sure. Just do an interview, right? Is there any way we could maybe get that going on in school?

Like whenever somebody churns, like obviously like it's hard to get them on the phone, right? You know, at that point. But I'd love to like figure out maybe that at some point.

Like, oh yeah, you want to cancel? Cool. Press this button.

Schedule an appointment after we talk. I think they have to be able to cancel easily, but I think, yeah, they have to be able to cancel easily. But I think you could encourage them to take a call after the cancellation, try and resell them.

Could we do a Zapier integration for the cancellation? We were just thinking an auto DM would probably be the best. Auto DM.

Yeah. I've noticed the Zapier integration. The Zapier integration feature on school is amazing, by the way.

But we started doing this in one of our communities where people join and we immediately send them like a welcome call. And then we just like immediately upsell them. It does really well.

Are the new customers it? Yeah. Oh, yeah.

That crushes just for everybody, by the way. If you let people come in and just give them an onboarding call, it's just, I mean, think about what an onboarding call really is. It's like, what are your goals?

What have you struggled with? Where are you at currently? What do you, like, why haven't you succeeded so far?

Oh, I think we might have some things for you. It's just like, it just lends itself naturally to a sales call. And you can do it in auto DM as well.

If you have a strong referral offer, you can put it into auto DM when they join. And like, who else do you know, you'll get this if you refer somebody so that, you know, you set it up once and you can have literally like extra 10% for free. If you have a strong referral offer.

And once they affiliate things, it'll be even more. Just going back on that single stream or what you're good at. One thing we have is we have that physical academy.

So what I was, one of my questions earlier was about how would you integrate school platform into the physical? You know, just random thoughts. But then because I think our school academy has done by far, you know, mostly better than physical.

What are your thoughts on integrating, ditching? I mean, I think the in-person members joining. I mean, you could, if you want to give a gift to the in-person members, you could actually, I don't know if they can have a different membership.

So no, they probably just join like anybody else would. And it would just be a benefit to them to because they know you in person. Is the digital already making more money?

Yeah. Yeah. The paid academy.

Then I'll do it kind of like how we're doing this and school HQ. So we've got Hormozzi's HQ. We've got school HQ.

For the power users in the online world, we bring it offline and we let them come in like this. And that can produce content back for the like online. So you use it as a reward.

Yeah. Yeah. You can either, like you can charge for it or you can use it as a reward for like what we do here.

We're not charged for it, but it's a reward. But you absolutely, like as a side note, if you wanted to make even like, if you wanted the in-person to generate more money and leverage to kind of like both together, give them an offer to have a weekend with you. I mean, like when I had the, it's not, it's martial arts, right?

Yeah. So I would do like weekend workshops where I'd be like, we're going to do a deadlift, you know, we're going to do the big three lifts for powerlifting this weekend. So anybody who wants to come to that, cool.

I do like big booty bootcamp for girls and they always want to, I teach them like eight different like moves for butt stuff because they always want to know butt stuff. I would do, I would basically just bring in specialists for stuff and then I would either, then I would just market it to my community and say that they could pay, you know, grand or two grand or something for the, for the weekend. I mean, you'll know the price point better than me, but probably, I mean, you could probably get away with between 300 and $2,000 in terms of two days for them to come in and you spend two days with them and you get a ton of footage.

You literally make money for it. You can get ads for your local gym. You can get ads for online all from that one event.

I actually think it's a huge advantage that you have the in-person component because you can do stuff that no one else can do. Level seven in school community is visit school HQ, the prize. Like once you get to level seven in school community, you get to visit school HQ.

That's cool. And then in the games, it's get in the top 10 and you get to come to a Moses HQ. It's the best prize on both leaderboards.

It creates this, because in the digital world, everything seems kind of fake. So if there's some HQ that people get to visit and you start to see photos of this place, it gives people like something they can visualize. Like I can eventually go there.

Right. And it works really well and you can use it in your marketing and all of this. I can guarantee you that if you make a post in your community saying that you're doing a workshop that you're limiting to 30 people.

How many people do you have in your community? Free ones? Well, the paid one.

Paid one. 3.30. Yeah.

So, I mean, you could do it on the free one if you wanted to, because then you could just sell them at the event if you felt like it. But I think it makes more sense to do it to the paid one and just do a higher ticket thing from the paid. And so if you have 230, that's perfect.

So that'll probably, you'll probably get like 30-ish people who'd be willing to do it. And so do you 30, you know, between 300, maybe, I mean, it's meditation system, maybe like 300 to a grand probably feels about right. You can pick the price.

You can start low on the first one and then move it up if you want to. If it's like, people are like, that was amazing, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, you can just do that like once a quarter.

So every 12 weeks or so. And just like that, you can pop an extra like 80 or 100 grand a year in. Like, and, but like, you're not just doing it for money.

You get all the other stuff. And like, you can do it for money. It's like, but like 90 grand a year.

You can charge your spouse. Just like, I have to buy it for 10 a year. And I can go back to sos volver.

I can'tTTK R. I caneld you every Friday. I can의를.

I can talk in my backpack. But like running, I can tell people, you know, you know, you can do it right now. So keeping the time right now as well.

So I'm not sure that I'm here. I don't know. I can tell them all the time right now.

So keeping that in the方 and right now, we'll Kyoki is like 2K 29.
