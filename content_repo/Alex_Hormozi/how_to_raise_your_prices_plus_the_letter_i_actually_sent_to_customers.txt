What's going on everyone in this video I'm gonna show you how to raise your prices in a tactical way on your existing customers. So it's one thing to raise your prices on new customers which for many times you know that's something that you have to do because you need to you know you want to reinvest in making the business better you want to cover some capital expenses or you just want to make more money which is fine and the number one lever on making money is what you're pricing at right. We've done this in thousands of businesses now and there's a process that we go about this because if you raise it on existing customers be ready to have people be upset but here's why this is so important so let's say that your business runs at a 20% net margin which is fine right let's say that you just for numbers sake you charge $100 a month if you're running a 20% net margin and you're at $100 a month a 20% increase in pricing would double your profit a 50% increase in pricing with three and a half X your profit that's pretty good if you doubled your price you would 6x how much money you make and so this is how big of a lever pricing is on how much profit you make and so knowing how to raise your prices obviously would be something that would be very important so there is a right way and a wrong way to do it so what I want to do is show you the right way because the wrong way to do is send an email out saying hey we're raising our prices you know screw you and you'll get a ton of customers who leave you and then you'll end up being worse off than you were before but I did this in my facility this is one of my first businesses and I actually had a third of my customers cancel but I tripled my price and so I was able to keep two-thirds of my customers at three times the price and lose one-third of my biggest my employees called it the culling we got rid of all the problem customers in one fell swoop so if you have a pain a bunch of customers were always complain about stuff you might want to do this because you'll get rid of all the cancerous people and keep only the people who love you and when I did that I doubled my revenue and here's what's even cooler my profit went through the roof because I even had to service a third fewer customers which is awesome all right and so the way that we do this is through a price increase letter and if you're curious my gym lunch secret book is a book that is about gyms but is a business book that is simply applied to gyms if you want it you can grab it is not how I make money but let's say let's let's walk through this so you have your letter to increase prices right now there's a format to doing this all right now it's not about you it's about the prospect is about the consumer all right so the first thing that we want to do right is you know we're gonna say hey you've probably known that we've been you know growing a lot you've probably noticed a lot of the the good things that are going on right now and so that's why I'm writing this letter all right so it's like why am I doing this why am I writing this letter to you what's the intention the letter all right the second is we're gonna talk about what we currently are doing all right and so this is allowing you to re resell them a little bit on what you're currently doing the value you're currently providing them because sometimes they forget because they might only use one aspect of your service and so if they're like oh wow there's a lot of extra stuff that I didn't even know about and believe me I can't even tell you the amount of times people read this letter they're like I didn't even know you were doing all this stuff right and so you want to list out you know the stuff that you're doing and say okay you know we hire and retain the best talent you know we have we offer continued education for our employees we you know we were providing new softwares and equipment to our members that that we always try and keep up to date that's what we're currently doing though I didn't even think about that so the goal here is to is to get them to think about your costs try and get them into the mind of you as an entrepreneur to the best of your you know ability right like these are the things that we incur in order to provide this value it's not like we're just taking all the money you give us and putting it in our pockets because that's what everyone always thinks all right the next thing we do is we say wow despite all this stuff that we're doing we want to do even more because we're losing our minds because we just provide crazy value all right and so it's like we want to let you know we're currently a ragtag bunch of champions our facility if you have an actual facility and if you're online it's like you know we've got a lot of stuff that's duct taped together we want to really you know level up the brand and we want to do it for you right so you want to tell them what's coming so this is like we want to add these X Y & Z things we want to add specialty programs we can add higher levels of service we want to add you know events to our to our business we want to add all these things right a massive improvement to our level of service these are all things that we want to be adding right and then what I like to do is I like to tie this tie this increase to a promise of values okay now what I mean by that is I want to tie this to values that I ascribe to that no one can contest so I can say I have made this promise to you and with integrity I can no longer provide the level of service that I have promised unless we do these things because I will not stand here in this marketplace and say that we are the best at XYZ unless we do these things and the only way for me to do these things is for us to have a corresponding increase in price all right now mind you when you're communicating the price it's also important to communicate the price in a way that's you know attractive so you don't say hey it's gonna cost you five thousand dollars extra a year you would say it'd be better to say it's gonna cost you an extra hundred bucks a week right sounds like a lot less right you can break down even more it's it's 15 bucks a day it depends on you know who we're talking to and what level of service you have but you can break it down to weekly or break it down to daily and that's why insurance quotes people in days it's only a dollar a day right so that you can do this in it and it will minimize what the perceived cost is so ideally you want to maximize by saying this is all the stuff we're doing that we you didn't even know about this is the stuff we want to do that's even more than that and this is how little it's gonna cost you and the reason we must do this is so that I can maintain my integrity to you and the promise that I made you I am fervent that this is something I'm planning my flag here is that I demand to be the best in the marketplace and for us to do this we must continually invest and for us to do that if like this is what is required right and then and here's what's cool is that I like to add a little PS at the end and that little PS is to give perspective all right and what I do here is I say if this is going to materially affect your life if you're not gonna be able to pay your mortgage you're not gonna be able to buy groceries for your kids please reach out to me and we can figure something out and so by saying that you automatically perspective to everyone that listen no one's gonna go homeless over this thing right no one's gonna lose their house because we're raising the price of our XYZ right right but we open the door for discussion for the people who feel obligated or feel the need to do this now if you make an announcement like this which I recommend you doing via video and be a direct mail you want to make it and then also turn the comments off on whatever the post is because believe me you don't want to deal with that as you say hey I don't want this to be you know a gossip forum if you have anything just bring it to me directly out of respect for you I want to deal with these you know face-to-face and not over the keyboard right and so it's an easier way to also manage and mitigate any kind of negativity that happens and believe me if you raise your prices you're going to have people are gonna be squeaky wheels and it's in their best interest to get you to not raise the prices so just don't chicken out once you commit to it stick with it all right because I'm telling you if you raise your price like I just told you if you have a 25% margin and you raise your price by 25% you double your profit all right so I told you I lost a third of my customers that's because I tripled my price and most businesses don't realize how much of a pain it is to find another one of your business and so if you can capitalize on that you can usually eek out an increase in in revenue and profit as a result you will be far out rewarded by making that change and the people who do leave are usually your worst customers and you've been wanting to get rid of them anyways and this gives you a great time to do it so if you're gonna raise your prices this is the way that I do it to existing customers I write a letter I tell them you know why I'm set I'm setting the stage for why we're doing this I tell them all the things that we're currently doing that they don't know that we're doing and you probably do tons of stuff it's good a list of stuff out then you tell them about the future of what's going to happen what the benefits are going to be to them to what they're about to enjoy and how that's going to impact them in a real way in every single time they see you they experience your business they interact with you and what benefit of the benefit is going to occur and then finally I like to end with values and perspective alright so probably values are right here do so values is kind of the wrap-up so just consider that 3.5 sorry 3.5 right and then you have your wrap-up which is hey big picture this isn't gonna make your break you you're not gonna go homeless because of this but if you do have something that's going to materially affect you because you have that anchor it makes it very easy for you to have that discussion right and so if you have to raise your prices this is how I recommend doing it I actually have the exact letter that we send out for for gyms in my book if you want to grab it you can I promise you it's not how I make my dollars but you can get that alexesbook.com if you're curious otherwise keep being amazing keep being awesome I made this channel so that a lot of people are broke and I don't want you to be one of them so that's why I made this so keep being awesome I'll see you guys on the flip side bye
