Mosey Nation, two days ago I was speaking with some business owners that approached me about becoming portfolio companies in acquisition.com and I want to talk to you about how that conversation went and I want to give you one of the most useful frameworks that I use in analyzing a business that you can use today to analyze your own business and instantly 2-3 exit which is exactly what I do when I'm looking at the portfolio companies that we're considering investing in. The beautiful thing about this equation and as you develop as an entrepreneur at least as I have and just so you if you guys don't know who I am my name is Alex Mosey on acquisition.com our portfolio companies do about 85 million dollars a year and so the reason I make this channel is because a lot of people are broke and I don't want you to be one of them and Mosey Nation is not going to be one of them. Everyone needs if you are good at something you need tools all right this equation is one of those tools that you have as an entrepreneur if you have to rely on your your systems if you have to rely on finance to get you the reports to get to make general directional decisions then you're going to be weak as an entrepreneur because you have to be able to to do these calculations in your head back of napkin all right and so I want to show you the most valuable equation that I use in analyzing my own businesses and potential portfolio companies and it requires five variables and I'm going to show you what they are and then I'm going to show you how I got the two hardest numbers that most people don't know how to get within their business all right so I can even give you the sixth number which will be a bonus one number one is going to be number of new sales per month most people know this number the next one is current revenue so that's most people also know this number the next number is price most people know this number the next number is going to be churn most people do not know this number the next number is going to be lifetime value most people do not know this number the next number is gross profit all right so I'm going to show you how in a simple conversation we can figure out all of these things and extrapolate where a business is going to cap out where the weak points are and how we can see what the size of the opportunity all right so I'm going to give you a hypothetical example that I just had I was talking to a business they were doing a hundred new sales per month all right so that's number one I said cool what are you guys doing in revenue right now they were doing uh 400k in revenue I said okay this is really important you will want to pay attention to this video they had 380 clients all right their current price was a thousand dollars per month churn they didn't know lifetime value they didn't know all right so I said okay well the first thing we have to do is figure out where your hypothetical max is going to be all right so if we know the current number of new sales because they're like well I I have to get you these numbers later I don't have them on me I was like if you know these numbers we can do them live together and they were like oh I was like yeah so let's walk through it okay a thousand dollars a month is the price right and I said okay well how many customers are canceling every week and they said 13 people per week were canceling I was like okay so roughly 50 per month okay makes sense everyone good here they said they have 380 active clients what we do is to take 380 active clients we divide it by 50 oops sorry 50 uh 50 people canceling divided by 380 active clients I already did the math for you it's 13 churn all right so now we take our price all right which is a thousand dollars per client per month we divide it by that 13 churn and we get 7700 bucks all right roughly so now I know that 7700 is going to be the LTV per customer all right which means that this business is going to cap out a 770k per month all right which is about 9 million bucks a year now they were currently doing about 400k now the thing is there's a lot of business and they were growing really rapidly right and it makes sense because they were because they had this kind of sales velocity so with this kind of sales velocity they're going to keep growing pretty quickly and then it's going to become an asymptote which looks like this all right so an asymptote is you have a hypothetical max and it and it approaches it but never gets there all right so the asymptote here will be 770k the thing is is that the growth rate would slow down because churn is going to start eating a bigger and bigger and bigger percentage of the new business that is coming in we know the current clients we knew the new sales we know the current revenue right we know the hypothetical max which for me helps me analyze the potential opportunity of this business right we know the churn now which is 13 we know the lifetime value of each customer now which is 7700 and I asked them what kind of margins are we running um on this and they were running over 90 gross margins all right and the easy way to do that is how much does it cost to to fulfill a customer so for them for that thousand dollar a month customer it costs them less than a hundred dollars uh to fulfill on all right so it was very very very low cost business which means all you do is you multiply this by 0.9 and then you get let's see here let's see if I can do my own math really quickly all right so now you get roughly let's say seven thousand dollars okay so the lifetime gross profit per customer is seven thousand dollars which means as long as we're spending less than seven thousand dollars to acquire a customer we are going to be a profitable business right for the most part when we had this little discussion all right let's go back to our little drawing we know that they're going to cap right at seventy seven hundred k right whatever you got i'm saying here right so if we want to grow this business we either have to increase this one we have to increase this one that's it you can only grow business by getting more customers or making them worth more period that's all we have to do and within this particular business i saw the opportunity here because i saw 13 churn right because check out how this goes if we can just cut the churn to let's say three percent ah let's do some cool math you want to see something really quick sure alex i want to see all right fine i'll show you so if we've changed this to just three percent churn all right the new ltv becomes thirty three thousand dollars per customer now this misses all of a sudden without changing anything else becomes a 3.3 million dollar per month business that will become the new hypothetical hypothetical cap and almost all of that would be margin ah much more interesting right what most people do is they say hey i want to take this thing and see how we can get it to uh you know a thousand right which would be you know awesome because then that would get us to 7.7 million per month but which of these do you think is easier to do 10x in the acquisition or simply dropping your turn from 13 to 3 and there's lots of ways to drop churn and i had a different video or said how i cracked netflix recurring revenue model there's eight c's to d to increase your stick or decrease your churn whatever way you want to say it that we'd be going through to figure out how we can cut churn from 13 to 3 and fyi for a company to have enterprise value most private equity firms want to see 80 percent yearly retention meaning you keep you keep 80 percent of your clients per year so if you start at a thousand beginning of the year you have 800 at the end of the year all right now if anyone wants to venture a guess at what 13 percent your monthly turn looks like you're probably keeping less than 20 percent of your customers by the end of the year all right and so for them they don't think that's an enterprise that's very valuable because what they're looking at um just in case i'll give you guys a little nugget here all right there's three main variables that they're going to be looking at any kind of any kind of potential buyer which is what's the growth number one number two is how likely uh stickiness which is like how likely is the the business going to be here and then what's the profit right so you could pretty much multiply these things together which is if i have a super fast growth company all of the revenue is super sticky and we're very profitable then this is going to be a very very very valuable business if i have a a business that uh is mediumly growing right it is not sticky and i have low profit then this is going to be a low value business and so the objective for us at acquisition.com is how do we take one of these guys right one of these businesses and turn them into one of these businesses and so it's really looking at these fundamental metrics to figure out where the weak points in the business model exist all right so right now if you're a business owner and you don't know what your hypothetical max is with your current model and your current numbers you are fooling yourself you don't know where you're going to cap out which means you don't know where your weak points are all right and so right now everyone should be able to do this math within their own business without any kind of complex recording without any kind of you know excel sheets that you're getting sent from finance all you need to do is you got to know how many new customers you're getting which is this guy how many new sales you're getting how many current clients you have where your current revenue is right what your prices are you should know all that stuff and as long as you can know how many people are canceling every month then you can calculate the rest of this entire equation for yourself and figure out how you can de-bottleneck the growth of your business because i'm a big believer in the theory of constraints which is a business will grow up to its nearest constraint and so all i try and do is simply remove the constraints of the business to allow it to grow right i see businesses organic beings they want to grow and they're simply being constrained by something and our goal is to find what the biggest constraint is and remove it most people try and do lots of things i believe that the smartest people in the world try and find how to do the fewest things that get them the most returns and removing the biggest constraint is the biggest one of those anywho my friends this is
