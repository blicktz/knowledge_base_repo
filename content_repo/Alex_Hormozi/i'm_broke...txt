What is going on everyone? Today we're going to talk about a fun topic which is I got a message yesterday from somebody who said you know who's dead broke and was like what do I do all that kind of stuff and so I think I've talked in the past I'll probably do another one about when I when I've lost everything what I did step by step to I think that after I lost everything the next month I did $110,000 in sales and now sorry not sales I was cash collected in the next in the next 30 days so like you absolutely just need skills you can have nothing else in your life and a beautiful thing is that no government can take it from you no person can take your skills from you in a divorce those are always your own which is something that I don't know for some reason feels magical to me and so one of the things that I've seen as I've kind of you know moved moved up I'm not saying that arrogantly just you know just developed progressed whatever is that the people who I surround myself with now have more money than the people that I surround myself when I was earlier in my career and what's ironic is that these people actually spend less money they they have they have less desire to spend money and they find ways to acquire things for less money out of pocket and that's always really interesting to me and so right now I think there's you know if you were to if you were to look at quote investment opportunities right you could you could you know invest in buying a house so let's say let's say you've got I'll do two scenarios all right let's say you've got fifty thousand dollars all right and you're like okay I'm thinking about buying a house right and I think for first house you might only have to put ten percent down I'm not sure it's ten or twenty yeah I remember but anyways let's just say ten for for sake of whatever so five hundred thousand dollar house all right you put ten percent down and then you get the mortgage right you get the liability of the mortgage payment every month you be now if you were to if you were to and let's say that in order for you to save that you've been making I don't know sixty grand a year and you've been saving that for you know five years something like that now let's look at an alternative scenario where you are still making that same amount of money sixty and you saved up fifty and instead of buying a house you have a long conversation with your spouse and you say or maybe you don't have a spouse whatever with yourself and you say I wonder how much money I could get for this money ah interesting right and so you've you you leaf through the businesses that are in your area and by the way the best way to do that is one you should contact brokers not necessarily to buy a business but to get an idea of some of the businesses that are in the area and what price ranges look like but if you buy from a broker you're gonna pay retail you could definitely negotiate a deal and I'll tell you one of the deals that I did that was really good at the end of this but anyways so let's say you you know you reach out to some businesses things that you like or enjoy or feel like you have some specialized knowledge in and you find out that there's a business that's doing let's say I don't know two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year in in profit right and because it's a small local owned business and you're not gonna pay retail for it you get it for two and a half you know times earnings right which would be which two and a half times it's 525 hopefully I think two and a half no that's 625 excuse me $625,000 is what a business you might pay for businesses doing $250,000 a year in profit all right now here's where it here's where it's interesting right so I had an early mentor who taught me this negotiation tactic that I've used pretty much for throughout my entire life since this moment and I used it in the deal that I'll tell you about in a second which is agree on price then agree on terms right and so when you when you would go to quote talk to this business right there's there's the price which you might say cool you know this business 625 and then there's terms right and so the term side once you've agreed on the price you negotiate down whatever and then you say okay well I'm gonna need you to sell our finance meaning you're not gonna pay anything you're paying over time right I need you to sell our finance you know three-quarters of the deal all right and so three-quarters of the deal man I'm doing some math today but like four hundred and you know thirty ish four thirty seven whatever thousand dollars and you're gonna finance that for you know three years right and then on top of that or five years you know you can do whatever you want here I think I mean you could probably I mean you try and push it out as far as you can right and then what you have remaining which would be like in this instance two hundred thousand dollars then you get a note from the bank right or SBA loan which you have a two hundred thousand dollar loan for it and you put your your fifty thousand dollars down right so then that would be two hundred so you put 50 which would be 25% of two hundred thousand so I'm gonna recap this 625 is the cost of the business you know 437 you get seller finance meaning you can pay that over time and then you've got two hundred thousand dollars that you get a loan from the bank so which you put fifty thousand dollars for so if you're thinking about this the guy who's selling the business he sells for 625 but he's only getting two hundred thousand upfront you're only putting 50 of that 200 and you're taking a loan for the rest of it right and so when you're looking at this you've now acquired this business that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year right so you upgraded your income from 60 to 250 thousand right and within you know 24 months all of that you know income will be yours and maybe hopefully you'll grow it or you'll probably try and work extra hard and take over some of the some of the other positions or to cut out some of the waste etc in the business and and and so that massively speeds you up in life right and if you compare that to what it would cost you to start your own business in terms of investment and like existing book of business client lists all the knickknacks you have to buy that you don't even think of zoning permits and all the fees and licenses it's actually pretty decent deal so I'll tell you one of the deals that I did that was pretty good so I had four locations at this point this is when I had the gyms and I opened a fifth location so the first two locations I opened I opened the first one I think for forty thousand dollars I mean I put I didn't I put as little as I possibly could in this thing and it happened to have been an old gym so there was like turf already in the flooring was already in it was painted like there was a bunch of things I didn't have to pay for so I lucked out there and but the second one because I thought I was smarter I put 200 we put 250,000 into the second location and here's the fun thing it made no more money than the first location did which I always think is hilarious so like to the undisciplined everything looks like a spending opportunity it's I pretty much would empty my bank account and and so on my fifth location my next two locations were corporate locations which are actually pretty cheap which is pretty cool those are those are good deals but the the fifth location that I did I had a gym that went out of business or he not out of business he wanted to uproot because his it got divorced or he had some some family crisis and so he was looking for someone to buy his his gym and so it was beautiful it had all this equipment that was really expensive in it and I was like man this is like a dream come true and so I agreed on price because I had my mentor talk me through this I agreed on price which I think was 40,000 I think it was 40 grand it was 40 or 50 I think it was yeah so that's what I agreed and then I was like cool I'll pay you over the next year and he was like fair enough and so I mean he didn't say like that we negotiated and then 12 months is what we what we came to and so I mean I try to go for 24 months but he agreed on 12 and so the beautiful thing with that was I didn't I didn't put any money out of pocket so you know my first year I put 50 grand in second gym I put 250 thousand dollars in fifth gym smarter more experienced me puts no money in right and in the first 30 days we did 51,000 in sales so this gym in the first 30 days literally paid for itself period right and so this thing that is now kicking off profit right every month during this during this whole period of time and then 12 months later I ended up meeting Russell and telling him how I was doing this stuff and he's like you should be teaching other people how to do what you're doing now and so I ended up selling the gym for one and a half times more than I quote bought it for right which I then had the gym pay for it on its own and so I basically acquired a cash flowing asset for nothing and then had just acquired a cash flowing asset for for no money and so I think about that in light of the original thing that I mentioned was just like I get I get people who message me all the time like what if what happens if I don't have any money I don't know what to do you always have to just get skills or this is just my opinion is that because there's no one who can take them from you there's no divorce there's no government there's no revolution there's no financial crisis that can ever take your skills from you and that's why when entrepreneurs hit zero they can usually bounce back I've done it I had eleven hundred dollars my bank account at one point at my at my lowest point after I had six gyms right after this so even though I had this experience and it sounds cool like I messed up and you know that's why I think I love the saying you only should only have to get rich once and and that's why people who are wealthy are more risk averse because the downside risk of losing everything is always bigger right like you can reverse thirty years of great decisions with any number multiplied by zero any number multiplied by zero you can have a billion dollars if you make a bad investment it goes to zero right and so that's why when people are like I don't know why you're motivated and I don't know why they're like it's just there's there's just always things that can happen you know what I mean and so just being risk-averse is what I have noticed from the people who have the most money is that they actually have way lower risk tolerances than the people who have no money which is hilarious because it's like the people who have the least amount of money then go buy lottery tickets which are literally the worst investment you could possibly make and and and they consistently invest their money in a terrible investment that has all the downside risk of going to zero whereas the richest people in the world find things that could never go to zero and they buy them for zero so think about that for a second people are using their money poor people use their money to buy things that have virtually guaranteed you know risk of going to zero right with tiny risk of upside right whereas rich people buy stuff for zero dollars that have upside potential but that doesn't that doesn't have a billion dollar upside potential they would rather have a guaranteed small return with no risk then a potential for huge return with guaranteed risk think about that so anywho I think if over time and it's not like you can shift your perspective on this overnight it took me a long time and I still am doing it now and shifting how like as I still get excited about you know I see these you know these these these cryptocurrencies 20xing and stuff you know in like a month and I'm like man that's crazy but then I also think like well the downside risk of me going to zero is far more upsetting to me than me getting 20 times more on some tiny investment that I would make and so I don't do it right and so anyways I see all this to say agree on price agree on terms try and get something for nothing see if you're gonna if you're gonna make an investment in any kind or you're trying to start a business there's usually a business that's already for sale or has a motivated seller an owner who doesn't want to do it anymore who almost give it to you for free right and that's the thing is when you're new you're getting so excited but you're not patient right that's why you have to have the character traits of being successful before you will see the success because if you if you have that character trait you'll look and you'll say I can take six months because in the in the decade of my in the next decade of my life there's no rush but me making a good deal or a bad deal of like should I put all my investment in this thing or should I be able to get something that makes four times more money for free you can do that you can do that and I'm telling you I talked to business owners every day I mean guys making a million two million four million dollars a year who literally have told me they're like dude if someone came today and offered me like guys who are making a million dollar a million dollars a year in profit like if someone had offered me 200 grand right now I would take it I just am so tired of this business so like there are opportunities they're just not listed anywhere you just got to look for them right and that's the thing no one will do it because it's work so but the good news is that if you have a little bit of work ethic you can make a tremendous amount of money with very little risk and do it the way the rich people that I know do it so otherwise have an amazing day keeping awesome I'll catch you guys on the flip side bye
