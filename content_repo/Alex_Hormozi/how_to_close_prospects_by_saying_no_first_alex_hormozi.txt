to give you a quick and tactical uh training this is one of my favorite stories of all time from selling stuff and this comes from the vaults of richard schwartz and manno swords furriers they're a fourth generation furrier in baltimore and they took over the entire market really the larger like maryland pennsylvania market just simply doing the boring work and being better at the everyday things and so richard schwartz unknowing unbeknownst to him was a a mentor of mine in terms of i just observed a lot of the things that he did in his business and i started doing back of napkin math when i was 17 or 18 and i was like dude this guy kills it um and he was and i probably still is um and uh there was one is i learned so many things from him uh but one of them uh was getting people to say no to say yes all right and so this is a very very real world tactical um tidbit that you can use to close sales now there's a specific type of sale that this really applies to which is uh a lot of times bolt-on or upsells right and these upsells can be incredibly important to the business in terms of driving bottom line profit liquidating acquisition costs and so usually these are sales that are not complex sales these are not necessarily core offer sales these are sales uh you know within the finished world that might be attributed to supplement sales or meal sales or if you were in retail it'd be like getting someone to buy a scarf with the outfit or um just you know anything along those lines you know getting someone to buy orthotics if you're in the in the physical therapy space or if you're in the dental space getting to buy a special kind of extra brace or special toothpaste or whatever or if you're in the beauty space you know night serums that go with your service package whatever it is right the point is is that usually there's going to be you know one or multiple things you're going to want to go with your core offer all right the reason that this this little trick i learned from him is so powerful um is that it closes like crazy all right so if you're used to having like 20 30 of people take upsells that is a normal amount where people take upsells and the reason he gets 90 plus to take his upsells because they don't know they're being sold all right and so here's the trick and here's how it works and i mean you can take this to the bank like it works okay and i'll give you the example uh that they used uh at at manno and so somebody would come in and so every year if you bought a fur coat you would have to store it right and they made they killed it on storage but anyways so people would come in so basically they'd sell someone a car essentially because that's how much a you know fur coat is they sell someone a car and then uh every year they would maintain that customer relationship by getting them to come back in and store their coat uh during the summer because it's not good to you know keep uh really expensive fur in uh you know the heat or whatever right that's at least part of the pinch and so uh they everybody brings their fur in to get stored in condition so they brush them you know and i was one of the guys who was brushing them in the freaking warehouse and like spraying these things down uh it was mind-numbing work but i got to learn a lot while i was there and so anyhow uh we brushed these coats and so one of the one of the things one of the promotions you ran as an incentive was get a free pair of uh fur earmuffs uh when you store your coat for winter or store your coat for summer excuse me and so tons of people would come in because they wanted these true real fur uh earmuffs by bringing it in and so what ended up happening is david his son would uh the person would come in and they'd say i want to i would want to do this and can i get the the fur for emails and so he would show them the fur earmuffs and then say well um you're like what we're going to do is uh store and condition your coat you don't want anything else do you uh and they would say no i don't want anything else but the conditioning was an upset right and it's almost even the way i presented it to you just now it's like well you're going to store your condition your coat but storing code versus storing and doing the brush down and doing the uh the the shampooing of the coat uh is obviously an extra service but it immediately added a couple hundred bucks to every single coat and they were doing thousands of coats right and so anyhow uh the point is is that they would get people to just agree that they don't want anything else okay so think about how you can use this strategy right there's there's there's many ways you can use it but the something else is the easiest that i can ever see right so let's say you say hey like this is what you're gonna uh this is what you need to take uh for this weight loss program right these are the four supplements you need to take now you might have more supplements right and you're like you don't want to buy anything else do you right and then they're going to automatically a lot of times like you don't want to buy any more stuff do you and then they're like no no no i don't want to get anything else right and by doing that you automatically close the sale that you just recommended right and you can do the same thing uh in a different way which should be like um hey uh you don't want to pay full retail for that right and they're going to be like no no no no i don't it's like cool so you want me to send it uh with this discount to the you know the address i have in file and they'll be like okay yeah yeah let's do that right and so by doing that you're getting them to say uh yes by saying no and the thing is is people are so contrary and people always feel like they're being sold that you actually use that psychological like it's subconscious like they can't even think they're not even making the thought process like they're agreeing because they're so pre-programmed to try not to buy things that they end up buying things and so you use that psychological bias to your advantage it's one of the most powerful techniques i have ever seen in sales most people get 20 to 30 uptake on their uh upsells if you use an assume close tactic like this you can literally see 90 plus take rates on this right and so as a to wrap up the story um when uh they give them the earmuffs at the at the furrier they would they would they would say well now that you have those uh you're gonna need to to store those and condition those as well so that'll be you know an extra or whatever and so what ended up happening is that people would get the the free uh the free earmuffs but you'd have to pay to get it stored in conditions which would cover the cost so uh it was just kind of hilarious because what would end up happening is you'd give it to them they'd have it in their hand and be like well you still need to store it because you just bought your coat here and you're not going to keep these out so to be to be congruent with the story of of needing to store the coats they had to wrap it uh right underneath the jacket and they would take both of them into the back and so people would come in they'd get the earmuffs they'd hold on to them and they put them right back on the coat and they say hey you don't want us to do anything else besides you know storing and conditioning do you and they're like no no i don't want anything else like okay cool well let's we'll get that taken care of and then they'd inspect the coat real fast like i want to take care of this button it's kind of loose want us to sew this little seam here and they're like yeah sure do you want anything else do you right no no no and so every time each one of these things they just keep up selling them um but people are so subconsciously uh wired to try and say no to upsells that they would say yes by saying no and so uh you can try and utilize that in your business um i think it works very well with kind of like hand-to-hand small upsells um but a lot of these little small upsets can be massive profit drivers in the business this is kind of like your fries and coke situation that i'm talking about here like this is a lot like you don't make your money on the burger you make your money on the fries and the coke because there's the high profit margin things even though it's not the core offer and a lot of times there's huge pockets of profit that most especially most small business owners and especially if you're running like a brick and mortar beat a service business uh that you're missing out on so um highly recommend using that strategy if you're like oh man i wish i could use it in my business you can uh just use your brain and be creative because uh winners always think man i wonder how i could use that in my business and losers think that wouldn't work in my business my business is different so decide which one you are and then execute accordingly otherwise lots of love hope you guys have an amazing saturday hope that was a value for you if it is you know drop or tag or like or do all the the fun stuff and uh i hope to see you on
