What's up marketers? In today's video I'm going to show you exactly how to brief a UGC creator so that you get content that converts on Facebook ads and TikTok ads. And yes, I'm going to show you the exact brief that we use to brief our creators at Thesis.

One of the most common questions I actually get about developing creative briefs for UGC creators is should you even brief them at all or should you allow them to have creative freedom? Now I've actually changed my mind on this quite a bit recently and I'm now of the belief that you need to brief your creators with as much information as possible. I mean you don't want to give them like a four-page document they're going to have to digest and you don't want to assign them homework on top of creating the actual content for your brand.

But you do actually need to tell a creator what it is that you want and examples do go a long way in helping aid that process. I think that we've found a really happy medium ground with our creators at Thesis. And to be honest, one of the core parts of our creative brief process is something that you actually can't see on the actual UGC brief which is in general we tend to hop on 15-minute calls every time we are working with a new creator.

So that means someone who hasn't worked with Thesis previously. And the core things that we're going to go over with them on the brief is you know telling them exactly what we want, some of the high-level brand do's and don'ts. And this is also the place where we emphasize like, hey you know what we really love creators who are able to put their own creative flair on content and we really encourage them to do that.

And this is also the point where myself or our UGC producer is brainstorming with the creators and actually asking them what type of ideas they have. It is kind of a tedious step to get on a 15-minute call with all creators but I think it's really well worth it. Another note that I have for brands and also agencies who are briefing creators and trying to get that awesome UGC content is to negotiate for the raws.

Now this is actually something that I find is a really interesting conversation between people who source UGC creators and the UGC creators themselves. I've noticed this trend where more and more UGC creators are actually charging more for the raws even though it ultimately takes them less work to do so because they're not expected to do the editing. I'm not gonna lie this is kind of a pet peeve of mine but I'm really really welcome for my mind to be changed on this because I find that right now a lot of creators are saying no if you're gonna make multiple ads out of my content then I should get more money for that but ultimately you're putting less work into it so I'm just like not quite understanding that and yes I run a UGC division at a big agency but also I am a UGC creator myself so every time I work with a brand that's like oh you don't have to do that it's yourself we just want the raws I'm like amazing here's my rate it's definitely not the cheapest it is what it is but I really go the extra mile and providing them a huge library of content and frankly that's how I get repeat customers now when I work with creators and they're like nickel and diming me on the raws and saying oh we're gonna charge you more for the raws and it's just like absorbent price because they're trying to think oh are they gonna create four to ten ads out of this I need to charge for that it just kind of drives me crazy sorry for the rant I would be really curious to hear your pov on this because clearly I have a lot of thoughts oh god what's the next talking point so I guess this kind of leads me to another question that I always think about which is do UGC creators create good ads meaning are they actually knowledgeable enough to create direct response ads that convert on Facebook ads and TikTok ads I'm not convinced either way to be honest because I think sometimes especially with a platform like TikTok there's a lot of different ad formats that are converting and a lot of times the more organic type of ads really do convert there but I've had problems when getting UGC creators to make edits for Facebook ads or Instagram ads because it really is more of that direct response style of ads that tend to work there and I just don't find that a lot of UGC creators have that on hand knowledge so I don't know I'm kind of curious to hear your pov as well on that I feel like this video is just turning into me like airing my grievances about UGC I am a creator too like I charge anywhere from five hundred dollars to a thousand dollars per batch of like raw content aka like an entire library of raw content for my clients and like I love doing that I love just being able to explore the project create a whole bunch of clips and whatever I don't really care how many creatives they're gonna make out of it because I like had nothing to do with that you know okay so enough of that I'm gonna show you exactly how we brief our content creators right here so here is actually a UGC brief that I created for one of my clients like literally last week and what's really dope is I actually just got the content back from the UGC creator too and it was awesome I was really pleased with it and it is now with the editor so that we can get those finalized assets so you can see right up here there's like quite a bit of information we have the client name the deadline always important shipping details I also love giving the website and Instagram and also talking a little bit about the target demo I think that this really helps just like frame the ask a little bit more for our creators I also like to outline creative package specifications so I always say hey submit via google drive or we transfer link and I'm also really explicit about what I expect from them since I don't expect one single video so I want one testimonial and 10 b-roll clips and if you're wondering did I hop on a call with this UGC creator yes I did and also I was available by text for her so she was able to send me a few shots and videos to ask if she had the setup right which was awesome I love working with creators that way now in the content brief I say hey this content is going to be used for ads so no posting to organic handles would be required very important for creators to know by the way it's going to run on Facebook and Instagram ads now the shooting specifications this is the kind of stuff that you think is going to be obvious to creators it is not you need to be explicit about this shoot in good lighting film all content vertically because again this is going to be for Facebook and Instagram ads add an extra one to three seconds to the beginning and end of all raw clips turn off all ACs don't add filters avoid wearing logos and keep your bathroom background clean aesthetic now what I think is the real meat of the creative brief is I actually do create storyboards for my creators which is right below so I go into the testimonial so the way that I like to structure my content with creators is to create modular content so I have them do a testimonial it can be either like full length or medium length and I also give them a sample script but again when I was working with this creator I emphasized with her like hey you can really add your own flair onto this she followed the script like pretty similarly which was great it was a great script and the client loved it so that was all good and here I have hey this can be medium shot or like one or two steps back and I also emphasize like hey feel free to pause feel free to pause between your sentences because I don't want any creators thinking that they have to like memorize the entire thing or thinking that they have to like nail everything right really the more content they can give me the better um and really just to emphasize hey like make it authentic make it genuine you think that's obvious but it's not um so sample script right there and then I go through all of the b-roll clips that I must must have so here I was like hey I want you to be sitting down and stretching with your laptop in view hey I want you to have five clips minimum b-roll of you working out it could be lifting weights it could be a little bit more low impact it could be a little bit more cardio um and I also wanted the full body to be in frame I was pretty explicit about that and I gave a few other options that I had liked I also wanted b-roll of them showing more of a healthier lifestyle so drinking some water eating a snack and those were going to be a little bit more close up so these are what our briefs look like at thesis these are the briefs that I also use in my personal consulting sometimes when I am arranging for content for for clients and this has been working so far I sometimes think it's too big and that like sometimes I just know most people like skip down here and look through this stuff I think it works and it's definitely been getting the type of content that we want which I'm really happy about but I don't know we're all a work in progress right so anyways I hope you learned something from this video if you did please give me a like
