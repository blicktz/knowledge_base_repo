What's up marketers? Before we close out the year in 2022, I want to do a video that talks about my predictions for Facebook ads and the D2C space for 2023. So here's what I got.

The first one is, is I think we're going to see even more automation coming from meta and Facebook ads itself. Now, this probably isn't a huge shocker to everyone. It probably seems a little bit more obvious, but I think that this automation is actually going to be coming from three main areas from meta.

Number one, we've seen the options for campaign build outs on actual Facebook ads to be reducing and the types of campaigns that we can make. I think that this is going to reduce even further. To be honest, I kind of feel like brand awareness and reach and traffic campaigns are all kind of superfluous and they all kind of frankly mean the same thing, which means that you want eyeballs instead of sales.

I think they're going to start to consolidate those down even further. So I wouldn't be surprised if in the future, Facebook only offered four options, one for like brand awareness slash traffic slash reach, one for lead generation, one for mobile apps, and then one for sales and conversions. The third automation that I think Facebook is going to double down on is of course, the targeting.

I really do think that there is going to be an element of even more reduced targeting on the Facebook ad side. And I wouldn't be surprised too, if they started introducing targeting suggestions, kind of like TikTok ads does, where when you're starting to target with a certain creative on a broad audience, potentially they might be offering up certain types of nuggets of information about the audience that you're targeting. Sort of like, oh, this audience has a big interest in food or fashion, or here's some broad demographics.

I feel like meta and a lot of brands are still uncomfortable with the creative as targeting and only using broad targeting. So if you are comfortable with that, then you're definitely ahead of the game from my point of view. I think that they're going to start offering up more information about what that targeting actually looks like on their backend to give more comfort, especially to newbie media buyers and first time business owners.

There's still the disconnect between this idea of personalization marketing and targeting broad and like using creatives to target. I don't know. It's kind of like a half-baked idea.

So let me know in the comments below if anything I said there resonates or if you have a thought about how Facebook is going to continue to automate or reduce targeting and maybe how they're going to compensate for that. The third and final automation that I think that Facebook and meta are really going to double down on is unfortunately automation for agency support. Over the last few months, I've seen quite a bit of reduction in their support for agencies and for brands that are on meta ads.

And I think that this is something that's going to continue to happen as we're still scoping out what's happening with the economy. We all know that Facebook did have a reduction in staff a few months ago and the partner agency portion of their business was hit pretty hard by that. So I think that we're going to be seeing even more automotive support from that.

And that support isn't going to be as hands-on as it had in the past. Now my second prediction for 2023 and it is in the same line of this state of the economy right now, I think that more agencies are going to close up shop. And I think that the agencies that ultimately survive 2023 are going to look a lot different.

I think the agencies that have started combining their services, especially growth with creative, that's kind of like the baseline requirement I believe now for all agencies. Since creative is your most important lever, you have to connect creative output and creative production with your growth services. I find that to be a complete necessity.

Now you can have creative only agencies for sure that support in-house teams for instance, but I don't really see the need in 2023 for growth only agencies. So that would be like media buying agencies. It's going to be really hard to prove that ROI since a lot of the targeting and a lot of the ad ops is automated.

Now I've seen a number of agencies towards the end of 2022 either close up shop or reduce the amount of people on staff quite greatly. And I think that this is something that's going to continue to happen. I think during the pandemic, we had a huge hiring boom for at growth agencies and now we're realizing there is a certain amount of staff that is superfluous and they're getting rid of those people.

My like note to agencies is to really look at the staff and really look at what they're doing on a day-to-day basis and really making sure that it's moving the needle for your clients. Are they good communicators with business owners and with founders of the brands that they're working on? Are they contributing to creative strategy?

And do you have a hand in the creative process that you can directly tie back your results to? Because that's ultimately going to be a huge necessity. I think the age of the Facebook ads only agency is dead.

Now, number three is very much in that same vein and building off of the last two. But I think that typical paid growth structures are going to completely come to a halt. And what I mean by that is agencies are no longer going to be hiring media buyers.

For instance, I was looking at a few agencies in D2C and e-com and looking at the open jobs that they had. No one was hiring for media buyers, but a number of them were hiring for creative strategists. I saw Common Thread Collective was doing this and I thought that was really interesting because previously they had always had a rolling application open for media buyers.

And now it seems that they've really switched that to creative strategists. And I do think that that is just the proper response to what the platforms need nowadays. And I also think about my own experience with my personal consulting clients, as well as my clients at Thesis.

I actually feel like nowadays I am weighing way more in on non-paid social media growth activities. I still spend a lot of time talking about Facebook ads and TikTok ads and creative, but I'm also pointing them to other growth letters as well that include things like direct mail, that include things like SEO, that include things like building an organic YouTube page and really building up an organic community that you can tap into that's sort of outside of this paid social only mindset. We're seeing a lot of more brands spending and scaling on the platform.

It's becoming more and more competitive. And I think that for the newer brand or newer agency, it's a lot harder to get those results initially out of the gate. For bigger agencies, they're now going to think a lot more about how they can contribute to the 360 experience, whether or not it's by doubling down on retention efforts like email, like SMS, or thinking more about CRO and landing pages and thinking about other offline channels as well.

The age of the typical paid social growth agency, I think is going to end in 2023. My fourth prediction for 2023 is that AI solutions are going to become a lot louder. Now, it seems like over the last few weeks, Chat, GBT, Jasper, and Dolly, these sort of AI solutions have really taken over and in a way delighted in everyone initially at how effective they are at generating certain types of images that would take creative teams months to create.

Long form copy text, blog articles, emails, titles, anything. And I see a lot of writers, copywriters, and creatives using these solutions as like a shitty first draft, if that resonates for anyone. And I think that those type of solutions are only going to get louder and have a lot more focus in our industry.

And my personal point of view on AI and paid social and especially in creative is I am initially like a little suspect of it. I think that there's just like a lot of nuance that our robots haven't quite got a hold of. But maybe I'm wrong, you know, because the things that these AIs can do quite a bit better than us is immediate research, immediate learning, and really sort of creating a process for incremental improvement in some ways.

But especially on the copywriting and storytelling side, there's something that's so inherently human about a lot of that that I just don't quite think that the AIs are gonna steal our creative jobs. They're definitely gonna steal your media buying job. But I think that, you know, we're gonna start using AI to respond to our text messages.

I think that we're gonna start using AI to respond to emails and whatnot. So I guess we'll be learning that one together. And the fifth one and final one I'm gonna end on is actually one that I think is quite positive for our industry, which is that I think Facebook is gonna continue to get better.

I think over the last two to three months, Facebook has made a lot of strides in attribution and getting results for the clients that are using their ad buying platforms. And I think a lot of us saw this this year during Black Friday, Cyber Monday 2022. Initially, we all had a lot of hope coming out of TikTok ads and sort of the overwhelming general like perspective was, hey, Facebook actually did pretty well.

And maybe TikTok didn't do as well this year as we all had thought. And Facebook has also done a good job of reintroducing some things we lost during iOS 14, which was breakdown conversion data, that sort of breakdown data is now rolling out and becoming more available on accounts. It's not available for all accounts, but it's available for many accounts.

I think that they're going to continue to take targeting options away for us. But I think as humans, we're still uncomfortable with going full broad Chad, which is why I think that they will offer up little nuggets of information about the audiences that our specific ad sets or campaigns are targeting, which would be a good way to get people to spend more on the platform because if they can see the breakdown between, oh, this ad set that houses this amount of creative is targeting these specific demographics and interests, while this ad set is targeting completely different ones, I think that we'd see a lot less tinkering of turning on and off ad sets. And we'd see more increases in certain budget on certain things based on whatever types of products or solutions we're trying to push forward.

I just hope that they have the manpower and the engineer support on their side to continue developing those resources. I don't know if any of you have noticed this, but the Facebook ads library has had this really wonky interface recently and, you know, I try to zoom in and it blows up my screen or it just looks too small and I can't even screen share Facebook ads library anymore with clients when we're doing competitor research together. So I now house all of my ad creatives that I'm saving and reviewing with my clients or my team in 4Play slash Addison.

I see the functionality of some things not being nearly as effective as they used to be, but I do see that overall the ads buying platform, it's something I'm having a lot more faith in. And that's all that I have today. Let me know in the comments below what your predictions are for 2023.

I'm really fascinated to hear what you guys think about meta ads, TikTok ads, and AI. These are big hot button issues and I'll see you guys next week. Thanks for sitting down with me.

See ya. Bye.
