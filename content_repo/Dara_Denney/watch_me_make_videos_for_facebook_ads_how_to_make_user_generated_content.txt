What's up marketers, we're going to be doing things a bit differently today. I've gotten a ton of questions lately about how to create video content for Facebook ads and Snapchat ads. So by the end of this video, you're going to learn how to create three different types of video content that converts.

I'm going to be taking you behind the scenes today as a film content for one of my clients using nothing but my iPhone. So let's do this. So here's the thing.

I'm not just going to take all the great product that my client sent me and start filming. We have a lot to prep before that. The number one thing that we're going to do is we're going to conduct some research and see what our competitors doing and if there's any kind of creative strategies we want to take from them and apply to our own.

Number two, we're going to actually write down that content that we want to create. And then we're going to have to see if there are any other kinds of special preparations that I need to make. Then we're going to shoot and then we're going to edit.

And again, for all the editing purposes, I'm actually just going to use my iPhone for that so that it's really simple for you guys to do at home too. So I'm going to be creating UGC or user generated content style of video today because I know that's what really works on Facebook and Snapchat these days, but it's also frankly all that I'm really capable of producing and it's quite simple. So let's get started.

We have a lot to do. So first I'm going to go to the Facebook ads library and check out what some of our competitors are doing. I'd kind of like to do something like this, but a little bit more simple.

I'm also going to check out some of my competitors on their Instagram as well as their mobile website and see if I can get some of their ads to trigger. Since I'm going to be working with women's luxury handbags today, I kind of want to do an unboxing sort of like this, but I'm going to have to simplify it a bit so I can get it right. I think one of the biggest lessons I've learned while creating this kind of UGC style content is to keep things simple.

Okay. So I landed on the three types of video ads we're going to be filming today. Number one is a single testimonial UGC style.

This type of user generated content is obviously something that works really well on Snapchat and Facebook ads. So I definitely want to be doing one of those. Number two is a time-lapse style video.

Now this is something that always catches my eye and stops me when I'm scrolling through the feed. So I want to try creating that. And luckily I found a new app on TikTok that's going to help me do that.

So I'm really excited about this one. And then number three, I want to do an unboxing. Now the thing that actually struck me the most when I personally received the product was how luxurious the packaging was.

And it was a real experience. And it's actually something I've seen a lot in the testimonials and reviews. So I want to try and tease that a little bit more in the actual video ad.

So let's go. So the first video that I filmed was the single testimonial. And to be honest, this is the one that I was the most nervous about because I actually had to be in it.

But I really wanted to do it because this kind of video content is really the best performing I find on Facebook ads and Snapchat ads. Now even though I do video for this channel, again, I was a little bit nervous about having to talk about the product and also worry about showcasing the product at the same time. So an ad like this one was out.

And originally I wanted to do an ad like this where I could jump between different types of outfits and show the different bags. But as you can see here, when I tried filming it with the only mirror that I actually have in my apartment, it was a mess. So in the end, I decided to keep it simple.

And I decided to approach it a little bit more something like this, which I knew would be easier to film than the other kinds of single testimonial content that I had seen in the past. So here's the final version of the ad that I created. Now I have a lot of bags, but this one is my absolute favorite.

And it's by a new brand I found called Verlaine. You have to check it out. And you can obviously see a few things that made this ad way easier to create while also still being engaging.

So number one, I ended up using B-roll footage at the beginning. So even though I love being on camera for this channel, I found it really intimidating to be on camera for a luxury brand because I am a proudly average person. So I just didn't feel like if I focused on myself, it wouldn't be the right move for the client.

And number two, I ended up using text overlay to tell a story and also call out important details about the brand. This made it feel really organic, like something you'd see on Instagram stories or even TikTok. And number three, I did use a full body shot at the end because I do find that using a full body shot does work a little bit better than just focusing on the profile or even just the face.

But in general, I am focusing on the bag. And especially at the end, I have that part where I zoom in at the bag. And number four, I used a voiceover, which again took pressure off having to film and talk about the product at the same time, but it still gave it that really organic feel.

Now, to be honest, even though I really like this ad and my team thinks it's their favorite, this is the one that I'm most nervous about what the client is going to say. So I assume they're going to want me to change around the font and the colors, which is totally fine. But I guess we'll just see.

So the second ad that I had filmed was a time lapse. Now, this would have been a total struggle to film otherwise, but I had actually found a new app to help out with this called Life Lapse. Now, I actually found this ad while scrolling through TikTok when I found one of their founder's videos pop up in my feed that was actually about how to create video content for social media.

And I was sold. So what's so cool about this app too is it actually shows you how to make several different types of time lapse videos. And it also gives you tips on how to create a scene, on how to hack a tripod when you don't have a tripod.

The trainings in this are honestly gold. Now, what's cool is I actually did a test run of the unboxing using the time lapse suture just because I didn't really know what to expect. And I actually really liked the way that it came out.

I just kind of think that the coloring on the bag was a little off at the end, which is why I didn't end up using it. Now, I had a slightly different idea for the video that I wanted to film. And what's actually kind of cool is the one that I'm going to be presenting to my client is actually the one that I filmed.

So here is the final version. I haven't decided if I am going to be adding text overlay or editing music, but for now I'm just going to keep it as is and see what the client says. So if you want to create a video like this, you're going to have to use Life Lapse.

Honestly, I would have had no idea how to create something like this before. And like I said, the trainings on it are absolutely fire. So be sure to give that a try.

The third ad was actually my favorite to create, which was the unboxing. Again, the packaging that these bags came in was incredible. It truly felt like a curated experience.

And what was interesting is when I was doing research on other unboxing videos, I was really amazed at how basic they actually were and how often they would actually show the gross cardboard boxing. So I thought that was a really easy thing to just not include. So in the end, I actually ended up creating several different types of unboxing videos, one for each product, in fact, so that they could be used in retargeting, which I think would be really effective.

But this was also a good move because I had a lot of content to sift through so that I could find the best parts and then put that into the final edit. So if you're going to be filming an unboxing video by yourself, like I did, you're quickly going to figure out that you're not going to be able to film it all in one glow because you do not have enough hands. So what I ended up doing is actually filming each part of the unboxing, really focusing on the details.

And in the editing, I just took the best parts of that unboxing and then put them together to create a more engaging video. And it's interesting, I even ended up cutting out some of the action parts that were a little too slow. And I really ended up liking that effect.

But when you're filming an unboxing, be sure to have a clean work surface. I just use my bed because I don't really have that much space in my apartment. And remember that you're going to do be doing most of the heavy lifting in editing.

Now for all these videos, I actually edited them all on my phone using an app called CapCut, which is actually a suggestion I got from Savannah Sanchez. The UX is a bit flimsy, but I think it's a really great app for editing on your phone when you need or want to. Now for the most part, I actually use Adobe Premiere Pro to edit the videos for this channel.

But for UGC, I think I am going to continue using CapCut. So I am going to be sending these videos to the client this week. So I guess we'll see what they say.

I'm not going to lie though, like even though I like the effect of some of these, and if another client of mine gave them to me to use on ads, I'd be pretty pumped to use them. Maybe make a few other edits and tailoring here are there. I think they're fine, but I also am pretty aware that this is a more luxury brand.

So I'm a little unsure about how they're going to feel about this kind of content. Frankly, some of it might need to be edited a little bit by an art director, which is totally fine, but we'll see. All right, that is it.

What an episode. If you have any questions about how to create user-generated content for your clients or for your brand, be sure to leave me a comment below. That is it.

See you next week. Bye.
