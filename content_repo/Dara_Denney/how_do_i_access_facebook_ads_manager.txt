Hey guys, welcome to my channel. Today's video is actually a response to a question that I got in the comments of one of my other videos. If you guys have any questions about Facebook ads, leave them in the comments below.

I am doing video responses for every single one of your Facebook ads questions. And today's question is from Mari Wilkinson who asked, how do I access Facebook ads manager? This is a great question because honestly, if you're not in Facebook ads managers every day, Facebook does not make it super easy for you to get to.

But this video is going to show you how to do exactly that. The first thing you're going to do is go to Facebook. And once you're at Facebook, you're going to go to your Facebook business page.

And yes, you do need a Facebook business page to access a Facebook ads manager account. But the good news is, is that if you've already created your Facebook business page, then your Facebook ads manager page was already created for you. Once you're at your Facebook page, you're going to see a little section up here called ad center.

Go ahead and click that. Once you're in ad center, go ahead and click all ads. And you're going to see a little link down here to go to ads manager.

And there, that's how you get to ads manager. Mari, thank you so much for asking me a question. And seriously, guys, if you have any questions big or small about Facebook ads, be sure to ask me and I will make a video reply just like this for your question.

Okay, guys, thanks so much. Bye.
