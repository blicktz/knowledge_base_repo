Hey guys, my name is Dara and I'm the director of paid social at a fully remote marketing agency Today I wanted to share with you guys the easiest way to upload a product catalog to Facebook Ads manager And look I hate doing this kind of stuff. I hate installing the pixel. I hate testing event tracking You know, I Really feel like I'm more well-versed in the creative end in things and when it gets a little bit more technical Like I don't feel comfortable with this kind of stuff So when I discovered the super easy way to do this I wanted to share with you guys so that you could take advantage of one of Facebook's most powerful tools when it comes to advertising online and The reason why you guys should do this is because the product catalog allows you to actually retarget customers with products that they've already indicated interest in So on my Dara does marketing fake Shopify store Yeah, please don't go here you can see I have a featured collection fold with some products of Dog costumes and clothing.

So what a product catalog would actually allow us to do is say a customer Clicked on this the Soho sweatshirt and Added to cart The next time that they went to Facebook or Instagram You could actually dynamically retarget those people so that they see this exact product in their social media feeds Which is really really powerful? In this method I'm going to share with you guys This is exactly what I do at the agency and also with my personal clients. So Let's dive in Okay, so we're gonna be starting at your Shopify homepage And from here we're gonna go to apps So we will be downloading an app to do the heavy lifting on installing this product catalog So we're gonna visit the Shopify app store And we'll be downloading an app called Flexify Sweet right here so Flexify is free for up to your first 1000 products There is a premium version which allows you to have better control over the way that your images Show up in Facebook or Instagram But just starting off just install the free version I Definitely use it for the free version for a number of clients, so it's totally fine So when you first download it You'll see this screen you will not be seeing this little notice It's just because I deleted it so that I could show you The exact process for getting to For downloading your product catalog, so if you click on apps again You can see that you have this Flexify Facebook product feed and this is where your apps gonna live So go ahead and click on that and Again, you won't see this little notice But what you're gonna do is you're going to Add the collection so yes, you are gonna have to have a collection already made in Shopify And for this purpose you want to create one with all of your products so that No matter which product one of your customers lands on you can be able to retarget them So we have the all products collection selected You want to make sure to click on this use SEO titles and description so that Google has an easier time finding you And some of these are just premium upgrades so for this purpose you're not going to have to worry about them You're also going to be able to see what your images are going to look like both in Facebook For the cropped option and for the fill option As you can see all those all tend to look the same and if they do That's a good indication that you don't need to upgrade unless you have more than a thousand products This right here is a feed generation time so with Flexify it's actually going to look at your Shopify account for you at a specific time every day to update those products as long as The products that you're adding to your Shopify site is in that catalog So I like to do this in the middle of the night like 4 a.m These are other premium features and then last easy Step is to save your feed And now so this is actually where your feed lives which is super cool So we want to go ahead and copy that and then we're going to head on over to Facebook Ads manager So once you're here what you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and click on catalog manager You're going to go ahead and click on data sources add products and And here we're going to be choosing a bulk upload Because we do not want to add all of our products one by one and we're not going to be using the pixel for this And when you see here that we actually have another few options to choose from and here We're going to select schedule feed and Enter URL so here is where we'll be entering the URL from our Flexify app so go ahead and enter it there Click next and Now you're going to be planning your update too so really we only want to do this once a day and I would recommend to do this again in the middle of the night kind of like when When Flexify is going to be uploading from Shopify so the way that it's working is that Flexify is sinking to the product catalog and then Flexify is then sinking to ads manager So let us do Okay, that's fine Okay, that's fine And then here we want to name the data source so you can go ahead and just keep the The regular name and you want to select your currency For this purposes, it's a USD and then you're going to hit upload So depending on how many products you're uploading this first time around Shouldn't really take super long And there we go very quick and it says that I have eight products in the data feed and that's exactly how many products I have on my Shopify So that's perfect and now you're ready to create your first ad So let's go ahead and see what that looks like actually So now you've already you know, you've done all the heavy lifting your product catalog is installed But I want to show you what you can do with that.
