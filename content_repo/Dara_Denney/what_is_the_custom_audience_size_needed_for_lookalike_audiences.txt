Hey guys, welcome to my channel. Today I'm going to answer the question, how many people do I need in a custom audience to create a lookalike audience? Now this is a question that I see answered wrong all the time and I think Facebook themselves is a little bit to blame.

So the official answer is, is that you need a hundred people in a custom audience to be able to create a lookalike audience. However, I've heard from my Facebook reps that the optimal amount to have in these custom audiences is actually around a thousand, which is where I think this major discrepancy is. So yes, you can still create lookalikes from custom audiences that only have a hundred people, but you're going to get a lot better results if that number is a little bit closer to a thousand or just over a thousand.

So when you're actually in the audience section of your Facebook ads manager and you're looking at the audience size of your audiences, you're going to see that they're not actually going to tell you what your actual audience size is if it's under a thousand. It's only once you reach a thousand people or more that they're going to start telling you how many people are actually in those audiences. And this is to protect people's privacy and people's data.

I guess Facebook thinks that if there's a thousand people in one custom audience or one custom list that you upload, it's going to be a lot easier to find those people. And there are some privacy issues with that. So yeah, if you've had a hundred customers buy something from your Shopify, you definitely can export those thousand people, upload them as a custom list to your Facebook ads manager and create a look like from them.

But your results might not be as good as if you had a thousand or more people. Okay guys, and that's all. Thank you so much for this super short and quick video.
