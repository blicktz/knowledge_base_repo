what's up marketers today i'm going to show you exactly how i built out a facebook ads account from scratch with a budget of three thousand dollars per month this video is a part of a series that i'm doing on this channel so if you want to see more of this type of content please subscribe and leave me a comment below with the industry and ad spend you want to see me build out an account for so in my last video for this series i showed you how to build out an e-com account with a monthly budget of fifty thousand dollars this video is for a much smaller budget but also in the e-com space which was requested by you guys so early in my career especially when i was a consultant i got hundreds of these 2k 3k and 5k to add accounts but this is not something that i specialize in anymore and the reason is because at this stage in the game you're still trying to prove out product market fit and viability of your product or brand and it is not easy it is far harder to go from zero dollars in revenue to 20k in revenue than it is to go from 20k to 100k however if you're a business owner i don't think that you should be hiring an agency at this stage your budget plus the agency fees are not going to be worth it and no agency is going to be a silver bullet for growth this early on i'd highly suggest that you learn as much as you can about this platform so you can better gauge agency performance in the future so take notes on what i am doing here this is exactly what i would do for an e-com brand that has a monthly budget of three thousand dollars so i want us first to start off by figuring out our budget and how we're going to be dividing that between prospecting and retargeting this is one of the most important things for a budget of this size was just to make sure that your campaigns are divided between prospecting this is your cold traffic people who've never heard from you also known as top of funnel or tofu and retargeting this is your warm traffic people who've had some kind of contact with your brand by either viewing a video engaging with you on social media or even visiting your website so the first thing i want to do is figure out our daily budget overall so that's going to be three thousand dollars divided by 30 that's how many days there are in a month which is going to equal out to a hundred dollars per day the overall daily budget so from here i'm going to break it down between prospecting and retargeting and at this stage of the game for many brands they're just starting off in their advertising journey so there's going to be a big focus on finding new customers and prospecting however we don't want to ignore retargeting completely this is actually a common mistake i see many brands making but the reality is that no matter where you are in your advertising journey your customers are still going to need multiple touch points to convert so the breakdown for this product is going to be 20 to retargeting and 80 to prospecting this is going to prioritize finding new customers and prospecting while also giving multiple touch points for conversion and retargeting one thing i want to mention though is that this budget is not set in stone for instance in retargeting if you start to see that frequency pop above a four or a five over the last seven days that might be a sign that you need to shift more of your budget to prospecting so the next part of this process is creative and i like to develop all my creative and compile all my copy images and videos before i build anything out so i'm not going to take you through the whole creative process today and i will show you the ad types that i chose for this brand when i'm giving you the entire walkthrough throughout the account but i want to show you a lightweight approach that you can take to develop and creative for your brand so the first thing you're going to want to do is some competitor research so you're going to want to see what kind of ads that your competitors are running at facebook.com slash ads library so i use this tool every single day to see what my favorite brands are running on their facebook ads and if i'm being honest also to check out the discount codes so here you're going to be taking a look at your competitors ads and making notes of anything that you want to try on your own ad account next you're going to iron out the ads that you want to test and i have tons of great resources on the added types that you can create for yourself and other great ones to test as well so be sure to take a look at these videos which i'll be listing in the description bar below and here you're going to be compiling the strategies that you want to test just be sure to remember anything that you got from your competitor research the third part of the process is to actually develop that creative so it's either going to be yourself developing the creative you're hiring out for a graphic designer or you're hiring someone from fiverr or upwork so if it's your first time using fiverr i would actually suggest hiring two to three designers to create the same ad for you in this way you can figure out which one that you like better and then develop a relationship with them and if you're doing this for yourself i recommend that you use canva for image-based products and cap cut for video projects and the fourth part of this process is to write out the copy and in the beginning i actually suggest that you use the multiple text copy option feature so you're going to be coming up with five primary texts five headlines and five descriptions and i recommend that you do this at first and once you figure out what kind of copy is starting to work and you start diversifying your creative and prospecting versus retargeting then you can start actually creating those ads and using the post id so that you can build up more of that social proof but in the beginning it's a lot more about testing and figuring out what works and like i said i'm going to show you the actual ad strategies i chose for this account when i'm giving you the walkthrough over the entire account build out so next we're going to start building out the actual campaigns and unlike the 50k per month budget we're going to be using an even more simplified account structure for this account and the reason why is because with these smaller budgets we want to make sure that our money is having the best impact possible and spreading everything across too many campaigns in the beginning is not going to be as effective so for this account we're going to start off with only two campaigns one for prospecting and one for retargeting and we already know that our budget is going to be 80 in the prospecting campaign and 20 in the retargeting campaign so let's go ahead and build out this first retargeting campaign so i always start off with retargeting campaigns because this is where i often find the quickest and easiest ones that i would count so we definitely want to get that up asap so we're going to go ahead and create our campaign and we're going to be using a conversion campaign for our retargeting go ahead and click continue now the campaign name you're going to go ahead and name it so i'm going to do dd that's just my name daradeni and then retargeting conversions because that's the objective and cbo because we're going to be using cbo for this campaign i often find that it does tend to work better in retargeting and almost as a rule i always keep my retargeting campaigns as campaign budget optimization so for this daily budget we are going to be using 20 so i'm going to go ahead and keep that and then for the campaign bid strategy we're going to continue using lowest cost now you do have other options here and i'm going to be creating a video in a few weeks that's all about what these other options mean and when you can actually be using these but to start don't complicate it just continue using lowest cost so here we're going to be naming our ad set and i'm going to go ahead and just you know name it retargeting this is going to be a website visitors 180 days audience and i'm going to go ahead and put it in all there because we want to make sure that it's everyone who's visited the website next we're going to choose the conversion event we want those purchases so we're going to go ahead and click that even if this is your first campaign that you're deploying facebook is smart enough to know people that are more likely to purchase and since these are people who've already been to your website it already knows the kind of data on them on who's more likely to convert versus who's not so you don't need to do add to car or view content or anything like that at this stage just go ahead and do purchase now we're not going to be doing dynamic creative or offer i wouldn't mess with this schedule button this is just if you wanted to start it at a later date now here is where we're going to to be putting in the audiences so like i said we want to do website visitors 180 days so right there it is perfect and the next thing that we want to do is we want to be sure to exclude our purchasers because we don't want to be um advertising to people who have already converted from us so i have a complete purchaser list right here perfect and then i also have a pixel purchase list awesome and we're going to be advertising in the united states great age range now even if your primary demographics are outside of this default age group i would actually go ahead and keep this on there especially for retargeting i actually tend to find better results by keeping that age group as default i'm going to keep all genders going to keep detailed targeting expansion on we're also going to be doing automatic placements and we're not going to be doing cost controls so from here i'm actually going to go ahead and build out the rest of this campaign and then i'm going to show you when i'm done the entire campaign and what we have set up in here so if you watched my last video where i built out an account that was 50k per month then this campaign is going to look super similar to you and that's on purpose so here we have our retargeting campaign when we go inside we see we have two ad sets one for social engagers 365 days and one for all website visitors 180 days and the social engagers is including both facebook engagers and instagram engagers and again i'm using the biggest time windows on these possible because i want the biggest data set possible so that i can get some learnings about which ads are having the most impact additionally i want to try and re-hook some of those people that may have been interested in my brand before we started this ad account so what i would do here is once you get some ad creative learnings and figure out the time it takes for someone to convert from your ads then you can reduce that time window from 180 days 365 days to 30 days or really whenever that drop off is for your customers with that said on these smaller accounts sometimes i just leave those time windows open in general for these retargeting campaigns there are three other things that i suggest you look out for number one is to exclude all of your purchasers from your retargeting campaign so i would exclude a custom audience based on your pixel purchasers based on your purchasers from your esp like clavio or mailchimp and also a custom audience export from your shopify account additionally you need to keep an eye on your frequency here i would try to keep your frequency around a two to three over the last seven days now this all depends on your product or brand but if you see your frequencies getting above a five or six over the last seven days that's probably a sign that you need to reduce your retargeting budget and shift some more of that into prospecting additionally always keep a lookout on the comments of your retargeting ads take note when someone says that they're seeing this ad too much as that might be another sign that you need to reduce your budget now the next and last campaign we're going to be building out today is your prospecting campaign and this is actually where you're going to want to focus a majority of your time and energy in the account now even for a brand new account or pixel or business you're still going to want to start off with conversion campaigns i've heard a few other gurus tell you to use traffic campaigns to season the pixel and to be honest this is total bs so i'm going to show you how to build out this campaign the right way so again we're going to be building out a conversion campaign let's go ahead and do that and this one dd again for my name and then prospecting and abo so the big change at the campaign level for prospecting is that we are going to be using ad set budget so our budget is going to be detailed at the ad set level and the reason why i like to do this is because i actually find when you're just starting off and you're just trying to start testing audiences sometimes cbo will actually pull the budget into one ad set or the other and really to do a authentic test we want to make sure that the budget is going more evenly and that you can shut those off more manually when you know that they're not working because they reached a certain threshold so we're going to keep cbo off and hit next and i'm actually going to again build this all out for you and i will show you what i got going on here when i'm done okay so let's pop into our prospecting campaign you're going to see here that we have four ad sets all at twenty dollars per day so if your product actually costs more than a hundred dollars i would probably use fewer ad sets right out of the gate so that those individual budgets can be a little bit higher but here are the initial ad sets that i will be starting off with number one is a one percent super lookalike and this is actually going to contain all of the lookalikes that you can make from your pixel so your one percent lookalike based on social engagers your instagram engagers facebook engagers also a one percent look like based on your website visitors additionally a view content add to cart initiate checkout and again these are all being compiled together because this is going to be like a super set of all of your data and i've found through my testing that i get a lot better results if i use this super lookalike versus just testing out all the separate lookalikes so i like doing that right out of the gate for these smaller budgets i would recommend that you test that as well too next up we have a interest based on your competitors now these can be your direct competitors if you can target them in facebook ads manager but likely they're not going to be so i would use your reach competitors or the brands in your industry that sell a similar product or service next up we have a customer avatar which is for like tech bros i guess for this account but here you're going to be compiling a more holistic 360 view of all the interests that this specific customer avatar has so you're going to include where they shop for food where they shop for clothing personal care home decor what kind of hobbies they have and any work based interests or software that they used so instead of segmenting your interests by competitors or by publications which we'll talk about next this is much more about zoning in on a specific persona and using all the interest to create that persona next up we have a interest ad set which is all for publications now this is pretty self explanatory but this is for all the different newspapers magazines tv shows etc that your target audience consumes now for these ad sets you're going to want to rotate them pretty quickly so you're going to want to turn off the ones that aren't working by the time they hit 2x your normal cost per purchase on facebook ads and if you're just starting off and you don't really know that that means i would then just start turning these off when they hit two times the amount of your product cost and really here you're going to start scaling up these budgets when your ads hit profitability so something i would recommend if you don't know when you're profitable is to watch these two videos that i've created about when you should scale and then i have another one that's about how you should scale but if you're seeing initial success from one of these audiences i would go ahead and just increase these budgets slowly by 20 every three days that's a really easy way to just get started on scaling the other ad sets that you're going to want to test early on include a one percent of your purchaser look-alikes now the only reason i didn't include this in the first round is because i figured that someone at this stage might not have those required 100 purchases to unlock that feature from the pixel but once you get those required 100 purchases you're definitely going to want to put that audience up right away another audience you're going to want to test is a broad audience so this is an ad set that has no interest targeting and no custom audiences and i like to put this up once i have some creative learnings because those audiences tend to perform better when you have optimized creative additionally i have another video that lists tons of other great audiences for you to test so i would definitely take a look at that so the last thing i want to go over is creative and this is not going to be all that much different from the creative funnel i use on my bigger accounts the main difference here is that we're only going to want to use three ads so that we're not spreading that budget too thin so remember to start we have two campaigns prospecting and retargeting and if you're just starting off don't feel the need to complicate this just use the same ads in each campaign and of course always be sure to take note of what is working what's not and try to do more of what's working i know it sounds simple but in practice can be overwhelming on these platforms but if you're ready to take your ad creative to the next level here is how i would build out your creative funnel at first so in prospecting we're going to have three ads and the first ad i would always include is a ugc compilation this is going to be a video that features multiple testimonials from several of your customers in a single video now i love using this in prospecting because it creates a sense of fomo and it makes people want to join in on the fun of your product the second ad that i would use is a image with a benefit text overlay and then the third ad would be a review type of ad preferably from a press hit in top of funnel or your prospecting campaign if you don't have any press hits yet i would go ahead and just use a customer testimonial and for our retargeting campaign again we're going to have only three ads and number one i would use a ugc testimonial which is going to be an in-depth review from only one of your customers and then again here i don't really want to complicate it too much i want to do a image with a benefits overlay if you want you can go ahead and use the same one that you used in prospecting and then for the third ad again we want to do a review type of ad here i would actually prefer to do a customer testimonial and retargeting but again if you don't want to complicate it go ahead and use that press hit that you're using and prospecting so the only real change that we're doing between these two campaigns is the ugc ad because we definitely want to give our retargeting audiences a more in-depth testimonial and view of your product now if you're creating this content for yourself i have tons of great resources all about how to create ugc type ads and the easiest ad designs that you can create for yourself so be sure to check those out in the description bar below okay i want to give you some final words of advice if you are running these campaigns yourself and number one is if you have multiple products in skews you can also try a tofu mofu and bofu account structure this is exactly like the account structure that i did in the other video that shows an account with a 50k per month budget all you're gonna have to do is rename your prospecting to tofu you're retargeting to mofu and then add a third campaign that has a catalog sales objective and name that bofu and the ad set i would put in that campaign would be a 180 day viewed content and add to cart with a purchase optimization and you can do a five or ten dollar a day budget for this campaign and you can take that right from retargeting the second thing is be sure to test new audiences and creative weekly be in the habit of once a week to turn off what is not working both your ad sets and your creative and then add new tests to find new winners i get tons of messages and emails every day that's asking should i test this ad or this ad should i test this ad set or this ad set and my answer is always both testing is never ever over you need to take an experimental approach to your facebook ads it's definitely not a silver bullet for any business and number three is to pay attention to what type of creative is working and prospecting versus retargeting because the more that you advertise those are going to start to differ so ask yourself why do cold audiences react this way to this creative and why do certain retargeting creatives do better versus what's doing and prospecting and number four is super important i talk about it all the time actually in my clubhouse talks and that's to track your learnings i actually use an excel sheet that has one tab for audiences and another tab for creatives and i'm going to be tracking all of those tests and number five the most important is when you find things that work create more content and ad sets that are like that and don't be afraid to increase your budgets and that is it thank you so much for suggesting this video i actually love creating this type of content for you and if you have any other types of ad budgets or industries that you want me to create content for please let me know by leaving me a comment below and hitting that subscribe button and i'll see you next week okay bye guys you Thank you.
