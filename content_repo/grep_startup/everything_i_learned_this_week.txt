okay welcome so i'm gonna try something new i used to watch a lot of tim ferris and kevin rose they had a show called the random show where they just spitballed for an hour or two and i'm gonna do that this episode and i'm just gonna do it by myself so i've got a bunch of things on my mind and i'm just gonna go through them a lot of it you'll be really interested in um and uh hopefully um hopefully enjoy it so let's hold on so i'm gonna talk about an insight i had this week i'm gonna talk about a regret i've had i'm gonna talk about the most interesting product i've seen this week i'm gonna talk about something i'm quitting i'm gonna be talking about a framework i've been thinking about ai tool i've been playing with the biggest productivity gain recently a story i was reminded of and a few other things and whatever comes to my mind so watch the whole video listen to the whole podcast and i'm curious what you think of this freeform episode so i just sort of wrote a few things down right before this but this is basically off the cuff so one trend that i think is only going to continue and i saw actually a tweet by alex leverman co-founder of morning brew that got me thinking about this so he says the four-step process of a creator entrepreneur number one build buy a business number two create content about the process number three grow audience of people interested in the process number four reap benefits new biz ideas new biz to buy feedback on your businesses marketing etc rinse and repeat and i think he's absolutely right i think creators are going to be creating a lot of new businesses and you know but there's one thing i think he's missing which is there's going to be less ads from creators and i think i'm an example of this so this podcast was making thirty thousand dollars of revenue a month when my co-host and i sahil bloom split up i was like i don't want to do ads so i removed all the ads and i went from thirty thousand dollars a month to zero i did it because number one i i didn't really want to be like honestly just like recording ad ad spots like it didn't feel fun and i think that if you're gonna be in content creation in some aspect like have fun with it so i didn't want to do that and then also i felt that i can build communities build products that i can just plug on the show here and people probably will go and check those out um so i i removed everything and it went from you know the people people say turn a cost center into a profit center that's like the narrative right now on twitter um the example that a lot of people use is aws amazon web services so servers was a cost amazon ended up turning that into a product and now they sell that product and make billions of dollars a year of profit from it i did the complete opposite i took a something that i was making money and then i turned it into a cost but my thesis is that long term um it's going to outperform it's going to outperform and i think that you're going to see a lot of creators and that was the only thing that was missing from al cleaverman's um amazing tweet today which is i think you're going to see less ads from creators so that's a that's a trend that it's only going to continue um okay next the most interesting product i've seen this week actually came from an instagram ad it's called pear ring dot co hair ring i'm just going to their website right now when you go to their website it's and by the way pear like the fruit p-e-a-r ring like a ring on you know a jewelry ring so when you go to their website you see the world's biggest social experiment it's a single like single question mark introducing pear the in real life social experiment taking the world by storm live in us uk germany canada etc so it's basically a ring a physical ring that people wear um to make it easy to know who else is single around um so it's a small quote unquote a small subtle ring that makes a big statement so for it gives examples on the website like if you're in a bar you're on a train you're at the gym um it allows uh people to see that ring and instead you know instead of the dating fatigue that people are having this you know on apps like tinder etc um they just see it and people can come up to each other and millions of people have joined it um it costs 25 dollars um and i'm not trying to like chill it i just think it's really interesting um because i i have a framework for thinking about building products and one of the frameworks is how do you build the anti-incumbent so the incumbent here is tinder like this is the complete opposite of tinder hinge raya all these dating dating apps literally a physical product that you pay for um versus a free product like a tinder or something like that um and i just think it's it's absolutely brilliant so that's just probably one of the cooler most interesting products that i've seen all week so check it out honestly it doesn't make a difference if you're if you're single or not it's just it's it's cool to see how um how to come up with a product that's going to get people talking um and i love how they call it like a social experiment they also have this thing called pear fest which is the world's biggest singles festival so they're just like they're doing cool very cool stuff and they and they literally sold out of their first release so something i'm quitting today so i posted on twitter 11 days ago and it got 6 000 likes and i was like what if i asked chat gpt to basically get me to a million followers in 30 days okay so i'm trying something really crazy with chat gpt for so i asked it you are tick tock gpt i am your human counterpart my name is greg eisenberg i talk about internet communities ai and startups i have 442 tick tock followers and your only goal is to get me to 1 million tick tock followers in 30 days every day i'll ask you what to record when i'll record i will keep you updated with follower accounts and what people are liking don't let me down well i did it for 10 days uh today's the 11th day i learned a few things but one of the things i learned was the content was bad it was just like not interesting content um despite that i got you know just under 2 000 followers from from it from like that stunt i guess um but i'm not going to continue because then suddenly i'm quitting because i was just a i'm not having fun with it and then going back to what i was talking about earlier like if you're creating content you want to have fun with it and i'm not having fun with it because the content that chat gpt is outputting is just very very low quality and it doesn't mean i don't believe that chat gpt could come up with really great scripts um because i've actually used it uh to create scripts for videos that have been really high quality um i've used it to create content that's been really high quality but it's actually the way i set up this particular experiment which is like i'm just the liaison between chat gpt and like i'm relying on people to like comment and then i feed it chat gpt and it's just it's just not working and i'm not having fun with it so lesson learned you can't leave chat gpt on its own to create content you have to um like if you want to create incredible content it needs to be ai enhanced it can't be ai driven just yet although with uh agent gpt and the autonomous stuff that's coming out coming out i think that might change but for right now if you're watching this right now or listening to this right now um you can't really rely on ai to to basically just like hey create a script and not give it feedback it is very much an iterative approach with it um tool i've been playing with this week summarize.tech so if you're anything like me you love watching youtube videos um and if you and if you don't uh if you don't watch youtube honestly watch youtube it's like there's so much incredible content out there that you can be learning from and i actually find like for me personally like if i watch the content versus listen to it it um it sticks in my brain a little bit more so i do watch a lot of youtube and this tool i've been using uh this week has been called summarize.tech and if you go to summarize.tech it's a free tool it says get a summary of any long youtube video like a lecture live event or government meeting powered by chat gpt and it's all time stamped too it's like pretty ugly ui and pretty ugly i mean pretty ugly design but it's it's really really high quality stuff you can there's a few ways i've been using this one is if i'm not sure if i want to like that you know dedicate an hour like here episode 95 of the all in podcast i might not want to watch it for an hour but i might be interested like some all ins i like some all ins i don't like or just less interesting to me so i put it into summarize.tech i can read the summary and then it goes like here i'm reading this one um they're discussing the passing of queen elizabeth ii elizabeth ii was a symbol of service i'm like uh do i really care about this like i don't know if i really want to spend an hour of my life watching this so that's one way you could um use summarize.tech the other way is if you're creating content um either on twitter or on a blog or on your sub stack uh or even on like website copy well you know you want to create compelling content it it just helps to like speed up the process for learning about stuff right so you might not have time to listen to six one hour youtube videos but you might be able to just read the summary or listen to different parts of it so this has been a really fun one to play with this week summarize.tech okay story i was reminded of so there's i'll tell you a story i was reminded of um because i had like a facebook memory so 2014 i in 2013 i sold a company to a social network called semelpon in 2014 one of our board members ram sharam who basically became like an my like mentor in a lot of ways he he was like a he's a silicon valley og he was on the board of google he put some of the first dollars into google he is a billionaire and he invited me to his christmas holiday party and uh he told me he's like there's gonna be incredible people there and it'll be good for you to be there as a representative from stumble upon like there's a lot of people you should know there um he's like get there get there on time so i get there you know i think it was called for 6 pm i get to his house in woodside cal no it was in atherton atherton california i think it's the highest median net worth in america if not the second and i walk into this incredible house and i think there was like picassos on the wall and crazy yard and this huge tent outside and they're serving you know high-end wine and stuff like that and i get there and there's only like i get there on time because he told me to get there on time and there's only like 10 people there or seven people there in this massive space for like a thousand people so um i end up grabbing one of these expensive glasses of wine i end up seeing these this older couple probably in their 80s and i started talking to them 30 minutes 45 minutes an hour you know he used the the father was telling me he worked at stanford and he was a professor and he was telling me about physics and the wife was also in you know really interested in education and and uh so just like we talked about all sorts of different things and before i knew it i had spent like 90 minutes talking to this older couple and i was missing my chance i was like missing my chance to uh take advantage of meeting like all these people like mark benioff was there marissa mayer was there all these like big shot people i start getting nervous actually i think she the the the grandmother she i think she was like are you are you okay and i was oh you know i should go like meet people here and she goes oh i have someone to introduce you to you said you're into videos right and at the time i was you know the company i had sold to stumble upon was a video discovery app built on top of youtube i was like yeah yeah she's like i want to introduce you to my daughter her name is susan wachitski she's the ceo of youtube and i was like oh my god so she pulls me over to the other side of the room introduces me to her daughter which is like way better than going up to a stranger and being like hi susan like someone like that hi susan like i'd love to introduce myself no her mom was like hey her mom and dad were like you gotta meet you gotta meet greg he's awesome i told her about our app five by she had it on her phone it was incredible and a lot of amazing things came from that and the lesson i have this the sort of lessons i have from that story i was reminded of because of this facebook memory is that um if there's going to be a lot of important people at a party get there on time and speak to anyone you never know who those people are so good memory and want to share that one with you all um a concept i'm thinking about right now so one thing i'm thinking about it's actually not so much of a concept it's almost like a philosophy a business philosophy which is how do you think about focus so i run a a product studio and in our product studio we have a family of agencies that we run um you know boringmarketing.com or dispatch.laycheckout.studio our design subscription or lay checkout our innovation agency about all these agencies we've got communities we run you probably need a robot.com etc etc and then products we're building right so we're doing all these different things we have different leaders in our company who run run these different divisions i've been thinking a lot about you know because i've been running this for three years and i've been thinking a lot about how do you know when to focus the hard part about running a product studio is you can do anything right you come up with an idea and you can do anything and i think you know to alex lieberman's uh tweet uh point like to his point like these creators who are going to create products like they're going to create tons of products and i'm i'm just trying to something i'm i'm thinking about is how much focus should you give to each product is is there a point where you're you're not focused enough and i think that's the reason why a lot of uh product studios have failed in the past they've failed in the past because they've focused on too many things they spread too thin they quit the products too late or too early um and we've made those mistakes uh over the last three years in a lot of ways and um the way i'm thinking about it now is i want to be a bit more focused and like we've got all these bets in these different categories be it design or seo with boring or ai and stuff like that and um i'd want to go deeper not wider um and i think a lot of you know a lot of people are going to make a mistake around they're going to go i think the mistake that people make is they either go too wide or too narrow they only focus focus on this one idea or they're focused on 10 ideas and it's too much so just something i'm thinking about and want to share with you all okay the biggest productivity gain i've had recently so the biggest productivity gain i've had recently was drum roll please deleting twitter off my phone i deleted twitter off my phone and the quality of my life has skyrocketed and this is coming from a guy who absolutely loves twitter and and that's why it's such a quality of life increase it's a quality of life increase because i'd be waiting in line for coffee during these like gap times or going for a walk and just subconsciously checking my phone it got to a point where i was just checking it way too much and i know a lot of people listening here have this problem too right like and and it might not be twitter for you it might be instagram or tick tock or whatever and i can't tell you how incredible it feels to just delete these apps from your phone and when you want to actually go and consume the this content go and consume the content on desktop and do it in like particular times right oh i'm gonna you know now i don't feel guilty when i'm on twitter and i'm like i'm gonna you know every morning spend 30 minutes on twitter enjoy it write tweets react to people reply to people see what's going on so yeah not people not enough people talking about what a productivity unlock that uh deleting twitter or social media apps from your phone is and i think i'll end this this version of the where it happens random show with a bit of a regret i've had um it's really two regrets so one is i only started posting on my sub stack or newsletter weekly in like this year 2023 so now i send out a weekly newsletter if you want to subscribe latecheckout.substack.com uh and i i'm absolutely loving it well first of all i'm just like enjoying doing it it's really fun to write the impact it's had on on our businesses has been multiple seven figures it's incredible so it's just like a reminder and a regret that i should have been doing this for years and i know you're probably listening to this too and you're like you might not be writing weekly um but i feel like we all could write something weekly um i'm very inspired by seth godin seth godin writes daily and he has been writing daily for like over a decade he's got like an incredible blog check it out seth godin like google seth godin blog and sometimes he'll just like literally post like a tweet size and he's probably just like a tweet size and he's got like a tweet size and he's got like a tweet right he's not writing it in the moment but i think now with like schedulers with having chat gbt as your editor for grammar and stuff like that and ideation like there really is no excuse for writing at some consistent basis maybe it doesn't need to be daily maybe it doesn't even need to be weekly but even monthly like start a blog write monthly um put put yourself out there and the results like will that will shock you they've shocked me the other thing i also wish i had done is and my other regret is um write on twitter multiple times a week like three four or five times a week you know i've been on twitter since i think 2006 and i would tweet but i wouldn't tweet like as much as i tweet now yeah in the the last 28 days i had 45.5 million impressions on my tweets that's like bigger than the size of canada bigger than california and and i built this audience starting in 2020 you know it's all it it really hasn't been that long so you could do a similar thing in three years reach 45 million people every single month and all that's required is is just coming up with ideas editing those ideas being you know and just putting it out there and seeing what sticks and find finding your lane and finding your niche so my only regret is i wonder if i would have started in 2000 whatever 2007 2008 you know what would my would my audience be a lot bigger and you know i never saw i i didn't start collecting emails until 2020 so this is just it was just a regret i had and i'm happy i caught it early and definitely something to think about uh for for everyone um go and write um and i think you'll enjoy it so yeah this ends this episode of the random show where it happens i hope you enjoyed it this is what's on my mind right now you are inside the brain of greg eisenberg and if you liked it share this episode with a friend and share it online and subscribe to our youtube channel and like i said we have no i have no ads i'm not there's no we i there's no ad and uh so i'm doing this you know partially for me because i i think it's it's fun to do but uh and also i think it hopefully people enjoy it so um let me know if you do it's been real later
