When I thought about what it meant to throw an event maybe years ago, it's like, oh, it's so expensive. Like you need sponsors, you need everything. You need to do open bar.

You need to do this, like overthinking it. You don't need to do any of those things. Yes, you can.

Yes, you can build it up to that. You need to host, have the space and whatever you negotiate from there is great. People are just very excited to go to something like that.

It doesn't matter that they're going to have to pay for drinks. That's fine. If you don't have a sponsor, don't want to cover the cost for people's drinks or the venue or whatever, that's fine.

There isn't this expectation or anything. I think you just need to go that mile and host. What are you pouring?

I hear you're pouring a beverage. I'm pouring the most prestigious and pristine sparkling water that I found in my journey for said product. It is the Saratoga Springs sparkling water.

You know the quality with the blue bottle. Not financial advice, not an investor. I'm also drinking some sparkling water.

You know about this arc? I don't know about this. What is this?

It's like a soda stream, but way more beautiful looking and also not sponsored or anything like that. I'm saying I'm trying to one up you. I'm saying you did.

I mean, it's more environmental and I can just- less waste. See, I see where you're going with this. But I got to be honest with you.

I'm not just drinking sparkling water. I'm also drinking it with Como's tequila. Excuse you.

All right, then fine. I will crack open the bottle of body vodka. Okay.

It's going to be one of those podcasts. If you're going to start the opening trying to one-up me, I'm not not going to feel threatened and try and overcompensate. Yeah.

I'm looking forward to this podcast. This is going to be good. Okay.

While you pour yourself a drink- I am as well. While you pour yourself a drink, I checked your LinkedIn before this and you have- It could go a few ways. Yeah.

My LinkedIn is either the worst thing in the world or the best pre-qualifier for who I want to work with or not. Yeah. Well, usually I like to introduce people.

Your title is Insert Very Important Title Here at VaynerFund. What does that mean? That is accurate.

It's not really important what the title is in our little fund, I guess. It could be partner. It could be janitor.

It could be anything. But whatever it is, it is very important. And I want people to know that, that I am very, very important at VaynerFund.

But it's actually just a litmus test because one of my life mottos is don't take life too seriously. You'll never get out alive. And I think that being the marquee title on my LinkedIn stresses that.

So I truly don't take it that seriously. I don't care how important anyone thinks I am. But if you can't take the joke and you scoff at that title, we're probably not going to work well together.

Exactly. And that's the reason I wanted to bring you on is because I think you live a really happy and good life. And you don't take things too seriously.

And you kind of just go with your curiosity. And I'm curious, just like, is that intentional? And, and yeah, how do you think about crafting your life?

Definitely. It is absolutely intentional at this point. I think it was subconscious prior to recent years, I'd say, but now I take a very active role in, I guess, just evaluating how happy things make me from a business perspective, but also from a life perspective, because it has been drilled home that, what do you know, we only have one life, I won't go so far as to quote our beloved neighbor to the north.

We all know what I would say, but had a minor health incident that wound up not being a big deal at all that I'm aware of, because the doctor did close the loop on that by saying, I guess we'll just call it a medical mystery, which was not very comforting. But as far as I know, totally fine happened last year, but it really put life in perspective, because at for a brief moment in time, I genuinely was convinced I was going to die. And that reframed so much for me, where it's like, Oh, how could you not want to just optimize for being happy every single day of your life?

Because it's the most important thing. And like, you're the one that has to wake up and live in your body every day. So you got to go you first.

So I saw I saw a tick tock video as I was like, I don't know, it was like two in the morning. I know you don't have tick tock. And maybe that plays a role into your health into your happiness.

But I was like, I was like, trying to fall asleep. It was like two in the morning. I'm like, swipe, swipe, swipe.

And I get this video of like, why, why are dogs always happy? And apparently, you know, this is whole tick tock around like, well, they, you know, for every one week that a human lives, or sorry, for one day, that is the equivalent to one week for a human. So basically, dogs know their own mortality.

And they know that, you know, their life is short. So they're just by definition, like, you know, when you leave, even if you leave your apartment to go get like the, the mail or something or coffee or gone for two minutes, your dog coming back to you, and they're like, stoked to see you. It's like, oh, my God, where the bill, where have you been?

And I feel which is, which is great. Like, everyone go get a dog. Completely.

What do you think? Yeah, what do you think about that? Do you think like, this new, like, almost like having a lease on life kind of kind of just change it just changed your perspective.

And now like, what what concretely did you change in your life after after you had this new lease on life? I ate that tick tock does resonate with me, it doesn't push me so far as to sign up. But I do like that.

I like that that exists and rings very true. But I guess I guess the new new lease on life, I would say it empowered me to say no more and say no more confidently. Because I just felt confident in saying this doesn't suit me right now and or ever.

And that's speaking in generalities. But I think just empowering me to take control where I know I can take control. And that's, that's a really beautiful thing.

Could you give an example of something that you said no to over the last year and something that you said yes to that you might have not five years ago? Definitely. Um, I think best example is perpetually attempting to eliminate the word should from just overall commitments and everyday life.

There are certain things that we all have to do that maybe we don't want to do. And I'm not saying you can just completely throw everything to a whim and I don't want to do this. So I don't have to do it.

There are things you have to do. But having an honest conversation with yourself around, are you just doing this because you think you have to do it or because you have to do it? So the easiest thing is mostly cutting out networking events.

And those have always been somewhat of a bane of my existence because in the field of venture capital, kind of important to schmooze and network and mingle. But it's usually done with a lack of intention that I think is detrimental. Um, I'll go so far as to say to your mental health, because you're kind of floating around your show up to this event, whether or not you drink doesn't matter, but you're showing up with no real goal and hopefully meeting people.

And then you have folks just like staring at the name tag, if there's a name tag and oh, you're not important, or I don't think you're important or whatever. And it's just kind of soul crushing. So really looking at how you spend your time and showing up in person as a really powerful thing, in my opinion.

So you should only be showing up if you actually want to show up. Um, because people can tell and you just lead a happier life. Do you?

Yeah. Like if you're, if you're trying to make it like in startups or venture, like, do you need to go to networking events? Because both of us don't really, both of us don't go to networking events really.

Like, I think, yeah, I think our vibe is just like, and correct me if I'm wrong. Our vibe is like, we'll just like bring together interesting people and good things happen. But it's, it's, it's more just like among friends.

Like it's never like, yeah. Yeah. Although we did meet at South by Southwest and, but that was, that was before.

That's like, we're talking 2010, 2011. Yeah. That's who knows?

Yeah, exactly. What did we know? Yeah.

Thank you. There we go. What did we know?

Yeah. Knowing what you know now, Phil, do you need to go to networking events if you want your best shot to win at startups or venture? I think it's, it's yes and no.

I think you still have to show up places. I think if you are showing up intentionally at certain events that are hyper specific to what you're interested in, I think that's great. I think you can pre-curate a hat tip to what you're passionate about, what I know you're excellent at, which is community.

I think you can find a sub community or two either on Reddit or on X now or something and go to events either online or in person in that circle, kind of to the point that you said, like, we like to only go with friends. Well, usually our friends know interesting people. And one of my favorite things to do is to, to host a small event where it's like, Hey, you show up, bring one person that nobody knows, or you think nobody knows and say that to 10 to 20 people.

And what do you know? You have a 50 person event, but it's really close knit, intentional. I brought this person because, and I think that's a much more interesting way to go about it.

But if you are trying to get your start and you're trying to break in, I think you find, you find, or you try and narrow in on what you're looking for a bit first, rather than the broad, I want to break into tech. But like, what sector do you want to be an engineer? Do you want to aspiration to be a COO one day?

Do you just want to be a CEO or you have ideas, something, hone in on what it is and find the sub community. And I think that's a really powerful and interesting way to go about it because you can learn a lot more that way. I think.

Totally. And also like the host is underrated, right? Like if you're the host, it's like, if you, if you're the person reaching out to people and being like, Hey, I'm curating this dinner of like DTC founders in New York who have between one and 5 million a year in revenue.

It's like, even if you're not one of those people, but you're trying to be one of those people, like it's, it's, I feel like it's a pretty good move. Yeah. And people remember that you bring people together and that holds a special place in people's hearts.

And it's, it's really nice to facilitate that. I personally enjoy that feeling quite a bit. And I'd say even to this day, it happened maybe two days ago.

The listeners don't know this, but they're going to know now we co-hosted an orange wine party in Brooklyn, right before the pandemic. Somebody literally brought it up to me yesterday. That was a plus one saying how fun it was.

And this happened in 2019 and it was pretty low lift from our part and it was awesome. Yeah. We did.

However, I full disclosure, we did bring the COVID 19 virus to America and, and spread it across the world because it was January, 2020, I think. And, uh, we did have one member, the DJ, in fact, Tyler Lemko comedian, Tyler Lemko did spread that we're using names. Oh, oops.

You know, I thought we're having like a, you know, an honest conversation. Open, honest. Yeah.

I, I appreciate the transparency. Yeah. The Como's I guess is starting to hit.

It hasn't officially. Yeah, maybe, but that, that also hasn't been confirmed nor denied, I'd say. Right.

But there is a lot of data suggesting that it may not have been, it wasn't not, not a super spreader event. Totally. But we didn't know.

Yeah. But we didn't know. Uh, so, but yeah, I mean, I also randomly get like people, people hit, you know, mentioning that, that those events and that event and, uh, it pays dividend both like work-wise and just like personal.

Like some of my happiest moments have been throwing, these events. And I feel like people, people listening should just like, don't go to events, throw events. Yeah.

Like to summarize, like, I think that's great advice. Okay, cool. So do, do what you would do.

I mean, do what you do, just trying to get on a call with somebody. If you don't know a group of folks, like slide in the D DMS respectfully, have a plan on the event. Doesn't have to be a blockbuster thing.

You don't have to spend a ton of money. It could literally, be a meetup in your city's local park of like marketing minds or something or whatever niche you, you kind of want to touch on. Doesn't have to cost a lot of money.

Doesn't have to involve drinking. You can craft your own event and just see who shows up, invite people and see who show up. It's as simple as that.

And maybe nobody shows up and that's fine too. And figure out what went wrong. Product, product, product test on your event invites and iterate.

Yep. Totally. What's okay.

Actually, let's go back to, so that's something that you learned, I guess, in your twenties, no networking events, be the host. Um, so you're saying no to networking events. What's, what's something that you're saying yes to more of these days?

No, no to, no to, I think no networking events is too rigid. I think no to attending events without intention, I would say. Yeah.

Yeah. Um, what's an example of a yes? Um, an example of a yes, obviously, I mean, it's a unique experiences where something's curated or it's a once, not necessarily once in a lifetime thing, but it's a very unique opportunity where you wouldn't otherwise do something specific example to spot, stop being so vague.

Um, this isn't in the past year or so, but, um, a few years back, I, I was at a group dinner curated dinner. Great. Awesome.

On theme with what we're talking about. Uh, this gentleman, uh, wearing a very wacky blazer, hindsight, it wasn't that wacky, but in the moment I was like, oh, this is a pretty cool fashion combo way to go guy. Talked to him for maybe 10, 15 minutes.

And he invited me in a few weeks to his birthday party. The birthday party was a bit unconventional because it was a three day event and it wasn't hosted in New York city where we met. He was going to host a large group of people in Tulsa, Oklahoma and program an entire trip to Tulsa to show the city because there's a huge entrepreneurial vibe.

He was leading the charge on awareness around Tulsa as a hub for business and SMB and technology and opening folks eyes to a city. They may consider just a flyover situation that in that moment, I said, yes, I'd known this guy for 15 minutes and I couldn't think of another time that it would have just a curated view into the inner workings of Tulsa. And I was like, yes, this sounds interesting.

Worst comes to worst. I book a flight and leave early if it's terrible. I didn't think it was going to be, and it wound up being awesome.

And I met a lot of incredible people that I'm actually super close friends with to this day. So long winded way to say unique experiences. What about that blazer guy turn, you know, made you think that this was this you can trust him?

He I didn't know. Actually, he just he was very personable, charismatic. I mean, that's that could go negatively, obviously, because it could wind up being a cult leader, but had a good vibe.

Cool. Yeah, I think I actually said yes to something that I wouldn't otherwise say yes to last week. So which is, I went to a Tony Robbins event last week.

Incredible. So I got a fun segue off of what I just said. But yeah.

Yeah, I mean, I wasn't going to publicly talk about this, or even privately talk about it, to be honest. But here we are. So I went as a guest to the Tony Robbins event.

It's the Business Mastery event, which is like more focused on like, how do you grow your business? So it's yeah, I don't know if that makes it any better. But that's that's what it is.

And I was invited to as a guest from Ali Abdal, who's like a big YouTuber, and this guy Joe Gannon, who helps me with the podcast and a few other, you know, social content stuff. So they invited me, they're like, hey, it's like literally tickets start at $10,000. You're going to be sitting courtside, like front row.

And Tony Robbins was literally like spitting on me. Like I should have brought an umbrella, honestly, in retrospect. And I gotta say, one of the better things that I said yes to in the last 12 months is going to this Tony Robbins thing.

What what's driving that? And I want to I want to preface it with I always had a lot of mixed feelings about Tony Robbins. Because I was kind of like, it's he's like a cult leader in a lot of ways.

And he he feels a bit like I felt at least before going in this, he's like a bit taking advantage of people, like selling these crazy expensive seminars. And like, maybe people don't have the money and like, bringing them into his quote unquote cult. But I went under the preface of two, two reasons I went number one, I was like, he's probably the greatest salesperson ever.

So I just want to like be in the room with like a world class salesperson, number one. And the second thing is, if he is leading a cult, there's like a fine line between a community and a cult. So I want to understand, like, how he does it right there, right?

That feels very fair. Yeah, very fair. So I gave up five days curated a hell of a community.

Yes, he has. Yes, like, say what you want about him, like objectively, he has. So I gave up five days of my life to spend it in West Palm Beach.

And I went to it. And it was so good for so many reasons. But number one, he is the greatest salesperson of all time.

Like, how he structures his, like the whole seminar, and how he like uses music music, like basically what he does is like, he'll, like the whole five days, he's using like the same five songs over and over again, he gets you to like get up and like shout. And then like, at the point of like, peak state, he like comes in. And he'll be like, Oh, by the way, you should like totally sign up to another seminar of mine.

You're like, so stoked and jazzed. Yes. So there's, yes.

Yeah, yes, yes, yes. So he so what he would do like to give you like a concrete example, like he would, you know, let's say we're learning because there's a, you know, business mastery, let's say we're learning about finance. And he would be talking about like, hey, let me go through like Robin's research, which is like one of his companies.

And like the P&L from Robin's research, and you're going through it. And you're like, see if I, you know, if I do these strategies, I can increase leads. And if I do this, and then he after, after, you know, he'll like put like, Katy Perry's, what's that song?

What's the big Katy Perry? Firework? Yeah, like fireworks come on.

He would be like, it's your company and like fireworks comes on. And it's like, raise your hand if this is your company, and like you're stoked that this is happening to you. And everyone's like, Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And then at the end of it, he like makes an ask and be like, Hey, by the way, like, buy my thing. So that's just one example. He's an incredible salesperson, he understands the power of state.

And I like it. I liked it. I thought it was very valuable.

I also not to put words in your mouth. But as you were telling that story, I was thinking around and I don't know if this is going to be the next episode of theirs or anything. But I know you've been very hot on the concept of multipreneur.

And I would say that is a peak example of multipreneurship where he is essentially not a personal holding company, but he has a holding company of sorts and every piece in and he does see why that probably resonates with you. He's a multipreneur that curates a rabid community. Yeah, seems like a Greg Eisenberg cup of tea first and foremost.

Yeah, I didn't I actually didn't realize the multipreneur bit until until going. So first of all, the guy's nearly a billionaire. Didn't know that he co owns 110 companies.

That and like, yeah, it's wild. Absolutely wild. And, you know, the way it was structured was like the event, like it was at Palm Beach Convention Center.

So there's like the stage in the convention center. And then as you're walking in, there's like different booths, but the booths are his companies. Right.

It's like his accounting firm, his legal firm. So he doesn't accept advertisers and sponsors to his events, which is like totally like multipreneur creator led sort of entrepreneur vibe is to like obviously sell your own stuff. That that seems like the the dream, the multipreneurship dream.

Yeah. Yeah, he's he's definitely doing it. And he's got a lot of subtle ways that he's able to sell people.

Another kind of like interesting thing that I didn't know is if you're going to a Tony Robbins event, like bring a Canada goose jacket because he sets the he like, I literally walked by the thermostat. It's 60 degrees. He sets his 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

So he sets it to be really cold. And the reason he does that is he wants people to like get up and move so that they get like the energy flowing. And it's like a Tony Robbins thing, apparently.

Interesting. Yeah. What was that?

What about 16 degrees Celsius? Something like that. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Cold.

Be careful. Cold. Yeah.

Yeah. It's cold. It's cold temperature.

Cold degrees. So yeah, I think overall, five years ago, 10 years ago, would I have said yes to a Tony Robbins event? No.

This time said yes. Learned a lot. Glad I went.

I love that you went. That's that's fascinating. Yeah, I agree.

Probably one of the greatest salesmen of all time. Yeah. And the interesting thing is, while that while the event was happening, Alex Hermosi, who's like a popular, like he's really popular.

Do you know, you know him now? Nope. Okay.

I love that. Like, I feel like I'm not surprised you don't know him. But he's basically so Alex Hermosi wrote a book called 100 million dollar offers.

It's like how to craft an irresistible offer. He's like big on YouTube. And I also keep in mind, I asked Steph Curry to his face what he did for a living because I just didn't know.

And I didn't. I don't really follow the NBA. And this is years ago.

But that just especially if I don't know somebody that's the worst litmus test. I don't really know anybody is totally. What did Steph Curry say, by the way?

He said he played ball for the Warriors. And then we moved on. He's so nice.

You know who co owns the Warriors? Tony Robbins. Tony Anthony Robbins.

I didn't expect the middle name to get in there. But no, I think it's, it's Tony. I don't know if his middle name is Anthony.

No, it's it's it's Anthony Robbins is a co owner of his 110 companies. Is that's definitely yeah, it's wild. So all roads lead back to Tony Robbins.

That's right. Anyway, I I led us astray. I'm sorry.

Alex Hermosi guy went from like zero to millions of subscribers in the last 18 months. Millions, you know, now he went on he got on Twitter like 18 months ago. And like now he's tweeting and getting 1000s of likes within the first hour.

He also threw while the Tony Robbins event was happening, he threw a launch event for his new book called 100 million dollar leads. And he had more than 500,000 people in the live stream at the event. Wow.

Yeah, which is that's wild. Yeah, completely wild. And anyone who's interested in like crafting offers or you and our lead, like how do you like get leads like you should watch it just because like the same reason I went to Tony Robbins like learn how to be the best salesperson of all time.

Alex Hermosi same sort of thing. And the interesting thing about Alex Hermosi and Tony Robbins is the stage for Alex Hermosi when he was doing his live webinar was the exact same stage that Tony Robbins has where in the back you have all these like zoom people watching and it's all these like kind of Brady Bunch style. You got you got to check it out.

So while I was at the event, I will. While I was at the Tony Robbins event, I was like, hey guys, did you did you see the Alex Hermosi event yesterday? And they were like, yeah.

And I was like, doesn't it look like the Tony Robbins set? And one of the people I was with said, oh, Hermosi is like one of the biggest Tony Robbins followers. And he specifically crafted his stage and vibe to be like a Tony Robbins event, which leads me to my thesis that Alex Hermosi is the modern day Tony Robbins for young people.

I don't think that is much of a stretch based on the facts you have presented. Yeah. So that's my that's my goal.

I thought you were going to say initially that you were at the Tony Robbins event in the live stream simultaneously. And that double Tony Robbins basically. Yeah, too much.

Yeah. Airpod in one ear, Tony spitting on you on the right ear. Yeah, I think that would have been a lot.

But yeah, I'll be real with you. I'm still like processing. I'm still processing the Tony event.

I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah.

I'm not a no. What? What's an event that you've gone to the last year or two?

Besides from the Tulsa thing, that's really like change your perception on things and really like, because you're always going to events traveling and stuff like that. I like to just show up where there's a large cultural event happening, not necessarily going to the event itself because a that gets wildly expensive and be you just don't have to. I mean, case in point, we met at South by Southwest.

The only time I've ever had a badge to South by Southwest is when for some reason they let me do a panel or speak. I've never gotten one on my own, but I've gone what eight times at this point you go because it's the largest group gathering of people that you likely want to know or are relevant to either your goals or interests or something showing up at a large cultural event and all the ancillary things that happen around it is a huge unlock because you just you go where the people are and you figure it out for the most part. But just showing up is a big piece of it.

And I feel like I'm stumbling over my words and not quite conveying, but the past I used to make fun of people that would show up at things like that, like the Super Bowl or whatever. But I have walked back that stance. I have dropped my judgment because now I do it too.

I don't I don't go to the Super Bowl, like the game itself, but I show up in the city that it's happening and you go maybe a day earlier, leave the morning of, and there's a lot of relevant things. As long as you know, a few other folks going serendipity lends itself very well to these situations. And you wind up leaving with a bunch of either new friends or contacts goals.

And it is actually wildly productive where I thought that previously it's you're just showing up to party. You don't have to party. You just have to be there.

Yeah, yeah, totally. And it's like going to these events, some sometimes because there's also like, you don't want to go to too many events, right? You want to be somewhat heads.

You actually have to work sometimes. Yeah, you have to work sometimes. But, you know, yeah, I guess that's a question for you.

Like how, what's the right amount of lifting up your head versus putting your head down? I mean, if you're not going to events, three nights, I'm kidding, I have no idea. I think the balance is different for everyone because sometimes I'll show up places and go to these events.

And part of it is to meet other people. But part of it is also, I have learned that exploring new places or going places that I know and just being a part of that event that inspires me creatively. And that creativity could mean strategic structuring of an investment or a deal or something, or it could mean creating content or a piece of art or thinking about things differently.

Creativity means a lot of different things to me, but that inspires me to be my best and makes me happy. And I feel top of my game when I'm doing those things. So as long as that feeling persists, I'm game to keep bouncing around and checking things out.

And I know, I know when I'm getting close to my limit, and that's when it's time to kind of hunker down and I guess, I guess go a bit more heads down, but heads down along the way, because I mean, we can work from anywhere, we have the blessing to be able to do that. And as long as you responsibly balance it, I mean, you just have to listen to yourself. Yeah, I think that's really, that's good advice.

Like listening, listening to yourself, you're good. Like, I feel like inherently, you know, like, oh, hey, I'm going to too many events. I'm tired, you know, or, but I think like thinking about it as like, I like how you kind of think about it as like a dose of inspiration.

You're like, okay, I'm going to go to the Super Bowl because, or the Super, like, I'm going to go to LA when the Super Bowl is happening because, you know, there's these two or three like side events almost that I want to go to. And I'm going to come back, like, I'm going to come back to New York with like, ready to go and hit the pavement. And then like, boom, heads down one week, two weeks, three weeks.

And then you're like, okay, another thing ready for that dose. Like thinking about it almost as like a battery and like charging your battery and, and it depletes. Is that how you think about it?

Totally. Yeah, that's exactly right. That's, it is very battery based.

And then another point to the whole, just show up where things are happening. Other people are more prone and open to meeting and engaging. So if you, there's always something to be done for me and probably you in LA, there's always like some sort of business deal or some thing we can accomplish if we visit there.

But the pretense of it being a major cultural event, I think people are more apt to meet with you or get that coffee. Whereas like, if you just show up randomly January 21st for no other reason, Hey, I'm in LA. No, sorry, I'm busy.

There's, there's, there's stuff going on, whatever. But if you, you're there and other people are there for an event and everyone's already in that mode, you're more likely to be able to sit down with folks you aspirationally wanted to sit down with or needed to book time with or something. There's just, um, the, the receptors are a bit more open, I find.

So it's, it's a good hack. But isn't, isn't the, the counter to that? Like I have a friend who lives in Austin and I actually went to South by Southwest, you know, what was it?

Six, a few, you know, five months ago, six months ago. I miss it. And yeah.

And when I texted him, he was like, dude, like you wait, you know, South by Southwest is so busy. Like meet me at this dinner. Uh, you know, and I spoke to him for like 15 minutes.

He's like, why don't you come to Austin when like, you know, it's, it's not South by Southwest. Do you find also it's helpful? Like, I feel like going to an event, a big event, you can kind of get like quick hits of people, but like, if you really want to spend time with them, I don't know if it happens during the big events.

What do you think? Oh no, I, I fully agree with that. I think to, to deepen or advance a relationship in a meaningful way, like whether that's friendship, business, whatever, it's really, it's really tough to do in that setting.

But I think for the initial contact and kind of, yeah, the initial contact and making, making an inroad, I guess it's perfect. It's the quick hit. Like, it's great.

Like you see if it's even interesting for the other person for you, and then you can take it from there. Cause then you necessarily don't have to be in person. You could hop on a zoom, FaceTime them.

You have the open line of communication to text or send a message or send an email. And you just have the context of that quick hit and meeting in person that I think is more important than anything. Cause you're never going to forget the initial feeling of meeting somebody or the initial like 15 minutes that you spent with somebody.

And as long as that went well, the door is open and it's kind of yours to mess up from there. And maybe you book a followup trip to Austin because you met a bunch of cool people and there's strategic things you can do by revisiting Austin. Then yeah, you can, you can further build that relationship and it doesn't necessarily have to be in person.

So I definitely agree with you that it's really tough to go deep and like build something super meaningful in that context, but it opens up way more doors in my opinion to, to get that, to fill the top of your funnel, I'd say for a marketing term. What do you think in terms of like closing the funnel or going to the bottom of the funnel? I was chatting with someone this morning who was like, who was telling me having a place, like a secondary home, you know, in a cool, interesting place as a destination to throw events.

She was saying that that's like probably one of the most valuable investments that you can make because like you can throw like, what was it? Michael Rubin, you saw you through the white party. Uh, that was crazy.

Tell people, tell people, I know, you know what that event was. Tell people what that event was, who Michael Rubin is and why that though, it's the event of the year. Michael Rubin is a wildly successful businessman that has catapulted in popularity in the past few years, years, despite him being a wildly successful businessman for decades now, I'd say.

Um, he's done an absolutely incredible job of tapping into culture as a whole and making sure that he is top of mind, culturally hanging out with the most interesting rappers, up and coming rappers, musicians, and, um, television stars surrounding himself with key people and seemingly doing it in an authentic way. Um, where he has established this, this white party that he does in July, uh, every year now as the, the event of the year for the most part, it's the who's who of relevant folks held at his house in the Hamptons. Um, the, the video that was cut up this year from this white party essentially looked like a Hollywood trailer for the most part.

Like it was wild. Um, I was super jealous that Gary got to go, um, and has gone to go to everyone. Still don't have that plus one, but that's okay.

Um, that's, that's on me for not being relevant enough, but that's fine. Uh, but another point to Michael Rubin and his strategy, it's not just him kind of swagger jacking. Well, that's a terrible term.

It's not just him trying to commandeer culture and inauthentically just post selfies with famous people. Like sure, he posts that, but he did, uh, have a pretty interesting soundbite where somebody's like, well, what do you, what do you get out of speaking to Quavo or, or another rapper or something like what's, what's, what's the point? Are you just trying to be relevant?

He's like, well, no, they have really interesting techniques for how they've either marketed their own music or products that they've sold. And it gives him a different perspective to accomplish business challenges that he has in his own business by speaking to these musicians, musicians, because they've obviously been successful in their own right. And it's just a thought exercise for him where maybe he can add some value from a business perspective to them and they provide insights that he normally wouldn't have.

So he's really, really intentional and smart around curating that. So Michael Rubin, just, just to be clear, he's the founder of fanatics, which brings in billion dollars a year, billions in revenue. They own the licenses to like the NBA, NHL, stuff like that.

I'm looking at some of the guests, like it's pretty crazy. Like the guests were Kim Kardashian, Jack Harlow, Travis Scott, Laurie Harvey, Justin Bieber. Like it goes on and on and on.

I guess like I look at that and I'm like, yes, obviously he's a incredible businessman and has done really well for himself. But like Gary, for example, like has like in my mind, at least like he's on the same level ish. And like, why isn't Gary throwing the white party?

Right? Why, why? Like this guy obviously took, wanted to, it must have been his, one of his main, his main goal, like to, to throw an event like this.

Right. And was one of his main goals, A and, and B, and that goes, this goes back to like my earlier point, which might not relate to a lot of people, but like having the second home as the destination, super valuable. Like, I think I'm looking at pictures of his place.

It's like pretty, pretty insane. Oh, it's epic. Yeah.

Yeah. But it goes back to what we started speaking about almost at the beginning where it's be the host and listen to how we're speaking about it right now. Like it's, it obviously makes an impact.

We have not gone, we haven't been invited, but now it's maybe this aspirational thing. And we see that he is this beacon that brings together really relevant people. That's really interesting.

And we're talking about that. So that in and of itself, I think is pretty important. And then I know you mentioned like, maybe it's not attainable or accessible for folks to own this own the second home as the destination.

But I think we can even walk it back quite a bit is host and have a destination. You don't have to own it. I mean, you know, you could have an agreement with a coffee shop or something that where you can host things for free, as long as you bring folks in and just to have the ability to be the host and have a destination.

Those are two massive keys and big unlocks, I'd say. I mean, when we hosted our party in, in Brooklyn and Williamsburg, it was, we got a free space, right? At a Gertie's, that's right.

And they basically were like, so picture this listeners, because anyone could basically throw their own version of a white party. That's, that's my come to Jesus moment right now. So I agree with you.

Yeah. I love where this is going. Yes.

Basically, I started having coffee here and yeah, coffee at this coffee shop, met the owner. He basically was telling me, yeah, I've got this amazing space downstairs. And I wish someone would use it.

And I was like, well, me and Phil might, you know, could use it. And then he was like, yeah, well, you can, you know, he's a brunch place and a coffee place, right? Like they, they close early.

And he was like, if you, if you give me a percentage, was that how it worked? I don't even remember. I think we give him like a percentage of, yeah, he, he was operating the bar and we gave him percentage of the bar.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

So, which is totally cool for us. We got to use this great space and he made money because he wasn't using the space. Uh, actually he was stoked.

And I remember him and he was like, oh, come back anytime. Like he was so, so excited. In fact, when COVID hit, he was like, oh, I wish we, you know, during like peak COVID, he was like, yeah, they're an event.

I was like, dude, like, I don't know. But, um, the, the point is, the point is like, you don't need to own the place. You need to just, you, you need to own the mission and you need to own like the idea of the event.

And, and then, you know, you could knock on some doors, get the space. And then the space could be an attractive, like, oh, I, you know, Gertie's maybe isn't that place, but like, you know, or maybe it is that place. For what our goal was.

Yeah, it was, it was perfect. Yeah. But yeah, no, I totally agree with you.

You can, and you can do varying scales of this. I mean, when, when I thought about what it meant to throw an event maybe years ago, it's like, oh, it's so expensive. Like you need sponsors, you need everything.

You need to do open bar. You need to do this, like overthinking it. You don't need to do any of those things.

Yes, you can. Yes. You can build it up to that.

I'm pretty sure that the white party didn't have a cash bar. Sure. But you just, you need to host, have the space and whatever you negotiate from there is great.

People are just very excited to go to something like that in that context that, I mean, it doesn't matter that they're going to have to pay for drinks. That's fine. If you don't have a sponsor, don't want to cover the cost for people's drinks or the venue or whatever, that's fine.

Like there, there isn't this expectation or anything. I think you just need to go that mile and host. Yeah.

No one's going to figure everything else out. No one's going to remember the, the cost, like the cash bar. Like that's not what people remember of from the event, right?

They're, they remember. And if they do, then there probably was something else wrong with the event. Yeah.

Totally. If, if people are coming to the event cause they're getting free, free wine or free, whatever, free food, like, I don't know if they're there for the mission. Right.

And so that's the most commodity of commodities is the free food and drink. It's like, well, our event has free food and drink and it's like, so do the other 10 that I probably found on Groupon. So like, yeah.

Thoughts? Exactly. So yeah, I'm just thinking to myself, like, man, I should be throwing some more events.

Um, I am throwing, I am going to be throwing some multi-preneur events. Um, which as you should. Yeah.

I hope you do one in New York. Yeah. I think, um, I also think I w I want to say that we, you know, IRL is just underrated.

Like IRL events are underrated, especially like post COVID people are just trying to like, people are excited to go to events. And so there is an opportunity right now for people, for people listening who like your, the chance of your event working in 2023 is higher than the chance of your event working in 2019. I agree.

I totally agree with that. And it all is rooted in, in what you mentioned, like the, the purpose, the mission, why are you holding this event? What's the theme?

As long as you keep that top of mind and, and organize it accordingly and curate the right people that you think fit the bill for the room that would get value on any side of it. And you host that, that it's great. Before we, uh, head out, give me one or two stories of some of the best events you went to and why they were so, so good.

Cause I know you've been to a lot of events. I think one of the most fun events, um, this is from years and years ago. And I thought about it because you mentioned like, why doesn't Gary throw his own white party?

He did. Um, back in the day, he had what was called the secret wine party back in 20, no, not even 20, 2007, 2008, even predates me. And we've been working together for 13 years.

He would, um, literally roll up to a bar. You did this started in South by Southwest say, Hey, I'm going to bring a bunch of people here. Is it cool if we just throw a party?

And they'd be like, yeah, yeah. Okay. And just watching it come together was insane.

On the third iteration, like had done it successfully. We'd bring wine down. There would be wine available.

I won't expand on that. Cause I don't know if it's fully on the open up, whatever. Uh, if you can do that in Texas, fine, but would literally send out a tweet.

Hey, secret wine party happening at the address. Thousand people would show up, line out the door. And it was so fun and just watching it come together as a community and evolve.

And then it did get a little weird at one point because people would start following some of us around the city because they thought that we would be scoping out venues and they'd be trying to get the jump on the tweet. But, um, the spontaneity and the, the relevance of it just being his community, that was super special and very cool to see. Um, another, Oh, one of the best events that I've been to is was thrown by my friend, Dan, who actually met on that Tulsa trip that I mentioned.

Um, he, he is super creative, loves bringing people together. He created a dinner series that is no longer in the mix where it was an experiential dinner. And part, part of it was, it was all themed.

And it was course based and there was an activity or a theme per course. One of them, he had a train going around his dining room table. He was wearing a conductor hat, of course, and the train was carrying arancini.

And one of the courses, well, you had to build your own plate and it was a jigsaw puzzle. And it was tied into what the, the food is being served. And that was just so special and memorable.

And the underlying guest list was, Hey, I invited these five people. You all bring one person that no one knows and we'll have a dinner and meet people. And the curation and experience was amazing.

I'll never forget it. I hope to replicate it someday, but I don't, I'm not as big of a visionary as he is. Do you remember the dinner you, Oh my God, I just pulling this up.

I was like, what's the name of that guy who, cause I, the craziest dinner I went to was in New York in February, 2020. And I just pulled up my email and it was you who invited me and it was at Dan's place. Yeah.

And I was at one of these dinners. I'm looking at the invite. Wasn't it insane?

So first of all, I'm reading the invite now. Do you think I can read this or is it too like, um, I think he'd prefer if we didn't. Okay.

Anyways, it's a terrible reference. I'm sorry. Let's just say it was, it was rule based.

Yes. You're looking at the rule flyer, right? Exactly.

That's right. What can we say about this dinner that could give people insight into how to throw a really interesting event? I can't say what happened at the event, correct?

Uh, no, you, I think, eh, let's not, but the pinnacle rule, the pinnacle rule was you cannot talk about work or what you do. That's right. And that in and of itself was powerful.

And I think freeing at the same time, because I, I think a crutch that people tend to use for better or for worse is just the first question out of your mouth. What do you do? Yeah.

It's like, that's, that's a pretty loaded question. And usually the context means like, what do you do for work? But it could be anything, but eliminating that I think is really key.

Especially in a place like New York where there's a lot, you know? Yeah. Do I don't, I don't need even, you need to explain that.

And I guess like that's, you know, bring it all back, like insert very important title here at Vayner fund. That's why you're like, okay, the re like real people will, will get it and you'll hopefully, you know, you'll be, you know, maybe that's like the best way to do it. Like to get like really interesting people to attract, you know, attracted to you.

Maybe. Yeah. So some takeaways I have from this is one, be the host, uh, to be like Dan and create something that's unique and interesting and unlike everything else out there.

Uh, three, go to, go to, you don't need to go to the event. Like you don't need to go to the Superbowl, but there's something that magical happens at some of these bigger events where it's like, go to the side event. Don't go to the main event.

And, um, I'm, I don't know if you're familiar and sorry to throw you off from your take, but group chat, if you're familiar, it's drama, Demorthy and on, on. Um, they have a term called boondoggling and that's what, uh, essentially showing up at the major culture event and just kind of being there and not necessarily going to the event itself. They call that boondoggling.

And that I think is a pretty interesting term. Yeah. I mean, I like the word, I like the word.

Yeah. Yeah. So boondoggling.

And then I think it's just taking stock in what, in what you're saying yes to and what you're saying no to and, and being okay. Intention. Yeah.

Setting attention. That's really, that's very Tony Robbins of you, Phil. Hmm.

Hmm. Well, well, well. And then last but not least, like in terms of multi-preneurship, like Tony Robbins, in terms of multi-preneurship and sales, you know, prowess, like go, go watch Tony Robbins and listen to him just as like, you don't have to listen to what he's saying, but just like in the fact that like understanding his techniques for talking and selling is just, and creating events is mind blowing.

And, and same with the Alex Hermosey event, like go watch that, listen to that. And it's no matter what you're doing, like it will be, it will help you become a better salesperson and, and life is sales. So, so it's a good skill to know.

Life is sales. It's mic drop. Mic drop.
