now you know we've been following vfriend since the beginning we love the project so much um what got you into nft communities in this whole web3 world um basically an incredible combination of my entire life right like i'm in my office obviously i put out a a lot of content so people have seen this like i've been collecting things my whole life right sports cards it's just who i am um wine collecting and i've been you know at the forefront of consumer trends and so there's videos of me in 2010 talking about virtual currency and farmville and you know um um just a a brouhaha of events um culminating with the explosion of sports cards again which kept me even closer to collectibles covid allowing for a lot of interesting behaviors to pop up natural things that were happening like roblox and fortnite and nba 2k and madden skins and i've just been watching the digital thing being an early investor in ethereum and really just seeing nba top shot and crypto punks happen and did my 30 40 hours of homework on the current state of nfts not what i knew about crypto kitties in 2017 and basically did what i do all the time whether that was snapchat or tick tock or musically or podcasting or to your point i'm very fortunate at this point to have a reputation of being solid at having a sense of what's happening and that's what happened to me i thought nfts were going to happen and they've happened and the way i've looked that learned my whole career is by doing and so i knew i had to have my own project i've been working on a toy brand called workplace warriors for a long time um and that in essence was vfriends so it wasn't hard for me to take these characters like patient panda and empathy elephant and turn them into an nft project instead of a collectible toys project so i'm incredibly excited to be at the forefront of this stuff and nfts for me are an opportunity for human beings to create economies and economies are healthy when you bring value to the economy and i'm very good at bringing value to my constituents and that is my plan with this project can you so i just want to double down on one thing you said right there sorry so you said like the 30 to 40 hours of homework you did what is your process so many people would benefit from hearing this like when you get excited about a new idea you're a very curious person everything i've always listened to and read about you is just like your innate curiosity is very real how do you go do that 30 40 hours of homework like do you have a special way that you go into that rabbit hole to figure something out yep first it's the mental commitment right it's like i'm doing this right like so it starts with mental commitment because my time is valuable um everyone's time is valuable my time is valuable because of the opportunities i have other people's time is valuable because people perceive their time is valuable so people don't like wasting time on something that's a fad i've always used humility and curiosity to say and intuition to say okay there's something here when it's something as new as nfts i start with youtube because i don't read well but i listen well and watch well so it was literally like nft 101 videos you know and then i then it was very heavy twitter search which led me to realizing people were very very aggressively active on discord so then i joined a bunch of discords and then listened to podcasts read a ton of twitter hours and hours of twitter conversations had hypotheses googled those hypotheses googled the counterpoint to those hypotheses that's important i'm very careful to not get caught in the eco chamber i'm almost like a i'm a boxer i'm a counter puncher right i i want to know the alternative the right click and save the bad for the environment the fads like i want to know every counterpoint i it's what keeps me from going in on things it's why i'm not loud about everything it's why i can be quiet or talk about the same thing for a year and a half it means nothing's come along that is worthy of my reputational risk to get loud about the right um so that that's my process let's talk about uh failure for a second i know how bullish you are in nfts i'm you know we're both super bullish how how does nfts fail you know is there a world where this just doesn't pan out no but that's the macro that that says if you ask me this question in 1996 about the internet right dot com failed 99 of the projects on the open sea top rankings top 200 right now are incredibly vulnerable against our valuation let me say that nice and slow 99 and by the way for everybody's watching but that's 90 or 93 or 99 like the far majority of i'm gonna do it right now in real time i'm going right now to open sea i'll pull it up too yep i'm going to rankings i'm doing last i'm gonna do all time i'm gonna do last 30 days all chains when i look at you know even the icons like board ape and crypto punks like doodles great project chain runners super interesting cool cats cryptos i love gremlin uh cyber cons killing an artifact had their monster drop the littles has some momentum right now right um um swamp first is a cute little one that i'm pretty hot on um me bits an iconic one from the crypto punks comic doing everything right lately and structurally in my opinion v friends my own um creature world i've been on the record of what i think about danny called lazy lions a really emphatic community um every one of the things i just mentioned vulnerable so how do you you know why because they're too valuable right now right but but guess what in what i just mentioned there's an ebay and amazon in 1999 the problem is the arrow of progress the arrow of progress is pointing up and if you go and bet on the space the macro it's headed in that direction does block chains that do affirmation of ownership and contracts is here for the rest of everyone's life right it's here so what is the right way then slowly when people say or nf how are nfts i say stuffed animals stuffed animals have been here to stay for the last 200 years not every stuffed animal company has turned out well beanie babies was a fad strawberry strawberry shortcake my little pony have been iconic garbage patch kids iconic in some ways disney stuff other things you know the wuzzles had a good year stuffed animals were here to stay not every stuffed animal toys and collectibles are here to stay not every toy and collectible was worth money art is here to stay sports cards are here to stay not every sports card nfts are here to stay for the rest of our lives the the far majority of projects in this gold rush cannot maintain their value because the supply of nfts that are coming into the market is extraordinary so how do we create i totally agree with you i think and i think it's like a great analogy that you're making to the dot-com burst as an example pets.com and the way i think about it is like okay if i'm a normal person then what i want to do is i want to invest in the nasdaq like i just want to invest in the index of the entire thing because i know that it's headed that way and it's going to be amazing and there's a right future you mean ethereum yeah well so that's the question i have for you but but is ethereum yahoo and is going to win the first seven years of search and is is solana going to come is it solana is the ethereum is it something we don't know the answer is you can diversify i'm sitting on e i'm sitting on other currencies i'm buying a ton of different nft the reason i went into nfts more than currency is my theory is if ethereum loses i can bridge over my crypto punks right so to me the nft asset class feels in a lot of ways like an easier bet if you feel like you really know which nfts you want to invest in but then you kind of need a way to do that because not everyone has your specific knowledge base or your ability to understand all the nuance and go and learn it they're going to be people my parents as an example they might want to participate in this growth so that they can benefit from it in their retirement but your parents will participate leisurely because they have a son who's going to be like hey you should buy this one or to your point they'll buy bitcoin or ethereum or or maybe in a year solana or something else and that's going to be it like like what people you guys are youngsters what i learned in 95 6 7 8 9 10 2000 2001 with wine library was at first everybody told me nobody would ever buy wine on the internet like at all so that was where we're at now nfts are stupid right click all that right it's so funny i have a lot of friends in their 40s and 50s who became their parents people that don't understand nfts that make that joke are the same people that didn't get a cell phone because they like their pager yeah it's easier to hate on nft on nfts i think than to embrace it for the vast majority let me give you a news alert everyone hated on the iphone over to blackberry everybody hated on cell phones over pagers everybody hated on websites over newspapers like again you guys are young enough that you haven't been through enough cycles you know it you read it i read about home computers that's how i projected the internet but like it's just super clear like people hate on all big shifts because they don't understand it so how do you figure out you mentioned your process of learning about the one once you fit once you kind of start to have that inkling do you just surround yourself or talk to the smartest people you know to figure out what are they excited about what are they working on on the weekend so that you can then go learn about those things like how do you actually get that first spark of curiosity either a random tweet comment on my social cold email because of where i am in my career or to your point no question kevin rose one of the smarter consumer internet people i know when we were talking about x-men comics and jordan rookie cards when he said hey do you know what a crypto do you have a crypto punk and i said i'm not sure what that is and he said you remember crypto kids i was like of course like i'd already known about top shot i met roham a couple months before top shot launched i knew nfts were brewing i was busy it was the holidays last year last year was still very hardcore covid so i was trying to navigate my company um but as soon as he said that i'm like you know what i'm gonna dig in a little bit deeper and so yes and what's been really ironic whether it's dave morin whether you know it's kevin collarin whether it's msg or harper reed or you know aaron battalion you know scott belski mike lazaro all these people that succeeded in web2 right um that i respected and thought were thoughtful miraculously in january february are all circling around like buzzards i'm getting a text from friends that i haven't talked to in six months six years because we've all been a little bit out of the white hot moment of 2007 to 11 of web2 sure enough even even people that aren't in it right now that are a little bit more discreet which is why i'm not going to mention them um who really made some serious wins in web2 even they reached out in february march and say they're kind of demotivated or focused on other things but even they were like hey what is this thing uh you could see the spidey senses of the people that really understand when shit changes and then a couple of icons again i won't mention them who really didn't get it and came back to me in the last six to eight weeks and said fuck and i remember like being disappointed in them like oh i lost they lost her edge or they don't give a shit or or one of two things they got soft because they have too much money or the better version they made so much money they're on to fixing the environment or the political system they went out to risk it right so you know it's it's really fun to watch humans evolve but yes keeping people again when you guys get to my age you've got that extra generation you're going to have your whole little crew of the people you've decided over this decade are smart are good and you'll find it fascinating in 20 years when the next thing pops off you'll be surprised how many of them are like it's been a renaissance for some of my good friends of web2 and we're enjoying it because it feels like the old days right you can you can it feels like web2 owes beginning when nobody understood social media and content that's exactly what's happening with nfts did you uh did you follow aaron levy in real time transitioning from like an anti-web three guy to like the most pro web three guy in the span of like 72 hours you know aaron was never really we were never in each other's circle heavy obviously connected through many different people but never really we never really got to chop so between that and just you know how much information is being thrown around and usually i pride myself in seeing that i missed that but it makes so much sense right like all of us have to go through it it's like look i invested in ethereum and bitcoin in 1516 i kind of glanced at crypto kitties i didn't buy one you know you you're you're in what you're in and you get busy and you get your life evolves what you're able to capacity do in your late 20s is different as your family grows up and like it you know like humility and curiosity will cure success to be good at this i rely on those things but even for me like there's a million things going on you can't get to everything what i love in what you just said is the humility even with his success to be able to quote unquote evolve in front of everybody and not fear changing his mind because i think changing your mind is a huge strength i actually think there's a lot of people right now that are in a really tough spot because they've been very anti-nft they've had the aha that it's real and they don't have the humility to say they were wrong and they're going to double down on something they don't believe in and i hope they see this clip and it makes them feel comfortable to change their mind yeah so what you're saying is like it's okay to change your mind it's actually a competitive advantage it's a competitive advantage like i'm never scared to say i'm wrong i didn't see it uh-huh like like i love that one thing that's funny about me is i do that all the time one thing that people would be very confused by hearing because i don't think people should spend the time to really pay attention to me to understand every little nuance i just never get loud when i'm not at 100 percent if i'm at 97 i won't make a single comment publicly about it until i cross the chasm that's why you see me get so loud it's when i get to 100 musically tick tock snapchat uh you know podcast uh nfts once i get to 100 there's zero doubt in my mind and i go pot committed reputation on the line but you should see i mean you know you know how little vr content there is in the world for me because i'm still in 97 i i i don't have my 100 percent so i'm scared to say anything i don't know that's interesting we understand there's so much content of me on the internet you guys know this plenty of people don't love my aggressive communication style and i'm empathetic to that that if i gave people ammo of being wrong a lot they would make unlimited videos of me being wrong there's not that many you know why because i don't try to say about things i don't know you're not scott galloway with the uh with the predictions on tech companies yeah to me that's you know i love scott too and i'm not i i love him too actually i think he's amazing yeah i'm scared to do that i don't want as a matter of fact one of i got very lucky there's a very funny video of me in a suit by the way which is rare because i was doing this show the daily when the ipad came out and they asked me to do a prediction show and i fought like hell i didn't even wear i this is a you were about to get a funny very nerdy gary v scoop i was supposed to wear a tuxedo for the new year's episode which i had because i'd go to weddings right but i didn't wear it with the hope that they were going to get upset because they were very professional and and like let me not do it that's how much i didn't want to do a prediction show because i'm scared to predict ironically it turned into one of my best moments because i predicted that facebook was going to buy instagram and they did but i don't like predicting i don't predict i observe and then i'm emphatic about my observation when it crosses my 101 percentile belief chasm which is fairly rare if you look at my content over the last decade i'm only talking about seven or ten things i'm just not willing to be wrong if i can help it what do you what do you what do you observe around brands and nfts so i think i think it's gonna i'm starting to rough i think it's gonna be just like social 90 up front are gonna make garbage 10 if you remember early brands on social zappos had a big move on it that worked for them there were some other brands that did a really nice job then you look at brands that were built from social gym shark i just joined the board fashion nova another one you know like casper i mean we can go on and on with a lot of brands that were building so social um but 90 will be done poorly and 10 will be done awesome i you know i'm very proud you're catching me at a funny time we just launched our we're working for four months on the budweiser launch that we had and if you look at you know it was very strong yesterday because we really know what we're talking about to their credit they really let us do the right thing and so you know vayner nft with avery at the helm she's amazing we're gonna do good work and a lot of other companies will pop up and do good work build equity with brands and just like anything with brands 90 will be atrocious because it's gonna be transactional short-term cheesy tone deaf not understanding but i do think you'll see some gems in there and brands have money and leverage access so they can do some really cool stuff with their smart contracts right so when we look at you know the openc you know it's 2026 and we're looking at openc last 30 day sales when when we went through that list that was mostly web3 brands do we think you know it's going to be 50 50 you know old school brands with web3 brands 75 25 any any insight there um i think it'll be 10 brands 20 brands i think you'll see publishers gaming companies like ip that we right now v friends board a cool cats ip getting established but you're going to see hello kitty you're going to see the flintstones so you're going to see some icons harry potter you're going to see some new stuff the friends of board ape is going to feel like icons because we'll be old by then new will pop up brands will be there really social media you'll see jennifer aniston join late and get five right right jay-z join late and you'll see charlie d'amelio and logan paul build from there and everything in between it makes sense the so the hit the couple like the three pretty actionable things that i'm taking away from hearing you talk about this stuff one is like the importance of skin in the game like if you're going to go learn something you've got to put some skin in the game and that is the best way to learn because suddenly you're like really invested in it two it's like the willingness to just admit you don't know something and not be afraid to admit that and continue to own that until you do know it and for you like you're saying 97 96 for some people that might be like you know 20 30 just continuing to say i don't know i don't have an opinion on this because i haven't earned the right to have that opinion yet um and then the third one for me is just like be willing to change your mind and go search for those counter punches the way you put it of the people that just disagree with you that you're like oh yeah i'm not actually thinking about that the right way i was flipped completely opposite of how i should have been like those three things to me are really popping out of what you're saying i think that's extremely good recap you know usually i'm pretty long-winded but i don't have much to add to that i think that's the right recap i think i think i have so much confidence i have so much conviction and i have so much energy that what is incredibly difficult to see unless you're on the inside with me is i use humility as my biggest core driver i'm not scared because i don't think i'm special like this is really important i don't think i'm better than any man or woman i really don't i'm aware that i'm professionally successful i'm aware that i have nice relationships so are hundreds of millions of people i genuinely believe what makes everything palpable for me and others that have something is humility it's also what grounds you in the ability to innovate yep absolutely so i know we've got a couple minutes left i do need to ask you the question of for any listeners out there i mean i've taken so much personally from watching you and listening to your different um your different social accounts and things you've been saying publicly for years like what are the two or three pieces of advice one piece of advice you give to an 18 year old a 22 year old and you know maybe they don't come from the best situation they're not they didn't grow up in a wealthy family yeah walk me yeah this is great that gary's great i love that this is my new like i've been really thinking like honestly look at number one honestly no matter yeah no matter what you come from let me give you one that i think is a secret of life ready for this this one blows me away not everyone has this many don't but many do if you grow up in a family that doesn't have a very big financial bag middle call it lower middle class and down and you have happiness in your home you are winning if you are trained in the first 18 years of your life that happiness and joy you are not attached to money you are unstoppable and you're looking at that person right now and i realized it when i started seeing patterns if you're grateful for what you have instead of envious for what you don't have you will always win there will always be somebody with more money there will always be somebody that's better looking there's always somebody more athletic better grades nicer car there always will be there's also always going to be somebody that's less there's 850 million people on this earth that do not have access to clean fresh water there's nobody watching this video right now that isn't in a remarkable situation compared to the 8 billion i don't know what else to tell you like once you get there once you really lean into gratitude everything else clicks i'm going to give you another one since it's right here on my desk number three is probably leading to the most happiness for me i don't think our world right now is built on valuing accountability we're in full blame mode and that's why so many people are upset personal accountability it's huge can you talk more about that yeah yeah when when you don't focus on what you've done wrong and you're in full blame game when you're in fingers instead of thumbs you don't feel in control which then immediately makes you upset like if you think it's the government's fault or your teacher's fault or your parents fault or your boyfriend's fault or your girlfriend's fault or your brother's fault or society's fault or luck's fault or if you think it's something else's fault you by nature are giving up control giving up control feels very helpless and very desperate and i'm it i i feel like accountability makes me happy i think everything at vayner media is my fault now that's a very overarching thing but here's where i go with it if sally the vp screws up or rick this the vp screws up and i think that right now because of social media the mainstream media are social unrest for a decade it's just you know i've been thinking a lot about this lately that the world is very passionate to go blue and red not just politically just like how everyone's living their life and like so much of my happiness comes from purple and i've been thinking a lot about that i think accountability is incredibly important i really do like what what have you done like it's almost like man you could do anything like i love the fact that you could do anything like even if you don't like the country you live in no matter where you are canada america russia china you know and everything in between like you could immigrate my parents did you know this is why i love web 3 by the way is this exact idea like we've now had conversations with some of the most amazing minds in web 3 and one of the things that i just blows me away about everything about it is it doesn't matter if you're a kid on the street in india my family's from india growing up with nothing or if you're a country club kid growing up in greenwich connecticut you have access to the internet and you can contribute and you can be in these communities you can get in a discord you can talk to people you can build with other people and the promise of that is so inspiring that it's hard not to get behind it and want to invest in it the end the end the end we just we just um we just spoke to geo the co-founder of uh axi infinity yeah and we're like how did you co-found axi infinity he's like i literally joined the discord and then i became a co-founder he was mopping floors in the disco he was like i was the community i was like i was running yeah i joined the discord this is a very special time i hope people take advantage of it i have to go to a family thing right now so i gotta go but it's a special time don't miss you're watching this video you're ahead of 99 of the world do something about it cheers well we appreciate you gary thank you guys thank you so much man we'll see you soon cheers bye bye see ya legend what a legend dude i want to go run through a brick wall right now what an absolute legend we're still on oh we're still on well he's a total legend i was like i'm sweating like i want to go run through a brick wall that was great especially that ending yeah that ending was oh man really uplifting really fires me up man that was so cool really really cool um takeaways ah geez so i mean i summarized it when i was on there but like for me the coolest things he said um skin in the game when he was just saying like one of the first things he does as part of his process is he goes and like puts a little into it um to force himself to learn i'm a big believer in that like when we when you first got me in nfts the first thing i did was go and do something stupid like i i didn't mean to but i put some skin in the game and i lost a bunch of money on ether lambos and that was a great learning experience for me i learned a lot from it that's a that was a great one for me and then the other two were like kind of connected but just don't be afraid to say i don't know about things i thought that was so cool the way he said he doesn't publicly say something until he's 100 on it and then he gets loud and so people are like oh this guy's loud but you don't see all the background all the work he's done to get to 100 on it and then that final one of just like be willing to change your mind right it's such a powerful concept and so many people can learn from that because we live in this polarized black and white culture where you're not supposed to change your mind you're supposed to be we used to like criticize politicians for being flip-floppers personally i look at that and say that's actually a pretty powerful thing that someone was able to change their mind on an issue um and so shifting the culture around that and his points on that i thought were just so so astute for me uh what do you call it the counter punches yeah i liked that counter punches so understand them so for example uh with nfts there's a bunch of counter punch arguments which is like it's bad for the environment it's a ponzi scheme uh like so list it out and go actually do the research and try to understand and have a point of view and i feel like not enough people you know on both sides like either pro nfts or or anti nfts or pro this political party or anti you know and all assets a lot aspects of life i think we don't do a good enough job at understanding the counter punches i agree with that i also think it's because like social media culture has made the like little quick quip um you get a dopamine hit from that because you do the little like ngmi to somebody that says they don't understand it or they provide a counter okay boomer no and people like and people go like it now you're like oh saying ngmi got me a bunch of likes so i'm gonna keep doing that but the reality is when someone says like oh i don't understand how this works nick huber our friend like constantly does that he questions these different things in web 3 and crypto for me i find it as like personally motivating to then to try to understand why he thinks that and how you can figure it out but the natural reaction on social is to just like yell at the person attack yeah attack and it doesn't do you any good when you do that you actually aren't learning you're not developing you're not strengthening your point of view in anything you're just ignoring a counter argument to it and especially if the counter argument comes from someone you consider intelligent or credible it's worth listening to yeah i think what i've noticed on places like twitter is that it feels like everyone is attacking everyone a lot of the times and it doesn't need to be the case like it's totally cool to ask questions learn understand counter punches so i think uh listen i thought that conversation went really well and it it started at web 3 and i think it ended at um life lesson so yeah i mean i think it's funny for me because like gary um i've never met him i know him from his online personas and the things he's done and i've always admired his energy and enthusiasm around different issues and things he's working on but i came away from that just being like this fucker is the real deal man i mean like i got fired up listening to him he is motivating he's inspiring but he's also humble and his humility around learning these things and wanting to dive in his track record of getting things right once he dives in on things and figuring them out he's not just some like motivation guy you know that's just out there motivating people like he is really in the weeds putting his money where his mouth is diving in on things like in the in the battle in the trenches um i i mean i was blown away i love it i thought it was awesome it was awesome we're looking forward to getting in the community after this we're gonna do our best to get gary in there with us to jam with everybody we'll do a twitter spaces with him or something like that to go deeper on these things but holy hell man i gotta go run through a brick wall same we're out the saying used to be let your game speak with common stock it's about let your gains speak i love common stock love the platform and have really been enjoying learning from other people on there how does it work it's a platform for verified investment knowledge so people are going and sharing their ideas sharing their trades but it's actually connected to their brokerage account so you can see the results they're generating and see their actual
