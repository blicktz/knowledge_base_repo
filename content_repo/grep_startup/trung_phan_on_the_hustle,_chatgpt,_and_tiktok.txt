So I knew I recognized you from the hallways of McGill University. I guarantee that there was no like photo put up. I was like not a good student.

I dropped out of pre-med because the classes start at 8 a.m. I was like I need to do something that starts from noon. And it was like it was history and sociology.

So that's how I ended up not graduating as a doctor. So you're from BC and you went to school at McGill? Yeah, I grew up in Calgary and my family went to Vancouver when I was like nine years old.

It's a funny story. My old man, both my parents were Vietnamese refugees. Actually quite a bit, as you said, you're from Montreal.

It's quite a bit of a pretty big Vietnamese community in Montreal because of obviously the French. And my dad just kept on going west. So I was born in Calgary and he's like, I need to go one more city west.

It's like Vancouver. Like let me get back as close as possible to Asia. But like obviously the Pacific Ocean is massive.

So I don't know what he's trying to accomplish, but he got so he got there. But yeah, so I ended up going to McGill. But man, dude, we could talk about honestly, we could spend the whole hour talking about McGill, man.

It's like I can't believe you dropped out. I mean, maybe it was the right move, but I had a freaking blast there. What was like the highlight from your McGill experience?

So I lived, did you live in residence or were you kind of where did you grow off the island? No, no, no. Do I look like an off island person to you?

That joke is so niche. Like no one is going to get that. No.

Yeah, exactly. Right. You're three listeners from Montreal.

I mean, you guys are pretty big audience. You might have more than you expect. Honestly, man, it was, I mean, it's going to sound lame.

I was departing. It was insane. The reason I went was because I heard how insane McGill was and it just delivered on every front.

Right. And I've only been back twice since I graduated. So it's like twice in 10 plus years.

And now looking back, I think I recognize how insane it is that McGill's campus was literally in downtown Montreal. And like within two blocks in any direction, it was the craziest party street you could have. And yeah, I mean, I did nothing of academic value or like professional value while I was there.

So like that. Yeah, that's it. To answer your question, it was literally partying.

You know, being social, partying, whatever you want to call it, like that just sets you up. I hope we don't have too many young listeners, but that just sets you up for like, in a lot of ways, success. Like if you're able to like go into a party, meet people, connect with people, whatever, like it's really underrated in terms of like setting you up for success, you know, doing what we do, writing on the internet.

No, 100% totally agreed. What I would say is this is if unless you're a very clear track, I mean, everybody knows this is cliche. This one with the purpose of university.

It's not the education, right? Like you can get a better education, not. How cliche is that?

That is the like, I thought, I thought you were going to go into Twitter is a free university for 99.9% of people. Yeah. I mean, that is, that is the truth.

Oh, well, let's, let's bring, let's bring it to Twitter. Actually, the best part of Twitter is in the university part. It's the socializing part.

I mean, how many people, I know, I know for a fact that you and a number of other, you know, quote unquote creators or people that built pretty large audiences, you're all in one group chat together, right? It's like, it's a social thing. It's like, it's a very social element.

So even though we call Twitter is free university, the best part of Twitter is still the social part. Yeah. So that group chat is me, Sahil Bloom, Sean Puri, Sam Parr, Nick Huber.

Am I missing anyone? It's like, it's like the COVID crew, right? Austin Reeve.

Yeah. Austin Reeve. Basically, basically what happened was Julian Shapiro was also in it at one point.

He, he, he left. But when he left the group chat, it's just one day you wake up and you know, you know what the group chat is. I like, I, I don't leave the chats because how awkward it is to see that person leaving the group.

I just have to mute it. But you mute the group. Yeah.

Anyways, go ahead, man. Also sign out. Cortland Allen was also in the group chat.

Also, also left the group chat. Yeah. So it's all for everyone.

But yeah, we, we create this group chat. We called it initially the 100K club. It was like peak COVID, you know, summer, summer, I think 2020 spring and summer 2020.

And the idea was, how do we, how do we build big audiences? We all had 10 to 15,000 Twitter followers at the time. And we're like, how do we get to a hundred thousand now?

Fast forward today, like Sahil has almost a million. And everyone in the group chat has like 300,000 and around, you know, that number. And it's definitely changed our lives.

Let me ask two questions. Do you think that could still happen today? Or do you think it was a very COVID specific thing?

And the other question I had was, well, it wasn't really questioned. Answer that. And I'll have a comment about the social aspect of Twitter.

I mean, it's happening today. You know, I feel like we're, we're, we're actually witnessing it in like the AI world. Like there's a bunch of AI creators that I know are, that are kind of like banding together.

And like, I see them like pumping up their stuff on Twitter. Um, so yeah, it's happening. Yeah.

Okay. So we're saying is like, get that group chat, but don't feel awkward if you have to leave is kind of the takeaway here. No, what, uh, the last thing I want to add about the Twitter stuff, I know you had a a broader agenda, sorry for kind of hijacking the beginning here.

But, uh, the thing that I always tell people about Twitter, I don't love your thoughts on this. It's just the idea of like, you'll get the top 1% of any field, right? Like they'll just be there exchanging ideas.

And, you know, as soon as you have a couple of people in that field that are quote unquote, the top of their field, exchanging ideas, no one else in that field that wants to compete can see that ground, right? Like this person's like, he's got the mind share here. So now I got to jump in here.

So I can't take it. But what essentially happens is that when you look at Twitter, it's not about, Hey, what is your vertical industry is like, can you get yourself into that 1% where everybody's hanging around in a giant group chat? Right.

And like, if you can just, whatever you're like, I always use a car dealership guy as a great example. I think a lot of your listeners and viewers might, will probably know car dealership guy, but you know, his niche is very niche. It's car dealerships, but the information is so good.

And it's just so, uh, engaging that he's elevated. Now where he has celebrities and athletes and founders and CEOs following him. Right.

So just got to get in that, got to get in that, that, that, that little layer on top. That's all I got to say. That's like my advice.

Yeah. I think the, you know, the, just to comment on that, like the cool part about Twitter is like, you could get into that room. And that's actually like why I initially me and Sahil.

Oh yeah. The name of the podcast room where it happens. Literally like, yeah, that was the idea is like, bring people, uh, the top 1% have conversations.

And I think it always reminds me of South by Southwest. I think Gary Vaynerchuk used to have like after parties in his like, um, hotel room, which sounds weird, but I swear, I don't think it was weird. No, it sounds totally normal.

We listen, we started it off with McGill party. Dude, after parties in hotel room, totally get it. Yeah.

People are going to hate this episode or love it. One or the other. So I think he would just like, you know, Tim Ferriss would be there and, and, uh, you know, Garrett camp and Travis from Uber would be there and they'd have these like jam sessions.

I think they were called. Um, and probably, I mean, I was never invited. So by the way, like, you know, I was never in that invited, but I always wanted to go.

Cause I was always like, imagine being a fly in that, you know, on the wall and hearing these conversations that these people are having, like amazing. Yeah. Twitter allows you to make that happen.

So I just want to be clear. I think we're on the same page here. One top 1% doesn't mean like financially, we're not saying, oh, you know, you have to be fina.

We're saying like whatever your field is or whatever criteria you choose to judge your field, like that 1%, like let's say you're a medical researcher, you're really good at publishing or whatever, right? And you're just, you're just passing out. That's what we mean here.

Totally. Yeah. I mean, like, yeah, exactly.

And I just want to be clear that whatever happened in Gary's room was probably, you know, kosher. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly.

Um, okay. So I want to get into things. Trung fan, internet legend.

I'll take that. I'm Canadian. I mean, you are.

I can't accept too many compliments. When Elon Musk replies to your Twitter, I consider you notable. Okay.

You are notable. May or may not be notable. Exactly.

Like, you know, like, yeah, may or may not be notable. May or may not be notable. But we're going to view towards me.

Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah.

Fair enough. So who, who are you and what are you doing? All right.

So, um, we already started this chat off with a lot of Twitter talks. So I'd imagine if anybody did know me, it is probably from Twitter, uh, spend quite a bit of time there. But similarly to how you mentioned that group chat, it was all during COVID.

Right. Right. And, uh, uh, I, one of the big regrets I actually have looking back is I wish I'd just done it like 10 years ago.

I mean, I know you've discussed this and I heard you guys talk about it. It's like, and you obviously white Riley, white, right widely on audience building. Right.

And, uh, not just as an end to itself, but it's a super high leverage. And I just like, I wish I just done this earlier. And I'd done to answer your question.

Like, you know, what did I do? It's like, so I'm a girl. I like wrote like a pretty popular blog and like, it was just about partying.

And I just wish I had continued that instead of, you know, I moved to Vietnam and, uh, was completely unqualified to do anything there. Obviously partied a lot of McGill and, uh, had no real plans for my professional life. Although you said you, you told me on the pre-chat you dropped out of McGill.

So you, you totally get the idea of like, not really knowing what you're doing in university. Right. That's right.

And like, I dropped out, like, you know, we went to school around the same time. Like it was like crazy if you dropped out back then. In the, like the late aughts and like the 05 to 010 or 10 or yeah.

Insane. Right. And it was now obviously it's way more normalized, but, uh, yeah, I didn't really have, I might as well have dropped out.

It didn't make a difference. Right. I could have gone and started earlier.

So, uh, in whatever my career ended up being, uh, so I went to Vietnam for, I ended up being there for five years and I don't remember the time, but there's a 07 08. That's when the, so the Beijing Olympics was 2008. And everybody's like, oh, this is like China's moment.

Right. So actually I planned to move to Shanghai. I had a lot of buddies that were moving there, a lot of Caucasian dudes.

And they're just like, we're just going to learn Mandarin and like, we're going to figure it out. Right. And then I'm just like, wait a second.

Like I'm Vietnamese. Like I can speak enough Vietnamese and I have family members. I'm just going to Vietnam and try to ride the same, like East Asia wave.

And the running joke about Vietnam is it's always five years away. So any, any year you get to Vietnam, it's like, oh, we're five years away from being like the next Asian tiger. Right.

But it's been that way for two decades. Um, but having said that I moved there and I don't regret it looking back because I can never do it again. Like I lived in Vietnam, like a total asshat.

Like we talk about partying in my gill, like multiply that by a hundred in Vietnam. And, uh, and a lot of stupidity happened, but while there, uh, I kind of did two things that ended up to where I guess a lot of your listeners or viewers might know me now, like just kind of, you know, shitposting on the internet about business. Okay.

So a lot of your listeners probably know me from being an idiot on Twitter and those like being an idiot in terms of shitposting about business, two things happened in Vietnam that was completely unplanned, but led kind of that route. So number one was, uh, I, because I had no real hard skills. I, I'm like, okay, what course can I take remotely that I can just do?

CFA was the easiest one, right? It's like the one that you can do. They test in Saigon.

I'm like, I'm just going to do this, put a little discipline around my life and like work in a quote unquote real career. So I took the CFA. And then the other thing I did in Vietnam was actually the thought, the thing I really wanted to do a decade ago was be a comedy screenwriter.

So I wrote and sold a comedy screenplay to Fox. I co-wrote that and I'm like, oh my God, this is amazing. I'm going to be a comedy screenwriter.

But I mean, I know that, you know, people in the entertainment industry is like you write or option and script. You're still like at the 10 yard line in your own end zone, right? You got 90 yards to go and you have no control over the rest of that.

So on and off for about three years, I thought I was going to be able to make a movie. I never ended up happening, but, uh, TLDR moved back to North America. Got a real job, quote unquote, real job in FinTech, worked for a FinTech firm.

You might've heard of it. It's called Kensho. It's based in Boston, sold to SMB Global in 2018.

And, uh, and then from there, somebody I knew at Kensho was an early investor in the hustle or an early-ish investor and then made the introduction to the hustle. And then that's how I ended up going down this route of being like a more public facing writer, a business thingy. But yeah, so the TLDR on Vietnam was two tracks that ended up kind of converging to where I am now.

Okay. And the hustle, like what was that experience like? So the hustle was actually a very good match because it was like, everything says like, you know, the tone of the hustle, right?

You know, Sam, obviously. And the way they write is like, it's like an irreverent take on business. I'm like, okay, perfect.

It combines my kind of interest in business with my real interest in comedy. And, uh, it was super interesting the time I was there because it happened during COVID. And we had a difficult patch where quite a bit of turnover, probably not surprising anybody during that time.

And the writing staff for the actual, uh, daily newsletter, because I mean, you read a weekly newsletter, right? You already know, like I write a weekly newsletters. Like it's already called me too difficult enough to just like be on the grind, but like a daily newsletter, like, I mean, you know, Austin, you know, Sam, the daily stuff is truly a seven day a week job if you're in the writer's seat, right?

Because at a minimum it's six days because you got to hit all five days during the week, but you just never stop thinking about it. Cause you just wake up like, oh crap. Like I got, I got to make sure I got the next one.

And it's honestly a recipe for burnout. If you don't have like a team in place, it was, I had amazing editors, uh, shifting kind of co-writers. But I'd say the experience that was great with the hustle was I'd never written at that cadence for that long.

And I'm like, okay, well you can do this. I was feeling myself burning out towards the end, but it was nice to know that how much you can actually pump out if you just kind of have to do it. Right.

And it was during COVID too. So I wasn't, there's what else are you going to do during COVID? So it was like a really, uh, at that time kind of thing.

It feels like there was a group of you that really took off, uh, at the hustle, right? Like, I feel like, you know, Steph Smith and there's just a bunch of you, like what was in the water at the hustle that so many of you became successful? I think, well, I mean, you'll know this from knowing Sam is like, he was willing to bring on board maybe non-traditional people.

Right. And I mean, I think with Steph, he found Steph from her writing, uh, as like a solopreneur, like a digital nomad and like, oh, this is just really good writing. Right.

And, uh, it might not be a traditional Ivy league route, uh, former tech reporter, but, but interesting knows what it's like to be an entrepreneur and that's probably valuable for the entrepreneurs. So I think, um, probably a combination of having, uh, kind of a wider net of who, would be allowed to work at the hustle. Cause ultimately our editor, when I was there was Brad Wolverton.

He was at, he was a former Washington post guy, right. Or like very traditional media. And, uh, but he was able to wrangle in kind of more non-traditional writers.

So, you know, I think a lot of credit goes to, uh, I think that was a really big hire, uh, for that team. He's still there. I believe he's running all of HubSpot's, uh, kind of, uh, media, uh, editorial stuff now.

But yeah, I think, uh, non-traditional writing, which is very much like consistent with what's happened with Substack now, right. The best writers I know are not people that came up as journalists, the best writers are former industry people. Like, I mean, who's going to outright community stuff or what your expertise is, right?

You're going to be the best about that. Like a journalist is not going to outdo you on that. And I think that applies to basically every kind of vertical now, although the, I flip flopped on how I feel about traditional media.

A bit of it is because I am so in the tech Twitter bubble that I'm just like, oh, you know, screw the time screw, whatever X, Y, Z. But the reality is that the actual reporting that we all riff on and write on like that is actually extremely difficult and very like, like time and financially intensive, right. Even when you look at some of the best solo newsletter writers, I mean, they're just riffing off whatever the financial times are or, or New York times or Bloomberg or Wall Street Journal has written about, right.

Because that's still ultimately the brass tack. Like you got to still have that original reporting. So I, I think I'm at a middle ground now.

I respect old media, but I do think that there's a lot of questions about their models and kind of their incentives now, which has led to some insanity. So what do you think about the kind of the old media stuff? It's like, they've kind of like jumped the shark, right.

I mean, I write a weekly newsletter and I plan to even write more and I couldn't even define the word reporting to you like properly. I don't even know like how I should be citing sources and how I should be doing like good reporting. You know what I mean?

Like, I feel like so many people on sub stack like me, we, we just have ideas and it's a platform to get our ideas out there. Sure. And I went to answer, I didn't mean to cut you up.

I didn't want to talk about reporting specifically. Like the way I think about it is, you know, if you're going to touch on a story, you literally have to call five to 10 people like that to me is kind of what it really comes down to. Right.

Like that, the, the time it takes to set up these calls, chase people down and like get the primary source versus, you know, we're often riffing on these primary sources. Right. Which is much less time intensive, but you add your own ideas, which obviously is cognitively difficult.

Yeah. So I remember like early on in my earlier on in my career as an entrepreneur, I would get these DMS from reporters being like, Hey, can you like, you know, do you have 10 minutes or five minutes for a quick interview on something? And I get on the phone and it was just them like citing a source or doing a little extra research.

And I remember like thinking to myself, like waking up on a Monday morning, let's just say, I'm like, you know, the meetings in the afternoon, I'm like, clear my day. I'm talking to someone from the New York times, you know, just so excited. And I get on the call, they asked me a few questions.

If I'm lucky, I'm getting a link, you know, right. Right. And that's like best case, or maybe like best case is actually linked back one sentence or two sentences.

realistically, I'm getting maybe a link. And, uh, I didn't realize at the time why they were so excited to speak to me. But now I understand it.

Like they need to speak to me in order to properly get their, you know, their piece across the finish line. Like you, like you're giving them the, the inner workings, right. The inside baseball that they like, if they wrote it without your insights, like that, that's just a, that's a, that's a wire piece from the AP, right?

Like, what's the point? They just go to AP for this. But like, you're giving like literally that one sentence where it's like, oh, here's an insight from entrepreneur.

So what did, what did that make you feel about the process though? It was like, you're saying, you're saying kind of even the playing field in your mind. Yeah.

Who brings value? Yeah. It changed, it changed the, the power dynamics, at least in my head.

So initially I was like, okay, there's these gatekeepers. And if I get them to write about me, there's a greater chance that I get customers, users, venture capital, potential, you know, people who want to buy my company, uh, like might be reading the New York times. I might say, Hey, we need to buy this company because we saw it in the New York times.

Like that's literally how deals get done a lot of the time. Like we feel this is a threat because it's in the New York times or whatever. Wait, has this happened to you though?

Like, uh, with your own personal entrepreneurial journey? Yeah. Yes.

Like, okay. So somebody's like, I saw him in the times. Oh, that's interesting, man.

Yeah. Like I remember, um, you know, when I had sold my, I was trying to sell my company in 2013, it was called five by two, a social network called stumble upon. And I was just trying to get the, the term sheet, um, from Facebook at the time, stumble upon.

And there was a couple others and I just needed a little extra juice, like an extra, like reason for them to like move. So I, I hired Ed Zitron. Uh, if you know, Ed Zitron.

Oh yeah. I've read Ed stuff. Yeah.

And he, he, uh, he got us in tech crunch and it was like, Through industry connections? Through industry connections. Okay.

Okay. I paid him $5,000 to get us into tech crunch basically. And you cross the finish line.

Yeah. And this is some inside baseball, man. Have you ever told this story?

Never told this story. This is amazing, man. Wow.

Yeah. That's baller dude. Yeah.

Yeah. And you know, it was published, let's say on a Monday, Tuesday by Wednesday, Thursday, all of a sudden Facebook came around, stumble upon came around just so happened that they had read the article, um, and, uh, it makes it, it makes a difference to be in the press. I've, uh, I've been in a couple, uh, of conversations with, uh, kind of on the sole independent side and the idea being, Hey, how valuable is a traditional press?

I think what you're saying here, Oh, granted this was 10 years ago. Right. Yeah.

But I feel like it probably pulls the same weight though. Like I remember when I was, so I took a break from Bloomberg, but when I was writing over the past year, I still remember the kind of outreach you'd get. And I guess on Twitter, I have a big audience, but there's still some people that I couldn't reach out to or that I know from AB testing, as in like, when I reached out to them on my Twitter account, nothing.

When I'm like, Hey, listen, I'm writing something for Bloomberg, totally different ball game. Right. It's like, it still means something to get into the terminal, for example, or in your case, I guess tech crunch is still, I mean, 10 years later, uh, I liked your thoughts, actually tech crunch now versus 10 years ago.

What do you think the influence is or like, Oh, I mean, it's gone down significantly. Okay. Significantly at the time.

What is the tech quench equivalent today in your eyes? I think it's, it's, it's gotten more decentralized. Like I feel like at the time it was, there was only a few places that you'd go for, for tech news.

It was like Pando daily. I think, um, what else was there back in the day? Um, uh, not, not Valley way.

You go there for different news. Yeah, exactly. But there wasn't that much, right?

Like tech felt like more niche and tech crunch was like the, yeah, like I said, tech crunch is the Holy grail. Um, today I feel like you have, you know, Paki McCormick, you have like sub stack, you have like more, Mario, um, you, you know, Ben's bites for AI, or we just launched one called, you probably need a robot.com for AI. Like there's these niche gatekeepers, um, that exist.

Um, so the attention is way, way more spread out. Yeah. That's a great point regarding, uh, Paki and Mario actually, because you've obviously seen some of their, uh, like quote unquote sponsored deep dives or even ones that aren't right is they clearly are just hitting the exact market.

And to your point that we're at tech countries to serve, but I mean, Paki, I think Paki is up to 200,000 subs and I know Lenny's is, Lenny's is massive, right? Lenny might be half a million at this point. Lenny is the second most subscribed sub stack period.

In the, in the entire, on the entire platform. Yeah. That is wild, right?

That is absolutely wild. It's wild. He's the new tech crunch.

There you go, right? He's the new tech crunch legitimately. Yeah.

Lenny is the new tech crunch, but he, he focuses more on like SaaS. But yeah, I mean, I, I, you're right. Lenny in some ways is, is the closest thing to the new tech crunch that we have.

Right. That is, that's wild. And I know these are all themes that you write along.

I mean, you write about consistently. Right. And the, uh, I remember the last, the last viral tweet you had that I legitimately DMed you about was like, uh, was, uh, around Michelle fan.

Right. And, uh, I know you love this stuff. This is like, this is like, you can, you can riff on this stuff for hours.

Right. Yeah. Yeah.

So what do you, okay. So you're at going back to your story, you're at the hustle. What happens?

How long are you there for? About a year, year and a half. Like I said, like a little bit of burnout feeling when, uh, when, uh, the daily, the daily pace for about a, a year was a little bit, uh, was, was fast.

There's a lot. I want to get back to writing a longer kind of stuff. And, um, and I think, I mean, you know, the deal had the HubSpot acquired hustle in February, 2021, uh, within a year, I think a lot of, uh, a lot of people ended up leaving, uh, which is pretty typical for these types of things anyways.

And, uh, I knew that I wanted to get back, uh, to kind of writing at a, at a less frequent pace and also just explore the stuff that we've thought about, like being more, being more solo and independent and kind of seeing where, where, where you can go. I mean, you'll know this, you've been in over a decade. It's just like, I prefer taking on random opportunities, uh, and not being tied necessarily to one place.

Uh, just because a lot of it has to do with the fact that I have built up good distribution, right? It's a little bit different maybe than a year and a half ago, but as you're building up a distribution and you see, okay, well, that's half the battle in my eyes with the content. It literally is how much effort you put into the writing of the initial thing or creating that piece, you have to put the exact same amount of effort and distribution, right?

And that's why people make the trade off. They're willing to work for a large publication because they don't believe that they can do the distribution on their own, but you can actually can, as you can tell, as you know, from your group, the, the, the, the, uh, the a hundred K club, it's possible to happen. So yeah, I think, um, I just want to get off the pace of the writing.

I've never really stayed at a place for a extended amount of time. And I still have this North star in my head of being a film, like writer of some nature. And what I found with writing independently and kind of using that as the main outlet was, you know, I do get a lot of interesting DMS.

I meet a lot of interesting people just from what I do on Twitter and, um, you know, moving the ball towards creatively stuff I want to do. Like a lot of stuff for me is even though I kind of work in the business world, I'm like the things that get me excited are more on the creative side, particularly humor. So yeah.

To answer your question of why I moved on is like, there are still things I want to do creatively that don't mesh with working with an organization. So what, like, what are you working on? And, you know, it's cause it feels like you have some interest in film, writing, AI.

Um, how does it all come together? What's your, how do you describe what you're building? Here's the through line.

The through line is this is I know what I'm going to be doing every day, basically for the next call it five, 10 years. Like I can already see it, right? It has to do with the age of my kid where he's five years old.

So, you know, no matter what, I know that, uh, you know, the commitment obviously, you gotta get a kid, right? So that's the main thing is like, that's levering me in. It's like, okay, so how do I build something I can do for 10 years around the fact that I got to raise my kid for another 10, 15 years.

Right. And what that is and what I've come to realize over the past year and a half was, I know I can just do the content pace that, uh, some of your listeners might see, or if they're not familiar, it's like, you know, I'll, I'm on Twitter every day, a couple hours, similar to yourself. Uh, I'll write a newsletter.

I do a podcast and it's just slowly building the audience. As you know, it's like the, it just, it just compounds, right? It is corny, but like the benefits, especially of audience building is all going to be towards the end.

Right. It's like, I wrote about it this last week, uh, Jack butcher who you had on recently on the show, he obviously has that amazing visual, right? Of like, you know, it's just like, it's just a straight line going nowhere.

And then it just kind of implodes. And, and there's a point on that straight line where you're like, oh, this is pointless. But it's just the idea of if you particularly audience building, uh, the benefits really do accrue towards the end.

Right. In so many ways too, is like the, you're picking up more people, but then the people you're picking up earlier than journey, they want to see you win and they're liking you more because of how much time they're spending with you. So when you're asking like, you know, where's the through line, the through line is this.

I know I can keep doing the audience stuff like content that I enjoy for the indefinite amount of time. So through that through line then becomes, okay. And I mean, you are, uh, you're an expert in this is if you have a big audience, what can you do with that?

So the AI stuff was essentially, you know, I'd advertise in my newsletter, I'd advertise in my podcast, but a lot of those advertisements weren't even products that I used. And the, the highest value thing for somebody with a big audience and not even like, I'm not even saying to myself, it's like, you know, you own the product, right. It's like, it's like whatever Jocko does with his, uh, uh, uh, uh, health products or Rogan now has a cut in like on it.

Right. It's like, you find a product that you can use your distribution to sell. The AI stuff made sense to me because I actually use, so the, the, the app that I launched barely AI actually use it quite a bit.

Uh, one of the two main use cases is actually is, uh, I use it a ton to copy edit my own stuff. I don't have a team. So writing and editing are two such different kind of, uh, uh, mental, uh, you know, the cognitive switch is quite large and it's really annoying to edit your stuff.

So I use, uh, uh, barely, which is built on top of water, uh, any, it can be on top of any large language model, obviously opening as a big one right now, but we can, we plugged into other ones. And, uh, I'm sure Google is going to release one soon. I know Facebook or meta just released theirs.

It's like, we're going to be able to route through this app, which essentially, uh, I guess they call it a thin wrapper, but the thin wrapper with, uh, two ways I put it is I think the UX and the convenience side, I know you've talked about it previously and used it maybe a little bit, but I think what we're seeing was that the convenience side is if the underlying models are going to be largely commoditized because every browser will have it, like every productivity tool will have it is people will be like, okay, well, which one will I actually use every day because it's convenient. Right. And we're finding like, we have the Chrome extension, uh, the one short, uh, one keyboard shortcut, uh, app, and obviously browser access.

People are liking that it's all kind of in one place and, uh, there's definitely enough of a market for those individuals where, uh, go ahead and build this product that, uh, to answer your initial question is like, it's plug it in to the audience building and, uh, the lifetime value for this product is higher than I can get on just ads. So yeah, that's, that's how I'm thinking about it. It's not, there is no real grand master plan other than I know I'm going to keep creating content and building an audience and I want to start plugging in more stuff that I own.

And I mean, you'll know this because I know how many things you've plugged into your, your kind of distribution, right? Like you have these, you have these like discord groups, you have, I guess I wouldn't call them courses, but you have, you have these things, right? So like whatever I've said is, is very familiar to, how you think about it.

A lot of people ask me, Greg, how do you build products that foster community? Well, I've got good news. That's exactly what late checkout does.

My company, we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast paced startups to design products that resonate with your community. We add a couple of interesting clients every single year. So if you're interested and that sounds like you email front desk at late checkout dot studio with what you're working on, what you need help with, and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod.

Thank you. Yeah. I was just in a meeting with my team right before this.

And I think we're launching like five companies over the, you know, over the next six weeks. Around your distribution. Around my distribution.

Exactly. Yeah. Exactly.

So I think it's, it's a good point that you have, which is once you're known for something, once you're a 1%, then, then it's like, okay, how do you become the advertiser? Basically. Yeah.

A hundred percent. One hundred percent. Right.

Yeah. So with the AI, with Barely AI, like you were relatively early with that. How did you get into AI, LLMs and productivity software?

Absolutely. So, but I'm going to have to give a lot of credit to my co-founder, Parham. We worked together at Kentro, which was the fintech startup that I mentioned, that I worked when I came out of the States, but he was head of infrastructure there.

So, I mean, he'd spent his entire career, like a decade, basically plugging at the time, it's a lot of data, like a lot of NASDAQ data, S&P data, into kind of a nice UX and making it very usable. And the LLM stuff was kind of creeping up. Obviously, ChatGPT's model, underlying model, had been around for almost 18 months and just kind of slapped it on top.

And I'm sure you've read the stuff. They didn't even, outside of Sam Altman, they didn't even think that it'd be a success. They were rushing out the door because they knew that the moment was coming for Mindshare and they just kind of rushed it out.

So, I don't think we were particularly early. I mean, Jasper and Copy were around probably a year plus before we launched. And now everything was just swept away by ChatGPT anyways, in terms of Mindshare.

But what I will say is that it is definitely one of the situations where like, you know, the tide lifts all boats. It's just the biggest tide ever. And even ChatGPT and OpenAI acknowledged there's just no way they could service all the different customers they want.

So, they did that deal with Bain recently, right, to do generative text and images for Coca-Cola. But like in that press release, they're like, we can't, we're doing one of the Fortune 500 companies, like a single one of them, right? And I think the long-term economics for OpenAI and Microsoft, which obviously owns about, we'll end up owning 45, 49% of it, is they're going to have to be kind of a cloud provider and they're going to want as many people to plug in as possible.

So, I guess their balancing act, which I'd love to, your thoughts on is whether to, you know, how do they have a balancing act between having their own product and trying to incentivize just everybody to build on top of it? So, I'll answer your question. I love your thoughts.

Like, we, I don't think we were particularly early. I do think that we got in right before that crazy rush. And, and to be honest, it was, it was when ChatGPT came out that first week, I'm like, fuck, this might like, we might be done.

And, but then we saw actually that it really helped clarify what our value was, is just some people want the UX a certain way, right? That's just how some people want it. And that clarified for us is like, okay, let's, this is our market.

We're not building the next Google. We need to find 10, 20,000 of these customers and get them to pay. And then you have a mid seven figure business.

And, and am I trusting that my distribution can do that? So those are kind of the, that was kind of the equation. So what, what do you think when like around kind of thin wrappers and, and open AI competing against potential other, other AI plays?

So my take on my take on like where we are in the state of AI and building on top of it is it feels very similar to how it was in mobile. So in mobile, basically what happened was, you know, you bought an iPhone and there were default apps. Like there was no, you know, the first version of the iPhone didn't have an app store.

Oh yeah. Steve jobs hated the idea of an app store. Cause he didn't want an app to drop the call.

Cause I don't remember, but in his, in, in the iPhone presentation, he's like the killer app for the iPhone is the phone call. We've created a better phone call. So he was fucking really didn't want to ruin the phone, but yeah, you're right.

There was no app store. No app store. And it got preloaded with some default apps based on what they thought people wanted.

And Apple knew a few of those apps because from, you know, 2000 to 2008, there was a huge industry around pocket PCs, which were just mobile windows and Palm pilots that we like often forget about to, you know, he understood, they understood that there was notes that you needed, you know, photos, maps, email, like a really shitty browser. Exactly. So they knew that that's the phase we're in right now with, um, open AI's business.

And then you're going to see Google, uh, as well. Um, so they've identified, okay, text to image makes sense. Boom, Dolly, um, you know, jukebox music.

Um, so there's just, they've, they've identified like the, and I hate the term, but low hanging fruit for the space. Um, today, uh, you know, we're, we're, we're recording this, um, February 27th today. I saw that snap added like AI, open AI integration.

And so now they're moving from like default apps to, okay, partner apps that we can trust. The next step is platform. So the app store for open AI or the app store for Google Bard.

And I think like, yeah, what you're building is like, you're building an app before, before there's an app store basically. Um, right. You're instead of relying on the distribution for an app store, you're relying on the distribution of your Twitter account and email, et cetera.

Um, and I think that there's going to be like open AI and Google isn't going to figure out themselves how to build every niche, um, AI based product, right. They're there. And they don't want to do that.

So I think there's going to be a huge opportunity over the next five years to like go and build a seven figure AI first product. I, I love that framing of the idea of, uh, they basically figured out. So the first iPhone came with 16 apps, like kind of everything you mentioned notes, email, browser, a contact list, the idea of like, and a great parallel here is like the open AI playground, right.

Or the, uh, the, the text playground is like, that's kind of the first tooling you'll see everywhere is probably just gotten a meeting with three people. And it's like, Hey, what are like, what are the main things we do with text? It's just created 20 of them.

Right. And, um, no, I really liked that framing. And the thing I will say, apart from the use case, different use cases you might have with the LLMs.

The other thing we've seen with barely is, so we've been reached out quite a bit by like SMB corporates, not even tiny, like 10, 20,000 employees. They want to integrate some type of LLM into their company, but they don't want to do it through chat GPT right now. And then open AI just doesn't have the resources to hold their hands because they're too small.

Right. So barely is actually very effective in the sense of, you know, we're working on the standard corporate stuff like SSO, single sign on, uh, localize all, all data. So you can upload and just keep it on prem or with on your, like not in the cloud because people obviously have a lot of concerns about privacy.

And, uh, we've seen enough outreach of that where, you know, if anybody listening here and I'm sure there are quite a bit interested in AI is like the one thing I cannot stress enough is the market is so big that even though like the mental gymnastics I went through and like, kind of like the anxiety when a chat GPT came out, it's just, it just came to mind. It's like, listen, there's just not gonna be able to service everybody because it doesn't make sense for them to. And it's like what you said, they're not either not gonna be able to figure out every use case B they're not gonna be able to service everyone.

There's gonna be enough room for a lot of people, maybe not generational stuff. Right? Like, I don't know how many Googles or Ubers, Airbnbs will come out of this cycle, but it's great for solopreneurs.

There's no question about it. How much anxiety does being built on open AI, Google, whatever give you like, it's, you know, cause they could just decide, Hey, like, we're, we're no longer giving access to, you know, chat GPT or, or they could just say it's gonna cost a million dollars a month. Yeah.

Oh, it's math. What the one thing, it was a lot more anxiety when chat GPT came out in November, but it seems pretty clear since then, uh, that there's gonna be enough competition in this space. I mean, even stability, right?

Like stability obviously is known for, uh, stability AI, it's probably known for stability to fusion, but they're working on a large language model and, and, and their whole, their whole ethos is to be open source. Right. And then you just saw, again, we mentioned Meta dropped one last week, Google has to drop, but I know Meta is more research focused right now and they haven't opened it widely, but there's almost no question that Google is probably going to have to within this year.

So yeah, I mean, it is scary, uh, but it's scary in the same sense that I believe the way you'd use a cloud provider is like, yeah, could Amazon, you know, screw you by jacking up prices and like making it really expensive. I think it's called egress fees when you have to leave the cloud. That's basically what they're doing.

Uh, but, uh, the trade-offs are worth it. And I mean, otherwise, like I'm not gonna be able to my own LLM either. Right.

So the reality is that I'm screwed if they really do pull that. So, so, uh, although there have been enough discussions where like, like, are we going to have to just do, or, or, uh, like a nut or like an interesting one enough where you can still do something super niche and, and kind of exist. But yeah, definitely anxiety, but I think it was much less diminished than in November.

That was a true shot. Like when, when chat GPT came out, the information had a great article about Jasper. So Jasper AI was, uh, you probably know the guy's like, uh, unicorn, uh, uh, AI, uh, startup that does a lot of copy and marketing, uh, text, but I read that information article.

And so they're in like a Slack group, uh, like a, a, a, a multi cross functional Slack group with open AI, because they were such a big partner. And then when chat GPG dropped, you're like, Hey, uh, what's going on? Like, this is like directly competitive.

And you know, the opening guys, I know, no, no, no, don't worry about it. It's like, you guys, you still have access to the different models. And it's just, it's just like, uh, just a marketing, uh, for open AI.

But, uh, I think, yeah, I don't, they raised at 1.5 billion. Like what was the ambition for that company? It's probably a 10 billion plus company, right?

Like, is that still possible? I don't know. It seems that, uh, it seems scary that chat GPT is out there and Microsoft can burn X amount of money.

Um, but yeah, let's go back to, I think there's going to be, I think the market is just so massive that, uh, it's worthwhile for them not to screw people and they'll just make a money, uh, on whatever their, their token model ends up being. Yeah. I think people really underestimate how big the AI market is because what is AI?

It lifts productivity. It uplifts productivity. So if you uplift productivity, 7%, like we're talking trillions per, per year globally of, of market options.

Product productivity. And this is another thing that we found with barely AI is like, so about half of our usage is outside of North America. The, I don't think people understand the, the multiplier that open AI provides for non native English speakers that are trying to compete and not even necessarily compete.

Just even just like, listen, I don't know how much you've dealt with, uh, uh, people in Southeast Asia or East Asia. I'm sure you have quite a bit. It's like the first of all, English, the English, the English teaching industry is massive.

It's just absolutely massive. Right. And that's just to teach English, not even to write, not even to read.

It's just to teach the pronunciation of English. And if you throw something like chat GPT, open AI, any large language models. Now you have people that are, have all the other skills, right?

Discipline, uh, understand accounting, understand finance, understand how to use the internet. But the truly large barrier was writing literally just good emails. You can even write a good cold email if you were like a, a Vietnamese executive, because you just don't have intonation and you just don't understand the nomenclature, right?

This is a massive change for you. It is truly a massive change. We're seeing huge usage in Southeast Asia for, uh, barely AI.

And even though our pricing is Western based for some companies over there, it's a no brainer for them. It's not, I mean, it's expensive relative to like how the per GDP per capita, but if you're running a business that can do some figures from Southeast Asia, it's a no brainer to be able to communicate properly for $200 a year, $20 a month. Right.

So I think that's the other part of it. Totally agree with you on the productivity, but I think the massive unlock is going to be even the playing field in a lot of ways for, for non-native English speakers. And, uh, we had a, it was funny.

We, I do a non-investment advice podcast with Bilal and Jack, and we, we randomly had a sailor on last year, Michael sailor, and he had a great line. He's just like, whatever you do, you can sell for more in English. Like if that's, you know, the, the language you're interacting in, obviously it's a lingua franco.

And he's like, and whatever you buy, you can buy it for cheaper in English. And I think that matters a lot. Like forget about just the productivity, which I totally agree on like 7% boost.

Like you said, we're chilling to dollars or whatever, hypothetical number. Right. But the unlocking of literally two to 3 billion people to compete in where the lingua franco of the internet, which is English, I think it's a huge and, and we can't really compute what the opportunity is for that.

Yeah. I mean, I obviously I speak English, but growing up in Quebec, like, you know, you speak English and French and you're in North America. So you kind of like see, you understand us, you understand selling into the U S.

Um, but you also understand that, you know, you, you might speak French as your native, you know, 93% of Quebecers speak French, uh, as their first language. So for me, like, I've always thought about like, how do you, how do you localize different products and niche different products, like barely AI for, um, you know, Vietnam, for example, could be a pro a huge product or, and then you can expand, you know, you can just, you can think about like, and I just find that Americans don't think often like that. They don't think like, oh, Hey, let's like, they just think about like, if, you know, if you make it in New York, you make it everywhere.

Right. Like that's like the, the mentality, but I don't think that's necessarily true because I believe in, you know, speaking to different audiences and the way they want to be spoken to. So I think there's a ton of opportunity and just creating, uh, proven products that have AI that are AI first and just focusing it on non Western, uh, non Western countries.

Well, let me, let me use an example from, I mean, you, you, you had a viral thread a couple of days ago around, uh, I think a vendor owed you a hundred and nine thousand dollars and you're just, look at this. 109, 500, but who's counting? Yeah.

So you saw a vendor owed you six figures, it's called a hundred K and, and, and actually, well, I was reading it. I mean, the solution ended up being very simple. It was like, you, you prompted chat GPT to give you an email to send hypothetically to a vendor that owed you X amount of money hadn't paid in a Y amount of time.

Right. Like simple enough, but I think there's an insight in there. I think it's why it kind of went viral.

Right. Last time I saw it was like 12,000 likes or something, which is millions of impressions. But like, I think the insight there was something and you touched on it.

It was like the idea that it's good call back off. Right. Like, yeah, I could have written that email.

I could have written it, but there's mental blockers for you to write that email. I think that, so for the listeners that haven't seen it, the, the text of the email is something along the lines of, you know, Hey vendor X, like, uh, we've given you five months, uh, uh, to, to pay this bill and we much appreciate it if you pay, if not, here's some recourse, right? Like you literally could have written that, but the mental blocker to be like, fuck, do I want to be the bad guy?

Like, dude, you know what I mean? It's like, do I really want to do no, but I want you to apply that. Think about that mental blocker that you as a West, a successful Western entrepreneur had, right.

To write that English email. No, no apply that to the 700,000, the 700 million Southeast Asians. Right.

Imagine trying to write an angry email from like, you're a Malaysia manufacturer. You're trying to get a, uh, a New York based company to pay you six figures. Where do you even start to communicate that properly?

Like you, I think that's what the beauty about that. Like it was such a simple solution, but I don't think people understand the implications of it. So literally now you can have angry emails that are effective written to sound like a lawyer.

Hell, this might be a bad thing, but not anybody can do it. But I think it's a great equalizer. I mean, a lot of our team is based in Canada, so obviously they're super nice and they're just like, they're just like, I can't write this email.

Well, like they were basically like, you know, responding to that, you know, that vendor and just being like, Hey, just following up would be awesome to get paid. You know, it's just like, it wasn't, it needed like a bit more, um, oomph. Exactly.

It was missing some oomph. And, uh, they asked for my advice and I was just like, chat GPT. Like, um, they're like, yeah, let's go, let's, you know, initially they're like, we're going to give it to the lawyer and let the lawyer just like handle it.

And at the time we were like, you know, we're, we're over budget that month on, on, on legal field. Yeah. I was just like, let's just, let's do a fun experiment.

And we did it. And I just, I got that notification like 95 seconds after I sent the email, um, from, from the executive of that company. And he's like, yeah, sure.

No problem. We'll pay you. I was like, you knew it was good content too, right?

Cause I know, you're a content guy. You're like, Ooh, this is good content. Yeah.

Totally. Yeah. I, yeah.

I was telling someone on my team, I was like, it's worth it. It's worth the money just on the content alone. I'm just, forgot the hundred and nine.

I mean, dude, I was looking, uh, cause I don't know, this is specific for the users that aren't super Twitter heavy, but kind of the way you plug your products on Twitter is after like a long multi tweet thread. Like I was looking at, and, and kind of conversion is typically whatever you can convert 10% of likes from the first tweet to the bottom. Like you've done a great job.

I was looking at some of the likes towards the end of there. I'm like, damn dude, this is like, this converted really well. Oh yeah.

I mean, I'll share some of that inside info. Like, you know, one of the things I launched in that thread or put in that thread is a design service called dispatch 5k a month. Yeah.

5k a month. I put it, I put the, I put the, in like in the tweet, I was like, Hey, listen, like this inspired us to, to launch this product that like we actually get paid on you pay us 5k a month and it's unlimited designs for your company. And it's like landing pages and websites and apps unlimited for, for only 5k a month.

And from that tweet alone, like seven, you know, that'll generate, sorry, it'll generate six figures in ARR just from that tweet. Just from that. Did you actually launch it because of that thread?

Yeah. So in the works, we, uh, we had it as an idea. We're just kind of like, Hey, like, you know, a lot of companies, we, we just had a request, like a lot of companies just need, you know, our, our short staff, but they want like small design tasks and they weren't right for our, like traditional design agency.

And we've just been like giving them to other clients. And we're just like, Hey, like, or sorry, we've been giving, we've just been referring it to other agencies. Cause we're just like, Hey, it's not a fit, not a fit.

They were like, Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have like a monthly subscription? Um, and it was, it was on the back burner. Um, and then when that happened, I was like, Hey, it's a great, great forcing function to bring that back.

Imagine if we can get, you know, six figures a month or even seven figures every single month being charged. And it's, you know, not, you know, we work with a lot of fortune 500s. It's, you know, net 30, net 60, et cetera.

Well, there you go. You need 20, you need 20. And I looked at, it's not shocking at all that you got at least 20 because I looked at, man, again, this inside baseball for people don't use Twitter.

Like you can kind of do like a rough hand conversion of like likes to like clicks. Yeah. I'm like, whew, this, this thread was like, like that's hilarious, man.

So like this, this, this thread, you put a little hit on every single level. There's like five layers of winning here. Oh yeah.

And it, and it generated thousands of subscriptions to you probably need a robot.com. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

Right. Um, so I'm curious. And so for you, how much, uh, cause I mean, you obviously jump quickly on different, uh, different, uh, ideas that you think are, you know, quite large, uh, potential and outside of the ones you kind of mentioned, uh, kind of the community, the newsletter, um, are you looking at doing a lot more AI stuff, uh, around products that you, cause you said you launched five to 10 a year, or you said you have five companies in the works.

Yeah. Yeah. So we got into AI.

Well, I've been in, in some form into AI for a long time. So like my co-founder and I have late checkout, you know, I mentioned stumble upon, like stumble upon was like the OG, you know, personalization and AI company. Yeah.

So that's how I got into AI. Um, and, and also I studied computer science at McGill shout out McGill again. Um, and, uh, so I learned, I learned a little from that and yeah, for those of you who don't know, stumble upon, it was basically like a, you, it was, you know, you put your interest in and you press a button and it would serve you interesting web pages based on some AI and ML.

Um, kind of similar to how like the tick tock for you page really works. Um, but for web pages. So I've been interested in a while, you know, for a while, but you know, with all this, you know, buzz over the last 12 to 18 months and a lot of our clients asking us for AI product designs, I just wanted to build like a free community.

Um, because my belief is like, if you attract the smartest people into a community and you have like, you know, workshops with them and, you know, masterminds with them, you get to know them. Like you, even if you're not an expert, you can become an expert. Um, so the fastest way to learn is to start a community in my opinion.

Right. And, uh, I, I wanted that for my team as well. So from that, I think we're going to build a lot of AI stuff.

Yeah. Fair enough. Right.

Because, uh, again, a lot of the, a lot of the difficulties in AI is, is not necessarily specific to AI, right? Like, again, you're not going to build probably a large language model. The challenges is distribution packaging.

And I mean, this is your area of expertise, right? Like this is distribution packaging is literally like what you do. So, um, no, that makes a lot of sense, man.

Hey, I had a, I had a question regarding, but you worked at tick tock, right? Yeah. I was an advisor to tick tock.

Okay. Okay. Because of the stumble.

Oh, because it'd recommender says, Oh, interesting. Okay. It makes sense.

Yeah. Well, yeah, actually, the reason why is because I, um, I had built like this app five by that got acquired. Um, it was this video discovery app similar to how tick tock worked and I, and tick tock hired when tick tock after it was rebranded to tick tock from musically they, uh, they hired a bunch of YouTube execs basically.

Um, and I knew a lot of those YouTube execs for my five by days. So they brought me in to help them YouTube if I and grow tick tock. Cause cause at the time it was an app for like 12 year old girls.

So we need to ask them, we got, we're gonna, there's a big elephant in this room. Um, should the United States ban tick tock? Give me your honest opinion.

Should the United States ban tick tock or force a sale? What do you think? Are you too close to this one?

What do you think? Oh yeah. I think there's no question.

I, I, I've never written about this. I think they should, they should ban and then force a sale. Um, my logic is it was a little cold wars, but I just think it's crazy that the analogy I always use is this.

If this was the 20th century, it'd be like if the Soviet union owned ABC, CBS or NBC, right? Like the televisions, the one of the three big television stations that had access to hundreds of millions of Americans. And this is what tick tock is.

I'm not, I'm not saying that there's every single day someone within the CCP is like going into tick tock saying like do X, Y, Z, but we've seen with Chinese tech and Chinese industry, sometimes you don't even have to say it's, it's understood what you need to do. Right. And, uh, I mean, Yi, uh, Yi Ziming the former, I mean, the, I guess he stepped down as a CEO of ByteDance or still chairman, very involved was he had to apologize for the, the, I don't know how to pronounce the two towel, the newspaper app.

He's like, yeah, CCP is like, we're not liking the content here. So we had to make a huge public apology. So it's not, they need the force of sale.

I'll tell you what's funny. I, I, obviously there's only like five or six companies in America that can buy tick tock, but I think it's going to end up being owned by Microsoft, which will just, and Satya is already the biggest animal ever. And he's going to own tick tock.

Right. And he's going to buy, buy for like 30 billion dollars. Uh, I think that will be the outcome.

So I don't know what you feel about that, but yeah, it's more just, I don't think it should be owned by, by a Chinese company with the CCP on the board. So those are my thoughts. Yeah.

So, I mean, I agree. I have to agree with you. Um, I think, yeah, sorry, go ahead.

No, I was going to say, if a for sale were to happen, who do you think would be a buyer? Um, I think Google or Microsoft. Um, but I, you know, I think like it can happen to Meta because anti competition, anti trust, right.

Um, it could happen to Disney. Disney could buy it. Oh, that's interesting.

Cause Disney actually looked at buying Twitter in 20, uh, 2016. I think that a term sheet, everything was ready. And then Iger like woke up one day.

It's like, I don't want to deal with this. I can, I don't want to deal with the moderation bullshit that's going on there. I think, uh, Google is interesting because then they own like short form tech talk and longer form YouTube, uh, Netflix, of course.

Well, actually let's game this out. I'm making a prediction. YouTube is going to buy tech talk.

They're going to spin out YouTube. It's going to go public 500 billion dollar company done Clip this editor clip this for when this happens in the next 12 months no, I, I think, uh, I think that makes sense. I also think Satya buying tick tock integrating open AI and then turning it into a super app would be the great, it's undefeated.

Just go off in the sunset that, well, what other purpose do you have to exist? Like Satya, go retire after that, man. Yeah, totally.

Um, dude, this has been fun. I gotta, I gotta run, but this is, this is, this is, yeah, of course, man. Uh, I know we had the hour and, uh, for the listeners, my internet was complete disaster.

So I, uh, I had to keep coming back and telling Greg, I'm like, Greg, we're getting this episode. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, well, you know, jump in and make sure your editor isn't too difficult to stitch it together. Greg, I do appreciate the time, man.

That was awesome, dude. No, you come back anytime. Uh, where could folks follow you on Twitter and, and plug the podcast also?

Yeah. Uh, well, keep super simple. Everything's on my Twitter bio, strong T fan on Twitter, uh, non-investment advice with, uh, Jack Butcher, who, uh, was previously on Greg's show and then, uh, Bilal Zady and, uh, yeah, barely AI is B E A R L Y dot AI.

Uh, it's free to use to try. And, uh, if it's in your UX wheelhouse, I get a lot of dopamine with new signups. So, uh, think about that.

I love it. Go follow him. Thanks, John.

Yeah, absolutely, man. Thanks, Greg. Later.
