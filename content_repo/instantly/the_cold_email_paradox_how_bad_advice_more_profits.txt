hey guys braul here and yesterday at dinner we were discussing with some cold email experts about why people succeed and why they don't and we figured out a paradox a disease an epidemic that's going around in cold email and in this video i want to show you how bad advice sometimes actually helps you make more profits before we get started make sure you like hit subscribe subscribe button so i can keep creating more of these videos and let's get into it so the symptoms are if you're asking questions like which domain provider to use which email provider to use should i use soho or g suite the technical setup how to do spf tkim what the warm-up limit should be which data provider to use what verification tool to use what what subject line is good right now what kind of copy should i be using should be using links in the image should be using images what are the daily sending limits when to send emails what to respond to interested leads if you're asking these questions then i'm sorry to tell you you had the disease you are one of those people that is overthinking a lot of the cold email and there are people out there that might be much less experienced than you but they're making more money and the cure is it's simple it's just send it the dude that's sending 5k emails with no custom tracking domain no text setup and generic emails will make more money than a dude with a perfect email setup sending couple of hundred emails so literally we realized this that we have some clients that after making 20 30k with cold email they're asking us like hey what's what's custom tracking domain they were sending the entire time without custom tracking domain we have clients that have no warm-up uh set up or warm-up activated they're making money we have clients that don't have teamwork set up they have some like red uh icons in instantly that the teamwork hasn't been set up correctly and they're making money so they're not overthinking it they're just sending pints of emails and making more money even if you burn all of your domains you're gonna end up with some clients hopefully and make more money so it goes a little bit against the grain it's that's why it's like bad advice obviously the best case scenario would be you do all these things there's like a perfect cold email setup but what i want to get across is you don't have to worry about these things the main goal what you should be worrying about is getting out as many emails as possible just reaching out to people stop overthinking stop having this like limiting belief that you need to have the perfect setup everything set up correctly and while it sounds counterintuitive at some point this perfectionism is is not good it's holding you back and there are like just people out there that aren't as good as you at cold emailing they don't know anything but they're just sending emails even if you use your gmail like you don't need to have the means just people that are sending emails are going to make more money and that's the main point of this video so the cure is just send it just start sending emails stop worrying but even if you're in like the warm-up cycle right now you can test sending a couple of emails a day like nothing bad's gonna happen the worst things can happen you're gonna make money like that's the downside so the main thing to remember is you still need a good offer and large notary group but all of this nitty-gritty spf what domain everything like that it doesn't really make a difference if you have a good offer it doesn't really make a difference what's going to copy use what subject line you use like if you have a really good offer the fundamentals are in place and you have a large enough target group that you can start blasting emails you're gonna make money if you don't have these and you have perfect these it's much harder to make money than having perfect offer large entire group and then you just run them emails as much as possible i'm not telling you to spam randomly that's why you need a good offer and a target group that actually will benefit from your offer don't do anything illegal don't spam people you still need to be offering people something that they need something that they will get value out of but stop overthinking all of these questions all of the main cold email questions start sending once you're getting responses you can worry about this but don't let these things hold you back in the instant accelerator we have so many topics and videos sops about everything like this and you can go through and you can learn them but i would rather much rather have you start sending sooner without knowing what spf dkm is you can start sending like just try it out start with your gmail just start sending and always like those dudes the action takers are going to make more money for whatever reason they don't have that limiting belief they don't take cold emails so seriously maybe that's another thing that people think that when they're starting out the cold email is like so serious uh other kinds of marketing channels like if you're doing like facebook ads google ads it it is like more uh official maybe more professional and cold email can be that but at the end of the day we're just reaching out to people and if our offer is beneficial for them we're trying to help them obviously like we want to make money but if we have a good offer we're going to help them make more money too we're going to help them succeed with their business like that's that's all it is we're just reaching out to other people other humans so like we're all in this together it's not something scary you don't have to have everything step by step but yeah still keep it legal don't spam people but just send it start sending those emails i think like if if i'm going to do webinars and i call with people like the first thing i'm going to ask like if people come to me like hey like rawul my email campaigns didn't work and ask like how many emails you sent and is it like 100 i'm not even going to take the call anymore it's like if you haven't sent like thousand five thousand emails like i can't take you seriously like you have to send the volume out first and then we figure out what works same thing with copy we won't know what works before you send out those emails once you start sending them out you start learning things you start learning what subject line works what kind of target group works for you what kind of messaging resonates with people you start getting all this input all this data all this information and then you can turn it into a really profitable campaign maximizing optimizing for all of these smaller things but yeah just send it just send it just send it so hopefully it will motivate you to stop overthinking just sending more emails and you will make more money if you want to learn anything about cold email everything is in instantly you go into.ai we're a free trial and if you go here in the bottom left instant accelerator we have everything from the mission offer which is the most important part so if you nail your initial offer again then all this small technical stuff don't matter that much but if you have a bad offer you can have a perfect setup it doesn't help and then we're going to help you with the setup how to get leads copywriting campaign management optimizing and then sales closing those people so hopefully this helped if you got any insights press subscribe press like and i'll see you in the next video cheers
