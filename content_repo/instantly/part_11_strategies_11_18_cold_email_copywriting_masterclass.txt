strategy 11 adding a guarantee the biggest objection to overcome with cold prospects is trust they don't know you they don't know what you can do if you add a guarantee they will trust you more because you have some skin in the game figure out the best guarantee you can offer it doesn't always have to be money-back guarantee and if you're struggling to close make it a no-brainer offer for them more skin the game if you're already closing nicely and you have a working focus then you can focus and make it a no-brainer for you don't make your life miserable on purpose so meaning in the beginning if you're starting out you want to offer a really good money-back guarantee or just guarantee but when you're getting to be an expert you can have a better guarantee for yourself you're not going to have so much skin in the game so there are three main types of guarantees deliverability based guarantee best for services if you don't do x will do y if you don't increase your revenue in 60 days you get a full refund if you don't increase revenue in 60 days we work for no extra charge until we get there asset based if you do audits set up we guarantee that you'll have a new website in 30 days or get a full refund we guarantee we'll set up your facebook ads with at least 10 ads in 30 days or you get a full refund and then action-based best for courses and do-it-yourself offers if you follow all the steps in an action plan course and you don't see the result in this time frame you get a full refund so you're putting it on them while still offering the guarantee that if they join your course and they follow through and it's not going to give them results you pay the money back example hey tom we help sauce companies like you get extra 10 meetings weekly with your ideal customers and if you don't get your 10 meetings weekly you get your money back mind if it's in your morning on how we do it so without this guarantee line it's pretty generic basic but this will be the interest more okay like they are guaranteeing 10 meetings maybe i'm like a little bit more inclined to respond to see how it works let's try the 12 performance bid offer if your offer is performance based say it in your emails this will get you more responses hey tom we have fashion income stores like you grow with tiktok ads and we work purely on performance if you don't increase your sales you don't pay us anything might need to send more information again it will stand out it shows you have some skin in the game it's a no-brainer for them strategy 13 free audit based on your services you might have an opportunity to give them a free audit give a free value and this will increase your responses for example hey tom we have fashion income stores like yours increase your traffic from google i already noticed some low-hanging foot on company website i would love to give you a free audit on what you could improve give any time this thursday or friday for a 15-minute call strategy 14 pre-work sending value similar to audit but you can already do even more stuff before you reach out if you have a very specific offer and not many leads in dark group then it makes sense to do more prep than it would usually do because you want to take the maximum out of your leads you can do mock-ups you can say like hey i create this tick to cat mock-up for you you get a quick call it hey i already created an audit about working through your product pages what you can improve just write down specific things you notice in the website size 15 broken link this is a little sneaky method but if you don't want to create customers videos for each prospects and only create videos for people who respond to this i create a quick loan meter for you and then i have room with that with a broken link link that doesn't exist if they click on it it doesn't work and then they will reach out like hey the link is broken then you will know that okay they're they're interested you will create the video then and send a new new link for them strategy 16 be ambiguous more vague it's counterintuitive but sometimes being vague is better than being very specific if your offer is something that people have heard hundreds of times they might be allergic even to like main buzzwords and even if you can actually help them they might not respond they might also be biased because of bad experiences with similar offers example if you help SaaS companies with SEO don't tell them you offer SEO they've heard it a thousand times before tell them you have strategies to increase their MRR this might be to interest more strategy 17 being upfront and trying to sell a copy sorry if it's too upfront but i know it is something that good your offer might have seen more information serve it's too upfront but just notice your website doesn't have a facebook pixel installed so you can even be a little bit more intriguing calling out something and like trying to get like wire sorry like sorry if it's too upfront but why don't you have tiktok ads like you're losing out on so much revenue this is again like one sentence you pick your interest with a question and then super short offer of what you're doing or what you can help strategy 18 being spontaneous this might be like one of my favorite ones to start with and most co-limit copy sucks because you can understand straight away it's a template so if we have a way to make it seem less templatized it will get more responses and to get around this when you're sitting down to write your first copy imagine that you just found the prospects website clicked email us contact us and you're now writing an email you can't edit it and you just have to send it so don't edit it keep editing to a minimum because editing will remove a lot of the things that make it seem like it was written on the spot it can be a little more sloppy but it will come off more authentic i like to use words that expert copywriters would say is remove for example the words so so i was just searching for income servers in a template videos i was searching for income source but if you had so it seems more like not that edited it should be a template you wouldn't say so it's more the way people talk not right and because of that it will come off as less as a template also like to use it like by the way let me know and anything else people used to write with their friends in chat don't use fancy signatures keep it simple example hey tim so i was just searching for sustainable income stores and i found your company and when i was scrolling through the product pages i saw that you don't have a tick tock account yet and what we just read away have you thought about tick tock or because shortly we help sustainable income stores spread their mission and get more sales on tick tock by the way we just helped this client get an extra 40k visit in one month there would it be cool if i send you more information how we did let me know best alex so it has like bunch of stuff so and when because shortly by the way just i typed it up no editing just first thoughts that came into my mind and it might get like long and sloppy but just do this as an exercise write it once just some what comes out of you after you've done the research just pure unadulterated first version copy that you can and try to end this out you'd be surprised how well this works
