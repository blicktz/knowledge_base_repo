hey guys raul here and today i'm going to show exactly what we did and what we didn't do to grow instantly to 5 million arr in 12 months with cold email and i saw a tick tock that uh showed that if you have like five fingers between you and the microphone the sound is better so i'm trying that hopefully it's better for you guys and if you like it please like subscribe and i will keep creating more of these videos and the first thing that not many people do so i'm actually going to show you proof so we go to chart mogul you can see we started from february last year 2022 and now we're above 5 million arr and i'm going to refresh so there's no inspect element stuff going on it's true 5.8 million arr and now i'm going to show you exactly how we did it so let's get into it so first part niche and offer i should mention that if you're looking at this and you want more detailed information in instantly if you log in and you go on the left hand side instant accelerator everything is in here everything i'm going to talk about is in here in much more detail starting from niche the setup where we get leads copywriting campaigns optimization sales so don't worry you'll have to take many notes later everything is in here but i'm just going to give you a quick overview of the most important things so let's start with the niche and offer so what does instantly help you do it helps people save money and make money so it's this really good combo that is very good beneficial for cold email because with cold email we're reaching out to people that don't know anything about you reaching out from the like outer blue and for that kind of marketing outreach our offer needs to be a priority it can't be something that's nice to have it can't be very situational for example like web design web development which is a good niche but for cold email it's very hard to sell it because you have to hit them in the exact right moment when they need your offer with instantly most b2b companies their priority is to grow that's what we help them do so we help them make money well we save money plus we combine it with a unique angle so when instantly came came live we were the first ones that offered unlimited email accounts with one subscription for sending emails and warm up everybody else was charging per account so it was very expensive and we came in with something new which combining it with these value propositions adding unique angle worked really well and it's still working really well so so the takeaway from you guys is whatever niche you're working on pull out the most important parts of your offer try to combine them with the priorities of your target groups hopefully it will help them go to business which is like one of the best ones and then try to figure out something unique about your offer if you have an agency if you have for example like seo agency if you're doing email marketing try to find something that you guys are doing differently it can be the offer it can be the pricing it can be your case studies it can be just how you present yourself your branding you have to stand out from everybody else and this is already like a huge marketing hack in of itself it's same with email copywriting if everybody's sending the same thing if you send something unique it's already going to stand out even if your offer is the same so try to find something unique and focus on the priorities that's what we did next up setup so for the setup main thing don't overthink it we've tried most of the email providers but our main ones are google and soho we do three emails per domain sometimes we've tried more sometimes we tried less and usually 30 emails presenting out daily and this is cold emails cold outreach that we send out daily plus the warm-up emails on top of that and what we did well is we scaled up monthly so every month that we grew it worked it was profitable we bought more domains more email accounts we started with just like 20 30 ones last year now we have hundreds and we keep on buying them we keep on adding more firepower to our arsenal so we can just reach out to more people so if you guys find a working angle niche and you're getting good responses and you're closing clients get those new domains get those new email accounts consistently don't just buy 10 and leave it at that you have to buy new ones and it's not only for scaling it's also backup for you if your emails get blacklisted they go to spam you always want to have backup and it also makes sense to diversify so sorry so don't only get google also get soho outlook whatever it is that you want to try so the setup part is pretty self-explanatory that leads again we've tried pretty much everything apollo ocean built with is good for everybody that wants to target the specific technology and then we were constantly finding new sources we weren't just complacent with apollo and we just used that we from the start we started using multiple different angles and again this is something that everybody should be doing it's not cold email isn't setting up forget it you have to constantly find new lead sources so that's what we are doing to this day still finding new sources and also doing custom scraping so if you find a database and we find a website email and a blog post with really good targets for us we just go to opwork and we post a custom scraping shop that please scrape all these emails verify them and send us the list so we're still doing it and you should be doing the same having a custom list having a lead source that nobody else is using is already a huge advantage or everybody else who's using the same targeting so you can imagine like apollo one of the biggest players on the market these people on there in the most like most common filters let's say like marketing and advertising or shopify stores all these people are getting so many emails so if you can find a new lead source you're gonna be ahead of the game and we've been doing this constantly still doing it finding searching everything just google it man like just go to google and add your niche database see what comes up and try everything don't stop trying them copywriting so here i know everybody wants to see formulas but just testing new stuff every damn day almost every day we try something new the most common one that we use is presentation hey compliment and then relevant case study like same why you clicked on this video want to see how we grew our sauce to 5 million arr i want to show you exactly how we did it and then soft call to action mind if i send more information we in the beginning we little like tried a little bit uh straight to call and calendar links but it didn't work as well as soft cta especially for our case which for sauce it's much easier to showcase how we got there with bloom videos than if you have an agency offer a high ticket offer where it might take a little bit more convincing but just try new new angles every damn day again if you go to instantly in the copywriting masterclass here we have so many different options for you to try there's never there should never be like a day or a week where you can't figure out like why just you try there's so many different options like one sentence email research angle asking for an intro podcast angle doing it in their native language using images using not images videos asking for permission so just we've tested pretty much everything that we've thought of and you should be getting into that mindset as well like i mentioned not set it and forget it you need to be doing it every day every campaign will stop working at some point no campaign is evergreen so you need to be on the lookout and prepare yourself for when that campaign stops working so it's not when that stops working and then you start figuring out new stuff you should already have those campaigns ready you don't have to launch them but just like add it to your calendar every day every week adding more campaigns and then testing all different angles then the campaigns themselves so pretty much again we just tested new stuff every day we have no clear structure it's not like always we're gonna do this some campaigns of just one email some have seven so first email and six follow-ups but the main thing here is we have tested hundreds of campaigns that's why we're growing so fast that's why we're getting so many results because we've went through the motions we've tested all the different angles we tested all different follow-ups we've tested like everything that you can test we have been testing and we will continue to test nobody knows what's going to work and the only way to stay ahead of the game is to come up with something new because all the old ones are going to stop working at some point so don't overthink it just again daily weekly make new campaigns try with follow-ups without follow-ups two follow-ups four follow-ups see what works for you the main thing just test test test test test and then lastly sales in the beginning when we got a positive response we did live sales calls i would jump on the demos with people uh nils rayo our co-founders jumped on the calls with people and you should do the same for us because it's a lower ticket sauce it was it made sense a lot of sense to optimize it and take ourselves out of the sales process it doesn't really make sense for us to spend even 30 minutes on a call for like a product that starts from 37 a month even if the lifetime value is bigger in the end the goal should be for sauces to take yourself out of it by substituting yourself with sales materials so how do you do it even if you're an agency you can still substitute yourself or make sales videos sops documents case studies everything that you can send over before the demo show on the demo and send over after the after the demo so these are going to be like your wingmen they're going to help you close the sale by showing them what you're doing how it works how you did the exact same thing for another person so if you're doing demos record them great materials around them great videos of your best case studies interview your clients and then slowly start piecing them into your sales process and try to optimize it as much as possible by shortening your demos because if you want to scale you have to take yourself out of it you can also build a team like we haven't built a sales team for this which is pretty surprising in the beginning we thought we would have to do it but right now it's completely automated for for us but yeah if you are going down the sales team route it works really well but you still should be creating all these materials and like this video as well i'm creating this video as a sales material so i don't have to jump on one-on-one calls with you guys because i do this one video and there's thousands of tens of thousands of you that are going to watch this video and i just do it once i just record it 20 minutes but it's going to be watched hundreds of hours so that's the leverage of content and why you should be doing it and yeah that's pretty much it so you see it maybe sounds a little bit simplistic but if you go into the deep end in our accelerator you're going to get everything exactly how we did it and the main thing is just to keep on learning keep on testing we're still doing different campaigns we just had the brainstorming call a couple of days ago coming up with new angles coming up with new approaches coming up with new lead sources that we're going to test so you should always be learning figuring stuff out once you find something that works double down on it get more domains get more emails and just start sending stop overthinking and just start sending i i can't imagine like where it would be if you would have like very clear structure and we never like have this experimentation mindset i think we we would never reached uh like five million in a year if you had that so try to eliminate that just start listening this is just like emails just reaching out to other people that if they need your offer they're going to respond so just go for it scale up hope it helps like subscribe leave a nice comment it was my birthday yesterday so positive vibes and uh yeah see you in the next one guys thanks
