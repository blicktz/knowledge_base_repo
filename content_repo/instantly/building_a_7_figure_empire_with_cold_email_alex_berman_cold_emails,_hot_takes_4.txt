Hey guys, I'm Raul here with another episode of Cold Emails Hot Takes and today super excited. We have Alex Berman. He has courses, he has YouTube, he's a filmmaker, he has software, best-selling author, food critic, posts on Twitter like a maniac and I think most importantly, I think like no joke, you've helped thousands of people pay for rent, pay for food, help their families and so like from the entire Cold Emails community.

Thanks for everything you've done and happy to have in the show man. Thanks Raul, thanks for having me. Of course and so I have some cool questions lined up but before we get into those stuff we always ask a couple of questions from all the participants in the podcast so you have so many different things going on.

What's the main KPI for you? What are you optimizing for? Right now the main thing I'm optimizing for is SaaS signups so we have the SaaS Tapleo which is the number one priority right now as we're scaling you know I think we're at 35-36,000 MRR after three four months which is great to see and I know that everything is related to that so for instance if we're cold emailing for Tapleo then all of a sudden now that cold email learning can go into the course or if we show great screenshots of revenue growth for Tapleo or even any of the other sasses that we're running now all of a sudden people are joining the coaching and joining that stuff so I'm very much a results focused person in terms of I know that like if we are doing stuff the content's going to be better versus being content focused which a lot of people are where they're creating courses and they're doing all this stuff but it's mainly copy pasting other people's things.

This is actually one thing I love about you guys too. All of your content is real in the field tested stuff and you're innovating you know you've got the spin tax you've got all these innovations and that stuff only comes from actually doing the work. Yeah exactly so like we're trying to be again like going after like you like the content part we've turned like from SaaS into more of like a content marketing age right now it's like good focus good thing to have and so because you have like so many things right now you're focusing on like Tapleo and for us we feel like all of this success and like money and MR we're making right now only makes sense if we compare it to like what we had before so like looking back when you start like what's the least amount of money you remember having in your bank account?

I don't know I've had like 20 bucks before and then I've had to like go to Walmart and try to figure out how to eat and all that stuff but I would say it's all it was all from for money management on my side you know like because because for me it always was like feast and famine like I'd make 6k and then I'd spend the 6k on one major project a lot of times it's art that takes up all my money um last time that was last time I was super broke because I decided to make a movie and it cost seven thousand dollars and I only had like seven thousand in my bank account I used every dollar on this yeah and what happened with the movie it didn't go anywhere classic like big money stuck that's classic art sometimes you put all this time in and then it's not even worth releasing but I'm getting better at that too like that's one of the main things I wanted to ask you and I was talking with uh instant this co-founders like what should I ask Alex and were like how the hell are you doing so many things like where did you get the energy were you born like this are you using a lot of coffee red bull something else like how do you do it I how do I get the energy bro it's just like they're I'm fighting I feel like I'm very much on on my back leg I see people even like instantly you guys grew so fast and I'm like as I see that growth I'm like why am I not growing that fast on our sasses or I see like cold email wizard blowing up with his uh cold email course he hit this nerve he basically turned cold email into a meme which I I was trying to do for five six years so I just see all these other people doing great stuff and then I feel like I always got to catch up and that's what gives me the energy it's like I'm always I'm always just trying to get on your guys level you know everyone else in the space yeah I love that but it's like it's weird for us like it seems like you're the guy like you're the one we're living for and then you still have the chip on your shoulder so like how do you keep it there like how do you have your back against the wall because I feel so with instantly now we're like bootstrapped but before I had a like a failed startup where we invested money and I felt like when you get the money you're gonna like let loose you know we can make it like we don't have that like rush anymore like how to keep it when you have those opportunities when you have the money so what works for me is big monetary goals so if I don't have something I'm saving up for uh then I don't try to go for the money like right now I'm really trying to you know build a family and have a house and like send if I have kids send them to private school and like these are all goals I have to stack up right which now makes my burn rate you know I'm gonna have to somehow find like 30 or 40 000 a month in profit just to support the family on top of savings goals on top of taxes and everything um so now I'm motivated versus if I didn't have any of those goals and I was just chilling you know and I was playing video games and smoking weed all day and my burn rate was two thousand dollars a month you know what I would I would feel no need to uh to keep going and I've been there before you know like I felt like I felt retired the first time I started making three thousand dollars a month but what is retirement there's a retirement at three thousand and there's a retirement at ninety thousand a month you know I was thinking about this the other day I'm like if I just went back to the life I was living in Wichita Kansas you know four hundred dollar a month apartment I could retire for the rest of my life and never work and I didn't want that I'm like do I want that life or do I want the life where I'm in a mansion and driving a supercar and have kids that are in private school and like all this shit and I'm like yeah that's that's the one I want the second one makes sense like that's uh like what I learned from from my first like sales job when we got the like bible of how to get started it said like yeah throw away old clothes like get a new nice watch get a nice apartment and it seemed like toxic before but like now I get it if you level up like you have to keep up with that stuff but that being said so like with your art projects which are like other stuff I heard like with the chatbot thing you have to like put some things aside have you gotten better at like saying no to things do you have a system for that like how do you get rid of stuff that you don't want to do yeah um so for for art projects we always want to do it like for instance on best meals on earth and every burger in vegas just this year I've spent over twenty thousand dollars on those channels and the star wars podcast so I'm still doing the art projects I think that's fine um saying no to sas projects is becoming easier um because right now when I when I'm screening things out I always think about uh will this be able to hit a million dollars a month and then do do I have something that'll take this to the next level for instance someone was just pitching me a sas uh yesterday it was like a task management software for business something like that and I was like one I'm not really that interested in task management excuse like a note app but two will my audience really like this will I be able to push this to you know 10 20 30 camera r in the first month or two and if the answer is no then it's not even worth considering at that point because what I've found is all of this stuff balloons out of control like do did I know I'd be spending twenty thousand dollars on youtube channels that wouldn't make any money no uh did I know that when I committed to spend four thousand you know on season one of every burger last year no I didn't know that it would balloon into this thing but everything does same with sas you know we're we're soft launching omni which is our our uh omni channel sales tool and I think we're 68 78 000 in in the hole on that right now in terms of development uh and development costs going forward post launch uh I was just talking to Amit who's our partner there he wants 12 12 000 a month for development and so I'm like and I see it I'm like okay if we commit to this we're going to be able to be best in class tool but did I know that when me and Amit were playing golf and he told me it was going to be 22 000 to build the whole tool all in no so I think that's the other thing I'm starting to realize is like saying yes doesn't mean uh saying yes to whatever's being offered it means saying yes to all of the second and third order consequences of everything um similar in sas too like when we started lead shark did I know that if we started a lead generation platform people like will cannon who run up lead would you know remove our free access to the tool or like you know like it's it's like you start something and then you don't realize like all the second and third order consequences similar on the courses I didn't know that like starting certain courses would give me bad blood with certain uh creative creators out there um so that's that's what I that's what I try to do now like anytime I'm presented with a project I try to think of like not saying yes or no to this but saying yes or no to how it's going to look in six months or eight months or you know two three years from now and then only if that looks good then I'll then I'll say yes otherwise I'll throw it in the trash it's got to look really good yeah it's like I remember like when we had a call when we started instantly and you we had an agency 10 and then we asked about the agency and said like forget the agency guys like you're going to be working on the sauce and same thing just like uh being flexible not being stuck with an idea just because you put so much money into it we're getting better that like first time in our lives we're working on one project like we don't have anything else instantly just that like we gave away the uh agency even though it was making money it was hard but now it's like feels so good and like one of the key things is also mentioned you have a partner and I think like a lot of people like maybe don't know this you seem like this like lone wolf Alex is doing like all these things like you're the face of the operation but you have like really good partner so can you talk a little bit about how people can find a good partner and uh like solo entrepreneurship versus having a partner how does that help you and people like start looking for partner yeah so the partner you're talking about is Robert uh who helps on x27 and now at anr ventures um I found him through Noah Kagan's make money online group back in the day like uh so that's that's how I would find a partner is do the same thing I hired him for some work um so if you're in like a course or a mastermind you're already aligned on the values you know of making money of succeeding of whatever you know that guy was pitching on the course so I would say that's always a great place to start uh finding like-minded people are inside the paid communities too because then you know the partner's not some broke person as well like there there really is a screen to that like if you meet somebody in a community that's a thousand dollars a month you know this guy at least has a thousand dollars a month to put into this so he's not going to do any stuff like stealing or anything like that um I would avoid broke people as co-founders uh you can get broke people as employees for sure and then make them rich which is great um but you really don't want broke co-founders because they're going to make decisions from the opposite of an abundance mindset they're going to end up stealing from you or doing weird things that you don't you don't want because that's that um we've co-founders all throughout the organization now too like me and Harambe Money uh do our Venture Mage course um and Harambe the reason why I partnered with him was he's a cool dude but he also has this great case study of raising money with cold email and so that was something we'd never done before so we decided to partner on that and he has a great vision he's worked with a bunch of other influencers and then Amit and the whole first principles team who helps us on the back end with building uh the sasses like like Omni I partnered with him also because he was a cool guy but he was able to run a uh a tech team he was the first agency that told me that the uh the hourly rate was like two dollars fifty cents an hour which I always knew it's true I've run an agency I know what it is you know what I'm saying so that's the other thing to look for especially when it comes to a tech partner is try to find one that's not using you as a way to make money you really want to find a partner that's using the business as a way to make money so if a tech partner comes to you and is like yeah it's going to be 180 an hour that's an agency that's not that's not your uh your co-founder and it's it's stuff like that um I don't know if there's anything else uh long term long term uh is the only real way to find these people as well like me and Robert have been business partners since maybe I don't know maybe six seven years maybe eight years now um and and you can only really see this stuff long term uh because I've had some partnerships fall apart too um we were running this one course called epic mail machine and this guy Michael was was building out all of our funnels for us he was doing all this stuff we were 50 50 co-founders and then after about uh two months in he he didn't like that he was doing all the work and so he sent me an email about that and he he basically dropped the partnership um but that was a good catalyst for us because I just made email 10k after he was the one who got us into online courses so losing a partnership is good too um but that's that's about all it is it's uh trial and error keeping a relationship and uh and just going for it it feels like it's similar like with you with the ideas you just like go out if you see something cool just reach out see what happens and I feel like more people should be doing that because that's the exact same way how we found instantly uh developer cto like co-founder it was like a random ready post that I did about like co-founder subreddit and it's like look what happened now we even went to like visit him in uh North Carolina it's like a random place never seen dude built like a nice house together and then you finally like meet up in real life so it's like actually possible it seems weird like online dating but yeah just like reach out to people it works and you mentioned like going after this like masterminds paid courses like how do guys like you still like learns and stays on the cutting edge are you buying courses what are you doing to like improve your own game I'm buying everything and I I basically get in every everywhere you know I took your guys course I saw Gerem from Lemlist had his free course I took that um I'm implementing these cold email everything like if you guys pitch a script I'm going to send one of those at our company and see if it works you know if we see random stuff online that we haven't heard of before we're testing it out so that's how that's how I'm learning all the time and then I'm I'm talking to people that are above us and trying to learn from them as well um I've been learning especially on the sas side uh Stefan Smulders runs expandy I was just talking to him about like how to map his thing out or how how we should map our thing out based on what he did um I was talking to Dan Martell who runs a bunch of sas stuff so I I think that's that's the thing is to um to understand how uh how small you are in the grand scheme of things right you could look at a sas that's making a million dollars a year or even something like tapio that's making half a million dollars a year and think oh we won if you compare it to one of these indie marketers but then you compare it to like a sas like buffer that's making 15 million a year and all of a sudden you're not even really a percentage of what they're doing and so I think that's that's super important is to look at what they're doing and try to aim for for them and not aim for beating even your past self honestly a lot of people like to look at their past self and be like oh I'm doing so much better than my past self I think that's cool I also like to look at you know the the people out there and say hey this guy's doing this how can I get his results um how come I'm not doing I I like the ego it's like I'm better than this guy right I like thinking about this I'm like I'm better than this guy right I'm smarter than this guy if then why why is he driving a nicer car than me why is he more successful than me and why are his business ideas better than mine right if that's true so then using that to like talk myself down and then uh and then going from there okay that's interesting because so like you're right now into like mindset you've already like reached a level you're trying to find like new things to motivate yourself but let's say so we have a lot of beginners still like there's so many people like still coming into online game they're learning about this stuff so let's say you walk down the street you find a homeless dude and you said like Alex I'm going to do anything you say for three months you can get to 10k a month what's the game plan what are you telling him what should he do step one is take a shower this guy's too smelly step two is create an offer right I was telling my little brother this he's trying to get into business and I'm like he calls it a scheme he wants to create the ultimate scheme and I was like all right well the perfect scheme starts with an offer so basically you need to be selling something to somebody so the homeless guy should come up with an offer probably a marketing offer because anytime you're offering people a chance to make more money it makes it easier to sell uh and then so maybe it's facebook ads maybe it's building a website maybe it's doing something like that those initial services still sell very well and then step one to make your first dollar is approaching these businesses on your street you don't have to worry about cold email you don't worry about cold calling or spending on ads just walk down the street business to business to business the local ones work a lot better than the chains and just see if somebody will will pay you that's how I made my first dollar I walked into a pizza restaurant and offered to rewrite their menu for a hundred dollars I still remember the guy he didn't even have a hundred dollars in cash he wrote me a check for the down payment of 50 and I stuck it up on my wall and that's how you got started just like door-to-door salesman pretty much yeah well so a lot of people over complicate it because you see a tool you see tools like instantly and these cold email tools or you see the gurus talking about facebook ads and spending all this money but the thing is that is all level two or even level three thinking right level one initial thinking zero to one is selling your thing to other people and so if you can't walk into a business and pitch them you can't do this 10 20 30 times until you make a dollar what makes you think that you'll be able to spend ten thousand dollars profitably on facebook or send a thousand cold emails and turn that into a meeting because what's going to happen after you send those thousand cold emails you're going to have to talk to these customers and sell so all you're doing is delaying the inevitable it's similar for sas launches the reason why i feel confident now spending 70 80k on these sasses is because we've done it at a smaller level and i know that we can build this sas and we can turn it into to money and we'll do it on these channels we'll talk to these customers etc etc if you don't have that then you would then you shouldn't spend the 70k you should build a landing page talk to customers and do all that i always think about fast forwarding the money making process so for instance if you tell me that you can't start a sas because you need ten thousand dollars to do the development then my next question to you would be okay let's assume you have the development ready you have the sas ready you have the landing page ready now what's the next step and a lot of people get stuck there you know because the next step is send traffic to the landing page and they can do that without spending ten thousand dollars um that that that is that's the big thing a lot of people get distracted and they think that um they need to spend money or they need all this stuff when really they need to get started and after they spend the money they're still going to be sitting on a worthless asset and having to do the the work that they put off six seven months ago and i feel uh like that's why cold email is so good like it doesn't have to be cold email but it's like one of the cheapest like everybody can do it you don't even need instantly don't need any tool just get a gmail you can start reaching out right and i know you're probably like bored as i like talking about cold email but my viewers would be mad if i don't ask some questions about cold email but so if you look at cold email people say it's easy but i feel it's actually like much harder than it seems because if you're a beginner for like so many things from the technical side finding leads copywriting campaign management optimizing all the software tech stack what do you think from the entire picture is the highest leverage activity that people should really learn and understand and like dive into that will give them like much better results compared to learning everything a little bit all you need are three questions you need who's my target audience what is my offer and what results do i have to prove that i'm able to uh to fulfill that for customers and from there everything else is clear right if if i know that my target audience is local restaurant owners in the charlotte area now i know how to contact them you know whether it's cold email cold calling walking in it's all there if i know my offer is you know i'll generate 40 new customers this week with facebook ads now i have something to to tell them you know whether that's via ad campaign whether that's vehicle email whether it's via walk-in whatever and then if i have a case study like hey i know i can do this because i ran ads myself and we're able to generate clicks for this amount so i know it's going to translate there now i have what i need to close the deal um so that's that's as simple as you can possibly make it it's like who are you selling to what are you selling and how do you know it works and if you can answer those three questions all marketing will fall into place i love that so just start with the basics don't try to figure everything out just like start reaching out as quickly as possible and then you'll figure it out and i feel like this again people are using like templates they're trying to do like one thing but i don't know what's going to work probably you're not going to know what's going to work before you test it out right so out of all the tests you've done you'll probably run like a thousand tens of thousands of tests do you remember something like that was like really how the this work so like pattern interrupt like something you didn't believe actually worked it's no because it's all it's all just basics bro the way that i sell i try to treat it like a magic trick i'm like if i tell you that i've worked with your biggest competitor and generated these results you're going to work with me so like let me try to talk to the competitor and get them to say that i've generated results for them then i'll send an email to you like it's all very very straightforward the way that we sell that's why you know we just do the compliment case study call to action and that's why i think it works so well it's like compliment them you know hey i know who you are you're awesome uh i've done this work in the past for these guys and i'd love to do the same for you let's talk like i think that works so well so consistently because of because of what it is um and so no dude there's no real curveball okay the biggest curveball that i found was just in the the people that are able to loan me their case studies like for instance me and my little brother started a documentary video production company and we hadn't made documentaries before in our life so what we did is we reached out to directors and what we found is a lot of these documentary and non-fiction directors need work and so they gave us permission to list their films on our landing page as like hey our team made these then we reached out to business book authors and this was our highest performing cold email ever i don't think i've talked about this too much but we basically reached out to it was like 80 people that have all been on this pot one podcast where a ghost writing agency for these business books interviewed every single one of their customers so we sent 80 cold emails and i want to say like 30 or 40 of them replied and the the whole thing was like interview or it was a documentary was the subject line it was like hey really love xyz book would love to make a documentary let's talk later this week question mark and that got such good responses and these documentaries were selling for anywhere between 50 and 150 000 each so the amount of leads the the lead amount we were able to generate from that campaign was like 10 to 12 million dollars of just leads off these guys um so that that was the biggest curveball it's it's not in cold email pitching as much as it is in the entire system because i'm not looking at just a cold email everything that we're doing i'm trying to see the entire uh picture at once yeah i love that like it works so well because you customize the cold email big picture for a specific niche right specific like lead source you didn't use like a poll or something custom custom custom that's why it worked and i feel like again people are too stuck maybe even like what i asked you is like some curveballs like well what's the newest thing that works like just a basic state work is proven but if you can try to find like these little pockets out there that people haven't hit like documentary guys i'm pretty sure they get much less emails than like sauce ceos e-com stores right so like finding these pockets might help and business book ceos too or business book writers because they sell none and they're rich enough to afford sixty thousand dollars for a ghost writer okay true so that's like if anybody out there wants to do some custom offers book writers go ahead and well even for even for x27 that was it wasn't a huge niche back when we started but we're selling lead generation to agencies and the way that i found these agencies was a database which is more popular now but it's clutch.co because what i realized was if you're willing to spend two thousand four thousand eight thousand a month to get a sponsorship on clutch.co you're probably going to hire a marketing agency and so i was cold emailing those guys and we closed it was like six hundred thousand dollars in annual recurring revenue in 30 days just reaching out to them you know with a marketing offer like hey we did this for dom and tom we made them a million dollars and we'd love to do the same for you same offer um and that's that's it you know find your lead pool craft your campaign around that and you're good to go that was with no custom first lines or anything the only customization point was um just one portfolio item so like hey love the work you did with power rangers or hey love the work you did on tyson and that was enough customization for them gotcha that's perfect like uh uh quote like to the editor like clip this we can make a tick tock reel out this youtube short we're gonna get into that game as well and those were all the like long questions i had so the last part is rapid fire just like some quick questions don't cheat answer straight away like what comes to your head you ready to go yep copywriting or sales copywriting is sales but like uh live uh on-call sales or copywriting like salesmanship in print so in order to be a good copywriter you need to be talking to customers so i think it's two parts of the of the same coin like i wouldn't be able to create a landing page for an offer if i haven't talked to a few customers already okay coffee or red bull sugar free red bull one twitter account more people should follow one twitter i mean they could follow you i've been loving those uh downloads thanks man biggest cold email red flag i guess cold email red flag selling an offer nobody wants to be able to do it i think it's going to be a little bit more people should know about the next digital gold rush i feel like it's going to be selling tick tock ads to people alex ramosi or undertate alex mosey underrated tool more people should know about underrated tool i feel like not enough people use the crunch based lead generation database it's a bunch of SaaS companies yeah i know like what it should be the biggest one and final question you're held hostage and they will let you go if you send out an email and open it what subject line are you using quick question that's a good way to end it classic quick question thanks so much alex uh where can people reach out to you i'm gonna add all the information in description but just tell short like what you have going on where they can find you and that's it if you want free content go to youtube.com alex berman and if you want to join the coaching go on over to email 10k.com perfect thanks so much man take care thank you
