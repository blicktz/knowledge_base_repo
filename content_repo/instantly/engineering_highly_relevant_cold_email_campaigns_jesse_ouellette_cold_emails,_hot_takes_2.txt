all right great welcome to episode two of the incident podcast we call it cold emails and hot takes where we interview cold email experts in the industry uh you know that are on the cutting edge they know what's they know what's working uh they're in the trenches uh sending cold emails getting replies uh today i have a uh a guest a great guest jesse from lead magic on we've been chatting on twitter a little bit back and forth i've been following his content his tweets and um yeah we'll be chatting about cold email so welcome welcome jesse if you'd like thank you pleasure to be here really excited to chat today i know you guys are at the top of the game for uh cold email so looking forward to it yeah great great to have you here so uh yeah maybe if you'd like you can give a little bit of background about you what you what you're currently doing and uh then i'll ask a couple a couple of uh juicy questions about cold email sure yeah i was a uh i was working uh for enterprise software i was an enterprise software sales rep i kind of pivoted my career towards sas founder the last straw for me was uh i kind of disagreed with uh our ceo over email signature and how it was going to impact our delivery and uh that was the last conversation i had and kind of enterprise software i obviously wanted to be in the inbox primary inbox was a big big deal to me so cold emails a commitment that i've made right i want to i don't want to waste the time i'm not going to be out there sending cold emails if it's not going to land so um you know got rid of the signature now i got my own company and we don't we just use plain text now so it's great deliverability right great all right i just i'll jump into in with a question because i'm following you on twitter and you're dropping some really interesting insights on there and i'll i'll link your uh twitter handle in the description of this too and i saw one of your tweets i really captured uh my attention and you said something like the presidential candidate who can call the email better will win the next presidential election so i was curious can you tell me can you tell me a little bit more about that yeah so i think really uh you know cold email in general right if you think about everybody you know there's what three billion uh what is it three billion emails sent every day right like so the person who's going to win is going to be able to mobilize and if you think about email it's not a it's not something that's it's not a social media algorithm right it's not whatever some company wants to put you where they want to put you in the priority in the ranking right it's it's not like how many you know likes you get or you know engagement it's a one-to-one direct communication to anybody in the world i mean everybody virtually everybody has email right so the hard part obviously is getting around the spam filters and that's kind of where all the focus is and i think companies or organizations that can mobilize their audience right so if we're talking cold email you can send b2b communication uh you know legally unsolicited to people and you can give them information and you can mobilize groups of people uh faster and i think that you know presidential elections and that was just kind of like an off-topic thing i was thinking you know twitter's kind of whatever you're thinking at the time i'm going to say it but that kind of came out and i was just like yeah you know i think really i look back at all the uh emails that i had from presidential election all they're all in spam they're all misconfigured d mark d cam and if you look at like lemless they've even come out and said a couple of their largest customers were the gop or dnc and and they've mentioned this on a couple of times they've kind of you know snuck it out there but i think it's tools like instantly are going to be used kind of to win elections now so i think uh you know that that was just kind of a random thought it really wasn't anything pertaining to anybody i mean i truly believed it so um you know interesting thought but you know happy to debate it with anybody but uh that's what i thought yeah that's something i mean for fundraising or fundraising yeah i mean really just mobilizing right get out the vote get people to the polls b2b you know just the issues right i mean i think you're going to see a lot of this and i i just think it's going to be uh i i think cold email will you know i think tools like instantly will be used to win presidential elections i think the the next presidential election will be won with a tool like instantly okay yeah interesting how did you learn about cold email in the first place how long have you been cold emailing uh yeah i've been kind of uh so i was a sales rep you know for 15 years i was an enterprise rep i had a lot of uh experience doing it and obviously i always tried to get the best data figure out how to validate all the emails i knew how to do email marketing but i was always on the sales side it was one of that commission check for some reason i don't know that was that might not have been the best idea i probably should have been thinking marketing plus side hustle but uh you know so but yeah i think the um just in general what i've realized about email is if you can land and you have a relevant message to that buyer it's pretty much you're going to get something out of it right and the only other way in life that you can really do that is through maybe paid ads or something like that i mean that and that's even really hard i mean you know so you're always gambling with yourself if you don't have that direct communication line right and in a phone call you really need a person there so email has always been an area that i've had a big focus on because i always wanted to separate my time from the actual uh sales process i didn't want to sit there and make a million calls and make them you know do all this now i'm not saying that's a bad idea and that's some people's profession and that's what they want to do great but i also think that there's value in just realizing every single person has email every person there and it's just really your job to figure out how to get around spam filters right now yeah so talking about spam filters what are what are some of your uh favorite strategies to to go around to spam them spam filters uh these days or like what have been some of your learnings yeah so i think really you've got to think through really all of the features that the predictive model can use against you right and what's really happened is there's really two sides you know there's two major providers of email right and they've kind of got a monopoly on everything right you got microsoft and google right i guess you'd say maybe a third is like a zoho but what you really have to think through is what would be the most likely action that a user would take right what would be a normal activity of a user how would they how would they address the problem like what would they be doing if it wasn't you sending 50 000 emails out and spamming your your market right and if you think that way and you think about how to build systems around that where things are deployed automatically you have vas that can help you in the spots that you're not strong enough you have uh you know process in place for when things start to go wrong i think it's a constant monitoring and you have to treat it like it's a service right and what's happened is sure there's great apis out there for marketing and sendgrid and you know you know those but those don't work so well for cold email because cold email it depends on you looking like a user and the second they see you're from sendgrid they're thinking you're a bulk delivery provider so this is where there's a lot of game going on right now and i you know some of the top people out there obviously a cold email wizard i nick abram some of the other folks on twitter uh you know i just eric obviously and some of those folks but we really just got to follow and see what other people are doing and quite frankly i just know just pick up the phone and ask questions with people and learn and we exchange information uh some of the cold email elites out there we're all exchanging information constantly exchanging information data that we find any new tactics uh it's not as competitive as you think in fact some of these times we we don't find any competition between each other in fact there's clients i'd probably give over to to some of them if they're one you know if i am running a cold email campaign sometimes because sometimes you can't handle them all there's so many of them right no no definitely so what we just say is i know you're going to help a lot of people with their uh cold outreach also if they're cold email uh i saw that you're working on a course as well we can talk about that a little bit later uh too and i saw the the outline that you had in your about the chapters it's very comprehensive in there um that you showed so you're covering a lot of detail there and i'm wondering like let's say somebody there's like three different levels of competency right there's a beginner just intermediate and advanced what would you give like to each one of these different categories let's say someone's a beginner they're coming into this they just i mean they know they're just learning about it they connected some accounts put them into warm-up what would you give them kind of what kind of knowledge would you give them on on their way so they can get to the intermediate and advanced level yeah sure so the beginner really needs to focus on just just getting kind of things set up and not really worrying about the cost structure as much right so what they're what they're trying to what they're trying to do is just make sure everything passes through verification make sure that warm-up is started make sure that they're keeping their limits low right and you know that they're they're basically under 50 emails a day on a domain you know they're not they're not getting complaints make sure they get their messaging right you know i would say start with maybe no more than like five domains really right like don't don't get too crazy here right you don't it's only ten dollars a year for another domain right so start start small start with that i think the next level of is that person who's going to take what they had before so let's say they had 10 sdrs or 10 people or anything sending out of uh they were sending they were sending all their emails out of out of the domain and one domain now see if they can 10x their their progress by sending it out of 10 domains and that probably is the next level but there's some management and then cost around data and getting that under control obviously verification making sure that you're verifying the emails and then i think the next level the elite level and i don't see too many people at this step yet i think this is what you're going to start to see it's a truly kind of api driven group of people where they're using uh tools like integra mat uh uh parabola uh zapier things like that to kind of get ahead of all of the emailing right so that group is constantly registering you know domains spinning them up spinning up campaigns you know they can get a 10 domain uh warm up going in less than a half hour right it is like a good good metric and i think that's like the advanced level so i think you know you start out at that small level like get your get your email delivery right you know even if you got to track your opens fine but the next level is then that level of all right now see if you can get that data cost acquisition under control then the third level is that low code no code kind of integration and and building that system around your business to run cold emails and i mean this can be your most highest roi activity out of any startup business and really i would recommend any founder to start doing this today really i mean you're wasting your time if you don't start today no no really interesting that you can uh automate all of the secondary domain uh setup you can automate all of that if you know how to do it and you know how to play around with the api and all that yeah the cloud cloud flares made it a lot easier so cloud flare has some really really good documentation on their apis uh the only part that we're not doing right now is actually registering the domain that goes still goes through there are some services out there like register the domain actually register it uh but we're not doing that yeah we are but we everything else we just you know everything's automated so dcam dmark all of all the records are all get set up there's not one step that we don't have to that we can't just click a button and do all through our really we're using google sheets really for api and and air table right so works pretty well and um you know you could do a lot of it through all the all the different tools that are out there in the low code no code world no very interesting yeah that would be more like the advanced elite level um yeah if that's the beginner intermediate stages and you have like some campaigns running and maybe people like intermediate level would be sending like a thousand emails a day or something like that once they they just send a lot more than uh they can get into uh into more more of these it's just incredible what cold email can do for you from a prop from a feedback standpoint right if you're trying to find feedback from ads like what are you going to really look at right like they came to your website they jumped off the website like what are you what are you really getting out of that so when you're looking at cold email and and you know a lot of the gurus will tell you that oh you're going to go damage your brand by spamming and all this i mean i see i've seen everything now i mean every guru has an opinion on this but the reality is if you're if you're light enough and you're relevant enough on an email you're never going to ruin your future uh you'd be you'll probably ruin your future by not doing it is actually the real problem that you have right now and that's why mostly startups are failing yeah yeah i mean i've sent hundreds of thousands of emails under my name i've never had an issue like people tell me like three months ago people don't remember you know they oh come on people like people are too worried maybe they will but like if you're just like hey this is what i could do for your business is this relevant like i mean be real with the person you know like yeah you bring up an interesting keyword which i talk about a lot is kind of relevant relevancy yeah uh and it seems it could seem a little bit abstract to some people but how do you ensure relevancy because a lot of go a lot of it goes into it right it's targeting this copy a lot of different things how do you uh view relevancy for cold email so i'll give you a kind of a uh there's two two parts obviously there's a big debate on the personalization versus relevancy uh personalization is your hey you know i saw you were here what a cool company you know like whatever but people don't really care about that right they want to know that you're relevant for your product so when you target somebody uh one of the ways that we're doing it is let's say we're selling lead magic right we could just use that as an example one of the things we might look at is hey you know your bounce rate was up 40 42 insert that variable we got a certain group that we've seen that are a good fit uh your bounce rate went up 42 last month it's likely you could get most of those users back onto your website and in your funnel or well at least back into your sales process is this relevant to you would you like to do that right you know something like that where you're you're actually calling out a statistic and they're like wow that's really interesting this person did the research now you and i know you're not i mean you could go do the research but that would be also a waste of your time because you can automate it of course and you know one of the you know we'll pull from different sources like you know seo tools um uh like similar web things like that that that can pull it in and then you build that central sheet a google sheet and then when you put it through instantly or any of the tools that are out there you can just then upload that that information and then that's part of your now that needs that relevance it needs to be a one-to-one relevance that's that's kind of the key differentiation and it needs to be something that that user is feeling is relevant to them yeah okay yeah that's a good example um bounce rate is interesting uh maybe something similar that comes to mind is like reviews if they have some reviews somewhere hey like you've seen like you have some uh you have a lot of reviews you have you have good ratings you have bad ratings there like just something that's specific to them and somehow you you scrape the data and yeah the two that i think people could start on if they're not as thinking traffic or whatever the two easy ones really if you're doing anything really a lot of the times uh the two things people do is they they adopt technologies uh if they're growing or or even losing traction right uh they adopt technology so techno graphics are big right like the the built list of the world and things like that then the other one is um job boards right job job obviously hiring right things they put in their hiring is a very um is a very key stat so if you're if you see somebody hiring for a position chances are there's something going on there and that's that's a great relevant reason and you'll probably nail like if you're going to start somewhere i've actually got an air table out you can find it on my my page but it's uh it's called b2b alerts and i just put all the alerts that we find that are kind of signals and 10 signals that we use and those signals are incredibly valuable and the more accurate you are the more chance you're going to get a response which is the ultimate goal of cold email anyways yeah yeah timing is also an important variable like you said in in terms of relevancy for example i'm using one uh lead source right now and just monthly gives you the report of who got funding in the last month then you can like a simple icebreaker like hey congrats on i'm getting funding last month or um you know congrats on on launching your x company just that signal base that timely uh data makes makes a big difference and you don't have to go spend all day writing personalized lines uh but it's still about one thing too is just getting to the um just getting to the signal before other people so like a good one on the funding one is we'll go in we know uh average uh sas company or agents well sorry more more company with funding like technology company they're going to go for funding every 18 to 24 months so what you really want to do is yeah you can get them right after but there's a lot of people probably hitting them up then if you could get them three months before and say hey i'm sure you would like to prop up that pipeline for that next investment round and they might already be in that round so you do like an 18 minus how many months and you know if you can get there before you're already thinking about like if you're into what they're already thinking about already thinking it right you're going to be short on your investors they're not going to think you have enough pipeline let's get you up to that goal and let's get you to where you need to be so you can build that pipeline and get that really mega round from that that company okay gotcha very interesting you know i talk to a lot of people that do cold email and some of them sometimes uh say hey i'm struggling to come up with cold email copy or i also noticed that like putting out content one of the most popular content pieces actually called email templates uh which is like nobody wants to write their own copy uh it's just a creative process it can be like obviously a difficult process um what's kind of your process to come up with uh we talked about relevancy already but besides that what would you say like your co process to come up with like bangers for the for the cold or email copy like good sequences so first of all anything that's long that looks paragraphy you know like it's just ngmi right it's not going to make it on the off the launch there right so anything that you have to look at that you wouldn't read in a regular email like i i communicate like on text really like the way you do so on email i think you know maybe keep it between 30 to 50 words don't use any of the spam uh one of the frameworks i'm using we're using one where the subject titles for curiosity gap so we do that we're not trying to click bait and we're trying curiosity gap the first sentence we go right for the relevance every single time why we're reaching out like relevance to that person the second the second parent you know the second part of it uh and this can all be done in 30 to 50 words very easily the second part of it is going to be um the reward like how we've helped other companies like you achieve x exactly what they achieve though more not like as general as i just said it there but and then i think the last part is that cta and that cta is important too because you really want to make that very interest space now right you don't want to be uh out there putting out a um uh a cta that's like hey you want to join my calendar like not only does it increase complaints we found it actually can really uh convert really low right like people don't want to give you their time you feel you're kind of you're kind of being a little rude there so what you need to do is just try to get that conversation started they're going to ask for the time they're going to be like well how do i talk to you like whatever right that's what they're going to do if they're interested uh so that's what we're doing and you know we kind of use that rrr method that i just described you know we do the relevant information the the reward which is that storytelling part right of other people we've helped and then that request that cta is key that's how we put the assemble it and you know we keep it short okay nice yeah that's a good that's a good framework yeah um very helpful okay great and maybe just a couple of quickfire questions just to to wrap up the interview if you've dropped the value already and and uh yeah so first rapid fighter question uh what's your favorite subject line uh what was the question sir uh what's your favorite subject line uh what's your favorite subject line it's probably something around like how we helped x achieve y you know or how something like that right like it's really more that curiosity gap where we're like kind of doing that i'm not a huge fan of um i'm not a huge fan of putting their name or their company's name in it because i think people are kind of on to that now i don't think it's going to matter as much i think a lot of it is are you in the prime inbox placement is everything right now right we all know how hard it is to get there but i'd say it's probably like how somebody achieved why you know like how you help somebody get somewhere right like what that is and make sure it's a relevant use case for that person that you're actually emailing is is kind of what i recommend okay gotcha next question would be uh how long do you warm your warm up your emails uh three weeks yeah we do it for three weeks we found a little bit of a dip uh if we do it for two we find a little dip we go um in the second month we found that after two weeks i mean you probably have more data than i do on this one but uh or maybe you don't because it is kind of hard to collect sometimes just because of the way there's a lot of variables there but uh two weeks we find that it's a little too short uh we like to go we like to go three weeks and that third week is important because after two months without the third week we find that it can dip off uh a little bit obviously a lot of it depends on how many complaints you get or how many things you're you know like who you're emailing are they kind of going uh you know quote unquote karen on you and reporting you as spam or whatever like there's a few factors there but you know that's generally three weeks yep missouri there yeah i've seen like three weeks too we used to do like only two weeks rush it a little bit but i think seeing significantly better results with like great things come for people who wait for things that's what i've that's what i've learned in life exactly exactly um last question would be what's kind of what's one of your or what are your favorite lead sources right now uh you don't have to share your secret sauce you know but uh what kind of some of your because i know lead sources are really important but what do you like to share sometimes and uh that you found useful um all right i'll give mine out um um my best lead source right now i got too many we've got too many leads right now we gotta we gotta we're in the business um i'll tell you my best lead source right now my best lead source is my inbox spam folder with and not only mine i got a couple of buddies who are obviously running large sas companies you know chief revenue officers you know zero of bigger sas companies right and i have them pull up their inbox and they show me their spam folder and anybody who's an sdr who's in one of those folders i check the records and i go right to the founder every single time and it works i swear to you i mean it's one email kill shot right now on linkedin and i can get every one of them and i just read their email i just check the headers on it every single one of them is a hit and it's like 90 right now in terms of getting a meeting and getting on the like you know and they convert fast too because they're ready to fix the problem you already found the problem and they love it yeah yeah great idea let's go back to like i mean this is as relevant as you can get with that with the timing yeah talking about relevance i mean you're literally watching it right there i mean they and look you just go into your spam folder i mean there's some companies right now and this is really the sad thing they've got a they have 15 20 sdrs maybe some have more and they're literally just slamming all their emails right into the spam folder with other tools that they're spending 100x more on than instantly and some of the more multi-domain multi-inbox kind of load balancing type tools and it's really sad actually it's it's really sad and then there's layoffs happening here and i really feel bad a lot of these reps have been reaching out to me and trying to see like hey how do i fix it and i'm like i don't know it's gonna be hard you have to go through your security hours wasted you know it's like like just human life just being wasted really it's it's really bad i i you know i feel bad for these a lot of them are younger generation sales reps and i feel terrible for them they should start their own v-gen agencies is what really what a lot of them should be doing right now yeah there's big demand for it okay great yeah thanks jesse for uh you know thank you something something yeah it was super interesting um thank you and uh yeah where can people find you if they want to learn more about you about uh i know you have a twitter uh jesse ogtm and then uh i'm also on linkedin i got a lot of good uh content on there and i've got it all in my profile i do have a b2b lead gen community thing that i have where i'm putting a lot of my materials i've obviously discussed the problem with sales development and teams now uh and then i'm also re launching a um a course called the cold email operating system and what that's going to have in it really i just documented all the instructions that we do on instantly and and you know all of the like steps that we take all the dns records on cloudflare zoho gmail you know all of them that we've put in there and you know we have some in there most a lot of it is probably some of it is in your docs too but i mean also we just put it all together a couple videos on how we do it and that's really it and it's in there um i haven't really like officially launched it yet but it is in the community so i'd love to have anybody have any questions just reach out big supporter of what you guys are doing i'm glad we're all going to get back into the inbox and uh really enjoyed the conversation today thank you okay yeah great conversation and uh anything that you mentioned i'll also add it in the description so you guys can find it uh easily and uh yeah it was a great chat and uh talk soon thank you
