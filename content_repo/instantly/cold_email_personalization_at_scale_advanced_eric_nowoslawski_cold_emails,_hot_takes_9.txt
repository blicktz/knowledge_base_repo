okay great I'm really excited about this episode of cold emails hot takes today I have Eric Noveleski on the podcast how are you doing man hey thanks for having me yeah great yeah and so you and I we've been exchanging a lot of interesting ideas via Twitter DMs so I thought you know I had to have you on the podcast just for the viewers for the listeners so Eric is the leads growth at play.com you know he's really one of those underrated Twitter accounts that don't have a lot of followers but they really really know what they're talking about so maybe they're too busy sending cold emails then growing the Twitter audience so that's probably why but yeah he really knows his game when it comes to scaling cold email and especially when it comes to real-time signal-based data and that's going to be a big topic of this episode also like how to create that relevant and personal data at scale so yeah Eric just to you know I'm really excited about this but talking about something we uh talked about in our Twitter DMs uh just to start us off can you tell me more about the misspelling strategy the misspelling strategy oh yeah this is great um so so my kind of MO like everything that I try to do is how can I write an email that somebody looks at and they're like oh this isn't an automated email like somebody actually sent me this email and that's what I'm always trying to achieve and so with the misspelling strategy what we're we're using is kind of a pattern interruption to to make somebody be like oh wow okay like they actually sent me this email and so what we'll do is we will purposely and instantly actually makes this super easy to do um we will purposely uh misspell something inside of the copy never their first name always it like it never touched their first name but misspell something inside of the copy and we'll try to make it look like an autocorrect mistake so the example I use a lot is um you know how do you know your website is optimized for uh conversation and then once we have an email open trigger we'll use instantly to automatically send a new email like eight minutes after the email open trigger goes um as and it's all like your back end is already checking to see if they replied or anything by then and we all know open rates are kind of trash anyway which is for this strategy is still totally fine and so then um eight minutes after they open the email we'll send them an email that says asterisk conversion dot dot dot enter enter so sorry I didn't fix that before I sent it out um and we got great great results on that campaign uh which was literally just like a like a it was for a uh an influencer who all he does is um takes people's offers and then just revamps them and a lot of the ways he starts is just with their website and so um yeah and like people would like message back and they were definitely on their iPhones because we had to send from the iPhones get Outlook for iOS like and they would message right back after that email be like oh I don't know how it's like optimized for conversation or whatever it was that campaign we ran that I think we ran that like a year and a half ago so from what I remember I think that was like depending on what list we were sending to and how we sent it that was like an eight to 12 percent response rate campaign when we were when we were doing that all right yeah that's that's really smart man I might have to uh test that one myself with our internal campaigns yeah I definitely would go for it um because it's like and then it's like because who who automates that right like nobody is just like automating that and it like I said instantly is like one of the only tools that you can do that super super simply like on that right side inside of the the like the email campaign builder right yeah so also a big topic of today's podcast like I said what is going to be relevant data and and you mentioned it it's something you really know a lot about what is relevant data how do you obtain it for your cold outreach campaigns yeah so great great question so and this is what I talk about with people all the time so you look at like a regular database right we're talking about zoom info seamless Apollo lead IQ lead graph all of these different databases they will give you firmographic information based off of how many employees the company has the industry that they think that the company has is or they just pulled it from their LinkedIn profile which is great they're going to give you the owners uh first and last name and then the email address and their LinkedIn profile and then after that like everything else is pretty extraneous they all basically give you the same information right and so all like every buyer is used to like being reached out to on like an industry level basis and they're used to being reached out to on an employee level basis so sometimes people come to me and they'll be like oh I want to email every chief marketing officer of companies with 50 to 100 employees that's my ideal customer profile and I kind of talk to them about how like that is like your high level ideal customer profile but that's not your golden ideal customer profile and so obviously for people who are listening to this you might not know what that means like there are 700 million people on LinkedIn and there's like this gigantic circle of all those people and then your ideal customer profile is like a subset of those people and then your golden ideal customer profile is what I talk about all the time and so a great example is like one campaign that we're running right now there's a CSV import tool that's a per it's a turnkey CSV import tool um and they reach out to product managers and it's like okay great so we could just reach out to product managers at companies with 10 to 10,000 employees and just have a heyday or we could first make sure that they even have CSV import on their website and reach out to them and see if it's something they'd want to take off their their engineering team's uh time so we use a tool called clay.com which I work for that company so full disclosure I work for this company we use a tool called clay.com and we can score we have a list of 28,000 SAS companies we could score every single one with one integration pushing one button we could score all of them to see who mentioned CSV import on their website and then get that link and then in the email campaign even say hey you know I was on your website and on this page it mentioned CSV import and then we send it to them um and so far the responses like people will even come back and they'll be like was this email like programmatically done because this was genius I don't need your product but this was really cool right and so um when I'm talking about relevance there's that that is a perfect type of relevance where it's just like a firmographic relevance like this company just generally all the time this is a perfect time to reach out to them and you can send this relevant message to these companies so then so you have kind of like the account based relevance but then there's also trigger relevance and so what I mean by trigger relevance is like uh you know the easiest one that everybody goes after is like funding rounds and like I actually don't even do like we'll use funding rounds as like a like a filter but we never mentioned them because like everybody else is mentioning them um funding rounds is a good one uh chief executive like a some kind of CXO new hire is another great uh trigger did they just install you know a certain software on their website in the last month like these are all trigger based things that will monitor and then once they enter that that trigger then we'll you know hit them with the email and then like through clay we'll set up all these monitoring things and everything and once somebody enters that window start hitting them or it's just sales navigator to be honest too so two kinds of relevance like ideal perfect perfect golden ideal customer profile that you're searching for on the marketplace that so you're not just spamming every chief marketing officer and then the trigger based of like okay so this thing happens that makes them qualified what is it what you know how can we find it and then let's go you know message towards those people yeah really interesting man so you mentioned right with this funding rounds it's something that already people think about and uh I feel a lot of people are thinking but the way you you're thinking it seems it's okay like going that extra mile thinking okay what are what's something similar signal based but that other people are doing it like for example okay someone recently got promoted to a cxo position and then hitting them at the right time the timing is really important as well when it comes 100 like I was just talking to a graphic designer and she was like how should I get jobs I'm like well you should probably just go to every company that raised money who's hiring a graphic designer and just email them like this like the and just just say like hey I noticed that you're hiring a graphic designer you could get this data um Jordan Crawford blueprintgtm.com he is building this database himself um Apollo kind of has it inside as well and then you could use apify apify I don't know what they call it apify.com they have an indeed scraper go create like job job board postings are phenomenal triggers okay great yeah the indeed scraper sounds interesting where can you find that type of data inside of uh Apollo oh so Apollo the filter is like all the way to the left it says job postings on the bottom the only problem with that is like you have no clue when they posted the job like you just know that like they are hiring for this position that's why I'll use um Jordan Crawford's data at blueprintgtm or um use the indeed scraper to just see like all right they who is on indeed hiring for uh sales development managers right now okay great yeah and now trader dms we were chatting about you know a couple of things one of them was you sent me an example of um an interesting niche which was off-market deals for private equity companies you know it's company that you were running and the level of personalization and relevancy was was insane do you remember which example I'm talking about and can you tell you more about that campaign it was super interesting so and then we actually just switched to an e-commerce one that like we still use that kind of personalization I'm trying to see I'm even trying to pull up that message here uh I guess it doesn't necessarily matter let me see if I can uh find it putting you a little bit on the spot with the specific example but maybe oh okay this is what weird no no I found it I found it yeah no so these private equity for companies they love local service companies you're looking you're talking about like uh a margin of like 50 to 60 percent not a whole lot of competition install a little bit of technology into the the company run a couple Facebook ads and you could like 3x the business very very simply so what we were doing is um looking for like pest control companies like it's like really really niche and these guys are on LinkedIn they like got far enough that they know that they need to be on LinkedIn um and we were messaging to them so like hey first name saw you've been running company name for you know whatever amount of years so the way we were doing that was um finding the owner of the company uh and scraping sales navigator for that taking that list bringing it into clay using their uh LinkedIn um their LinkedIn integration and then enriching for the person's profile and then the company profile so we can have the founded year of the company just like straight in our spreadsheet so that we could say like you know so you've been at this company since you know or you've been running this company since 2012 right so we have a great first line uh that definitely is in the preview text when they open it up on their phone uh digging a little deeper I saw you had whatever Google review count reviews on Google averaging a Google review score and then I saw your Yelp review score as well always such a tough crowd over there the reason I reached out is because I'm curious if you'd be open to selling a business let me know if it's something you're considering um and so that all those things we did in clay as well they have a Google uh review integration that if you could find the person's business which if you have their domain you'll find their Google my business account and we'll take the the total amount of reviews that they've had and then their average Google review and then put it into the campaign then um take their company name scrape Google to find their Yelp page which then um their the Yelp scraper inside of clay will also give us their review score um I was thinking about making like different lines for everybody but it turned out like everybody gets a different um uh everybody has a higher Google review than they have a Yelp review so we just put in a line like there's such a tough crowd over there like everybody hates Yelp um you know so reason I reached out is I'm curious you'd be open you're selling your business you know let me know if it's just something you'd be considering super super short message like literally the personalization and the relevance is like 60 of the message there and then our ask is super straight and to the point and um uh yeah and then we were just able to take these companies then they just like move them on to the private equity firms as leads of like because there's a huge problem with these private equity companies right now is they have cash to deploy to buy these companies private equity has created more billionaires than real estate ever has everyone is like talking about like real estate has created more millionaires yeah but like private equity has created billionaires and so they have cash to deploy they have no clue where to find these companies and so we found a really good niche in doing that and then we also found a private equity firm that wants to buy e-commerce stores basically the same thing except the personalization we added was um we added like the exact date that they started working on the company like from their linkedin profile using clay because their integration will give you like you started working at this company august 2018. we added that in um and then we created a line at the end of like you know ps i noticed on your linkedin profile you live in this area have you ever you know been to this restaurant we've heard really good things about it um and we literally ran those campaigns side by side of just like hey would you sell your company and then the one with all the personalization and we had a 5x increase in responses uh when we use that personalization man great stuff great stuff i love it uh especially people when they hear personalization they just think about you know an icebreaker personalized first line or whatever it may be but that's not really scalable right it's a little bit tedious but if you're using all these custom variables and these additional data points you just insert them as custom variables you have them there it's already highly personalized but still scalable and like not really a lot of manual work involved and uh yeah man that's great people yeah really like think about that more like using more custom variables if they have yeah oh 100 because then like because like i said in the beginning like we're trying to get over the barrier of them saying all right this is an automated email right and so um vaybav nimbiri built smart writer and that is probably the best ai tool i've ever seen for writing first lines because he like a lot of the first line tools all they're doing is exactly what i did is just extracting a little tidbit about somebody's linkedin profile and then throwing that into the same line over and over and over again and so like smart writer actually i feel like uses way more ai and like actually will write different lines for people and things like that but the problem is is sometimes these lines like they end up like a little wonky no matter what like um the the cheaper ones will say things like oh i saw you went to this college like did you know john elton went to that college too like you know and it's like yeah i can't like how do you sell something after that that's like really tough so um use it when we use clay we're just pulling out the inserts that we need and it's still super super relevant like i i would be hard pressed to have anybody tell me that like that's a bad line like that you know reaching out to them and saying like the date that they started working at the company or they're actually the date you'll get is the day they started that title so you always want to include the title with it but like freaking great line we'll get great open rates until we turn off open rates because we'll just turn them off after we run it for like a week but um but yeah adding in more custom variables i i you know we we see huge increases but they have to be relevant like you can't just be doing like just like the cheapest ai software you found on the market and then throwing those in you got to keep it really really relevant what's your so besides the custom variables strategy into relevancy what's kind of your process to come up with compelling copy for your cold email campaigns right you mentioned kind of you know all of this like how do you come up with that stuff yeah so a lot of it comes from the customer like the customer has to be the one to say like all right here's my perfect customer because and i have that conversation with them too i'm like look like don't think of me as like your cold email nerd like think of me as your data nerd like you tell me where your customers are and i will go find that like so wherever you point me is like we we have to be very clear that like that's what exactly we're going after and then it was funny as when it comes to copy like i was just watching cold email hot takes last night with nick abraham on the episode and like right in the middle of the episode you asked that as well and he was like you know like i really don't spend that much time on the copy like as long as you're getting an email delivered and you you have a relevant message to these people like the the copy kind of doesn't matter and so obviously the copy matters but like i don't think you need like a like the the best like to spend like four hours and like multiple drafts and everything like our copy basically writes itself because there's so much data right like the first line is always going to be the same second line is usually something to do with the relevance of the company so like you know hey i figured so that that line we use like hey nils notice that you've been the founder of instantly since you know whatever um so i figured you would be the perfect person to reach out to next line you know i noticed instantly has a free trial on their website you know so i figured you know you might be a fit for this product whatever and then just get straight into the ask thanks for your time boom like under 75 words boom boom boom boom boom um you know don't spend a whole lot of time on the copywriting that's you know kind of our fault and like i said the data basically writes the email itself you know it's not it's not that crazy yeah yeah good stuff can't overthink it with the cold email copy either right it's just have the the relevancy you have the the reward or like the value prop and then you have the request which is the call to action and that's pretty much it if you can like sprinkle in some custom variables to make it even more relevant then then you're good to go yeah how about uh follow-ups uh so you sent the first um email what kind of follow-ups do you like to have on step two or three or do you even do a lot of follow-ups yeah so this is this is even my favorite so we won't go over like four follow-ups like unless we have a client who and we try to talk to them about this like having like a super super long time horizon and like a really nice brand building email sequence um but most people are like direct response like i just need meetings today like let's just go um i've set up campaigns that are like 12 emails long and it's like over the course of like six months that we're we're sending it um but that's like you know a brand building thing as as opposed to a direct response thing so um for follow-ups i think the biggest people the biggest mistake people make in their follow-ups is um that one i i think the you know thoughts or like bumping this up just making sure you saw my email like i think those are basically done like unless you're outside of a market that the people get emails all the time in like we were talking about that gutter cleaning niche just before um i i don't find that's working with people anymore i think it's kind of like a lazy thing what i like to do is try to create serendipity in the follow-ups and make it seem like um i'm telling like an overarching story through all of the threads so like then the next follow-up that we send is a lot of times uh there's this pro there's this thing on linkedin called people also viewed and so if you go to somebody's page it says people also viewed and then it'll put in you know your your your thing um and so if i were to say like hey we have a mutual connection you're probably not going to know that person but the people also viewed linkedin is using some kind of algorithm to find like who do you dm the most who do you comment on their posts who do you like their posts most often and then that person will show up so we'll actually scrape that person and we'll say you know uh nils i was just on rayo's uh profile on linkedin and the algorithm pushed me back to yours so i figured i would follow up and then we have some kind of follow-up thing there so that there's at least serendipity with like wow they were actually doing research and like that's your co-founder like you know and so you know that person i was just on their profile and i'd figure i'd follow up and then we add in like you know maybe a case study or something there and then the third email i'll say something like you know to add more context or digging deeper here like maybe i didn't explain myself correctly and then we like to go into the case study a little bit more fourth email we just shift the total angle of the offer like oh hey you know like if this isn't a problem for you like maybe this is a problem just because like if they're not going to respond to that angle they're probably just not going to respond then i hate breakup emails um like the email we're like hey you haven't responded to me so i'm going to stop emailing you now like it just makes no sense to me but we'll pull in the total company headcount from their linkedin company page and we'll pull that into the sequence and then we'll say um you know hey nails there's eight people at instantly i can understand things get or like it to my understanding there's eight people at instantly i know things get incredibly busy is there possibly somebody else in the company i should be speaking with um and we'll kind of just like end all of our sequence with that okay great awesome man eric you gave me so much so many ideas to test like for yeah go for it yeah campaigns and uh all that so thanks for sharing all this value i know you have a hard stop so maybe you know as a final questions uh final question to wrap it up here i'm always curious to see you know where do you think cold email is going to be in the next six eight twelve months you know if you have to oh yeah about what will work in the future that maybe it's not on people's radar yet like what would you say yeah so one the big thing i think about all the time is the spam filters like they are getting better and better and better at like or well they're getting harder to beat one two like the email service providers are catching on to what we're doing right like i i have to think they they see iwe in all these subject lines and they're like all right like this is a warm-up service like they i have to have a feeling that they know it's going on on the back end right and so like my the biggest thing that i'm worried about in the next six eight 12 months is like how is the technology landscape going to shift and how are we going to be able to react to that um if it's spam filters then that's fine like we all know what to do like just more domains more inboxes instead of sending 35 to 50 emails a day let's all send 20. like we all know how to get around that my biggest worry is like google outlook or zoho being like hey you know this subject line always has iwe in it it's done like we're not we're not going to send this anymore or like we're not going to allow it anymore um that's probably my biggest fear right now is just like how is spam going to to change in the next six to eight months i think like there's things like more things change more things stay the same right so like you know the more things that change about cold email like the more that you have to have your offer perfect the more you have to have relevant messaging the more you have to have a good list like like all those things are always going to be around it's just the technology landscape that scares me okay i got it now especially with the warm-up and warm-up pool um you have to keep innovating there like always staying ahead of the curve like making adjustments like even small little tweaks on how the warm-up uh emails are structured um always have to be on top of these things and we also continue with instantly but i can't continuously making changes in the warm-up um yeah but yeah it's like a cat and mouse game sometimes oh yeah for sure we should all get shirts made that say like uh google hates us because i think like all of us we just feel like we're just at war with google all day exactly yeah i mean it's essentially with any traffic source right you always have to be ahead of the curve and know what what's working right now you can't really rely on i mean some like you said some stuff stays the same but some strategies to work six months ago stop working so you have to uh you know be quick quick on your feet um yeah but yeah eric this was a great episode and so much actionable advice so many ideas um to go out and test and also for people for viewers and uh it was great to have you on uh thanks for being on thanks for the time and uh where can people find you if they want to learn more about you about what you do and uh i'll put it in the description of the video also yeah so you could just email me at eric.noaslowski n-o-w-o-s-l-a-w-s-k-i at clay.run or you can um find me on linkedin just again eric noaslowski and there's no other eric noaslowski so you'll find me there okay great yeah i'll put it in the um in the description too also your twitter like go follow him go follow him on twitter one of the most underrated twitter accounts in the cold email space and uh yeah thanks again and i'll talk to you soon man yep talk soon bye bye
