hey guys Raoul here and i just noticed something with instantly that i thought i'll record a quick video to show you guys and maybe we'll help you get more responses before we get started like subscribe you know the deal and i can keep creating more this content so the main gist of it is people are different companies are different but there are like some filters that we mostly use when we get leads that are that we can fool people and like stereotypes actually are true and we're going to be focusing on the employee sizes today so we're going to take a look the differences in contacting small companies one to ten employees the medium companies 10 to 50 employees and large 50 plus employees and it's actually very different and with instant now we started completely just the founders just like the core team super small and now we've grown into pretty large team especially with the customer support and i'm getting a much clearer picture of contacting these people and the mindset that they have and what you should be doing so let's get into it so first the small companies these are businesses starting up maybe they don't even want to be very large they want to keep it simple and these are the easiest companies to get replies from so the goal obviously isn't to get replies it's to make money but if we're starting out i know there's like a lot of talk about targeting established companies but it's going to be harder than going after these small companies there are a couple of reasons first you can be more universal small companies they don't have the entire marketing stack sold they don't have let's say if they don't have a facebook marketing agency yet you can come in you can do it if they're not doing cold email you can offer that if they're not doing seo you can offer that you can be much more upfront just like tell them what they need they they are not that busy at the moment so you can even try calls and using the call cta in your emails like can you jump on a call because these people are more likely to do it they have more time they're more open and if you take a look at their like business as a whole there are a bunch of holes that have not been filled yet otherwise they would be bigger and this is obviously there are like examples that is the opposite but most companies there are so many different things they're not doing and you can help them grow so if you're using these filters on apollo ocean whatever lead tool you're using if you're targeting smaller companies these are this is the easiest way to start you can be very universal you can offer the main offers that you have you don't have to go very granular and you have much higher chance of getting response because they're not getting that many emails now if you get into the bigger companies comes that are making money the medium companies 10 to 50 employees you have to be more specific so this is where instantly is right now in the beginning you could hit me up like hey raul do you want the short form content creator you weren't doing it like sure show me what you got but now i already have that we have an seo person we have a email person we have a designer we have developers we have customer support so most of the big holes have been filled already and it's going to be very hard for you to come in and make me i pretty much like have to fire somebody or like that i don't want to do it if it's like working for me the only option is going to be if i don't like like their work or we're already in a position of looking for somebody else so you have to understand the business is much more in detail so there are some stuff that are evergreen this is like lead generation if somebody would come to me like hey raul i can get you 50 more clients a month it's like uncapped for us like if you can get us more by doing your own stuff you don't have to like we don't have to fire somebody we don't have to switch it up like i'm down show me like how you do it so this evergreen stuff and more specific problems that these companies are working on so it's it can't be just like let let us help you do seo let us help you do facebook ads let's help you do copywriting most of these companies already have that so you have to have something unique something more specific in that niche and already here you should start leaning away from calls up front uh like founders are going to be super busy at this point like already for me like if somebody wants to jump on a call i'm like uh like do i really want to do it i will only do it if i really see the value so if you have a super valuable stuff you can try it but i would try sending more info sending loom videos and having them not do as much work you can also start preparing materials at this point these are established companies so if you reach out just with a text versus like hey raul i created a awesome youtube video for you check it out can i be your editor so if you prepare you're going to stand up from all the people they're targeting these companies that aren't doing that and then also what i recommend is building rapport you can invite people to webinars you can do research email just like reaching out like hey we're conducting research in your niche mind give us some questions these kind of things are just to build the conversation start up the relationship and then maybe later you can pitch it or help them if it makes sense so you can do all of these things already in the first portion but in the medium company range it becomes more of a like a must do you have to stand out you have to put in more effort otherwise you're not going to get as many responses and then the next level large companies so if it's 50 plus already like these dudes are busy their life is hectic they have so many departments they're working on 10 different things a day they're putting out so many fires you have to be very specific very concrete straight to the point you have to make them understand you understand their business like if you said like vague stuff like i can help you do seo it's never going to work for these large companies you have to be you have to make them know you understand the business you have to be in tune with the trends you have to just make come across as a real expert these dudes hate time wasters they hate fluff straight to the point very specific it has to be a very low effort from their side again like if you try calls here it's going to be very hard to get these people on the call up front i would again soft cta mind if i send more info mind if i record loom video that sort of stuff works much better here again preparing materials helps here if you reach out and say like hey i prepared uh email flow for you that can reduce reduce your turn like we did for x mind if i send it over this will work much better if they're dealing with churn problems it's a burning problem in their mind they're like okay send it over like i would respond to that and same stuff with medium companies you might want to start building rapport first so it means more effort the sales cycle with cold email gets longer but it's much easier for a ceo of a large company to say yes to jump in a webinar which helps them get more views more people or doing research like just answering few questions and then you build report and take it from there so keep that in mind the next time you're doing the filters and you're targeting these companies they're very different so main stuff is that for larger companies you have to be more specific you have to understand them maybe don't invite them on call straight away send info make it super easy for them if you're starting out and you want the easiest way to get responses start with some more companies they're going to be harder clients unfortunately because they haven't fully built out their sales process it's going to be harder a little bit to work for them it's going to be more work but it's easier to get responses get your foot through the door get some initial case studies get some experience and then you can move to the larger companies where it's going to be easier to work with them because they have a structure but it's going to be harder to get your foot through the door so i hope it makes sense if you have any questions put them down below like subscribe see you on the next one cheers
