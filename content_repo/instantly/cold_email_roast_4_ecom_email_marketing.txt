what's up boys raul here with another copy roast for cold email if you're struggling to make your copies work get your responses this it is for you i'm gonna rip apart some of your copies see what i can do to improve and yeah that's pretty much it i'm having a bad hair day today so i'm hoarded up but the copy is going to be great so first one hey carlos love reading your interview with abound where you shared that your business is basically a representation of who you are as peru artisans and that your first product came from your father's idea to create a collection of holiday ornaments on gourds what the hell is that it is inspiring to see how you're carrying your family culture into the business world awesome work i reached out because i'm offering free paid advertising audits for econ brands for which i see potential we just helped another brand go from 30k to 160k in 84 days let me know if you're interested in the free audit so first off you already know if you've checked some of my other videos we're going to go to the read time paste it here and check the silent region so 26 seconds not too bad but i would say still too long like i already got tired of winded reading the first part and it's uh it's crazy like usually the more personalized email is the better it is but here i think you went like too personalized it was like too much presentation like most of the email or this is like 50 is about your personalization about their podcast so i think this is like too much you don't need that much and also if you're doing that much like you're putting a lot of time into it which might not be worth it if you're not getting responses right now and i assume you're not getting responses because otherwise you wouldn't have submitted this copy for roasting so yeah let's uh do what we always do keep shortening it so the first part like you can use the presentation just like cut it down hey love reading your interview about with abound about peruvian artisans and that your first prototype came from your father's idea to create a collection of holy ornaments on cords what is this i don't know so i'm gonna go down the rabbit hole but or flowering plant species family cook with you guys pretty okay this is some some next level stuff but uh yeah like if that person knows about the cords cords and like keep it up might resonate with them uh yeah short one sentence instead of this long one and then i reached out because of offering free paid advertising audits for econ brands for hsc potential so this we can improve we just helped another brand go from 30k to 60k in 84 days let me know if you're interested in free so again we can simplify it a lot just make it more concise more relevant simpler so let's say we want to keep this i i like to use loss subversion here uh instead of like how much you can offer but this one is a lot of money is a lot of money is a lot of money is a lot of money is a lot of money is a lot of money so by the way i noticed a couple of things that might be losing your store 20k to 50k then i'm like hmm like what is this like how how can i like lose that so let's add it here and then yeah mind if i send more info it's like one of my go-to ones right now like already this i feel is much better so let's put it here 13 seconds perfect and you can make it like even shorter hey love reading your interview with a bound yeah like even that like this one right already don't need more the dude will see that you actually read the information 8 seconds this is more like it hey carlos loved reading your interview with a bound about peruvian artisans by the way i noticed a couple of things that might be losing your store 20 to 50k monthly mind if i send more info like this feels like much better shorter same stuff and then i would play around with this so this is loss version you might be losing store another couple of things that might add 20k 30k to restore so then you can start like playing around with this shortening your this and yeah like it's like you're using the audit angle here which is great but i would just start like mind if i see more information and then like play around with this mind if i send a loom video then like figure out like what works just try different uh put like different pieces and then rotate between them to figure out what works until you find something that works but yeah otherwise like the offer is good like you help companies make more money they need it but the biggest thing here is i say i think it's a saturated offer so like e-commerce brands like they're receiving this so much there are so many e-commerce agencies uh email agencies so you might want to want to be more vague and this one like this way this is good that's why this is good because we're not mentioning email yet so they're not allergic at all another like email offer i'm only doing it so sometimes it it pays to be more vague more ambiguous all right i think this is pretty good try this one and then next one also you come on hey i want to get straight to the point i want to reach out because we help clothing retailers based in increase their email revenue conversion rate and then during those knowing one-time customers into two three and ten x recently this for vintage threads nearly toppling their email prior to working with us image i wanted to ask your permission if it's okay for me to send a free audit going over what we can do for you to improve improve your current email strategy so again first thing let's copy here for sex so i want to shorten it again to 10 15 seconds so first thing again like it just needs to be more concise like you're going over a lot of stuff but like this one already i want to get straight to the point but instead of getting straight to the point you're right i want to get straight to the point like this is how you get straight to the point hey i want to reach out because we help clothing retailers based in country we see lemon right again because it's like very similar niche same things apply uh it's good but as soon as you start talking about like increasing email revenue conversion rate you're doing something that these emails or ecom stores have been receiving for years and then you're like roasting their clients annoying one-time customers it might actually work like it might resonate but i would just this part i would keep it simpler so a really good like universal presentation for ecom stores is your latest collectionistic i really love your latest collection especially if it's clothing stores like they always have new collections so you can use it like it's it's a really good one say more i love your product pics your product pics look look amazing who is your photographer like this kind of stuff you can try and use uh but yeah you can also use the country basis this is like that has worked best for us and then by the way i'll notice something that might be losing you half your revenue from email or maybe even just like half your revenue so we don't mention email just doubled rev for vintage red like this might if i send a 30 second look showing how so again pretty much same stuff but just take away all the stuff we get straight to the point and let's see how how long it takes for the average person let's read this nine seconds so again much shorter like already like if you just like look on it like visually like this one will take some effort this is like so short that it's like it's an effort level more people are going to read it and you're going to get more responses thanks to that and then yeah i would try different presentations for you just try the country one try the collection one try some actual person's first lines and then this one again because it's an email offer be more vague uh try to use some different angles uh the audit things maybe you can do even like mind if i send you mind if i send over two things you can things specific angles like stop mentioning audits i think that angle has that ship has sailed as well because so many people are like offering audits and audits is also like seems like oh like what is this another audit like do i have to like waste 30 minutes or like an hour on a call to have to like send over some stuff like i would avoid it at the moment and just like do more work for them like just do it like send them over like make them show them you already have something you already noticed something and if you say like yes then go through their store sign up to their email see what they're doing try to buy something add something to cart and then find something that will help them and once they see you can actually offer value then you can go and offer the auditor like ask to jump on a call and then go after like more ask more of a time investment from them i wouldn't do it straight up from the first email and also the success image so i wouldn't send images in the first ones it's a little bit spammy maybe the second one or you can ask like hey i want to show you an image of what we did for vintage threads i want to show you a growth chart of what we did for vintage threads mind if i send that image over and then you send it so yeah remove the image remove a bunch of the stuff be more vague it's counterintuitive try different presentations keep it short 10 15 seconds use the readtime.com it's free just copy paste i use it for like all of my campaigns at the moment and yeah use like super simple super simple call text like mind if send over information mind if send over loom mind if i send over a pdf mind if i send over an image and that's pretty much it so try this out try to win variations and i think you're gonna get more responses and if you have your own copies you want me to roast i'm going to link the type from down below you can send over your copies if you got any insights out of this i would appreciate if you like and subscribe to our channel so i can keep creating more of this content cheers guys see ya
