you set up your lead engine you're getting leads in you responded to them and then you get them on the call so here's what you do always have the camera on we're starting to call always speak couple minutes early for the call like i hate that if somebody's pitching something to me and i have to wait for them it's a straight up red flag like don't do it be couple minutes early always be in a clean space with not many distractions like if possible don't be in a kitchen you have the spice racks behind you a lot of noise like don't do that be presentable clean nice doesn't have to be too fancy just like clean then have a notebook and pen ready this was one of the biggest things that i wouldn't believe would help me when the sales calls added my small notebook and then actually like physical notebook and a pen i was writing down things it helps me to remember stuff i can later put the notes up i'm not on my computer on the sales call i can just like focus on them and then takes notes it helped me so much i recommend it it's actually a cool little book that's gonna fill up with a lot of cool people cool stories i recommend it worked for me really well uh what helps as well in the beginning if you haven't done a lot of sales you're going to be a bit scared you don't know what's going to work so do as much preparation as needed before the call look over the website if you answer the questions in the calendar link look everything over know approximately what you're going to talk about know the questions you're going to ask go through the qualification questions your script everything in detail so you know what you're talking about check out their linkedin just like look at their pictures you know them it's just not a regular person as you you don't have to be scared just do some preparation for yourself have some pointers that you want to cover and it's going to make your life a little bit easier and then record the call whenever possible in zoom you can just record it you can ask the prospects if you're okay recording it so you can share with them later or if they have co-founders you can share with them and make a google drive folder with all of your demos you can learn from them looking back like an nba player watching film and you can also share with your future sales team for them to see how it's done you you as the founder in the beginning are going to be the best salesman you know your product the best you know how everything works and that's why you can close the best in the beginning but then once you start building a team they haven't been in your business as long as you but if you give them the recordings of your demos they can pretty quickly understand okay this is how this guy does it i can like take these sentences i know how to structure the call so start with that and just record whenever possible and for me it really helped to look at other people's demos as well everybody has a unique style of closing so in the sales company we share demos with our sales reps and you can do the same if you have a partner if multiple people are doing sales demos just like share them between each other and then just like comment on each other see what you can improve see what you can do better and then when we start getting into the qualification discovery part next i'm going to walk you through exactly how to structure that
