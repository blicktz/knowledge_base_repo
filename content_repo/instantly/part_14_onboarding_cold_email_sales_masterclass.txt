And let's talk a little bit about onboarding. It goes a little bit beyond sales, but you can also use these documents on the sales calls to give them the vision of exactly what's going to happen. So two parts, the onboarding deck and onboarding form.

So deck, super simple. So if you say yes, welcome board, here's what's going to happen. So your tasks, day one, onboarding call, give the best insights, ask a lot of questions, and day two, start preparing for responding to leads.

Day 14, we launch campaigns. Again, your only job is to respond to those leads and ongoing campaign running, responding to leads. So whatever your offer, ask from a prospect, it might be like nothing.

If you're, let's say you offer short form media creation, your task is nothing. Just create good content. We take clips of those and we post them.

If you're offering Facebook ads, SEO, just like confirm with us every month, the creatives or the articles, that's all you have to do. The main part is make them understand exactly what to do and make it as simple as possible for them. And then our tasks, so this is what we're going to be doing.

On onboarding call, we're going to give you the overview. We're going to confirm target groups, confirm value prop, Q and A. And then from day two, we do the campaign setup, buy a self domain, set up email accounts, start warming them up.

We find them valid leads, write the email sequences. We create the instant layout, give you access to inbox and talks to show them everything you're doing, the actual work that goes into this. It's not magic.

We get results by actually doing the work. Day 14, campaign launch, emails are warmed up. We can create campaigns to scale based on what we learned about what works.

And then ongoing, just optimizing daily campaign checkups, adding leads, improving copy, email health check, sales process audit. That's it. You're ready to start.
