Hey guys, Raoul here back again with a second episode with Roy helping him build a 10k agency. So last episode was quite brief just to get the background information. Today the work actually starts.

So Roy, are you ready? Yep, ready to go. Perfect.

So let me share my screen and show you what we're going to be working on. So one of the most important things that we do is consistency and it's something that like a lot of people like don't like doing and I hated this a little bit when I was a sales rep but we need to be tracking our work daily especially in the beginning like if you have a specific goal so we see like what's happening which days are working. So I'm going to share this sheet with you and for everybody watching I'm gonna just add it to description so we're gonna get access so you can share this with you and then just daily we're going through this start filling this up and it's like very simple right now just so July the day is fifth how many emails you sent today how many positive replies so it's better to do like we sent today and then tomorrow morning you fill in today's numbers for positive replies then we calculate the positive reply number how many demos you scheduled how many demos showed up show up rate demos closed then you get the close rate and then revenue sold and cash collected so these two are different because sometimes you can sell like a 10k plan but you only collect 5k so you got it here but this is better just if you can sell like full full offer like straight up so that's easy does this make sense and any questions about this nope it's still pretty simple yeah I'm also going to add comments so here I think just like overall just remember and like you remind like what you're doing so let's say here July 5th right um first campaigns with roll and then remember okay we tried we tried x and x remember and then I can see okay like this this day actually worked really well we did this and just getting it happy to this and then let's do so every day that we have a call with you let's go through this first check it out so always come prepared on the call with this and it's going to make it much much simpler so the second part that we discussed uh last time briefly let's do and do docs new google docs here so how does google docs have error okay so we're gonna be doing it on a fly google docs is not allowing us but this is another good example no excuses we didn't get the word to google just new spreadsheet so what i'm gonna do is calendar events like we discussed yesterday so we want to add let's say 30 minute slots you wanna when you wake up first thing you do in day you wanna fill in tracking sheet so let's say like again 10 minutes maybe five minutes just like a small kind of feeling tracking sheet then what do you think like how do you like to work are you more like uh creative work in the beginning or do you want to get like the harder and difficult things off your mind straight away i usually do the harder and more difficult things yeah so let's do uh inbox zero it's like most people should be doing this like already by themselves but just like again like put like 10 minutes just to 15 minutes that's your inbox zero you check your inbox every morning when you jump on a call with me your inbox should be empty you have replied to all the people nobody's hanging there already so it's inbox zero we have a clear mind clear vision everything done okay so next up we're gonna do copywriting and it's gonna do 30 minutes then we're gonna do and for the copywriting i'm gonna show you like exactly what we're gonna do a copywriting then setting up campaigns to 15 minutes finding leads and prospecting 15 minutes maybe like this one before even here so the project thing because we want to find those leads and then we okay we're gonna copyright to these leads then we set up campaigns for those leads and then let's put this 30 minutes we can change the times later then what you want to do is study uh so we need some accelerator we have like so many materials you want to take again like 30 minutes an hour every day while you're going through this like searching something new so your brain is always like used to finding new angles going through the stuff and i'm going to add in let's see 60 minutes so you can like if you have a sales book like a sales course you mentioned like you want to get those like courses but i would recommend just like starting with the accelerator and all the stuff but you have like a block where you're starting you come up with new angles then because you don't have a partner usually what we would do is uh like a call stand up calls with teams but what i would do is then add a lunch block 60 minutes and then add a block from i can show my calendar later but pretty much like what i have is so i have my morning tasks then it's empty a couple of hours for like calls there's like lunch and there's empty a few hours and then from the evening to morning my calendar is like blocked like i just add a block which is like an event and nobody can book in something there like if i need it i can change it whatever but this way i know okay like i have this like slot of hours that i'm focusing on like doing demos like just like four or five hours just like demos like these where people can book in demos and do the calls but i've done all the hard work already there's just like life calls with clients finding clients clients then let's do in the beginning what you would need to do is twitter outreach so while you're waiting for your emails to warm up we can do twitter outreach just reaching out to people this is like how we started let's also 30 minutes of twitter outreach and then link in outreach 30 minutes this like seems a lot but actually it's like it's like one hour three so four hours it's like half a work day in the beginning and as you start getting more responsive demos then we're going to take away some of the stuff here and you're going to focus more on demos but in the beginning we need to get the whole rolling get the engine going and just get as many opportunities as we can as we do a bit more stuff there in block uh from evening to morning okay so i'm gonna share this with you and then for our next call set this up in your call calendar and this is gonna be uh work day yeah everything is gonna be work day just every work day these ones and block is like every day yeah perfect so yeah let's for the next call tomorrow let's have everything in your calendar and then it's just like sticking to it and getting into the rhythm so yeah tracking sheet inbox zero finding these approximately so let's start with this so now let's actually start um creating some like good campaigns for you going through your like offer editing it uh so i have your instant account in here let's close this one i do already have like uh some campaigns right now it's like their post but which campaigns do you think were good you want to start from zero do or do you have like something that you want to work on yes so the the one that was performing pretty well was that one the partner software the software one and um the new one that i was i ran for i ran for a little bit yesterday was the software development lead gen but though yet the software development legion has the new copies that i wanted to run by you okay so we can go through both of them let's start with this one um so uh who are you targeting here what's the like prospecting filters so it's uh software development companies they're doing between 500 000 1 million with one to 50 employees okay and let's see the offer hey uh by the way this wasn't the exact copy that i used i mean the exact offer that i used for for this the campaign that i ran this for if that makes sense yeah yeah uh do you have the like copy that you run um it was it was exactly the same as this copy it was just a different offer so the offer was um i could we're we've been helping successful ceos like you add 120 000 to to their revenue in four months using ai leverage code outreach skill okay gotcha but again how we do this for you just lose this nowhere okay so like all you know it's like pretty good let's take this let's see if uh it works now okay so let's do variant let's do it here so this one i'll start like uh nobody sorry but nobody cares about you uh it should be about like them this one it's okay okay okay so first thing that i would try and it's like hey i'm gonna see us like you triple the software company revenue for 12 months using a alert called outreach at scale so again like first things it's like a overall um like copy approach like we've been helping versus we help like much stronger it's like we've been helping it's super simple we help successful ceos like you triple the social company in 12 months so again i think this one is like this claim like triple the revenue it's like uh uh outlandish if you like have you like actually done this or like i've actually tripled so it's yeah so we have to be like realistic for these years like they're not like dumb it might work in like some cases but like a success ceo like you take these ones away um and again like let's say we're want to say like lead generation services like our offers lead generation so again like we don't want to make them feel like they have to do the job so what i want to say to them is like hey we have success with ceos like you uh get five to ten qualified meetings with your ideal prospects weekly using alr is called outreach at scale they're like ceos like don't want uh to do the sales course themselves so i would say well successful let's say like niche software companies like company name so if you have the company name i think this would be like a sequined easier or if you don't have a company name like yours like get faculty means which are the process weekly using alr is called outage at scale so this one is pretty good i'll put together i didn't talk about how it is for a company uh yeah i like this one guarantee it is one too yeah but the 2x i would like again put something more more realistic because we guarantee um 15 let's say 10 meetings no or your money back this is like good but i will try like both of these this is like one let's two let's copy this save add variant so again like uh if you go to the templates so we have like tons of lead generation offers so third one okay i was super impressed with company name tracker and want to reach out so we help again this is sauce like yours add rep by getting from 10 up to sales meetings i'd like to share a couple of these and try to steal and i would remove this mind mind if i share more info on how to do it i just might have to share more cheers right this one would be one and then i would like yeah just this is if we go to the calendar like copywriting this is what i would do daily at least like couple of these like angles just like try different ones you don't have to go like too crazy just a couple a couple of good ones and and then i'm going to show you one really good one let's do add variant i'm going to stop sharing my screen for a second i'm going to search for something and then show you what's the one that's going to do i'm taking one of our campaigns i don't want to show like the exact copy we're using because it's working like so well but i'm going to show like a variation of it that we can use okay i got the copy okay just curious is is um is writing copy for instantly like very different from just like lead generation services or is it pretty much similar it's pretty much similar it's like a different angle and it's something that um we can actually go through next um to craft like your offer uh in a really good way so you have a better idea like how to craft those emails but it's like very similar uh yes the only thing is like what is it easier is like it's so cheap okay i'm going to do a new campaign sequences and we'll copy the new copy in here change a little bit right let me share my screen sorry for the wait the promise is worth it okay so it's like super simple but what we want to do is create this kind of email of we're targeting let's say we're targeting in like this software companies like first name i had look at your website and i wrote out some people we could target for you and you work at company name and then you write out so if you're looking leads them we know the software companies they want to target ceos they want to target i don't know coaches so we write this out ceos ceos in la that 2x and other one let's say marketing managers at e-com stores making one meal plus so i'm going to leave this uh to you uh for the next time as well to figure out who exactly are there like ideal customers so if you already have two clients like who do these clients like want to target who are the ideal clients for these people i'm gonna write this down and then i'm gonna do let's say targeting three and then if you're thinking about targeting any of these we build lead operation and engines for like yours that that's what how to start all right so this is like definitely one a person to reduce the biggest difference with the previous one is we have something very specific for them this like presentation we show them we understand that we want to target we show them these are the clients we want to bring you And the next step that we can do is, let's see, I'm going to save this.

Step two, like your follow up. And in the follow up, I'm not going to write a copy. I'm going to let you like work on that.

But show like examples. We can reach out to people like, and then you can put like a name, like whatever. So let's find like actual people from the list.

And like, there's like an interest. So try this one. And then what I want you to do is, let's figure out now like two or three different angles of the company you want to target and then find the specific leads for them.

So I'm going to save this one. So we already have this campaign. Let's go to campaigns.

I'm going to change it. Name. Edit.

Targeting. Copy. We have this one.

So you know you have to like work on this one. And then now let's go. Okay, let's try again.

Talks new. No. Can't do it.

I have to do it instantly. Let's go for. Let's go through.

Offer that we can craft. Let me see if I can open this one. I did have one more angle that I wanted to run by you.

Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. In the.

It's in the lead gen one. So through that. This one.

Yes. Okay. And then it's the reduce.

This one. Yeah. Yeah.

Let me know what you say. Reduce time spent project. I think.

I think. Yeah. So again, like this is something that might work.

But I think to like. To knock it out of the park. Like just like.

Saving time. Isn't. As big of a priority as like making money.

Getting meetings. Like we help you get that money. I would like start that.

But definitely can try. Just like reduce. Time spent.

But I think this is like. Like CEOs. Don't usually do the prospecting.

Like we help. Your team. Save time.

Like that might be useful. Then again. That should be targeted to.

Marketing managers. Sales managers. So.

You want to match. The value prop. With the person that actually like uses that.

Right. Does that make sense? Yeah.

All right. Let me see. Let me see.

Let me. Edit on. Oh.

It's full. That's where. Let me change.

And now. Okay. We finally did it.

Google Docs. New. Nice.

I'm going to close this stuff. So what we're going to do is. We're going to work on your like offer.

And. Based on the offer that we're going to create. Then you can use it as a.

Like a foundation to creating better emails. So. Roy.

Lead. Gen. Offer.

First thing. Like what I would recommend is. Like I mentioned.

Because you don't have a partner. You're doing this alone. You want to make.

An offer. That. Like package.

Really. And honestly. Automated.

So there's like. Two ways. So one is like done for your service.

Which is. Like the harder part. But then it's like.

Done with you. Then it's like. Do it yourself.

This is like. Most hands off for you. Like easiest.

For you. Easiest. For them.

And it's like. In the middle. So this is.

Done for you. Easiest to sell. Because you don't put any time in.

And this is. Hardest to sell. But easiest to you.

Because you do. Like they do most of work. So what we're going to do.

Is what I really like. Is. We're going to sell.

Like lead. Generation. Engines.

So what we're going to help. Companies do. Is we're going to help them.

Set up. Lead generation engines. In house.

With instantly. They help them reach out. Up to 10,000.

Of their ideal prospects. Monthly. On almost autopilot.

So what we do. Is. Behind the scenes.

Like we're saying. Setting up instantly. For them.

Like it's actually super easy. But they don't know that. And like your.

Like your experience. And like watch your show. And help them set up.

Like it's so worth it. So let's lead generation engine. We're going to have.

10,000. Ideal. Prospects.

Then we can do. Copywriting. You're going to help.

Write them copies. So they know how to do it. Copywriting.

Then you can use like AI. AI. AI.

Powered. Conversation. Yeah.

Persensation. Yeah. I love this one.

Then you can do. Like some playbooks. Um.

The call would be like to set them up. With an instant account. With.

Uh. The hyperleads. Hypergrowth.

So they can. Then you buy the domains. So this one.

Let's add it here. The prospects. Um.

15 accounts. Say three domains. Email.

Warm up. And. Set up.

Playbooks. Playbook. And then.

Let's say. Sales. Oh.

Okay. So this is like. A beginning of.

What you can like work on. But. Like I mentioned.

We're going to help them. Reach out to. Prospects.

Monthly. Uh. We're going to create.

15 accounts for them. Then you can show the. 10k.

Email roadmap. 10k. Let's run one.

10k. Yes. This one.

Okay. We need like. 15 accounts.

To send us many emails. And it's also like. Really good to.

Include an offer. Like. Later.

When you show the. ROI. So we're going to go through that.

As well. Like the sales process. But.

10,000. 15 accounts. Three domains.

We're going to do email. One up and set up for them. Copywriting.

Let's say. Four. Sequences.

AI powered. Personization. Converting.

Leads. Playbook. We can take this from instantly.

Sales audit is also like. From instantly. If you go to the accelerator.

Sales. We have it. Under the master class here.

But pretty much again. Like. If we set up.

The lead generation. Engine for them. And they're getting leads.

If you don't close them. It's like. It's on them.

Because like. You can help them a little bit. So it can give you like.

An audit that you can go through. Just like. Give them.

It's like. More value. And.

Audits. I'd say. We can sell it for like.

5k. One time. Setup fee.

And. You can also like. Add a guarantee.

If you want. Let's say. Empty.

10. Meetings. In this.

Price. And then. Monthly.

And say. Retainer. So.

You set this up. The first month. It's more expensive.

Like 5k. Because you have to buy the accounts. Write the copy and everything.

And the month retainer. To keep it going. Running.

Engine. You can start from like. 2.5k.

But it's actually super simple. You just need to fill in. Leads.

Maybe work and copy. And they take care of the. Inbox management.

So you can go down to like. 1k. But you can start here.

And same with this one. You can start with like 5k. Set everything up.

Most of the time. It's like. Okay.

But you have a lot of room. To come down. Because.

Cost. To build. Like this for you.

Like don't show this. Don't show this to that people. Hyper growth.

With instantly 97. Then hyper leads. 197.

Then you need. 3 domains. Like 30 bucks.

Let's say. And then you need. 15 accounts.

Let's say Google Workspace. Like 7. So 15.

105. Let's add all this together. 97 plus.

197. Plus. 30.

plus. 105. So it's 429.

Like your cost. Which is like. Insane again.

But the value. Like. Yeah.

People don't have to. Feel bad of like. Because it's so cheap.

The value. And how you're justifying it. Is this right.

Like. Yeah. If it costs like.

Yeah. This much. And to get back.

More from it. It's valuable for them. But given it costs like 5k.

It's worth it. And if you just get like. A couple of.

Customers from this. So this is the engine. You want to build them.

And. Then. Maybe let's like.

First. There are like any questions on this. Do you have any like.

Suggestions that make sense? Yeah. It makes sense.

So. Okay. And it would be.

A monthly retainer. So it wouldn't be like. Paper lead or anything.

But you can. We can like. Work on that.

But. If we want to do like. A package deal.

That they take care of. At least like. We set up the engine for them.

We have to pick up. We set up. But they take care of the.

Leads and booking them in. Then it's like this. But you can say.

Monthly retainer. 1k. Plus.

If they want. Let's say you can like. Upsell.

Inbox management. It usually. Our clients do it themselves.

But if you're short on time. You want me to do it. We can do 200.

Per. Booked meeting. So it's going to be 1k.

Retainer. To keep it running. To fill it with leads.

Make sure. Copy is running. Everything.

And then. If we. Do the.

Inbox management. We booked meetings. It's going to be 200.

Book meeting. Or you can do it yourself. Then it's just like.

1k a month. Okay. Yeah.

It's like. Pretty. Pretty good deal.

Right. Any other questions. About this?

No. Okay. Perfect.

So. Now let's. Go through a little bit.

Of the. Targeting. Who can resell this to.

So like. What do you think? Like.

Who would be the. Good. Prospects.

For this kind of offer. Setting up. Like leaders.

And agents. For them. Within software development companies.

Or just like. B2B. Just like.

Just generally. Like. Who could.

Like benefit. From this the most. I mean.

Definitely like. B2B. Companies.

That need. That need more leads. Is that what you mean?

Yeah. So. B2B.

But again. Like more specific. Like something that we can target.

Like with keywords. Like soon. Search for.

I think like. Agencies. Yeah.

Marketing agencies. Software development companies. SaaS.

PR. Agencies. Anything else?

Like another like good tip. That I can give is. If you go to instantly.

You can check. Like what kind of. Templates we have.

Say like. So. Leadership agency.

Video production. Coaching. Like coaching is a really good one.

Because. You. How do you target.

Is. Is that all in the instantly. Yeah.

It's easy. You can go to them. And like.

The best people to target. With this. Is like.

High ticket people. Because like. One close for them.

Is worth so much. Potentially like. Tens of thousands.

Of hundreds. Thousand dollars. So like.

Software. I think is like. Hardest.

Because. If it's like. Small software.

Even like with instantly. It's really hard. Like to pitch this.

Because like. The client isn't worth as much. So I need to get back.

Like many more. So let's say. I get like.

I pay 5k. 5,000. Divide it by.

It's in 97. Or let's say 37. I need 135 clients.

For the 37th month plan. So lifetime value would be higher. So that's.

Another thing we can discuss. But. Software.

I think like. In the beginning. I would.

Add into brackets. I'm going to tell you this. So it starts with.

High ticket. Offers. Where.

One client. Is worth. Like.

At least 1k. Ideally. 5k.

Then we want to like. Understand their. Like value prop.

So let's say coaching. Let's go here again. Then we can go like.

More in depth. Agencies. We start with specific ones.

Influencer marketing. TikTok. Content.

SEO. Recruiting. Recruiting is actually really big.

Recruiters. Are pretty much like. Elite relation agency.

This help companies get. Perfect. Like workers.

But I thought it's. I don't know if you made content. On this or not.

But I thought you said. It's like. Hard to deliver.

On over email. Like hard to bring them clients. Yeah.

Might be. But it's like. Same can be said.

About like every niche. But again. Like we don't have to like.

Start there. We can try different angles. But.

It's like definitely worth. Test. If we can like.

Like find those angles. And I don't think I've offered. Like.

It's like Legion. Plans. It's like maybe.

If you offer like a service. Where you guarantee. Like results.

It's harder. But. Giving them an engine.

That they can use. And run. Maybe that's going to be easier.

To. Okay. Got it.

But like. Web development. I wouldn't target.

Design agents. I wouldn't target. Those are like very specific.

Or maybe. Maybe again. Like.

Maybe I'm wrong. Let's do. Web design.

Because yes. Same argument. It's hard.

If we run the get page for them. But they always look for clients. They want to maybe try the.

Engine. So. It's just getting started.

Getting your like foot. Under you. Might be good.

But like long term. I don't have a lot of. Trust to this.

And then like. Ecom. Yeah.

I think this is like. Good enough. So.

Let's take like. Three ones from here. What do you think?

Like. It's like. Who would be.

Like your favorite. Or who would you want. Like target here.

Which would you want to work with. From these ones. Yeah.

The two clients that I have right now. They're actually not in software. They're marketing agencies.

So. I. I do have.

Some experience in that. And I. I do want to go after PR.

And coaching. But I'll be open to suggestions. I think these are perfect.

Like I would have taken the same. So. Marketing agencies.

Peer agencies. Peer agencies and coaching. I would also do like.

Some marketing agencies. Peer agencies. To like.

Like agencies. I would start with. These two.

Okay. So yeah. Like start with.

Marketing agencies and coaching. And then PRs. Because like marketing agencies.

You can. Just break down too. Like you can do.

SEO. Facebook. Ecom.

Influencer. Content. We can like.

Break this down even more. And each of these. Can be a different campaign.

So again. If you go to the. Sheet.

If you're working. Like leads and prospecting. Is like.

How I can. Figure out. Like different ways.

Inside the niche. Same with copywriting. Same with campaigns.

We have to like. Launch them. But it's okay.

I want to do one campaign. For influencer. Marketing campaigns.

Like specifically. So. Let's do one.

Let's start with. Maybe like coaching. Because you haven't like.

Done this before. I think it's. So.

What I would do next. Is. Instantly.

So. Lead finder. So there are a couple of ways.

Like industry. And just use like. Professional training.

And coaching. Like simple. And if you go here.

Let's see how many. Professional trainers. And coaches.

We have. So like. 146,000.

So you're from. U.S. Let's start with.

United States. Let's then do. Filters.

Management levels. Sea level. 7K.

So. You have now. The hyperleads.

Inceptive plan. Which allows you to send. 10,000.

Or get 10,000 leads. Monthly. Verified.

But let's. Nail this down even more. So we have.

So we have professional training. From United States. Sea level.

Employees. Yeah. Maybe employees.

And this is also something that like. My personal experience. Coaching companies.

Like smaller. Like coaching companies. They actually like need more help.

Especially like with this kind of like. Engines. I think these engines are going to sell really well.

For a little bit smaller ones. Let's try this. Like 0 to 25.

And 4.5. And. I wouldn't want to add revenue.

Because revenue filter. Like it is good. But we're starting out.

It. It's not that important right now. Let's see.

Maybe this is like. Good enough already. We can do like.

Select the first. It's like a. Week's worth.

How many. So you have six accounts. Right?

At the moment. So 180 per. 80.

K per day. So. All right.

Let's do like a thousand. Okay. Select first.

Thousand results. And like you're looking at it. This is how simple it is now.

To do campaigns instantly. We select. First thousand.

Add to campaign. Let's select the one that I did. Edit.

Targeting copy. Add to campaign. So it's like adding to each.

Right? It takes a little bit of time. Like adding to campaign.

Once you're added. We're going to start verifying them. And all the verified leads.

Are going to stay in the campaign. We're going to remove. All the other ones.

And. Now. Once the leads.

Are added. Then we can work on. The copy.

For these coaches. And like. Run this campaign.

For a week. For these coaches. Once you get more accounts.

Then we can like start. Next ones. Next to it.

But thinking like coaching. And marketing agencies. Because you already have the.

Clients is really good. So we have these ones. Right?

All these coaches. In verification queue. Sequences.

So this is the. Copy. I showed you before.

Right? So I look at your website. What are some people.

We could target for you. And you work at. The company.

So now. Like this is like. Homework for you.

Do some research. Go to these people's. Like websites.

And see. What kind of clients. Like typically.

Coach one. Go to chat GPT. Like.

Ask chat GPT. Like hey. What are the best kind of clients.

That. Personal coaches. Business coaches.

Want to target. Who's their ideal customer. And it's like.

Add those here. And then. Yeah.

Like whatever it's going to be. If you're thinking about. Any of these.

We build. Leads and research. Angels for companies.

Like yours. That help you get. Try to tell meanings.

With them. On autopilot. We.

Could send you. A video on how you. Could get started.

Or could it get you. A video on. Of how.

It works. So. So the key is like this part.

If we nail this. We get. Exactly the class that they want.

Like they're going to like. Like this. What's going to make it resonate.

Right. But a subject. You can do.

Marketing ideas. Or. Company.

Name. This one. Let me say this quickly.

I thought you were going to put. Quick question there. Yeah.

No. I haven't used that in a while. And this one.

Yeah. You can try to make. Something happen from this one.

I can do. Two days. See.

But yeah. Like that's how easy it is. And same.

Let's do. Now let's take this campaign. Um.

All right. Copy. Let's.

Rename. Sure. Let's go here.

Rename. This is going to be. Coaches.

In. U.S. 0 to 25.

Employees. Targeting copy. Good.

You know. Now I'm going to. Duplicate this campaign.

And what we're going to do. Is we're going to do. Agencies.

Do you know? Do you know? Okay.

So we have. The. Agencies here.

Now we're going to. Like change the copy. That.

It's pretty much like. The copy system. Just targeting again.

Think about the class. That you have right now. Think about who they want to target.

Again. Ask chat GPT. Who would be the ideal.

Target for the clients. And then again. We've got the lead finder.

So. So two ways of like. How I do it.

So I did the first campaign. I'm going to let you do the second one. I'm just going to show you like.

Two ways. So industry. Marketing and advertising.

And just like. Use this one. A bunch of leads here.

You can do United States. Again. Use employees.

Whatever you want to use. And the second one. Would be.

Keywords. You can add agency here. And just like.

Search for. Composites. Have like.

Agency in their name. So that's again. Like your homework.

Find. Those leads. Again.

Create a campaign. That is like a thousand. So like weeks worth of leads.

And then. We have. Two campaigns for coaches.

And this one. And then. Our only goal now.

Is to. Daily. Work on this.

Create these searches. Like if I find a good search. Again.

Like finding decent prospecting. You don't always have to just like. Add them to the campaign.

You can also. Like save the search. So you can go back to.

So what we should have done. Like with the previous one. And same with copywriting.

So I gave you like some ideas. Then go through. Instant accelerator.

Look at some copy. Look at the templates. Come up with more angles.

And then set up campaigns. Literally like we just did. You can.

Like if you're not using the old ones. I would delete it. Clean slate.

It's like super simple. Right? And.

And we just have the ones. That we're working with. And.

You always have like backup. Or you can also add. Instead of like setting up campaigns.

It's just setting up campaigns. Or. Variants.

Okay. Or let's say. Variants.

Or. Follow ups. So you can also like work on the current campaigns too.

And I always have to like. Create new ones. Just make them longer.

But here like. We got agencies. 11,000 from United States.

We can work on these. Again. Select first thousand.

Whatever you want to do. Add them to the campaign. And boom.

We have like two ones ready. And. The only thing now.

That's like. Like stopping you. From getting to 10k.

Getting the money. Is just like the volume. So imagine if you can like.

Reach out to all these people. Like today. You'd be like tomorrow.

Already getting. So many responses. So.

I think you. You said you're going to get like 15 accounts. Right?

So. Again. I have 18 right now.

But most of them are warming. Like 12 of them are. I'm going to add.

Like six more. To warm. Okay.

Perfect man. Then we can start. Using these.

And even like with the growth partner ones. I wouldn't like worry too much. Like we can definitely use them.

Just like volume. Just like. Change them.

Like the retargeting of the domain. Let's just like blast them. It's better than just letting them sit there.

So like. Let's remove the other campaigns. And then.

Yeah. Then tomorrow. If you do a call.

We can go through. This one. We can go through the.

This one. Tracking. How many emails you sent out.

Today. So like fill it in. For tomorrow's call.

And then. Once your campaign is done. Like you.

Done the work with the cold emails. Right now. You.

Your. Like emails. Set.

There's like nothing much you can do. So then I would do. Twitter outreach.

And it's actually worked like really well in the beginning. So you can just do like. On Twitter.

Maybe like. Actually two things. So.

So like. I'm helping you. Build.

Like. And then. On Twitter.

What I would recommend is like. Start. Like building in public.

With digital machines. Instantly. Start tweeting.

Like daily. Or weekly. Like week one.

Of maturity 10k. Send this many emails. This many calls.

This many clients. Just like. Get your Twitter active.

Get people seeing like. What you're doing. And then you can use your Twitter.

To start reaching out. To people like. Just search for like agency.

And reach out like. Don't use like cold email copy. But like.

Hey man. So what you're doing with. Like your agency.

Just like start up these conversations. And then you can like. Tell them like.

Hey. How many meetings are you getting right now? Like.

Do you guys like. Want to get more? Because like.

We can build these engines for you. It's like almost. Automatically.

Like work. And then. So.

We can go through Twitter stuff. Next time. So we're like.

Almost at an hour now. So. But.

Be active. Work on this stuff. And.

Do you have any more questions for me. At this moment. Or is it clear?

It's. The steps until this point. Is pretty clear.

What I wanted to ask you. It's a minor question. It's.

About the sub sequences. So. When someone's into.

In a sub sequence. Do they like. Once they respond.

Does it take them out of the sequence? Yes. So.

What I would say. Like shortly. Is.

Let's not. Set up. Sub sequences.

Right now. In the beginning. So they're really good.

For like. Automating. If you have like.

A large volume. But right now. If you have like.

Smaller volume. It's much better. To go.

Manual. And respond. Basically.

Like manually. So I wouldn't. Like worry about.

Sub sequences. If you get leading. Be as specific as possible.

So hopefully already. Like. You're going to get some positive ones.

Like today. Tomorrow. And we can like.

Work on those. Or you can like. Respond right now.

On your own. And then we can go through. See if you can do something better.

If it's like. Already perfect. But I wouldn't worry about.

Automation sub sequences. Right now. Yeah.

Okay. Perfect. So.

Any other questions. About the offer. Maybe again like this.

If you like start. Selling this. Then going forward.

Once you're getting responses. We can rework. Like your website.

A little bit. Generate a video. Around this.

Share slides. And. Yeah.

Just like a small. Like rework. Of your website.

To make it more. Like applicable to this. So people like.

Understand it better. But yeah. I think that's pretty much it.

So yeah. You have a contact. Everybody else like.

Looking at this video. Thanks so much. We're going to be back.

Like tomorrow. Record another one. So hopefully.

We get it going. We start getting like results here. Like subscribe.

And yeah. Thank you. See you in the next one.

Bye.
