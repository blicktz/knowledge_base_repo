At this point, you might have noticed how many different spreadsheets, documents, guides we have, and it's because they're going to do the heavy lifting. So assets like case studies, Lumideos, blog posts, insightful documents are going to help you close more. They will do the heavy lifting before, during, and after the call when used correctly.

They will build trust and show the prospects you really know what you're doing. So this is why Alex Remoising can close businesses super easily. Best-selling author, insanely successful business owner, huge following, so he must know what he's doing.

Luckily, we don't have to be like him. We just have to show our prospects that we know what we're doing. We have a system.

We've done this before and are in good hands. You can send a quick video of your processes or relevant case studies before the demo to get your prospects already invested and they understand the process more. This will make the actual closing so much simpler.

So imagine you have a sales call with an SEO agency and before a call, you send them a video testimonial from an other SEO agency you work with. The prospect is going to be like primal, like, damn, they've done this with an exact same customer. So they can probably do this for me too.

So getting into the habit of creating these SOPs, documents will make sense to send to your prospects, save screenshots of your successes and ask your clients for video testimonials. We can also use these assets after the call to bring those prospects over the line. So all the follow-ups, you can send them over.

And when they're on a fence, you can hit them with a strong proof of reference and you're going to close more. You can also give this to your team. Your team is going to have so much higher chance of closing if they have these documents ready, because if you as a founder aren't there, like it's pretty much like cloning you.

You know the best things about your product. If you have created the documents, you don't have to train them. You don't have to explain them.

Just give these documents to your sales team. So here's a list of some assets you can create. Blueprint, framework, document of the processes.

The more in-depth, the better. Just like, even if they don't read through it, just because it's like 50 pages on Leechang, they must know what they're doing. They wouldn't create a 50-page document otherwise.

Testimonials, reviews, super strong. Always have a bunch of these every time you get a good testimonial. Screenshot it, save it, ask for video testimonials.

Custom-processed Loom videos, super powerful. If you say no before the call, after the call, just showing them specific answers to what they need right now. No generic stuff.

List of references, bros can hit up. So in the recap template that I showed you previously, you can have, by the way, you can contact Mark from this company and ask him how it was working with us. Sales tech, so this continuous work in progress, make it better and better and better.

Screenshot of results. For us, we just had screenshots of all the inboxes, positive responses. Blog posts.

If you can write a book, that's a good one. Podcast. Again, show us you're one of the leaders in the market if you're doing podcasts.

YouTube channels, videos. So again, imagine they ask, what makes you different? Or we have a YouTube channel with 50K followers in our niche.

Again, it establishes you as an authority in your field. Social media posts. Like if you're doing Twitter, I just wrote a thread about our topic.

Like check this out. Landing pages. You can have different pages on your site about specific things, specific problems.

And then free guides. Similar to what we're doing right now. Everything that this will help you build more trust and eventually help you close more.
