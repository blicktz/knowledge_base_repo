hi everyone so we just released a new feature in instantly which is reply templates and i just wanted to make this quick video to show you guys how you can use this and where you can find it so when you're in your instantly account you want to go to the uni box select a response you've gotten start writing reply and then what you'll notice is a new button down below called reply macros when you click on it you'll have the option to create the new reply macro so you can name this whatever you want but basically this is how you'll find it later on i'll just call it reply one and then you can just insert a reply that you usually want to send to your prospects so i'll just write an example here our pricing starts from 37 per month kind regards so just a super super simple example then i'll click save and what this will do is insert one of those macros here so when i'm back here in the text editor so now what i can easily do is just start typing a hashtag which will load up all the replies that i've saved so this is the example i've saved just now and when you just click on it it will insert you here so the main value of this feature is that you'll often find yourself writing out similar replies people asking for more information pricing info all that kind of stuff so you can create templates for all of these and this will make responding to leads so much easier because you can just choose the templates and reply this way and yeah that's pretty much it thanks for watching you
