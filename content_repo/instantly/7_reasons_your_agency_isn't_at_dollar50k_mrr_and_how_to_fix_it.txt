hey guys if your agency isn't at 50k mrr yet there are seven main factors why it's like that and i'm going to show you in this video how you can get past them how you can fix them how you can scale your agency before we get started make sure to hit like and subscribe button so i can keep creating these videos and let's get started so first thing the main main one is you're not getting enough sales opportunities if you're not talking to clients if you don't have demos in your calendar it's impossible to grow so how we can fix this you need to get more email accounts set them up and instantly send more emails jump on sales calls and close it seems simple but that's the lifeblood of your business just the oxygen you can never lack on this you need to have opportunities you need to be reaching out to new people every damn day so check this is uh last four weeks for our campaigns and you can see we have a total of a thousand people that reply to our emails so even if 10 of those are positive 100 people imagine if you were talking with 100 positive people every month that are looking to talk to you about your service that might be a perfect client it's impossible to fail and we got there by sending thousands of emails every day so you need to start sending more emails setting up accounts and doing this regularly you can't like you need to do this every every day that's the main one let's get on to the second one so second lack of focus so i see this a lot and i've done this as well so how you can fix this is stop working on side projects so most of entrepreneurs they have so many ideas so many different things they want to work on but if you really want to scale your agency put all of those other things on pause just for now it doesn't mean you're not ever going to work on them but just for now for the next three to six months just go monk mode just focus on your agency and just focus on the things that move the needle stop working on your website right now your logo if you're not getting enough sales opportunities that's the first thing set up your campaigns start sending emails start talking with clients and then focus on getting your clients the best results that you can focus on that focus 100 on our agency stop everything else and you're going to scale much much faster third not using vh virtual assistants so vas were a huge help in our agency they can help you get rid of all the small things that you don't like doing so for example for us in our literation agency mining leads getting filters and exporting leads from apollo and then verifying them all this like manual leverage task that's pretty much just like clicking buttons can super easily be outsourced to vas just go to opwork you can find some maybe on fiverr and all the small tasks that are doing right now that don't require much like deep domain knowledge or it's like super easily outsourceable just hand them on like i said mining leads managing inbox all these things you shouldn't be focusing on these and that will give you much more time to focus on the things that move the needle getting on sales calls sending more emails and just making more money for your agency four not creating sops so standard operating procedures so these are videos and documentations on every repeatable task that you do in your agency so for example and if you have a lead generation agency and you're buying domains and setting up email accounts record a loom from that create a documentation like this uh video like this documentation i'm showing right now then once you have the documentation if you're hiring more people you can just hand them that document you don't have to train them you don't have to waste your time on explaining everything you have an sop and you can just hand it over so this goes hand in hand with hiring vas super important every repeatable task in your agency write it down write a document record loom video everything you give to a va you should record okay let's say it goes yeah okay fifty five so this is what we did in our agency and it hold us back a lot so it's onboarding unqualified clients it's going to be so stressful you're going to be focusing so much of your time on bad clients getting them results that's going to take away from your actual agency getting results to the good good clients so how to fix this so first before you jump on sales call with them qualify them harder like do they actually have the money to pay you uh long term do they have the time so if something from your offer needs time from your client make sure they're willing to do that for lead generation agencies super important thing is skills if you bring them leads can't actually close if they don't have any experience closing cold clients it's like they're going to be mad at you you're going to bring them leads you're going to bring them meetings they jump on a call but they don't have experience they can't close and that's not on you but they're going to blame you on that so don't work with bad clients same goes with like let's say they don't have case studies for lead generation it's going to be very hard for you to get them more leads if you don't have any case studies so this newer kind of project like new startups are a little bit harder to work with and if you already have this kind of clients find a way to fire them like straight up you have to do it if you have a guarantee with them fulfill it or refund if you have the money for it but get rid of them don't work with them all of your time should be going towards getting your own campaigns up getting more clients for yourself and helping your best clients get more results so sixth not investing profits into growth so i see this a lot and i think it's mainly because once you start getting money you think like if i start investing it back if i start hiring people you're going to lose lose money so yes your margins will get smaller but your net revenue profit will increase and maybe not in the first month but in long term it's you're going to make more money if you invest it back so let's say right now i'm sending 100 emails daily and i make 10 000 bucks a month i will invest 1k 10 back into getting more email accounts more domains so i can send out 500 000 emails a day so i will 5 or 10 x our outreach by spending that 1k but with that i can possibly make like 20 30k already because i'm reaching out to so many more people i'm getting more sales opportunities so don't be afraid of investing some of the profits back and it's it's like delayed delayed gratification you're putting your current profits a little bit on pause you're not going to buy yourself that nice dinner that nice jacket car watch whatever but long run you can buy multiple you can buy many cars like if you want so remember this invest it back and same goes into investing back into your clients so if you have a really good client you can invest more back into them lead generation super simple you just buy more domains for them you don't even have to ask money for them you can but you can invest your own money back into getting more domains so you can get them more results same stuff like if you're an ad agency invest money into getting like a better designer get like a sick kick-ass 3d or like a video editor that can create like an insane video you pay a couple hundred bucks maybe even like a thousand but if you know it's going to bring you much more back in the long run it's worth it so don't be afraid to invest profits back and last doing everything solo is a huge mistake i feel a lot of people are struggling with this and again don't be afraid to outsource all the low leverage tasks that can be done by va just for like five six bucks an hour another way is to find a partner find a partner that has those skills or likes doing the things that you don't like doing you can go into instantly's facebook group i can put the link down below there's a lot of like-minded people there you can find partners on twitter so if you're struggling you're not growing i really recommend like you can do it solo but it's like much harder that needs to be it's going to be easier with a partner and same thing goes like your margin will get so let's say you get a 50 50 partner but your net profits will increase long term because you can do twice as much you can do so much more work if you're a partner plus you're not going to burn out your life is going to be a little bit easier because you always have somebody to went to to bounce ideas up from so this is super underrated you shouldn't be focusing doing everything solo unless like that's your goal and in our agency and instantly we have four partners it wouldn't have been as successful if i would have done it alone 100 so get a partner it's going to help you and that's it so i hope these things helped you start implementing them straight away i would say the most important part is just what most companies struggle with they just don't have enough sales opportunities so get more email accounts set them up and instantly send more emails and you're going to see your agency start growing and scaling because it's always like you get more sales calls you're going to close more you're going to get more money so hopefully you got some value out of this if you did
