I think the thoughts or like bumping this up, just making sure you saw my email. Like I think those are basically done. Like unless you're outside of a market that the people get emails all the time in, like we were talking about that gutter cleaning niche just before, I don't find that it's working with people anymore.

I think it's kind of like a lazy thing. What I like to do is try to create serendipity in the follow-ups and make it seem like I'm telling like an overarching story through all of the threads. So like then the next follow-up that we send is a lot of times there's this thing on LinkedIn called people also viewed.

And so if you go to somebody's page, it says people also viewed and then it'll put in your thing. And so if I were to say like, hey, we have a mutual connection, you're probably not gonna know that person. But the people also viewed, LinkedIn is using some kind of algorithm to find like, who do you DM the most?

Who do you comment on their posts? Who do you like their posts most often? And then that person will show up.

So we'll actually scrape that person. And we'll say, Nilf, I was just on Rayo's profile on LinkedIn and the algorithm pushed me back to yours. So I figured I would follow up.

And then we have some kind of follow-up thing there.
