qualification discovery super important if you get good at this you're gonna close more the closing is gonna get easier and you're gonna not waste your time on tire kickers people that are not qualified so get really good at this in the beginning and your sales is gonna get easier the goal is to honestly figure out if it's a good fit and if you can help the customers we don't want to sell them if they won't benefit from our system and this is what makes it hard if you try to sell to unqualified people you can do it but it's very hard have a physical notebook ready writing them answers and you'll also use the answers during the demo and follow-ups and the qualification discovery part you should only ask questions and listen don't give up solutions yet just listen take an answer okay like don't start selling this just ask questions listen write them the answer and move on to the next question and this should take five to ten minutes max some people they love talking so it takes a little bit longer you can like stop them oh yeah I get it uh and so a couple more questions or just like be friendly you don't have to push it too hard but in the beginning you can just frame it just give a short answer it's just in like a couple of sentences how does the system work something like that if you're asking for concrete numbers about their funnels their goals mark your stats into an ROI sheet or whatever works for your business so the example that we have is for a leasing agency and we have this ROI calculator we can actually put in their ticket size their actual closing rate the numbers they want to achieve and later when we demo we can show with their numbers how it's going to work out how the numbers are going to look how much the ROI is going to be so if you can do something like this strongly recommended and the example of qualification is for leasing agencies change the questions to fit your business so example script first hey Tim nice to meet you where are you calling from it's a typical small talk okay cool so I already went through your website and your answers when booking in but I wanted to ask you some questions to get a better understanding on how things work internally is that okay I know reach out to you but what is the main thing that piqued your interest in us what made you jump on this call write down this answer they're literally telling why they're here what's their priority you can use this later in follow-ups on a demo to really hone in on this or you told me you jumped on a call because of this this is exactly what we do and what are you guys doing right now to get more customers meetings what channels are using getting a little bit background on what they're doing to see if there's something you can improve cool and how many meetings you're getting right now weekly again writing the numbers seeing where they are right now so we can compare it later to where they want to get to and what's your close rate on average from those calls so here we want to understand what's your close rate on average ticket size you can understand your business understanding if cold email cold outreach is a viable solution for them cool and final question about the background how long is the sales cycle for you so here again if the sales cycle is long it's going to take them longer to see positive responses and closes if it's short they're going to get results quicker but everything you have here you can later tie back let's say you work with them and they haven't had closes for two months and you can tell them like yes but you told me your sales cycle is three months so how are you expecting to get the closest faster with us so all this can be used later and you just want to have like a benchmark of where they are right now so they don't blame you and then once you have the background out of the way sweet so let's talk about the future how many meetings would you ideally like to get every week so understanding their goals and then based on that goal you can tie it in with your offer and then understand approximately how much work you need to do and approximately what the pricing is going to be okay and hypothetically speaking if you were able to get you the amount of leads they said they want are you guys able to invest around 5k one time if we're able to get to those leads of course so this is a very important question it's a hard question to ask in the beginning but you're qualifying them for money you have a lot of options to play around with the pricing but you want to make sure they have at least some budget they can invest into your offer right now if you don't have any money it's not a good fit you shouldn't do the call you shouldn't do the demo it's not going to close so very important question don't skip it if you say yes perfect and again hypothetically if you can start getting your leads right away if you can get to those 10 leads a week are you guys ready to get started right now qualifying them from urgency if they're not ready to start right now we don't recommend doing the demo you're just wasting time that could have gone into talking to interested prospects you just say like no we're just like shopping around right now we're working a new project we're trying to raise money we're ready in like six months it's like yeah that sounds cool so let me reach out in five months once you guys are actually ready for this and final question are you the guy that pulls the trigger or do we need to include other decision makers if they're not the decision maker we don't recommend doing the demo and reschedule another call with the real decision makers sometimes it's not possible and you would have to do it then i recommend recording the call so they can share it with their team but always always always try to get all the decision makers on the call from the first get go if the answer that all right based on what you told me it seems like a perfect fit i'm going to stop sharing my video now share my screen and walk you through exactly how i can help you get leads and make more sales so then you get into the demo or that's perfect let me book you in for a 30 minute demo how how about tomorrow how about the day after so you wanna if it's a fit book them in straight away or jump in a demo if you booked in a long enough time window then some objections if they can afford 5k just tell them like yes just to be completely upfront require some money and how much do you have in your budget right now like what can you afford to spend then based on response see if you can offer something that would fit their budget so yeah again honestly just see let's say they want to get just like five leads and you can do it much cheaper than your typical pricing then maybe you can offer it a little bit cheaper but it's like all up to you if it's not a fit again be honest with them so based on what you told me right now unfortunately it's not a fit because of x but i'm happy to reach out in a couple months to see if things have changed and i can send some materials if you want to work on this on your own if you're on a budget right now check out these videos this document these materials and build the system internally so again be friendly help them with as much as you can then jump off the demo it's not a fit right now don't waste your time
