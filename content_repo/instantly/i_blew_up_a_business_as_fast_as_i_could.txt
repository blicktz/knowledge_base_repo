So this is me seven years ago, burnt out, had no direction, feeling completely lost and overwhelmed with where my life and my career was heading. But here's me just 24 months later with a thriving seven-figure business, a happy family, and a lifestyle that allows me to do literally whatever I want, whenever I want. You might look at this and say, I got lucky, but that couldn't be further from the truth.

In reality, it's a lot more simple. I just figured out what actions were going to actually move the needle for my business. So my Germany wasn't always glamorous.

I grew up in a blue-collar family where entrepreneurship wasn't even on the radar. My dad worked in construction. My mom stayed at the same company for years.

Parents were divorced. I'd bounce between jobs. And then something changed.

I met the founder of a company that I was working for while I was in the call center. And it was an e-commerce company. He said something that stuck with me to this day.

I think you're capable of more than you think you are. And that single sentence really ignited my fire to go out and do more than I thought that I was capable of because my environment really showed me otherwise. I jumped into sales and was 100% commissioned salesperson, grinding as a 20-year-old surrounded by a bunch of people with college degrees and a lot of sales experience.

I ended up making six figures in that job. But I wanted to do something bigger and I wanted more freedom. So I quit to try real estate.

I moved into my friend's spare bedroom to cut costs and started building a personal brand on social media. And people started noticing my content and asking me for help with their own. I didn't even know what a video agency was at that time.

So I started basically charging for help. And about two and a half years into real estate, I realized that I was kind of onto something. But the problem was, is I was a glorified freelancer, doing everything myself, had no business experience whatsoever.

And I knew things needed to change. Fast forward, when I made that decision to change, that business scaled to multiple seven figures, were able to get a 7,000 square foot studio, employ over 25 people. And I was able to work myself out of the business, hire a CEO and start a new business, which in less than two years, has already done multiple seven figures.

So in this video, I'm breaking down the things that made me successful into seven steps that you can follow, even if you're a complete beginner. Let's get into it. So the first step is we need to create an offer that sells itself.

So when I first started my business, I had a major problem. I was just seen as a commodity to people. Potential clients would compare me to everyone else who made videos, everyone else who did social media.

They'd say things like, oh, I can just get this on Fiverr for $50. And I was constantly competing on price and losing to cheaper options as a result. And I was frustrated because I knew I could deliver great results, but the clients only saw me as another video guy, another social media guy.

And really the game changer for me was learning how to create an offer that made me incomparable. And here's exactly how I did it using what I call the irresistible offer formula. First, I got super clear on my target audience.

Instead of trying to help any business owner or anybody with a pulse, I focused specifically on service-based business owners who are experts at their craft, but struggling with marketing. Specifically, I targeted real estate agents and home service companies. And I knew that these people had money to spend and no time to create content and they wanted leads.

So by narrowing down who I serve, my messaging instantly became way more powerful. Secondly, identified their specific pain points. I talked to these business owners and discovered that they were frustrated with inconsistent client flow.

They were tired of relying solely on referrals. They were overwhelmed by everything that had to do with social media, but knew that they needed it. They were tired of wasting money.

They were tired of watching the competitors getting clients. And when I spoke directly to these pain points in my offer, potential clients would say, it's like you're reading my mind. Third thing, I focused on their desired outcomes.

I learned what they actually wanted. They wanted a steady stream of qualified leads every single month. They wanted to be seen as an authority.

They wanted to convert more prospects and they wanted to build a content library that works for them 24 seven. So by promising these specific outcomes in my offer, I was no longer just selling videos. I was selling the results that the client actually wanted.

And this is where everything changed for me because once I understood their pain points and their desired outcomes, creating the solution was simple. Creating the offer was simple. And for me, the answer was a combination of content and ads.

I realized that content alone probably isn't enough. They needed me to distribute it for them. And ads alone weren't enough.

They needed compelling content to advertise as well as they needed to build a brand. So I created a system, an offer that delivered both. And fourth, I outlined the exact steps to achieve these outcomes.

My offer clearly explained the process. This approach showed I had a system and not just a service and really spoke to exactly what they wanted. And I created the client attraction system that actually got them leads.

And the unique mechanism really makes it impossible for clients to compare me to anyone else, which is exactly why we included it. So when I put all these together, my offer became irresistible. I packaged it as the client attraction system, priced it around $2,000 per month, which was high at first for me.

But the client saw it as an investment, not just an expense. And this allowed me to close more clients, keep them longer because I was getting them a result and have something that was actually marketable and outcome driven for that specific client. So I know it was no longer just basing my offer based off of deliverables.

I was actually getting my clients outcomes. So what you need to do was just define exactly who will pay for your services, list their top five pain points, identify their outcomes and create a solution that directly bridges the gap between the pain and the outcome. And all you need to do is package it with a unique mechanism with a results focused name and make this the foundation of your entire business.

Without me doing this, I'd still be struggling to convince people I was the next best thing and better than the cheaper option that they were pitching to me. Step number two is what we call the momentum campaign. So after I created my irresistible offer, I faced a new problem.

I had this great offer, but nobody knew about it. I needed clients fast, but I didn't have money for ads or time to build a huge following at the time. And I was really starting pretty much from scratch with almost no audience.

And I'd see other business owners talking about complex marketing funnels, these email sequences and content calendars, but I wanted clients now, not six months from now. And I didn't want to spend a bunch of money doing it. So I felt stuck and overwhelmed.

And that's when I developed what I call the momentum campaign. This simple strategy helped me land my first clients in literally just 14 days without spending any money to do it. Here's exactly how I did it.

First, I leveraged my existing network. Instead of trying to find brand new people, I looked at who already knew, liked, and trust me. I made a list of past clients from previous jobs, friends who owned businesses, people I'd met at networking events, former colleagues, anyone who had ever asked about my work.

This gave me a list of around 30 to 50 people who already had some connection to me. Second, I created a value-first outreach message. So instead of sending a sales pitch, I crafted a message that led with value.

My message had simple parts like a personal connection. Hey, it's been a while since we've connected. I've been helping people like you get clients through video content and thought of you.

Would you be open to a quick call to see if this could be a fit for you or someone that you know? And really the key is just making it personalized and being human at this point. And the third thing I did was I made a public announcement about my new offer.

I created a simple post on all my social media accounts that said, I'm excited to announce that I'm now helping service-based businesses get more clients through strategic video and targeted ads, something along those lines. And if you know anyone that is looking to get predictable leads, build authority, convert more prospects, the outcomes that we built in the offer, comment the word info below or DM me and I will reach out to them. And the fourth thing that we did was just the natural transition.

So when somebody responded to my direct message or my social media post, I simply said, great to hear from you. Yeah, I recently started helping businesses like yours get more clients through social media. I do all of these things for clients just like you to help them get to the outcomes that we just talked about without the pain points that we've built.

Would you be open for a call to see if this could be a fit for you or anybody that you know? Naturally, people want to help. I did this every single day for two weeks straight and it wasn't just a one-time thing.

This became a daily practice of reaching out and following up. The momentum campaign has not only worked for me, but it's worked for a ton of people that we've worked with like Jordan who literally got $10,000 in seven days or Phillip who was just a brand new business did the same strategy and got $14,000 literally in one week. Or Ryan who created his irresistible offer ran the momentum campaign.

He landed $34,000 in contracts. The beauty of this campaign is that it works whether you're just starting out or you're looking to scale an existing business. So here's what you can do right now.

Make a list of 30 people who you already know. Craft a value first message that offers to help them, not a sales pitch. Create a public announcement about your new offer on social media and do this daily for at least two weeks straight.

Ask new clients for referrals, keep the momentum going and this will give you the cashflow that you need in order to continue to build your business. Step number three is the outbound email machine. So after running my momentum campaign, I had a solid base of clients, but I knew that I couldn't just rely on my network forever.

I'd eventually run out of warm contacts and my growth would eventually just stall. I needed a new way to consistently bring in new clients who had never heard of me before and I wasn't really ready to start running ads and I tried posting on social media, but building an audience just takes a long time. I needed something that would work right now without a big budget or a huge following.

And that's why I discovered the power of cold email outreach and I developed what I call the outbound email engine, a systematic approach to generate high quality leads through cold email. And this system helped me add five clients every single month, literally like clockwork. So the first thing I did is I identified my target audience and instead of emailing random businesses, I got really specific of who I wanted to work with.

I chose real estate agents with X amount of reviews and X amount of time in the business located in a specific area. This was crucial because I could actually write copy that spoke to that specific person. Second, I built a massive targeted prospect list.

I didn't use generic tools or buy leads. Instead, I used a tool called Instantly to scale my outreach. This tool allowed me to find thousands of qualified leads and make sure that I'm actually getting their emails when I do reach out to them.

It allows me to not only find leads, but I can reach out to them, I can follow up with them all in one tool. And I can do it at high volume, which is really required if you do want to actually get business. And third, I created my value first email sequence.

So instead of sending a sales pitch in my emails, I'd led with genuine value in my very first email. And I remember one of my first campaigns that worked really well was the free video offer. So basically what I would do is I would have a personalized message to them mentioning one of the trigger events that I would pull from like the location or the company that they worked for.

And the call to action was not, hey, let's set up a call. It was, hey, can I offer you a free video? And then from that, I would do two follow-ups with the irresistible offer.

And this got people in the door quickly because I tied that free video into a potential package. And because I was giving them value, they had the rule of really reciprocity and they moved forward with me as a result. And once I got through one list, I just rinsed and repeated for multiple niches.

Once I had the system working for real estate agents, I identified new niches like new home service businesses, plumbers, roofers, contractors, and I created a new campaign and instantly and would just continue to stack and compound the amount of outreaches that I was doing every single day. So here's what you need to do. Define your perfect target audience with specific criteria.

Use a tool like Instantly to manage your outreach at scale, create a value-first email sequence with a banger offer, and send a consistent volume of emails every single day. So after the outbound email, step number four is to build your authority on social media. After setting up the outbound email machine, I had a steady stream of leads coming in, but I would notice something frustrating.

Many of these cold leads were skeptical and took a long time to convert. I was spending hours on sales calls, trying to build trust from scratch, and even when I did get them on a call, they'd often say like, oh, let me think about it, or oh, I need to shop around. So I needed a way to pre-sell prospects before they ever got on a call with me, and that's when I developed the authority content system.

And this approach helped me build such strong credibility that prospects were already 80% sold before we even spoke. Here's exactly what we did. First, I committed to consistent content creation.

Instead of posting randomly whenever I felt like it, I made a firm commitment. I would post every single day on both Instagram, both on LinkedIn, with no days off. I would basically block out 30 minutes each morning to create and schedule my content for the day.

And second, I developed my three-part content funnel. I realized that not all content serves the same purpose, so I created an approach with three types of content. Top of funnel, which is awareness and attention.

These posts typically just cast a wide net and bring new people into my world. Second is the middle of funnel content. This is education and credibility, step-by-step breakdowns of my methods, behind the scenes look at my process, detailed case studies with specific strategies, comparison posts showing why my approach is different, and more.

This content builds credibility by showing that I actually know what I'm talking about. And then the third type of content is bottom of the funnel content, which is all about conversions and action. This is before and after transformations with real results from clients, limited time offer announcements, and direct invitations for people to work with me.

This creates urgency and shows exactly what working with me would be like. After posting, that wasn't just it. I created what I like to call the daily engagement system.

I realized that social media isn't just about broadcasting content, it's about being social. So I developed a daily routine to actively engage with my ideal clients. Every day, I would spend around 30 minutes to an hour and I would respond to comments on my posts.

I would comment thoughtfully on 10 to 20 posts from potential clients. I would send five personalized connection requests on LinkedIn. I would send voice notes to new connections.

And it wasn't really about random connections. This was about planting seeds. And I would focus my time on people who could be clients.

And when people jump on calls with me, they would say, I feel like I already know you because they've seen my content and I engage with them. And as a result, my sales calls completely transform. Instead of spending hours trying to convince someone to work with me, prospects would say things like, I've been following your content for weeks and love your approach.

I saw what you did for X client and want the same results. Oh, I don't need to talk to anyone else. I know you're the right person for this.

All because I was building my authority. So here's what you need to do. Commit to posting daily on Instagram or LinkedIn or wherever your client's spending time.

Create content for each stage of the funnel and implement daily engagement to build real relationships. And lastly, be patient because authority takes time. But this is the seed planting activity that will allow you to build authority and allow you to have prospects be pre-sold before they talk to you.

So after that, the next thing that I focused on was creating the video sales letter. After building my authority through content, I also noticed something interesting. My calendar was filling up with sales calls, but I was spending hours saying the same things over and over again.

And that's why I developed the video sales letter system. And this approach helped me literally double my clothes, right, while cutting my sales calls in half. So here's what I did.

First, I created my core video sales letter. Instead of explaining my background and my offer on every single call, I just recorded a 15-minute video that covered my story, why I started this business, the common problems my clients face, my unique approach to solving these problems, and the specific results my clients were getting. Then I would overview my services and what made my approach different from the competitors.

And it wasn't just me talking to the camera. I included client testimonials, screenshots, results, and visual examples of my work. Then with that VSL, I added it to my pre-call strategy.

So when somebody booked a call with me, they automatically received a link to my VSL with instructions to watch it before our call. And once they watched it, it would pre-sell them on my expertise and approach, it would qualify them before I spent time with them. And I basically, in the video, set stage for focused sales conversation.

And then third, I developed my focused sales call framework. So with prospects already familiar with my background and offer because they watched the VSL, instead of spending an hour explaining what I do and having to set up another call, the call was focused on their entire situation, their challenges, how my solution can help them, addressing any questions or concerns, and presenting the investment. And now these calls were a lot shorter and a lot more efficient because they had already been pre-sold on the VSL.

And also the quality of my leads improved dramatically because the people who weren't serious didn't move forward after watching the VSL. And I stopped feeling drained after sales calls and I was only talking to qualified prospects. So here's what you guys can do.

Create a VSL, implement a pre-call sequence and make sure people watch it and continue to refine your process based off of the feedback and results because the VSL will give you a scalable way to sell without burning out. Okay, so we had the VSL, we had the sales process down. The next thing that I need to do is step number six, which is the agency operating system.

So after implementing my sales processes, I faced my biggest challenge yet. I was still the bottleneck inside of my business. Even with a growing client base and a good sales process, I was drowning in day-to-day operations, which is exactly what I don't wanna do as a business owner.

I was managing client deliverables, overseeing project timelines, doing all the quality control, putting out fires. I was working 80 hours a week just to keep things running. So I needed a way to systematize my entire business so that it could run without my constant involvement.

And that's when I developed what I like to call the agency operating system. And this framework really transformed my business from chaos to clockwork and allowing it to run smoothly, even if I wasn't there. Here's exactly what I did.

First, I built my client directory in Notion. I created basically a database that contained everything that we needed to know about each client. It was the contact information, the password, service package, contracts, important dates, brand assets, access to communication preferences and history.

You name it, everything is centralized in one place. Second, I created my fulfillment and task system inside of the agency operating system, which is basically a structured workflow that tracked every deliverable from start to finish. And this is clear task assignments for team members, due dates, status updates, depending on quality control checkpoints.

You name it, we had it. And this system gave us complete visibility into what was happening with every single client project. I could literally just at a glance, see if anything was behind schedule or needed attention.

Third, I developed a client success dashboard. So I built a system basically to track the actual results that we were getting for clients. This included ROI calculations, goal tracking, areas from improvement, NPS surveys, wins that they've been able to get.

And they were focused on the outcomes that we were getting, not just deliverables that we were doing. It also gave us a lot of data for renewals and getting new clients as well. Then I built our automated onboarding sequence.

I basically created a full system that would automatically send them their contracts, send them their invoice, send them the onboarding form, send them a onboarding calendar to book the onboarding call, as well as the process internally so that we can be efficient when onboarding and really turn onboarding into our secret weapon. Because the moment the client says yes is the moment they have buyer's remorse. And we want to wow them from day one.

In Styx, I built out a client portal. I basically created a dedicated space where clients could see all their deliverables, see all their due dates, access all the assets that we've been building for them, see all the leads even, and even submit feedback and requests. And this portal allowed us to improve client communication, reduce back and forth emails.

So from a system perspective, what you need to do is you need to take the steps to the outcome, which we talked about from the offer perspective, figure out how can I systematize these, get everything that's in your brain and what you're doing, turn them into a system that somebody else could eventually follow. Because the reality is that systems run the business and people run the systems. Without systems, you're always going to be the bottleneck just like I was.

After implementing the agency operating systems, the next thing that I needed to do was build a dream team and become a true CEO inside of my business. Look, I had the infrastructure to scale, but I had one final challenge. I was still involved in way too many aspects of my business.

Even with great systems, I was still managing client relationships, overseeing projects, handling strategy. I was working fewer hours, but I still couldn't truly step away. I needed to build a team that could run the business without me.

And that's when we developed what we call the dream team framework. And this approach allowed me to transform from an overworked agency owner to a true CEO. Here's how I did it.

First, created a strategic hiring plan. So instead of hiring reactively when we're overwhelmed, I mapped out the ideal structure based off of our offer. I identified, okay, what are the roles needed for the business to run?

What are the KPIs based off of our offer? And I created detailed job descriptions with specific outcomes for that person. And I really realized that hiring deserves the same level of attention as client acquisition or service delivery.

Second, I implemented our A player recruitment system. So I stopped settling for whoever was available like I used to do. And I created a process to find talent.

I wrote good job descriptions that attracted the right people. I created a multi-stage interview process to thoroughly vet candidates. I developed skill assessment to analyze each person applying for that role.

And while this process took a lot longer upfront, it saved me hours dealing with things later. Third, I had to build a SOP framework. So for each role, I had to create comprehensive standard operating procedures.

These are step-by-step guides for every task that needs to be done. And I basically just filmed the Loom videos explaining exactly what I did. And what I would do is I would take the transcripts and I would summarize the transcripts and put that into a standard operating procedure.

And this allows the team members to work independently and just follow standard operating procedures, not have to rely on me for every single question that somebody brings up. The reality is, is that when team members know exactly what is expected and they have the resources to achieve it, like the agency operating system, they perform at a way higher level. So by implementing all seven steps of this framework, I've been able to build multiple seven-figure businesses that run smoothly, whether I'm there or not.

And you can do the same by following the exact roadmap. Now, let's be honest. You probably clicked on this video assuming that I was going to blow up a business as fast as I could live.

Well, I didn't do that in this video. If you click on the video on the screen, you can watch me actually start and sell a service-based offer live on camera as a challenge. And if you want to see exactly how you can apply this in real life, I will see you over there.
