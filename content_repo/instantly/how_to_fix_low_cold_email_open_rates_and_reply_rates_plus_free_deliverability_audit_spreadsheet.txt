hey guys Raul here i got back from new york four days ago now in estonia but i still have jet lag i don't know how but we made a deal with nils and reo that we're gonna put out like one content piece a week everyone so i'm here like a good soldier getting my content piece of the week and it's gonna be a good one it's deliverability audit which is gonna be super useful if you're having problems with your campaigns either you see a big drop in reply rate or a drop in open rates this is like what you want to do so first i'm going to add this link to the sheet below in the video description and open this up make a copy and then we go through it one by one so first thing you want to do is open up your instantly next to it and let's start with deck setup so this is to check if your dmark tkm spf and custom tracking domain are all set up correctly good instantly we have a nice button for this here this means it up click it it will check all your domains and for this account everything's done correctly if it's not click here for the guide and just go through that one by one make sure everything is correct make the changes you need test it again until everything is done correctly that's one of the biggest things we've noticed that just take setup hasn't been done correctly so in this case hold it done i check not and custom tracking domain for this you want to go to the settings settings here custom tracking domain here's the instruction how to do it check status verified ssl verified everything done nice check then we go on to the warm-up so first you want to check if the warm-up is on for all accounts just by this green flame icon here for these all accounts it's on check is the warm-up score over 90 percent 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 94 99 so yeah seems it's over 90 no problems with the warm-ups is the warm-up limit below 50 a day so again you want to click settings settings again scroll down to warm-up settings and you see daily warm-up limit suggested 20 you can put it higher but recommend 150 here's 20 so perfect then warm duration have the accounts warmed up at least two three weeks before you actually start sending from them in this account they have been we don't start sending before they've warmed up for two or three weeks check and then sending limits are you sending less than 30 emails a day per account so you go in here settings settings again and check daily campaign limit it's 30 emails so we recommend keeping it rather low some people are sending like 50 but this is in a case that you notice problems with your campaigns then you want to definitely lower it and add limit here so we recommend 30 it's a safe one so next up once the text setup and warm up has been checked out everything's correct there we go on to the campaigns so first part is the leads let's go to campaigns select an active one and under leads for this one we have total almost 7 000 leads and we have 200 bounces which is around average it's nothing crazy so check this if you're seeing a bigger number of bounces like over 10 or 5 you want to check your lead source and check your leads again with bulk email check and never bounce or something similar and you also might want to change the lead sources that you're using if in your case you're getting a lot of bad responses a lot of bounces just change the lead source in our case it's correct so then sequences and again to remind you this is only when you have problems with your campaigns if you're not having problems you can go wild you can test different stuff but in this case you want to make sure that we're using plain text to go sequences just regular text there's no images here you can go to your your next part are using images no check are using links no again if you're having problems remove all the links are using spin tags so if your email copy is too similar you're sending the same stuff over and over again you might run into deliverability issues so as spin tags are using personalization if you're not you might want to do it for the same reason as spin tags to make your copy more unique you don't only have to use person's first lines you can also do personization based on location based on their job position whether whatever just make it more unique are using follow-ups so again like if you're having problems and you have a lot of questions you can also do personization based on location based on location based on their job position whether whatever just make it more unique are using follow-ups so again like if you're having problems and you have like eight follow-ups in your sequences you might want to cut down in this campaign we have no follow-ups so imagine you're sending emails the first email no like nobody opens it and then you send like six eight follow-ups which all go to spam so this hurts your deliverability and we recommend cutting them down if you're seeing these issues so time window when you're sending emails out make sure the time window is nice it's not like too small and also it's not sent on like weekends you don't want to send on saturday sunday that will show you a drop in deliverability and then open tracking if you're having problems you can go to options here and then just disable open tracking but in this case we're not having problems so i'm leaving it on and then analytics if we go to analytics here here's like where you can monitor everything on a much like higher level and i recommend doing this every day so slow ramp volume this is like one of the main things even after you've done the warm-up period of two or three weeks are you sending emails like slowly are you ramping them up like in the first day two four then if the open rates and replies are good then six eight ten the next days you want to get into the habit of just checking it every day and only scaling up the numbers if your deliverability is good you don't want to start sending 30 or 50 straight away after warm-up if that account hasn't seen any cold email activity before so be very careful of this and this is like one of the biggest things we see why people are having issues this just start blasting straight away i know it's hard but you have to be a little bit more careful calm and collected and you will see much better results again sending volume is the campaign volume not exceeding 30 per account because we set it in the account level it's not exceeding that and then checking the average open rates and reply rates making sure they're healthy and i want to show you like a good example so here on 8th of august we sent almost 3000 emails and we got 1000 opens so around 30 percent so this is not ideal so after that we lowered the volume to 1800 and then 1500 so almost half of what we were sending and you can see then the open rates started rising so now on 11th of august we sent 2600 emails and 1600 were opened compared to when we sent like 3000 and 1000 was open so we got 600 more opens by sending 300 less emails so this is what you want to do as soon as you notice something the next day lower the volume and then lower it lower it keep it low until you see the open rate getting better reply rate is getting better and then you can again scale up the campaigns and getting more replies same if you look at the replies same if you look at the replies here we sent 2900 we got 37 replies here we sent 2600 we got 97 replies so it's a big difference right so this is like what you want to get in the habit of checking them every day and not letting them run with bad open rates because if you would have let this run for 3000 a day it would have again maybe burned our domains it wouldn't gotten even worse so you want to check it every day so bad campaigns if you're noticing bad open rates bad reply rates you want to pause them straight away you don't want to keep them running like i just said and then a really good habit again to get into is setting up and buying new accounts monthly so if you're getting good results and especially good instantly there's no reason why you shouldn't be getting new accounts every week every month this is going to help you scale up by adding more accounts to your instantly and your campaigns and also if you it turns out like you burn some of your old accounts and domains you have like new backup ones so always get the habit of getting new ones we're doing it all the time right now and this is the best way to scale up like if you just send more emails you're going to get more responses and more business you're going to get more closes so in this case we are doing it our campaigns are doing it our campaigns are pretty good so again copy this go through it if you have any problems and questions you can put them
