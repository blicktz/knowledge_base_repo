It's Raul and this is my world record attempt of setting up a cold email campaign from finding leads to actually launching it. Here we go. Start and go instantly.

CEOs, location, New York, industry, marketing, advertising, wait for it, load, select the first page, add the campaign, uncheck this, add some great new one, adding, adding, adding, open campaign, sequences, I'm going to check a template, lead generation, this one, use, save, options, account, down, launch, publish, done, stop. So close to sub 30 speedrun. That's pretty good, man.

That's how fast instantly is with like Lead Finder. If we go back to the campaign, ads, leads are in here. You can see verified sequences here, working, options, email account is in this account or this campaign actually is running.

So I think I'm a world record holder. See if you can beat me. If you can do it faster, let me know.
