hey guys i'm raul and if you're not getting responses to your cold emails this is a video for you i'm gonna roast three copies from you and i'm going to show you exactly my mindset how i approach copywriting how it fix them and then you can do the same for your own emails i'm also gonna leave a link down below where you can submit your own copy for next week's copy roast if you like this video please subscribe like so i can keep creating more of this content so let's get into it so the first copy let's read through it hey greetings it's a pleasure to see your commitment and interest in driving continuous improvement at company i'm salman my firm provides internationally accredited lean manufacturing and six sigma training to manufacturing and service sector personnel 2021 we train participants across 50 plus organizations including textile vendors of nike adidas walmart boomer target boss etc along with professional startup group post group in midnab etc as a result following our mentoring they have attained cumulative savings of eight hundred thousand dollars does this sound like something that could benefit you if so let me know if i can send over some time to discuss this in detail so first thing if you have checked some of my videos previously what's the first thing we see it's too long like it's way too long again so i created a video about this the biggest mistake in copywriting is that your copies are too long and i shared a tool that you can use so let's start doing this for every copy i'm just going to copy this for now and i'm going to add it to the readtime.com i'm going to leave a link down below but let's go through it and this you should check this silent reading time 27 seconds so this is way too long for the email we're coming in completely cold the people don't know anything about us we need to be on point and even like right now when i read through it like i already got tired and it's like 27 seconds so you want to get this number down to around 10 to 15 seconds max so now let's get back to the copy so the main things that i take from this is they help save a lot of money and they have insane clients so these are the key to making this copy work and we can just we just have to make it as simple as possible by using these case studies and the savings part so this is the copy that i would use hey john very impressed impressed in what you built with company so a little presentation would you be interested in potentially saving as much as it's going to save in manufacturing costs we've helped nike adidas walmart puma do exactly that mind if a cinema is a little bit more info so this is already much shorter let's now copy this into the read time and you can see nine seconds so much quicker and we start just with simple personalization you can try it without it to make it even shorter but this is the main thing we ask them would they be interested in saving like here it starts like hi greetings it's special to see i'm salman my firm so talk about you you you i'm my so remove all of this with you how we help you everybody wants to hear just about themselves so would you be interested not i can save you we have this type of here would you be interested in potential savings so here you add an exact number like the cumulative one is okay but like a specific number and also with the examples here case studies uh if you have like the textile vendors nike adidas walmart puma like use those exact target group that you're going to go after those case studies that they're going to resonate with if you're targeting textile vendors use those if you're targeting some other company use those don't use like nike for targeting car parts or whatever but i feel like this is already going to be much better going to work cleaner for you you're going to get more reads because people are just going to see it's like short okay i'm going to read and might have some more information and same here let me know if i can send over some times to discuss in detail so only again like this uh more harder call to action i don't really like right now just like mind if us in more information super easy for them to just reply like yes and more information yes like super easy if i can listen over more times like discussing detail like the in detail already for me i feel like subconsciously it's going to be always like one of these like business calls what is this i don't know like if i have time to jump on this but this might have some more information i would love to learn it okay if you can really save me hundreds of thousands of dollars in manufacturing costs like how do you do it so i really like this part all right let's go on to the second one hey i see that you are the ceo of company and that you are fairly active on linkedin how are you managing to generate new business properly managing the profile demands quite a lot of time and not everyone has that especially with a role like yours that's why i personally manage linkedin profiles for c-level executives to generate a stream of high value leads i do this successfully for companies like x and y and when i look at your profile i see great potential to realize the same result i thought out some ideas jump in a quick call kind regards mark so again what do we see it's a little bit too long so again just copy paste 26 seconds so first thing you want to make it shorter the offer is pretty simple you help make people more money get more leads from linkedin but you are talking about this in like so many different angles different ways you're gonna asking like different questions like it's just the same stuff over and over again so again we're gonna simplify it we're gonna re remove bunch of stuff and we're gonna make a soft call to action not a quick call again my name's more information so this is rosa hey john love your linkedin profile how many leads are generating from it weekly so again we ask them uh qualifying question and making them understand if they have an issue if they're not generating any leads from linkedin they're like oh that's right like i'm not doing it and then you come in because last week i helped x get 14 calls from linkedin and i'm confident to do the same for you mind if i send more information so here qualifying question about your offer that you're helping to generate them leads generate them calls and then a specific case study in their niche i helped this get its calls exactly we're not talking we can generate a stream of high value leads this uh it comes off as spammy as a little bit like scammy like oh we can skyrocket your sales the more specific and direct you can be the more trustworthy team so legit i'm just telling my best case study last week whenever at like 14 13 12 and a half as specific as you can get added here and switch up the call to mind of cinema information let's see how quickly people can read this this 11 seconds for an average person to read again much quicker you're gonna get more responses because more people are actually going to read your email all right and the third one last one hey my company has done for your service where we help skincare brands similar to yours decrease cart abandonment and increase returning customers rate using advanced email flows and automation this done correctly can add 20 to 30 percent of new revenue each month without spending a penny on paid ads or extra work on your end we take care of everything mind if i send over more details let me know thanks so first thing it looks a little bit shorter but let's add it here 18 seconds like close but we can make it even shorter a little bit better is there like look something that uh i would maybe actually took a time to read but again like reading through this first thing that i mentioned on the last copies it starts with like my my company has where we help this should all be turned around into use like how we help you nobody wants to read about you and also we can simplify this uh call to action your offer and this is like this one might have some more details that's perfect so how to shorten it so they're targeting skincare brands e-commerce store so a good generic presentation your new colleagues collection looks sick oh i love your product pages i love your product images as good as looks you're missing out on 20 of revenue which you can't follow so i'm substituting they can get 20 more revenue with loss so they're feeling oh like am i missing out like i'm losing and same here your new collection you're missing out not my company has helped like helping you so you're missing out on potential 20 revenue with your current fund mind if i send info not fix it and then i add this your part we take care of everything done for you this is like great no work near the near end cheers so super simple quick presentation we talk about them we use loss instead of like gains testing that out you can try both ways and let's copy it here 10 seconds so perfect already like just like looking at it like this doesn't look that long but if you see this you're going to read through it like it's such a low effort that you're gonna check it it's good looks you're missing out 20 driving to confirm okay like interesting like how does it work might have a sending phone how to fix it and then you have like really good like documentation mind map flow charts on some email flows some automations that you've done like uh create documents of this and then you can say it over like that is exactly what we did for this skincare brand we added these and these email flows and if you want i can show you on a quick call how we can do the same for you i can prep already some emails exactly like how we would increase your returning customers so that's pretty much like how to approach it so again main thing make it shorter like look how long these are look how short we made them same here like long long long talking about yourself switch that up talking about them as much as you can like practice this i try to take out all the wheeze and eyes and turn them into use and yours and use this tool the readtime.com it's free just copy all of your email copy in here and make sure it's 10 to 15 seconds try it out and i'm sure you're gonna get more advice so again thanks so much for listening watching if you you
