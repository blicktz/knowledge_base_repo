hey guys Raul here with another episode of cold emails hot takes and today i can't believe we actually made it happen but we have one of the let's say mount rushmore of money twitter with of ecom he has like legit empire if you haven't heard of utopia almost 4 000 entrepreneurs there and well there are like so many gurus online that like make it appear like they want to help people so just a quick story before we get started when i met you and we invited you to be an affiliate for instantly we don't allow many people in and for all affiliates we give them the affiliate commission and they can split it up however they want like they want to take it from themselves don't want to give them to the users most people just take everything for themselves but you like one of the rare ones who actually gave most of it as discounts to the users so i think that's like one of the main reasons why utopia is best like it seems like it actually care and i'm super happy happy to have you on board man thank you for having me bro hello hello everybody i just want to say first things first raul you got the dopest sunglasses in the game i picked up my first pair of sunglasses too but i know i'm lacking man i'm absolutely lacking right now these are actually from barcelona so we were talking before i hit record that like here you're in spain right now so i got them there and when i did the podcast with mason i was wearing sunglasses and that video got the best click rates most views so there's something to sunglasses even with online content creation so 100 like if you're going to do a face review like maybe start slow start with sunglasses and then take them off dude this guy has the entire road map planned out for myself i love it perfect and i know you told me like you're a little bit anonymous maybe we have to bleep some stuff out but and across your entire empire we asked this from everybody what's your current mr like poll park what kind of numbers are you bringing in right now so i never give the exact number but across of everything from the utopia my agencies all of my affiliate offers and commissions as well as my econ brands i'm doing over six figures not multiple which is over 400 but well over six figures on a monthly basis right now nice and my favorite question to like ask after that is what's the least amount of money you remember having in your bank account least amount of money is when the bank draft fees would fucking come out man oh i don't know if i'm allowed to swear but when the bank draft fees will come out and i'm minus 30 and i know if i waited a few more days it was going to go to minus 80 and i'm freaking out i had no idea what to do i called my dad my dad's like figure it out yourself i'm like damn bro but those were stressful times and looking back at it i know and the funniest part is i'm still young so i still have that same bank account under a student bank account name because they still think i'm a student in university right now it's hilarious like i feel it's the same for you like just thinking back those times like when we were struggling when we didn't have anything like that's what makes the current success like worth it if you're like born wealthy like i wouldn't say like it has the same impact right and you probably have a chip on your shoulder that's what makes you push to feel the same thing yeah and you know what it is like if if you get everything that you're praying for today would you be ready for it that's the quote that i always run with these days because i remember back in the day i'm like yo i'm so ready for 100k months i'm so ready to 50k i want to i want to make a million dollars and i would start every business with the sole intention of making a million dollars by the end of the year and i realized that that was never the case the journey that i'm on the cycle that i have in my life is all about patience and i have to stay patient i have to learn the foundations even on my last partnership when we had the 75 employees i wasn't a big equity holder that's the honest truth i did not take a lot of money home i was managing we're making millions of dollars but i wasn't taking much home to myself and i realized you know what was this is just a part of the journey for right now i have to take a step back and enjoy the fact that i'm able to to act on a vision that i'm able to lead that i'm able to generate revenue and in the future when the time comes right then i can focus on making money myself right and and i switch the mindset of um how long is it going to take me to actually start making money when i start something to okay how long will it take me to master the skills right how long will it take me to become a goat inside of the space and then the money comes yeah like that delayed gratification right that's that that's the hardest part and i was doing prep for our call and i saw somewhere like tick tocks or youtube shorts and you said you've been tweeting daily non-stop haven't missed a day since 2020. like how do you keep the consistency up like how do you still like motivate yourself to have a team doing this what's your structure to like just doing it every damn day tate says this best a man shouldn't care about happiness right am i feeling happy today or not most days i'm not happy when i wake up right i just i'm just building the actual habits that you need in your life right because something that i've realized super early is money and and actually building something that that is successful isn't a one-to-one ratio you put in one piece of work you're not getting one piece of output which is money right away you're going to be putting 100 pieces of works inside and then you might get one two three wins so when i'm on this journey right now i'm not looking for for like happiness on a daily basis i'm not looking to be motivated i have the habits that i built that i will do every single day and i've been tweeting every day since february 14th and it's unquestionable it's a non-negotiable trait in my life it has a high roi that leads to excellence in my life why would i question it why would i do anything else on my journey that avoids me from something that is going to make me money and a better individual inside of my overall life right so that's why i don't i don't i don't skip time when i'm or skip a day when i'm writing tweets i'm like i'm like 30 days ahead on my tweets right now but i was usually 90 days ahead when i started twitter bro i was so ahead with my freaking tweets i would post it on twitter hype furry was screenshot and everyone would crack up i'm like what while you guys are stressing about oh my god how many tweets am i going to write this week everything's scheduled for me i can focus on the other aspects of my business i don't not now like i don't do 90 days in advance anymore because it's kind of foolish because you need to optimize i do like 25 30 days in advance of a new strategy a new structure i see how that performs and then based off of that i add those winning tweets into my next cycle of the next 30-day tweets damn the smart like i was just uh telling my team like oh look at me i just like planned i legit just did like two or three months ahead and i was like yeah but like it turns out like i should then just like see what works best within a month and then optimize and reuse that content is that we're saying yeah basically man because the thing about any social media in general is once you have that winner and if say you're you're 90 days scheduled out you might have a winner this week but you're on week 12 now and your account's dead and you're like what's going on so now you schedule new tweets based off of that like a few weeks before and now you're always having to wait a cycle of 90 days until you actually can can find winners again right which is way too long in the space where and we got to move with speed but of course data is super important that's why i like doing it for 25 30 days so i get to actually test the waters to see if if the strategy or the angle or the tweet concept or the tweet inspiration or the structure is actually performing gotcha and like it seems like right now like everything is saying like you had it so thought out like you know legit what you're doing so when you started you told me like what was the vision then like what was the origin story and has it changed or do you still are doing the same same vision that you had vision still stays the same strategies change jeff bezos always says that and i've loved that quote i've been saying that for like six seven years now but the vision for utopia here's how it started i've been on forum since i was 14 years old i was making money online at 14 and 15 15 a flute of dominican because i was making money from stuff i read on forums so i take that knowledge from forums and i realized there's so much so much time i used to waste on it i would just struggle to scroll through because there's so much fluff and bs and too many people who who don't have the willpower to actually learn something they just want quick cash so i didn't like that so when i came on twitter i've already had years of community experience either um building my own or being a part of one i posted a screenshot on my twitter account from a snapchat from five years ago today i was building a community and a subscription-based community and a subscription e-com brand five years ago today on a mind map or like a few days ago but five years ago i posted the entire mind map on twitter i'm like i've been in the community game for so long because i know it's been the future i know if i have a community i can validate any offer i can validate any product i can help thousands of people i can have a raving fan base and all of this can help me promote whatever i want so from a monetary standpoint the vision was okay let's build an ecosystem i can acquire sasses i can acquire shopify applications and i can fix them up internally with a development team and then use my community and my audience base as a launch pad to actually help you build um all of these actual products and i can sell them boom i take one from 5k to 100k mrr sell it the next year right and now we'll have an exit lined up every single year for the next few years and then when it comes down to the aspect of the vision of the personal side of things utopia doesn't make me the most amount of money for my ecosystem and it doesn't but it takes me a lot of time because i'm passionate about it i love the aspect of creating a product that no one has ever seen before it's something that is so obvious to me that everything should be affordable that everything should be so accessible for the people that actually want to make money the people who truly have the will and i want to be their bridge towards fulfillment so utopia becomes that bridge so it's going to have every single research you'll ever need to make money online for the most affordable pricing without an upsell but on top of that without an upsell for like extra knowledge to pay for so that's the vision from the personal side and then the vision for the other side for the monetary side as an exit on a yearly basis and using this ecosystem to to build high mrr companies like allow it like i can uh feel myself like getting pumped up like when you talk about like you actually like care and you want to help people and like so far like 4 000 people already like one of the biggest paid communities like online but i'm sure like i joined yesterday it's shameful to say like i'm one of the newest utopians but you have so much content there and you said like you're into data like analyzing what works best so what are you seeing from these like 4 000 people what are the patterns for the people that actually succeed like what do they do differently than all the people that don't the thing that these guys do differently than most people don't don't is accountability right and like one thing i preach to every single team member i have every person i've ever worked with any business partner or utopian is to manage your expectations people overestimate what they can do right and in a short amount of time i manage my expectations for example with the utopia i took a six months to reach 6k mrr for example right because it wasn't a real primary focus but still it took time but my goal at that point wasn't to actually grow it mrr purpose-wise it was really to grow the value inside and by managing my expectations i knew that if my heart was into oh my god where the sales today oh my god how come this input that i just did have worked didn't lead to an output of actual results i was questioning myself every single day if i didn't manage my expectations i would have fallen victim to my emotions and i would have never actually succeeded um for for what utopia success is right now i would have never actually succeeded in any part of my life because i would be like oh today i'm just not feeling it all right so it was really about managing expectations for myself and all for the members as well when you're starting your journey you will fail it is common sense at this point like you look at the the stuff that you see on money twitter bro your account my account everyone's account we all tweet the same formula we're all tweeting the exact same um cycle of how this entire journey works this journey is cyclical you guys got to be conscious of how cyclical the journey is you started off by not understanding anything but then you have a goal you define that goal and you start defining the questions you have that are problems and barriers that are holding you back from moving forward you use those questions to visually draw out a roadmap once you have the roadmap of where you want to go then from there you can start acting on each step of those roadmaps and the beauty about utopia is i've already created the roadmaps for people they just got to act on it right so when i'm explaining this to people this is why everyone's succeeding so well it's because you manage your expectations i i tell people you won't see a result for a year bro laugh at it enjoy it love this process because if you reach the money today you will not be happy in a few years because you skip the foundational um um the base of experiences you don't have that chip on your shoulder you're not who you're supposed to be in life enjoy this become the best version of yourselves while you're making the money and you'll reach fulfillment but that's what at the end of the day fulfillment's the real goal it's not really the money got it and like i imagine you get like so many dms from this uh beginners that like join they want to see like results fast but if you would lay out like one plan i know like everybody's different but if like some dude tells me like hey wiz like if you give me a plan and i will commit to it for the next three months i want to get to 5k 10k mr like what's that one plan that you would lay for them what do they have to do every day so the plan is going to be based off of your age group in my opinion because i won't recommend a kid who's like 15 to 20 to start a marketing agency because they don't have the skill set and no big brands going to trust them if you're in that that age group go on tiktok you're on tiktok anyway starting e-commerce brand that's my recommendation i have two cousins right now i was just in canada to visit my parents after a year and i met up with some of my cousins and i took them out and two of them came back to me they're like because i disappeared they're like where the hell did you go and i came back and i'm making some cash it's been quite a few years and they're and i told them what the what the ecosystem is and they're like how can i start so we have a group chat and i'm telling them to work on an e-commerce brand so they're learning about drop shipping they're learning about creating very captivating creatives they're learning about how to get some sales how to write copy how to do copywriting just basically wearing multiple hats at once to understand the ecosystem of how an actual business is ran so you can manage your expectations again and then later on once if you don't like that route then you can take the skill sets that you learn from it and actually use that as an agency offer but if you're older 20 older than 20 years old you have a little bit of skin in the game you have some sort of experience it's so simple high income skills right what is making people money how can you can how can you make other individuals which are brand owners more money so they don't have to worry about that aspect so they can focus on a different part of their business for example i have an agency for twitter right now i'm telling these people you don't know about twitter you don't care about twitter let my team and i handle your entire twitter account strategy content strategy will tell you exactly what to tweet you focus on your business you'll never have to worry about twitter again and you'll have your leads coming in so i'm telling what you need to do is define your high income skills that make other people better results which are right now i think the most in-demand agencies will be building a community agency for people would be a content repurposing agency would be a tick tock organic agency um all these uh but would be a cro agency would be a sas anything sas related take anything agency from the e-commerce realm and build it for the sas realm that's where the money is right now i have multiple students who are doing well over 50k a month because of that in the past six months and they just started i have one guy who's at 35k a month he started four months ago because he's targeting sas right now so if you are a beginner that's over 20 master a high income skill and learn to offer this to individuals um with just to get some sort of experience where i get some reps in and then from there you can go ahead and sell it as an offer for three four thousand dollars on a monthly basis perfect so like the teaching side you have down but there must be some other like utopia for you like some mastermind courses where you're in like what sources are you using to learn to get better every day raul do you remember when i our second conversation that you and i had yeah on twitter and i asked you i asked you a question right i asked you i'm you're you're a kid with a couple thousand followers at that point you're probably doing 10k mr you're not doing anything wild or crazy or probably 30k whatever it was right there's nothing where you are right now respectfully right you right now you're you're a titan in the game right on the side of twitter um and when i what the question i asked you is what are you doing right now to boost your mr right i i am forever going to stay curious i i'm a kid i will always ask people questions i will call people up i will ask for their opinion for example right now i'm learning about real estate so what i did is i booked a call with cali crates and deals and coins from twitter both two separate guys huge inside the real estate space i offered them some value they offered me some value i think that's the best part about having your own leverage is i'm able to use my leverage and exchange value to these individuals and we exchange value back and forth but that's my easiest way of learning anything right because i i only have so much knowledge in my paradigm and my thought bubble right now but whenever i need to expand i don't like reading books i despise books i don't listen to any podcasts like rarely really ever the only one i'm listening to right now is probably um like like factually would be um one with andrew schultz and mr beast anything with mr beast because he's on my journey right now because i need youtube right but the real the real truth is i'm always speaking to people who are doing better than me or the same amount or even beginners who can give me some sort of feedback and i'm just asking as many effing questions as possible like it uh it seems so simple right like so easy just reaching out to the person that has the piece that you're focusing right now so i feel like that's what most people like do wrong or even like when you take on board like partners or investors like not taking somebody just because you need somebody but very specific skills like with instantly when we needed like fixed churn we reach out all the churn experts so i think that's the best way to go about it and especially for beginners like if you're learning something if you're doing like let's say cold email like it has so many pieces take it like step by step don't start thinking about like what's in the future take it right now like what's happening what you need i think that's that simplest way and yeah for example like prime example of that is like mr beast for example i'm listening to his podcast and he's talking about he buried himself in a coffin for 50 hours and it was his most viral video and that specific video was very scary so what he did is he literally just called up david blaine on the spot he's like hey how the hell did you do it for an entire week and he just got a consultant right that's the that's the power of building your own dream team network right i have people who are experts multiple people in every single avenue that i want to excel in right because i know what i want to do in five years i know where i want to be in five years and every single aspect of those i have basically consultants or friends i can go to to ask for advice and vice versa anything anyone has ever needed from me i will always be able to be an open book and give back as much as possible so it's building a dream team of collective progression gotcha and like bro i gotta ask like usually when i do this podcast i'm like looking at the person right now i'm looking at you're like azuki nft so like what's the pros and cons of being like a faceless dude online like do you like it i saw you're gonna do a face reveal at some point what are your like thoughts about that so like i'm barely anonymous like hundreds of people probably by this point know who i am right like after this call if you want to break my status it doesn't matter right so many people know who i am and it's exciting right um like for example chase diamond obviously because he's a business partner nick shackleford a lot of these fun guys i've break broken my anonymous status too immediately the only reason i do it on twitter is a mystique right now you have no idea who i am i i am i have a halo effect over over my head right now whoever you think i am whatever you think i look like that is me and i let that be right but i'll go to events right i'll meet utopians whenever i want right i'll go i'm going to be going to multiple events over here in spain as well too and i'll break the anonymous status but respectfully just i want to i want to stay behind the scenes because i don't want my myself to be out there for forever i like being behind the scenes right although i i enjoy leading i enjoy teaching i want to be able to to lead my team alone and then have my team actually be able to spread the message around the world because right now this is just not scalable right just having myself over and over again while running the companies it's just more of a headache for me if anything so that i i really enjoy the mystique aspect but the cons is a lot of people won't invite me on podcasts for example a lot of people won't do partnership deals with me a lot of people won't do sponsorship or collaborations deals with me even though i'm i'm by far probably one of the largest e-commerce related accounts and marketing related accounts on this side of twitter i guess one one caveat is it's twitter and number two it's i'm anonymous like for me like i wish they did something similar like sometimes it just feels like being behind the scenes a little bit better uh like being anonymous you can pretty much like right now maybe you've like broken it like some people know about it so like who's like that people don't know about me i had a fucking like a poem account on instagram and i don't know why like just the creative side of myself and it anonymously i posted so much it actually got popular in estonia and then i started i couldn't hold it in i started telling people about it and as soon as i did that i stopped posting because like now people know who i was and i got the feedback but that's the hard part because there's an extra lens on it now what is this person gonna think would this affect that individual whatever the hell it is right it becomes a real big pain um yeah i totally understand but someone who's done an exceptional exceptional job at um reclaiming his anonymity was saswiz saswiz i don't know if you know him he's a good friend of mine um he has multiple he has multiple sasses on this side of twitter he's built quite a few things but his first few thousand followers were i believe he was not anonymous and now he is same with um charles miller i don't know if you remember charles miller writing to riches he was not anonymous then he was anonymous then not anonymous etc etc and he has like 100 plus thousand followers so there's a few of these guys who just rebrand rebranding is always fun right rebranding always is a nice pattern interrupt for socials people are like what's going on people are curious people stir up drama and at the end of the day drama is is what gets more people to talk about you when there's more people talking about you you're you're the center of attention and more sales and more growth so like all these channels that you mentioned like on twitter and i mentioned like you're now focusing more on youtube i think it's like a good way to end it if you like share some love and just tell people like some three two twitter youtube accounts they should follow something that you're getting value from and you think people might also enjoy from you so social media accounts that you think i enjoy right now um that i'm actually reading on a daily basis i'll be honest bro i i spent like for example i have no social media apps i just recently redownload instagram right so i don't really have anything there youtube i'm rarely ever on youtube as well too i've downloaded videos that i re-watch i'm re-watching steve jobs's lost interview everyone's watched that amazing piece where he talks about vision and this is applicable for everyone's step of their journey either a veteran or a beginner because you understand what your vision truly is and how he saw the future as well as how he led his team and the other one right now is i'm watching mr beast at the end of the day content is king evergreen content is more important than short form in my opinion i know everyone is hyping up short form but short form isn't converting right i know people right now who have a quarter million subscribers because of shorts on youtube but it's not really converting for them right you got to figure out a way to create long form content that is exceptional that is forever going to last on the internet that will forever bring in revenue towards your specific offers and skill that horizontally across as many platforms as possible blog sites um youtube channels etc etc and you're going to take all of those and and you can learn about it from mr beast you can learn about it from my account um and then just yeah that's basically then follow a few accounts that i follow on twitter go to my following list follow raul of course absolutely you guys don't miss out on that and then just check out the utopia but i'm not really looking at any books youtube channels or realistically twitter accounts like my hour on twitter right now is probably like 15 20 minutes every single day and that makes sense like you're focused on that like more important stuff and like just from our talk right now like the main insight that i cut out of it is like everything you're doing is long term like you have a legit vision you're planning ahead same thing like with the content with evergreen stuff you're not just creating something that works for right now it's made you do it once and it stays there and brings in actual conversion not just views and i think this is a good place to end it it's quick short and i know like most people like know where to find you but you can just let people know where they can find you best places to get in touch if they want to so yeah absolutely so twitter account whiz of ecom and the utopia the io that is it everything you will ever need to reach out to me like i don't do consulting calls or anything right i don't have any any program after this that's going to upsell you or for anything i don't care for at all right all i care about is if you need help and you're willing to put in the work just hit me up and i'll and i'll dm back perfect and for me thanks so much for being on the call and uh don't get pulled over by the cops again bro yeah that was crazy man thank you so much brother you're absolutely amazing okay you too see ya take it easy
