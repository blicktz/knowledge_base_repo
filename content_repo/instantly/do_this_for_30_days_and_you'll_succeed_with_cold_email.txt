hey guys raul here and in this video i'm gonna go through something super important that i see over and over again asked every day in our kolyma group asked every day on twitter and i just want to squash it once and for all before we get started like and subscribe you already know and let's get into it so it's actually super simple but it doesn't mean that's like easy but i'm going to try to explain it in a way that you guys understand okay like i need to do this so what you should stop doing when you're starting up is stop overthinking there are so many different options you can do so what you need to do is you need to pick one route and stick with it there is no one truth in cold emailing or in life like there's so many different options it's all relative it's all based on current trends that is based on people's experience you just need to pick one route and stick with it it's going to make your life so much easier and you're going to be more productive because you're not trying to think oh like maybe i should do this maybe i should do that no just like pick one pick one course to follow for example instant accelerator you're just going instantly we are accelerator we have everything you need in here how to pick an ish how to do the setup how to find leads copywriting campaigns optimization sales you've got to start here we have our limits exactly how many domains per workspace how many email accounts warm-up limits sending limits results and these are going to differ between different courses but what you should do is not get all the courses just get one i recommend instantly one for obvious reasons but it's actually good like it helps people like you should just follow this if you're starting out don't jump all over the place if you see somebody else making something new you can keep an eye on it but first if you're starting out commit to 30 days with the exact roadmap laid out for you we've done the hard work we've sent so many thousands of thousands of emails we've done the hard work we know what works for most people start with that you're going to get the experience you're going to get the courage you're going to see how easy it actually we're just sending emails and then you can start building on top of that innovating coming up with your own stuff pick one niche i see a lot of people i'm doing this right now but i'm thinking this and maybe i want to try that i saw this my friend is having success with that stick with one niche in the beginning even if it's not going to work you're going to learn so much about cold emailing pick one niche stick with it same with an offer if you're doing seo if you're doing email if you're doing lead generation just take one offer research it get really good at it ideally you want to have experience with it already just one niche one offer stick with them get really good at explaining this if you work with one offer for a long enough period you're going to become an expert you're going to know the ins and outs and that's going to help you coming up with a copy that's going to help you with optimizations that's going to help you turn more positive leads into actually booked calls it's going to also be close so stick with one offer get to be as much of an expert as you can on top of it and then pick one email service provider so again we see this time and time again should i take workspace should i take soho should i use something third just pick one like if you have the money go google workspace if you want a cheaper option go soho don't try to over complicate it don't try to get everything don't try to read and ask people about it just pick one it doesn't matter just pick one i would be so proud of you would just pick one instead of asking me like which one is better just like action action action action pick one cold email template we have so many options in here there's not going to be like a perfect fun for you usually sometimes we have but we have the copywriting masterclass here and if you go to campaigns if you go into a sequence inside the sequence you can actually find hundreds of templates if open this one here let me see templates and see hundreds of templates for each generation influencer marketing growth agency follow-ups tick tock agency content marketing we have so many templates and already maybe this is like our fault we're going to give you too many options but it's on you to select one don't spend hours on this it's different seo agency try one and edit it for your business just start with one pick one template start sending out emails once you've sent hundreds of emails and you don't get a response then select another one but just pick one to get started stick with it and then once you start getting replies send 2500 emails if you get closes perfect then scale if no closes pick a new niche and offer and go again and you would have to do it until you find something that works that's like how it is you just go back into instant accelerator niche and offer you read our mission of a masterclass you can operate a different offer maybe while you were working on the first one you got some ideas but you don't switch halfway you commit you try to do it you send 2500 emails if it doesn't work then you go back you select a different niche you select maybe something that you see might be easier for you only then you do that but you have to commit for 30 days to one course one structure so you can google if you don't want to use like instantly of course there's like so many out there just stick with one and it's going to make your life more easier you're going to take more action and you're going to get more responses the main thing is you just want to start sending you want to remove the overthinking because there are so many different things like even if we look at the accelerator and the setup part all like spf tmart tkim there's like so much stuff going on like hundreds of little pieces so we need to do everything we can to take those away and just give you something just follow one structure pick one niche pick one offer one email search provider one colon email template and just start sending emails once you've done it for 30 days you've built up some muscle memory some experience then start innovating experimenting trying new stuff so i think this is like the most important thing that i can give you guys hope it helped quick nice video super important like subscribe and i'll see you next one cheers
