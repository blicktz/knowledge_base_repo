let's take a look at how to set up calendly or any calendar tool that you have so a good calendar page should have picture of your face smiling you want to have actually your picture people love people they don't want to talk with companies just show yourself however you are your logo small intro multiple days time to select from don't be don't have two little days or hours in the day available you want to give them a bunch of options and a short period of time as applicable don't send 60 minute links if you just do a 15-minute discovery or qualification call first the first goal should be simple and easy as possible for a prospect you don't want to scare them away with an official super like long call this is just to see if this actually fit if you can actually help them if you like working together so just 15 30 minutes max for the first one usually you can do it even even shorter then have qualification questions so honestly ask questions you need to know before you can prescribe them a solution you need to be 100 that you can help them 100 that they have the budget to work with you and 100 that they want to start right now not in six months and 100 that all the decision makers are on a call if you're doing a demo but keep the questions to a minimum and only ask the most important questions that will help you prepare for a call so for example for our leaching agency here's the questions we had is your business focused on b2b sales because we only help b2b if it's b2c we can't really help them how ready are you to scale your company if you had as much demand as possible so you want to see if they're ready to scale right now if they are good perfect if they want to do it later it makes sense not to do to the call right now and assuming we can help you internet budget are you able to invest around 5k to get started so this was around the main price point that we had just to see if they have the money so yes definitely they have the budget not right now and then anything else that you'd like to know before the meeting this is the bare minimum that i would ask and just to get that understanding what to do maybe you should add their website so you can check out the website as well before the call but this is going to help you once you get the meetings in check these questions and if like all of them are wrong don't jump on the call maybe in the beginning if you want to get good at this even jump on a call with this like a little bit worse leads just to get your hang of it just to get it out of your system but later you definitely don't want to work on these leads because people underestimate the opportunity cost that is lost when you work with unqualified prospects if you work with a prospect that's not qualified you're not just losing 30 minutes of your time you're losing 30 minutes that could have gone into an actual good prospect so it's like instead of going up the hill they're actually going down down home so don't do it and then set up reminders notifications at least two 24 hours before a call and one hour before the call this increases job rates and send relevant assets inside the confirmation emails you can send case studies insights blog posts videos anything you send that makes sense to the prospect that's relevant to your offer it's gonna do some of the heavy lifting it's gonna do some of the sales for you because you don't have to explain it on the call that much it already looked at the video to the blog post about your offer the other side a little bit more and then just set up a zoom integration or whatever you're using for your video calls and you're ready to go
