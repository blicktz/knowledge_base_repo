Hey guys, if you're struggling to come up with copy ideas or you're not getting replies to your emails right now, I'm going to show you a super simple way how you will never run out of copy ideas. So let's get started and if you like it please like subscribe and we can keep creating more this kind of content. So first off I did this random niche selection so I'm going to do it completely randomly seeing what niche we get.

I put down the most like regular ones SEO, recruiting, consulting, coaching, TikTok ads, influencer marketing, lead generation. It works with every niche. I'm just going to show a couple of examples so let's select or see what we get.

Okay coaching it's a pretty broad niche and again it doesn't even matter like what kind of coaching you do if you're teaching something if you have a course here's how I would go on about it. So the hardest part I think is to open a blank document and start writing. For me it's very hard sometimes you can't do it like if I start writing to a specific person but for email campaigns what I do is first go into instantly and in the sequences section click this button templates and we have hundreds of templates already we're adding more every month but this is what you should be getting into the habit of every morning when you start your campaigns to a quick 15 30 minute copywriting session in our lead generation agency and for instantly we tried and we're trying new campaigns every day because no campaign is going to last forever everything's going to stop working so in the end you need to get in the habit of always having ways to create new copy new angles so we have our coaching offer and you can see we have different niches already here like lead generation video production marketing advertising coaching so the first step would be just use the coaching let's let's read quickly through hey i'm with we help this this niche it's a sales training then you draw out to keep people i want to learn it's okay it's a live coaching your linkedin profile was impressive i want to reach out directly so i'm in the coaching space as well using my coaching hundreds of high achievers like yourself we actually use this in our lead generation agency this is a little bit long for me business coaching so i like this looks clean looks simple let's uh let's click use template so hey first name your linkedin profile was impressive and i want to reach out directly so i would start off by using just this you don't even have to go uh full personalized in the beginning if it doesn't work you can just change change out this uh part this sentence next so help this i would enter let's say if i have big ceos i would have as specific niche as possible let's say exhaust for the business to 100 million evaluations 100 senior executives breakthrough and now i'm looking for eight more people do the same so again this we actually used this template in our leeching agency for a client and they had a pretty unique offer where they put together like eight to ten people from different niches in like a cohort group where they start teaching them and i feel this adds a lot more uniqueness to your email it says just like i'll help hundreds of senior executives break through and it's very specific and now i'm looking for eight more people do the same and right now it's february let's say do the same in march we know it's like coming up it's seasonal it's right now so adding these kind of small resonating variables inside your email will help and i'd love to share a couple of great stories as far as you're free to steal are you free anytime for a quick chat so again we use this are you free a lot don't really like using this anymore so what i would do is i would change the call to action mind if i share um remind if i send over a link for example if you have if you have a link or mind if i just share more info i pick it one best and then i'm going to add your name and then i'll just add a link for the first one yeah that's pretty much like first one don't overthink it doesn't have to be perfect you don't even have to go into the follow-ups just save let's add a subject line again super simple just start with a quick question save we have our first email super quick and imagine like if i wasn't like blabbering talking about it it would be even faster so let's say now we want to add a follow-up add step and again i would go into templates and we have bunch of follow-ups if we go to let's see here we scroll down full ups so you can see we have so many different ones we just go through quick and easy maybe this one it's like quite used but again let's just like the goal should be to move fast test a lot of things maybe it works maybe it doesn't only one wonder why not find out use template boom we have our second step i would add this let's say three days after the first one and then let's add a third one again i click templates scroll down to the follow-ups let's see another ones yeah this is a really good one just following up here as one of our other clients is about to close with 53k ticket as a result of these past few weeks we'll have to do something similar to you so we're using a case study so be honest on this case that if you have something remember we were targeting sauce ceos and let's say we just got the really good case study or it's a previous case study we can just like use it here just following up here as one of our let's say one of our sauce clients is about to close 50k enterprise steel as a result of our work pass fees would love to do similar to or would love to show you how we did it again mind if i send more info so this one you can see i'm just like on the fly just changing it up a little bit for my offer and save boom and we have a three step sequence for coaching client and this was like quicker and easier because we already had very specific templates like the coaching one that we already had here and we just use it change it with whatever is my case studies whatever i have achieved you can just fill it in but it's that's pretty much it is it's just like piecing together all the information and plugging them into the templates you like so let's do another one let's actually delete this start from zero let's take the first one delete this let's roll the wheel again let's see what we get now and then i'm going to do something a little bit different okay literation this is actually good i have a lot of experience with this so let's close it and because we started as a leasing agency you can see we have tons of leasing templates but let's say you're in a niche that's not in here we're going to use a completely different one i'm not even looking i'm just going to take a random one and then turning it into a literation agency one so this is a good skill to get into and just you can try let's take something yeah let's take a seo agency for a literation this one let's take and this one use template so how are you currently managing your seo program so this is the keyword right and i will just now switch it for each generation for example how are you currently getting leads for their company and then is the backlinks increase content or mix up to two so here again let's change it for lead generation to be like are you using eight channels organic and cold outreach i'm asking because we're business because we've been helping businesses like yours to get found online so again i would change this be like yours to yeah be like yours to get five to ten qualified meetings weekly ultimately driving let's say old outreach revenue i wouldn't actually like new levels don't really like that okay meetings and helping you grow with cool updates looks super simple taking out the buzzwords these are very personal uh a good strategy for copywriting in general is if you're not funny don't try to be funny like just be yourself uh what you resonate with for example like i took out the buzzwords like just for me personally i don't like them but if you like it uh people in your niche are using a lot of these just be yourself that's easiest way like don't try to push to be something that you're not in copywriting it's it's gonna like make more friction it's gonna be harder for yourself and would you be interested in learning more pretty simple so hey how are you currently getting leads for a company i would maybe even like remove this don't need them actually i'm asking because you can help be like yours to get 510 qualified means weekly and helping you and helping them with cold outreach would you be interested in learning more so super simple let's say let's do another test uh with a random one so this is actually pretty easy because it's like simple let's say something more random let's take let's skip the agencies let's see if we have like a recruiting a recruiting firm let's see follow-ups email one yeah let's take like this one new template the first name will be in there we'll hire somebody but there's a problem it sounds specific skills can't find it anywhere with static solution we match your company with the best fit talent for less money than area status in the market we do this by combining our unmatched niche samples and unique monitoring technology open learning more it's okay this is very different from leech anderson agency so how do we make it better so first and i just like clean um um maybe i like i would completely delete this and add something specific a question do you need someone with uh uh like a random one i haven't used it maybe it works and then we can do a lot of changes here with let's see here the company with our lead gen solution we match your company with the best fit let's see clients so we're doing pretty much simply recruiting firm helps companies find the perfect talent for them lead chain agency helps companies find the perfect customers for them so that's going to be switching up this your lead gen solution match your company with the best fit clients for less money and time than any other lead gen agency on the market we do this by combining let's say our custom software plus what else can be so let's say like with instantly we have for us instant list uh customer we do this by combining our custom software and eight year x experience in finish let's say we're targeting saas again eight year experience in saas space okay another email done like we started with recruiting template we turn it into lead generation template and there's like random random one completely blindly taken but you get the point you can pretty much turn any email any email into your offer it just change out the most important variables in there and you can do the same with follow-ups so get into the habit of this if you're struggling just go here open templates first check if we have something specifically for you if we don't just go through and read them see something that resonates with you what you like use template put in your information and you're good to go and the second part that a lot of people using instantly aren't using as much as they should is if you go into instant accelerator copywriting copywriting master class so let me take my video and if we go here so we have 25 strategies here that you can use if you want to do it just yourself by the start one sentence email using research angle we have examples here you can copy them so we have 25 different angles you can test from here and then we have 24 more strategies so we have like 50 other completely new strategies to test and you can do the same thing let's uh maybe let's do a quick one i like the first one i always recommend people trying this so one one sentence email let's say you did a template so now what i would do is i would go back into a campaign let's take the campaign we had here so this one how we're getting leads from company and now i'm going to use the strategy from the instant accelerator turning it into one sentence so how do we do it let's say so yeah we can remove this one but this is the key right and we take this one away okay would you like to see how we we let's see how we got the number you actually did quality meetings further instantly okay and how we can do the same for you like even this one it's like test it out try it you'd be surprised of this like one sentence emails and you can make it much better but yeah like slim let me know is maybe like uh you can count it as a sentence but yeah you get the point super short straight to point hey would you like to see how we got 17 minutes last week for instantly and now we can do the same for you let me know save try it out and then i go back again to the accelerator check what other strategy were there take a template take my current campaigns duplicate them change them up and and just get in the habit of just putting them together editing and that's all it is i never know what's gonna work i just try different angles i go through templates and then like something clicks sometimes i'm like oh this is a really good angle or if i receive emails i look what people are sending me and what catches my interest and there's copy paste in here take out their company and niche specific phrases substitute them for mine and testament try them so template section here and then the accelerator and you guys are going to have so many different ways to test so hopefully this was helpful and i went on much longer than i expected but please like please subscribe and i'll see you on the next one cheers
