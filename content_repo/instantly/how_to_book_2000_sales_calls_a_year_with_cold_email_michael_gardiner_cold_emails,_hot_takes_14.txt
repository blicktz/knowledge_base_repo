welcome to another episode of cold emails and hot takes today i have michael on the pod michael great to have you on how are you doing yeah absolutely man i'm really excited to be here and to talk to you today so i'm doing great thanks again for having me on okay great yeah for the viewers listening michael is the founder of b2b outbound and dfy meetings and he's booked well over 2 000 meetings between himself and his clients this year so i'm sure he's going to drop some uh some good nuggets and value today on the podcast and uh yeah michael you're ready to reveal a couple of cold outreach uh secrets let's do it all right great uh yeah before we jump into the cold email tactics i want to take a step back and look a little bit at the bigger picture um because on twitter the other day you mentioned that and a quote your agency will grow in accordance to how badly people want your offer so let's talk about offers how do you create an offer that people actually want yeah sure and i think this is one thing that a lot of people get wrong when they're starting out or they think that you know they need just a perfect copy and deliverability to be perfect and everything to be perfect in reality if you have an offer people don't want or is incredibly competitive you can make it work but it's really forceful like our best clients have unique offers and our copy is nothing crazy for them it's just people want to offer and um going into offer creation i'm sure you've seen this the thing i see that hurts people the most is saturated markets and the way i think a lot of markets get saturated talking to your audience series i think a lot of them are going to be kind of younger entrepreneurs you know maybe in their 20s right so you have a lot of people take the same paths they go through the same courses same youtube videos and these videos suggest things like lead generation for realtors or facebook ads for e-commerce and what happens is you have so many people competing on the same thing following the same paths and although the documentation on what to do next is easy the fact that that's so easily available just creates insane competition so that's kind of the idea first idea um that i consider when it comes to offer creation and when i look at our best clients the thing they have is an offer people want but also an offer that has healthy barrier to entry it's you the best offers look at our clients are not in a a to z step course or at least not in every a to z course and they're also not super clearly defined online and i think that's kind of an interesting concept okay so creating unique offers that also have some type of barrier to entry uh for people yeah yeah exactly and the level of barrier to entry can vary but just having some is so healthy i mean look at like a facebook ads agency for e-commerce i'm sure you've seen that super competitive lots people are doing because there's a lot of great information on it so when you're first starting out you don't know but it's super competitive and you know there's a guide on how to do cold email for e-commerce facebook ads and how to hire media buyers but you're also competing against a whole massive amount of beginners where for example let's say if we talk about facebook ads for b2b businesses there's probably not as many courses on how to start an agency doing facebook ads for b2b businesses or as many tutorials on how to do it like that slight barrier to entry just under being less educational resources and blueprints means alone there's gonna be less competition outreach and you know you go a step farther and there's some services that are kind of tricky to figure out um so the bigger the barrier to entry the less competition and if you combine that with an offer that people really want which that's best found out by testing and validating interest uh you can be on to a real winner okay great yeah it's definitely something people should keep in mind as they they do the do their cold emailing right and no deliverability tactic really helps if your offer is is not uh doesn't have the product market fit or there's just too many people doing it and uh all right yeah let's let's do a couple rapid fire questions and after that we'll jump into some more uh open-ended uh topics uh just are you ready for for a couple rapid fire cold email questions yes i am all right great and uh what what are your favorite b2b data sources okay so where we're getting contacts from yeah cool so one thing we like to do is when we get our data we like to focus really heavily on segmentation so rather than personalizing to every single prospect we like to get people in groups so you know we use tools like store leads d7 lead finders snob hunter sales kill poly but beyond the actual tool to get data we like to group people into boxes that make them similar for example for targeting let's say marketing agencies for targeting marketing agencies we find all of them on one directory in one category and we can reference in a personalized line for category and the fact we found on a directory or all of them in one location where you can reference that they're all in one location so i can do a personalized line around the location so um you know where we find people we just look for where can we find them in a box like altogether similar this is often directories or like a blog post of top 100 marketing agencies for say tick tock ads or you know uh guests of a podcast even you know someone wanted to target people who were cold email specialists they could scrape everyone who's been on your podcast cold email them and the first line could be i listened to your podcast and i really found your interview inspiring blah blah blah pitch you know so we look at what similarities can we find when we're list building okay great yeah and with the list building something that i learned from you like don't hesitate to just hire somebody to do it manually right nothing and not everything has to be like 100 automated you can just get a va and you know check out those directories check out the blog post check check check that out and they add the leads manually um that's a that's a big one and then it's also highly relevant right like you said like yeah down to them in the first line it'll pique their interest doesn't look spammy absolutely yeah what do you assume what are you some of your favorite cold email subject lines so i think subject line is something that's like way over thought because it's it's more like if you're gonna get a low open rate it's probably your deliverability um so it's taking that out of the picture here so if your deliverability is good for subject lines there's two things we don't want to do uh one of them is make it sound like a newsletter so not conversational like it's not like a newsletter we don't want to do that also misleading subject lines i see these quite often like i just bought your product or problem with company name like don't want to be misleading my favorite ones are really basic just company name just first name idea for company um partnership opportunity for company your name x their name really simple stuff one thing we do it's a little bit different is we'll put like three or four spaces in front of a subject line so in certain email platforms you have all your subject lines in a row and yours stands out a little bit so we keep it pretty simple okay nice that's a that's a nice little hack there with the with the spacing so it stands out more that's a cool one um what's your favorite call to action in a cool cold email yeah so for call to action um when we run campaigns for clients right we're optimizing for book calls so um we focus on getting calls booked however um if you're someone who's just starting out and you have a lot of time video audits are a great way to get on calls right it's it's going to convert better it's just loses scalability at some point so if you're just starting out um offering a video audit or some type of audit in general will do quite well but obviously that breaks that scale um so we just do really basic stuff like is this something you'd be interested in talking about um if you're interested i'll set up a time to talk are you available talk thursday so just really simple call to actions because if offer something they want they're naturally going to be interested and one other thing we do is we never put like if you're interested book on my calendar here but what we will do is we make the calendar link part of the email signature and if someone's really interested we're just going to see that link and they're going to book on it without you being pushy great what's your favorite type of follow-up messaging or just follow-up messaging in general yeah so if we're targeting companies that are a little bit larger so let's say 50 plus employees which most of our clients are um email two is normally going to be asking for an appropriate contact at a company so rather than just the normal butt message like who is this appropriate for because especially if you're targeting employees within a company not owners if it's not their business and not something that they're paid to do they often won't answer but if you ask them who's in charge of this they'll give you a referral when you can message that referral and say hey jen told me to email you and it comes off a little bit warmer and it does really well um we normally only do about four emails long um sequences because we prefer to do more prospects and fewer follow-ups unless somebody has a really small total addressable market in that case we'll do more follow-ups we're trying to maximize every prospect um email three case study if you have it um if not like really great resource email four we normally do another case study we mentioned it's a final email on that one we normally link um a calendar link is like a cult actually if you do want to talk the links here okay great uh so done with the rapid fire questions let's move into some more open uh open-ended questions what would you say are some beginner mistakes when doing cold outreach on and scaling an agency what do you what kind of things do you see people doing wrong out there the number one thing coming back to offers is they think there's an issue with their copy or some magical trick for missing when people just don't want their offer so that it's not when to give up but it's when to switch what you're doing and also from the first point having that reference point that you can't be exactly the same as everyone else for example i'm gonna take i'm gonna pick on facebook ads for e-commerce i'm sure you've seen this too people have the same funnels the same offer the same guarantee the same copy same positioning targeting the same people right so um that the offer is really the main thing i mean in terms of beginner mistakes a lot of times people don't reach out to enough people they think they can reach out to 500 people a month or you know i often see like silly issues of like deliverability um but beyond all that it's just do people want your offer okay got it so let's say someone you know has their offer dialed in they know they have product market fit they're more like in their intermediate stage what are some of the mistakes that intermediate people do when doing cold outreach cold email specifically a lot of it i see is obsessing over perfection as opposed to volume so it's always unique for each business for example if you're somebody who has a massive market reach out to let's say 30 40 000 people i see a lot of people worried about getting their booked meeting rate from say one out of 150 to one of 100 where that difficulty of doing that is much more than just doubling the amount of people you reach out to so i think a lot of times it comes down to volume um because if you have something that's already working you probably know the basic terms of like focus on the prospect not for yourself pitch the meeting not to service relevant case studies um for past the basics i think a lot of people get obsessed on the stats and you also want to have proper tracking right like we know roughly what it costs us to get a client from cold email and we know our lifetime value so those two numbers in mind it makes it really easy to make decisions on what volume we need to hit to hit our financial goals and also how to make sure we're profitable okay got it and one what would you say is the best way to turn a positive reply into a meeting so someone when someone raises their hand says hey i'm interested you know how do you turn them into a booked meeting what's your inbox management process uh what does that look like yeah sure so on a tech side we use close close is great because you can trap people through different stages um it's really simple to use and um in terms of appointment setting some of the things i see people do wrong that i would recommend changing is one of them is i see people putting a lot of effort into their copy but not for appointment setting we do entirely personalized appointment setting we have guidelines we follow but your appointment setting should be completely personalized i mean one of the main things is energy matching i see a lot of people they respond with thank you for your reply here's link to my calendar let's talk it's like no if your prospect's sending you exclamation marks smiley faces so excited match that if they're talking very formal business tone match that some energy matching is huge um another thing i see is when people ask questions i see a lot of times those questions being avoided by sending a calendar like i'll tell you on the call it doesn't convert in really complex industries or uh it's a complex like bigger businesses like ask the questions they answer um don't always just push for the call right away it's okay to have a conversation and um the third thing i would say is we found that saying like book on my calendar kind of a turn off to people as opposed to saying like you know do you have a calendar i can book on um or would you like to schedule time manually and then maybe as a ps like ps if it's easier you can also book online so we're like very gentle and polite with scheduling the call as opposed to being pushy towards the calendar okay interesting so give them the free options inside of that email manual uh book on them on their meeting meeting link they can book on your link okay great and uh so how do you personally talk a little bit more about the personalization in the appointment setting how do you personalize that approach like i definitely agree like people should put more effort into replying to those leads but how do you personalize that message or what do you do there yeah sure so one thing we'll do is completely personalized lines the ps so if you told me you know i was interested you're interested in my cool email search i'd say uh thanks for the reply really happy to hear uh hear from you i think based off working of companies like x y and z your prospects you reach out to are gonna be really impressed and excited to talk to you um do you have a calendar i can book on or if not feel free to let me know a time that works for you or check out my calendar for availability um ps love the last tweet reference tweet so we have like a personalization right for example about like why this is going to work for them hitting on ego a little bit like you've worked with great companies and then we have a ps show we did a little bit of research you know you're only going to have so many positive responses you want to put as much energy into them as you can and um beyond that it's follow-ups too like we follow up um respectfully but relentlessly okay great what do those follow-ups look like once you know someone someone's interested i imagine they're a little bit different than the the cold follow-ups um how do you bump that message up yeah so one thing i would say not to do is just to keep doing the bump bump can we talk can we talk can we talk can we talk so uh the first one we do is something like hey is this still something you're interested in talking about and normally say like hey is getting more sales calls on the calendar so something you're interested in talking about um we'll also personalize around holidays like for example you know we're going thanksgiving tomorrow and someone replied hey sure you're busy with the family it's thanksgiving would it be better to loop around next week so we'll reference a holiday um if we have a case study that's very similar to our business at some point might fall up and say hey um i know we haven't spoken in a while however we just had great results of a company really similar their name is company name we're able to do this for them because of xyz specific elements of your business i think the same would work opposed to talking so like again personalizing there um even down to like youtube videos if they have a new youtube video that matches them we'll include a youtube video um in addition to this i'm always adding them on linkedin adding them on twitter liking their content on instagram like um not messaging them on every platform please talk to me but rather just trying to get them to follow me back because i'm posting content and the content will nurture them okay interesting one i haven't heard that before yeah like also adding them on the on the socials and kind of engaging with the content staying top of mind and uh yeah that's a great one awesome and so once you have them uh you know you get them to book the meeting and they're on your calendar how you go from meeting to turning them into a client what does that process look like can you give some some pointers yeah absolutely so i am not a sales coach so the advice i'm going to give here is going to be less on like sales tactics more on how do you manage that contact because there's i i'm just i'm not the best at explaining sales it's good at sales i'm not going to explain it so some things we do outside of like specific sales tactics one of them is before your call we want to send them an email um like to make sure we're going to show up so like a follow-up email to make sure we're going to show up increasing the reply rate what we normally do is we do is tastefully we send them an email it's like hey super excited for our call today add a little bit of personalization um by the way if you want to check out before our time here's some case studies and here's a couple youtube videos i think you might enjoy so we're building trust we're reminding you on the meeting and also adding personalization we also do some text so if we have a prospect who i'm extremely excited about like a really great one i'll send a personalized text message beforehand um if it's just a normal prospect we have an automatic text sequence if it sends some youtube videos sends them testimonials and just tries to build some of that confidence before recall so that's going to increase your show up rate and also then confidence on the call higher confidence on the call for them a few easier to close higher show up rate more deals potentially to close and then after the call i think a lot of people this is a really funny thing that we've seen um it's they send their proposal over email but they don't consider that the proposal has so many spam orders and they're using their company email that's on outreach email that's not warmed up and it goes to spam the proposal so we use a warmed up email warmed up and instantly to send our proposals through and we also um do really unique proposals so we our website cfymetings.com if you go for our sales process we send you a proposal it'll be like dfymetings.com instantly and we have a personalized webpage it has your company name your name specific notes on our call and a three to five minute video going through all the main points faq questions youtube videos invoice link all the next steps laid out clearly and having that adds so much professionalism confidence in your ability and it's helped us a lot in terms of increasing our close rate outside of just the sales call itself okay great yeah going that extra mile like makes huge difference uh great to see how you are doing it uh one uh technicality like how do you get their phone number like do you have that just as a field in the in the calendar form or like how do you go about like also being able to text them like where do you grab that info from? Calendly form and i'll make a note here we have an automatic one for most prospects but i'm super excited i do it personalized and when i do it personalized if i can get them on whatsapp it always does better because no one does like whatsapp pre-call meeting messages yeah okay sweet and okay so let's say you know someone has an agency um they currently have two to three clients they're managing those two to three clients how do you go from that to getting to 10 plus clients to really like you know scaling up the agency to 10 plus clients how do you go from from point a to point b sure so one thing i think is good to say here is like outreach is fantastic and yes the simple answer is more outreach but if your retention sucks then it's like if you want to really scale you need to have good retention because longer retention higher average customer value and higher average customer value the more money you can spend on outreach and still be really profitable so first thing is what is your retention right if your retention is under three months like you don't have an outreach problem you have a retention problem that means that either your service isn't good it means maybe you're communicating poorly of clients maybe you're choosing bad clients maybe the person who's actually doing the delivery of a service whether yourself or a contractor employee they're doing bad so if retention is an issue like it's just an ongoing game of get clients drop clients get clients drop clients now once you have that retention fixed um with cold email when you do have something that's working it's a pretty simple process of if my market's big enough let's add more volume and if your market's not big enough then can you go after a different country can you add in a different sector and increase volume i mean obviously there's ongoing testing but for the most part i see people just get scared of really high volume for example we're doing another big push in sales on january we have a hundred email addresses warming up for that like we have something that works we're just going to beat the living hell out of it interesting you you touched on going into other countries right so majority of people are targeting the us or just english-speaking countries in general um can you talk a little bit more about like how you go about targeting other countries that are non-english speaking like what's kind of the play there sure so we don't do any coding mode campaigns outside of one client um that and that's just like a special circumstance that isn't targeting in english however a lot of people think that the only countries that exist are uk us canada new zealand and australia but let's say for example the rest of europe you can filter on tools like store leads english stores in those countries and there's plenty um another example there's tons of e-commerce brands let's say e-commerce e-commerce brands in um in china they have warehouses in the united states but they're based in china if you went on tool like store leads which people who don't know it is it's a e-commerce filtering tool to find stores and you plug in english text on website e-commerce stores in china you'll find a bunch of great brands that have warehouses in the united states they're based in china same thing with the uae qatar kuwait oman jordan saudi arabia singapore south africa panama because people have companies in panama because they're there to save taxes like you just got to get a bit creative because most people just can find themselves and when you hop out of those countries the competition just drops because people aren't reaching out to them that's a great one now you have to think about outside the box a little bit and all the all the ones that you mentioned there singapore qatar united arab emirates panama like i mean usually people don't think about them right away but everybody speaks english there so and they have money so that's it those are a bunch of good markets and uh yeah so you would um you would increase the the volume basically like if you want to go i mean you focus on retention first make sure you're able to deliver good service people stay with you and after that increasing the volume uh and also going into other countries uh would be the main thing to go from two to three clients to 10 plus clients or yeah i would say other countries if your market's small right if you have a big market you might just be able to stay in the united states forever um but yeah for a lot of people like of cold email i know that's an underwhelming not sexy answer but in reality it's like if something's working and it's profitable you know you need to do more of it obviously you're going to get better along the way because you have more data and the more people you reach out to the faster you get data but a lot of times it's just doing more yeah and uh it's a little bit more like entrepreneur related uh question you've been in the entrepreneurial entrepreneurial game for a long time you have a lot of experience uh if you could go back in time meet your younger self uh what would you tell him like what what kind of lessons would you give him on his way uh as as you know growing all these companies and scaling the companies so if i go back and talk to myself i think the the first thing um would be focus i've struggled a lot with focus i think a lot of people have shiny object syndrome when you're starting businesses um you know i had a lot of businesses but did okay when i started up which too i was for some context i'm 22 i started business in 15 um and i i did pretty good right away not like good in terms of making tons of money but like i had an income at 15 from a business which is cool um but focus is i was trying to do too many things i was trying to do at one point an agency which had a couple clients a drop shipping store which had some sales and a vending machine business which i had some vending machines and at the same time i was trying to do like a reselling business reselling clothing and the thing that was frustrating for me was um all the things i did worked a little bit enough that like it was hard to cut them right it's hard to cut something when you're making money from it even if it's not much and it took for me like like growing from you know a few thousand a month to tens of thousands to and beyond it took like narrowing down focus and that's consistently been a struggle of mine even to this day i have a notion doc called list of businesses i'm not i'll have a start so i can like put my ideas in it and it has over 100 business ideas um because that's just like my struggle so focus being number one um number two probably would be um outreach like i've been doing outreach for an entire time but i used to do the thing where you obsess over the numbers and not the volume and uh if i could go back and tell myself to focus more on volume of outreach um that would have helped too but i was doing cool emails back in 2015 i didn't know what a coding well was but i'd find people companies i liked and just send them emails and they would respond okay nice and um as a last question i'm always curious to hear what are some cold email strategies that you just recently discovered but not a lot of people know about yet if you're willing to share of course i'm gonna give three is that okay yeah please perfect okay first one is specific for december so in december people do not generally hire too much for agencies like they don't want new projects normally again this is not everybody it's just generally speaking so one thing we're doing is especially in december we're doing what we call job board campaigns let's say that you offer sales training about your service so we would go on a job board and look for companies that are hiring sales managers because they're saying we need someone to help with sales and we would specifically cold email those companies not mentioning the job posts but pitching sales training because they're in the market for everybody else is saying you know let's wait till january if you're putting a job post out in december you probably want to hire december and this can apply for everything if you offer um let's say that you do i don't know graphic design you know you look people hiring graphic designers and you cold email those companies because they're hiring graphic designers so those really high intent prospects especially in like all year round but especially in a time when our people aren't hiring are a gold mine that's that's number one okay great number two is specific for e-commerce i know a lot of people have e-commerce services and that's targeting chinese um stores in china with warehouses of the united states they get skipped over there's so many brands who are successful in china they work with an agency and they have like a sister brand or like us facing brand um it's still based out of china but the warehouse in the united states and their products are sold to us market and for most people we're getting their leads off tools that filter by country they're completely skipping over these and there's like 30 40 000 good ones that just aren't getting emails much so that's another one we're taking advantage of um and for the third one do you want to be specific to cold email it could be like general prospecting uh general prospecting is cool too yeah the third one which is really underrated and um i would say a bit thought negatively about is upwork like people have the connotation that all people on upwork are hiring cheap prices or just like cheap prospects and i think the word place that thought comes from is on upwork you can't do any filtering the job post might be need help with ads or need help with graphic design or need a website made so you can't actually tell the prospect serious what their budget or anything is until the sales call and yes that's a little bit frustrating but we've been getting so much good work on upwork and another thing to note is like volume we apply to every relevant job everywhere in the world every single day on upwork so we're applying to hundreds of jobs per week um sometimes close to a thousand per month and we get consistent clients from it and again there are a lot of tire kickers people have low budgets but like we sign a client who does 20 million dollars a year from upwork his job posts need help with cold email you have no way of knowing to get the call so um again upwork's great for december too because again people have lower intent to um hire in december do new projects but we're putting a job on upwork they have high intent so we got two intent ideas and one unique targeting idea those are three things that we've recently been doing a lot more of and are really excited about okay great exciting uh awesome michael that was the the last question uh it was really
