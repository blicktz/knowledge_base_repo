Hey guys, so today I'm going to show you how you can use Spintax in your email copy to make it more unique and also make sure that you land in people's inbox rather than spam or promotions folders. So what is Spintax? So basically Spintax is just text enclosed in curly brackets and separated by this vertical bar symbol and what it does is it just takes one of the inputs that you put in and puts it into your text.

So in this example I have three variations but you can actually add as how many ever you want. You can do two, you can do five, it doesn't really matter. It doesn't change the way this works and yeah instantly one important thing to keep in mind is that you want to add random in the beginning of the variations because this then will make sure that all of those three will be randomly chosen.

If you don't put random it will just choose between the last two and yeah even though it's not the end of the world you still want to have random in the beginning to make sure that Spintax works properly. So yeah let's jump into instantly and see what this looks like in real life and how you can actually use this. So here's one copy I have that includes a pretty good amount of Spintax.

So the first place you can see it is already in the subject line so yeah it also works in subject line and if you have additional steps don't worry about it breaking the thread because it will choose the same subject line it chose in the step one for all other steps to make sure that the threading works correctly even if you have Spintax in your subject line. So yeah this is like the traditional way to use Spintax you put random in the beginning and then just variations of the same thing in a different way. So you can use synonyms you can look it up online at different ways to say the same thing just to make sure it's as unique as possible.

And yeah jumping into the email copy itself the first thing here you see is like a special way to use Spintax it's called fallback variable and what this does is if you don't have a first name in your lead list for whatever reason it will choose there instead. So a use case for this would be if you still want to make sure that your email sound natural even though you might miss some kind of data that you put in so let's say for example you have company name put in as a variable and the company name is missing so instead of having just a blank spot there you can input something that takes its place when it's missing so it still sounds natural. So in that case you don't put random in the beginning and you just format it like this moving on from there is another example of using synonyms same way to say different things just to make sure it's super unique so as you can see here handle manage deal with sales and yeah increase boost raise or synonyms to make it as unique as possible and then in the end I also have included call to action as a Spintax so this is entire sentences that all say the exact same thing but in a different way and yeah that's basically what Spintax looks in real life and one way you can actually make sure in Insulate that it all works correctly is by clicking the preview email button in the bottom here so as you can see it fills in all the Spintaxes I put in.

Quick Q Bridget hi Bridget I'd love to find out more about the way you manage sales at company name and yeah so basically you can just make sure that the Spintax works and every time you close it and preview this email again it will like again randomize it so you can make sure that it really works the way you want it to work and also you can just double check that all the Spintaxes together also sound natural and yeah one interesting thing that you can also check with your copy is going to this site I will link it in the description as well so you can basically copy your you copy your email here and yeah you have to take out those random in the beginning because it will also count as a variation here and you don't really want that because those won't actually be in the email so I've taken out all the randoms and used the same exact copy that I just showed you within instantly and as you can see it will have 729 different variations of this same email so already pretty low effort just adding in a few synonyms here and there a pretty short copy as well you will already have over 700 different variations of this email so you can actually see the power of power of Spintax and how you can make sure that your emails are super unique so if you add in more variations here this number will rise exponentially so you can reach thousands pretty easily so yeah that's basically how you use Spintax you can pretty easily make sure that all your emails that are going out are unique and also the reason you want this to happen is because there are spam filters that are checking for email body copy and if they see like let's say a thousand emails have been sent today that are exactly the same those will be flagged as spam and you will probably end up in spam as well but using a ton of Spintax those systems will not detect that this email is the same because it's properly Spintax then it will be unique enough to be considered like a unique email and this way you can make sure that you can send out bigger volumes of email without getting stuck in spam and yeah keeping your delivery plate high you
