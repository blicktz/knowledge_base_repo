In this video, we'll be looking at how to use Spintax in cold email and how to get ChatGPT to do the tedious cold email chores for you. So first things first, what is Spintax? Spintax in your cold emails, it helps you create variations of sentences or words, and it can help you generate even more diverse email bodies for your leads.

So the more variation, the more uniqueness in each email that you send out, the better. So as an example, you know, here, let's say this, if this was our first sentence, I'd love to random learn here, find out, right? You can see these are synonyms and it will interchange them.

For one email, it will be learn. For another, it will be hear. For another, it will be find out.

And if you do this throughout the text, you can see how very quickly you will get a large amount of unique emails. And it will mix and match and variate and Spintax the entire thing. So let me just show you a specific example and how to use it with ChatGPT.

Because also, right, usually you would have to do this work manually. You would have to put in the brackets and all that. But now with AI, you can just let it do it for you.

So let's jump in here and we'll look at a specific example. I played around with the prompt. And this is the prompt that's been working.

So here we'll just ask ChatGPT to add Spintax to this cold email and use the following Spintax structure. For Spintax, bracket, bracket, random, main words, synonym 1, synonym 2, and closing, two closing brackets. The random word should be at the beginning of the Spintax structure, not the end.

Do not Spintax anything that is already in brackets. So here I had to refine it a little bit because sometimes it would take the random and put it at the end, which would break it. Or it would try to Spintax variables like first name or company name.

And these are like very dynamically insert company name or first name. We don't want to Spintax that. Otherwise, it will break as well.

So let's go ahead and take this prompt. I'm going to put it into the YouTube description as well. So you can just grab that and use it to Spintax your cold emails.

So let's go back here. Spinging around with it earlier already. And then I'll grab this.

And this is the cold email example that we're going to be Spintaxing or that ChatGPT is going to be Spintaxing for us. It will immediately recognize like, okay, which word it's going to take and what are synonyms for it and so on. So let's run it and see what it comes up with.

All right. So it's doing the work here. Imagine having to do all of this manually.

It will take a while. Like picking out the words that you want to Spintax thinking of synonyms. You have to look up synonyms.

So on and so forth. Here did it in like five to ten seconds. So let's grab this.

It's actually good. We can use this. So we grab this and let's go into instantly.

We'll set up a new campaign. Just click here. Then we'll go to sequences.

And then I'll paste this in. We'll have to do some formatting a little bit like this. And yeah.

Here we already have a Spintax email. It's going to create thousands of different variations of usually if we just sent this out like this. It would just send out one variation.

Maybe a little bit more than one variation if you count the custom variables like first name or company name. But let's say we're not counting this. Like this email.

It's going to be going out. There's going to be thousands of different variations that are going to be going out compared to only one here if we just used it like that. And then we have the Zins diet of instantly.

Let's say let's add a subject line as well. And what I like to do also we can add a variant. Right.

We can do A, B split testing. We call it A to Z split testing. You can add a lot more variations than only two.

And let's say we wanted to do a little split test here. What you can also do is you can grab this email and add it into ChatGPT and then just tell it hey make this cold email more concise. And that's going to be a good cold email.

Right. We have a little bit more of a wordier more professional or longer cold email compared to the more concise snappy cold email. So it really shortened it down as you can see.

Hope this email finds you well. As head of you can share. Could you share how your cold outreach is going?

We've created a tool that helps our users get up 50 plus new sales opportunities a week. So we can grab this right and just put it as a B split test here. But what we're going to do again is let's have it spin text.

So let's take the prompt again. And then spin text the above cold email. Or maybe we don't even have to say it.

Let's see if it gets it right away. Okay. Okay.

So obviously also you have to sometimes double check. Right. This wouldn't make too much sense.

I hope this email finds you great. Finds you fantastic. So we're going to be cutting that out.

But for everything else we can use it right away. So let me just grab it. We're going to put it inside of instantly.

Again, this one doesn't make too much sense to spin text the wall. And we're going to cut that out. And there we go.

So I'm going to use the same subject line as well. So the subject line is the same. And then we can do an A-B split test.

We'll have two copies rotating. You could also call this copy rotation. We have the variation A rotating.

At the same time, it's spin taxing itself. And then we have B rotating. And it's also spin taxing yourself.

So we're getting a lot of variety, a lot of uniqueness into these cold emails. And it didn't take me a lot of work to do that right there. It really saved me a lot of time.

I did this video is now seven and a half minutes. If I had to do all of this stuff manually, it would have taken me a while. As you can see, this is much quicker.

Okay, great. So yeah, let's wrap it up. This is pretty much the needs trick.

Really can help you save time, launch campaigns quicker, even add a bunch of spin tax in there and get more positive replies. I hope this one was helpful. Again, I'll put the prompt into the description.
