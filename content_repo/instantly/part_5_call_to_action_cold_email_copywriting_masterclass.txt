and the third and last part of good cold email is call to action and a really strong well formulated call to action will improve your response rate and here are some options you can test and ideally everybody wants just to send the candle link they will book it in and you have a meeting but this is one of the lowest response rates called action that you can use people are super busy even selecting time or clicking a link on your calendar might be too much they don't want to do it your job is to make it as simple as possible for them and instead of asking for calls straight away there are points of more lower friction called actions you can do I also recorded a video on someone to call call email called action we're using so you can click this link in video and check it after as well but here are some examples 90% more info again instead of asking for a call you send your offer some pitch and just ask them mind if it's in more info this is a really good one do you have any time this Friday for a quick chat more specific not asking for can you do a call just be specific on Friday would you be against having a quick call this Friday so again like maybe I don't want to have a call but I wouldn't be against it it's a little bit psychological trick you can use mind if I send your Loom video about it again much more specific and you show them you've actually made a short Loom video if you have timing you can add mind if I send you a two minute Loom video then respond with an A if I can send more info respond with B if it's not a fit right now just giving them super simple options to respond then you can try choose a time from my calendar here adding a link would you be interested in doing a 15 minute interview with me so asking an interview instead of a call I know you get pitched a lot so I want to ask your permission first to see if you mind if I can send you more info so this is like super polite asking the permission to ask if you can send more information can I send you a link to explain how it works please see more on this blog post here if you written about something that will help them you can ask if you can send the link instead of sending straight away can I send a PDF that explains how we do it same logic let's talk want to see how we do it can I give you a call on Wednesday or Friday at 1 p.m. Eastern I know you're busy but can I call you next Tuesday I promise you will waste your time when would be a good time for a 15 minute call this one I like interested yes or no even if they're not interested they will respond no you will get some responses you can maybe ask later like why not right now can I reach out later let me know if you'd be interested watch the video here if you made a video a little video about it I wrote more about it here if you wrote a blog post are you free anytime this week for a quick chat here's the series document I wrote check out our app here I'll send you a burger with Uber Eats if you can jump on a quick 15 minute call this week so adding a little bit of humor humor you might if I run some calculations for you to see how much you could save if your offer helps me save money compared to competitors it's a good line to use interested to hear more let me know if this sounds like something we're exploring for a company name we're confident we can get results and then adding your offer like getting leads priority for you right now or not really so these are a bunch of call to action already for your test try to make it as specific as possible if you're asking for a call or time propose specific times it works usually better and try with lower friction for example interested just asking if you're interested and making it super simple for them respond like yes or no instead of asking for a call or some big commitment straight away mind if you send your more info is also a really good one so start with this once you're getting comfortable once you're getting some success with these then start experimenting experimenting and trying new angles if you find something that works hit me up on twitter or message or inside this live chat we'd love to add more call to actions here thanks so much you
