Once we have an email open trigger, we'll use instantly to automatically send a new email like eight minutes after the email open trigger goes. And it's all like your back end is already checking to see if they replied or anything by then. And we all know open rates are kind of trash anyway, which is for this strategy is still totally fine.

Eight minutes after they open the email, we'll send them an email that says asterisk conversion dot dot dot. Enter, enter. So sorry.

I didn't fix that before I sent it out. And we got great, great results on that campaign, which was literally just like a like it was for a an influencer who all he does is takes people's offers and then just revamps them. And a lot of the ways he starts is just with their website.

People would like message back and they were definitely on their iPhones because we had to send from the iPhones get Outlook for iOS. And they would message right back after that email and be like, oh, I don't know how it's like optimized for conversation or whatever it was. That campaign we ran that.

I think we ran that like a year and a half ago. So from what I remember, I think that was like depending on what list we were sending to and how we sent it. That was like an eight to 12 percent response rate campaign when we were when we were doing that.
