Hi everyone, so we just released a new feature in Instantly which will allow you to transfer leads between your campaigns that you already have in your Instantly account and I wanted to make this quick video to show you how you can use this new feature and also talk about some use cases for this new feature. So you'll find it when you go into campaigns select a specific campaign and go into the leads tab. So here if you make any kind of selection from the leads that you have here you'll see this new button appear and clicking on it will enable you to transfer this selection to any of the campaigns that you have in your account and then you just choose the campaign and click confirm and yeah that's the basics of the feature so now let's talk about how you can use this for your actual campaigns.

So let's say you've completed one campaign you've sent out all the emails and then you have a bunch of leads sitting in this campaign and now what you can do is filter them based on different conditions. So let's say I want to see everyone that opened my email but didn't reply so I'll just click on this selection wait for it to refresh and then I can just click the arrow here and select everyone with this filter so now I've selected everyone in this campaign that opened my email but did not reply and now what I can do is move them to another campaign. So let's say that campaign could be just a different copy a different approach or it could be specifically tailored for people that opened your email but did not reply so I made a test test campaign here so I'll just choose that one and click confirm.

So now what happened is that all of those leads that I selected were moved out of this campaign into that campaign that I just chose. So going back to campaigns navigating to the campaign that I chose and going on to leads you can now see that all of these leads are now here and they've back reset it back to this not yet contacted phase. So now yeah basically I can just send another type of sequence to these people and under filters you can find a bunch of different criteria so you can also do people that didn't even open the email so these are like people that did not even read about your offer or anything they can kind of like new leads and you can retarget them hit them with another copy another offer try to get a reply out of them in a different manner and yeah this same thing is also available in the unibox so if I go into the unibox and select the reply here the same button is here so again an use case would be if someone responds like yeah maybe I'm interested but they like don't want to get on a call right away so what you can do is again have this follow-up campaign created where you send them reminders about this sometime later so basically again you can just click that button choose whatever campaign you have that you want to use and click confirm and that lead will be again sent from the campaign it was previously in to a new campaign and yeah basically that's it so it enables you to retarget people based on new conditions and basically work through the leads until you get the desired result
