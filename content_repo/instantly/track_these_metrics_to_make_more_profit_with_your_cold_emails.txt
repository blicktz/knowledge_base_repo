cold email is not set and forget when you're running campaigns you should constantly be analyzing and tweaking things based on the results and you'd be surprised how many people are doing this wrong so in this video i'll break down all the most important metrics to aim for so you can start landing more clients for less money and get the most out of your cold emails like the video subscribe and let's get into it first i'm going to walk you through the main metrics the main kpis for cold email you can optimize your campaigns for and then i'm going to show you one of my campaign and show like how i would look at it live so first if you go to our accelerator here you click the optimization and in the optimization guide we have all the main metrics inside instant already so you can check this out so main metrics in the order of importance are first revenue most important metric if your open rate is trash but your campaign is bringing revenue you should never posit like you should keep bringing it's bringing you money so this is the biggest thing to understand if the campaign is making you money pretty much forget about all the other numbers obviously you don't want them to be bad but if they are but they're still making you money i would just scale that campaign up it's most important metric and that's why you should be always marking the leads as interested and adding the lead value so you know which campaigns are bringing you money and how you can improve it you can do better targeting so this is pretty generic but the better you're targeting the more revenue you're going to be making because it's going to resonate more raising prices so if you're already getting a bunch of meetings you're getting a lot of interest it's maybe a good time to try adding some offers some services some software some features that could increase your pricing you can offer a longer term deal if you're offering monthly you can go for yearly you can go for three months just bigger deals bigger tickets you're going to make more money and then increasing conversion rate if you're better at closing every lead that you bring in with cold email it's going to bring you more money so make sure you go through our sales accelerator as well make sure you have a really good optimized sales process because every lead in your inbox is worth thousands of dollars for agencies so you should treat them as one and put a lot of effort into them the more you optimize your sales process the better your cold even results are going to be so second positive replies positive reply is a lead response positively to your email it's up to you how you want to define it if it's a booked meeting just a positive response an interested lead this is the most like second most important metric you should optimize for and you can improve it pretty much the same way better targeting better copy if you copy it's really good it slaps you're going to get more responses you're going to get more positive replies better personalization the more optimized segmented personalized your email is the more responses you're going to get and also improving leads to meeting ratio this is pretty much inbox management once you're getting the leads in the more you can convert them the better you are at turning those leads in your inbox into meetings the more one lead is going to be worth to you because you're going to get more people on the call you're going to close more people and it's like a positive avalanche that way then positive reply rate it gives you a good overview of how well your campaigns are performing and you should be optimizing for to get your positive reply rate as high as possible how you can improve it same thing better targeting better copy better presentation so it's very similar the positive applies just a different metric and we're using the rate to monitor it then bounce rate uh super overlooked metric i'm going to show you instantly how you can see it and this pretty much means if you're sending emails how many of them are bouncing how many of them never even reached a recipient which means your lead source is bad or your leads aren't verified so you want to make sure your bounce rate isn't above two percent you want to have it much slower so you're only sending good emails you don't get your emails burned make sure to change your lead source if your bounce rate is above two and use email cleaning list verification then reply rate this is maybe the most controversial one that i have it so low but think about it it's a vanity metric if you get tons of replies and you optimize the campaign but you don't know if those replies are positive negative did actually bring you money it's not the reply rate that you should be optimizing for it's the wrong way to think about it there are so many uh campaigns people have like oh look at me i have 20 reply rate but if all of those are no thanks the reply rate in of it itself is not a good metric to aim for it isn't directly correlated with success because there are negative responses including this so how we can improve it same stuff better targeting better copy but overall this is just have it as like one metric that you see and measure but focus more on the positive reply rate positive replies and revenue and final one open rates so it's actually like it is important but i've added it as last one because again there's misconceptions everybody's like asking what the opener should be and like what a good open rate is but open rates are more of a symptomatic kpi which you want to check from time to time so you want to see if you have good deliverability if your emails are landing in your prospect's inbox if they are it doesn't really matter if it's like 60 70 50 55 it's like you can tweak it here and there but again if i have campaign with 25 open rate and it's bringing me 10k a month and then i have a campaign with 70 open rate and it's bringing me 1k a month i would just go for a 10k lower open rate campaign so i hope that makes sense that we want to focus on actual results not the vanity metrics of reply rates and open rates how to improve it make sure the text setup is done correctly tkm tmark spf everything is done and set up correctly make sure you warm up your domains if you're already getting low open rates post campaigns post those accounts just let them warm up for a while and then launch the campaigns again and post those campaigns like it's in here so now these are the main ones and let's go into actual campaign and show you quickly how i work on this let's take this one so here in analytics for example like this one i've disabled open tracking to get a little bit better deliverability and reply rate two percent and opportunity numbers right now it's just i added it as a thousand so again this reply rate might be good might not be let's say i i don't have any opportunities here then this reply rate like sucks i wouldn't scale this campaign up but even now people think like 1.9 like that's a low reply rate but if you're getting 16 positive responses opportunities and one of those each one of those leads is worth 1k for you it's 16k with a 2 reply rate and if you scroll down here i did an a b test both sent almost the same amount and you can see reply rate two percent two percent and opportunity seven and nine so the second variant variant b actually has a little bit more responses it's still like pretty small campaign i can say definitively if it's actually better but this is what i would optimize for i would just like look at this i would realistically ignore replied and opens if i choose which one to use and if i see okay let's say this is 15 and this is one obviously b is better i would just pause a right now they're working both pretty well so i'm going to give them on and this is like this is it this is what i monitor just checking out opportunities if there if i'm not getting any opportunities i'm going to rework the targeting try a different angle work on the copy switch it up but this is the main numbers that i'm going to work on and i'm going to show you in unibox how i mark leads as positive so this is something you should get into the habit of let's go to the unibox and let's take all and i got three positive responses so if you remember like i had 16 positive responses before i'm going to take all of these i'm going to mark it as interested i want to mark this one as interested and mark this one is interested and now when i go back to the analytics i'm going to have three more so 19 opportunities there so that's how it's switched between the analytics and then what you want to get into the habit of and what we're working on right now to make the unibox have some sort of crm capabilities and this is where you should be focusing on your clients now i have my interested leads in here i will send them report responses like here to get them to book a meeting or to get use a trial for instantly once they've done that i can add as meeting booked if you book a meeting with you if you've had a meeting with them let's mark this is you had a meeting with them but it didn't close yet this is where you can make a lot of money and again you can use this filter here so all the people that you had a meeting with but haven't closed so they've already learned about your offer you jumped on a call there was some kind of resonance there you could actually help them so these people actually need your service so you should be following up with them and this is very very valuable status that you should be using a meeting completed and then let's say i'm able to pull this guy over the finish line close him then i mark it as closed and now under closed i have all my closes in here like i mentioned i'm gonna we're gonna make it better we're gonna add some more features to make it more crm like but get in the habit of marking all leads as interested in the first if it's just lectures and over then if i go to analytics now let's refresh then you're gonna see that all the leads now are gonna show up in here so see 20 total with the new ones and then it will add the lead value on top of it based on the campaign so for the other campaign that i have here i have a smaller post lead value but if i add it to a thousand two so every campaign that you have if you have different offers different services add the lead value on campaign level but the main analytics will calculate it based on those like totals it will add everything together so that's what you should be optimizing for campaigns that get opportunities so here for example this campaign 2.5 reply rate which is higher than this one 1.9 so if i would be optimizing for reply rates i would take this campaign scale it up but you see i'm getting less opportunities but actually the positive reply rate is higher because out of five that responded four are positive so make sure you monitor numbers after this call i'm going to tell our developer to add the positive reply rate after the opportunity as well so we can see that and then i just scale up the campaigns if they're working well and i monitor only these numbers i don't really watch open rates i don't really watch the reply numbers just actual positive responses opportunities and how much money these campaigns are making so i
