All right, let's talk about follow-ups. We don't really use long follow-up sequences, usually four max. Some people have success with longer, test it out, feel free to experiment.

You never know what's going to work in your niche. So our structure, the initial cold email, main email, that's everything I've showed you in this guide so far. Second one, quick bump, two days later, three days later maybe.

Third, sending values and case studies, and fourth, breakup or something funny. So the first quick bump, two days after the first email. Hey, I know you're busy, just making sure you see nothing in period.

Hey, is there someone else at the company? I should be sending this to you. And don't be afraid of using GIFs, images, funny stuff here too.

And then value. If you did your homework in the initial email, you're going to have so many different angles, different value props you can use. So case studies, offering free audit or send alone video.

So everything you didn't use in your first email, or if you have a really good point in your first email you want to get across, send this over here. Keep it short, keep it simple. Again, use the same strategies about everything we covered, but just send them something valuable, something that would pique their interest more than just a regular email.

And then the fourth part, breakup email or meme. At this point, I'll assume your offer isn't a priority right now. Feel free to reach out when changes.

Or send a funny meme with a cat, with a penguin. Try out some fun stuff and just get a response from them. Break those patterns.

And you will get some people to respond like, hey, that was funny. Can we have a quick chat? Thank you.
