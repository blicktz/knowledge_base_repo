Hey guys, Raul here with another copy roast. So if you're struggling to get responses to your emails, watch this video and I'm going to walk you through exactly our strategies, my mindset, and how I approach writing copy by ripping apart some of the copy that you guys sent over. And don't forget to subscribe, like this video so you can keep creating more of this content.

So let's get started. First copy straight away, my first initial response. It's too long.

Like if I see something like this on my phone, on my laptop, I'm not going to read it. But let's go through it and then write the better one. So hey, the challenge of every real estate developer is to manage less risk in the process of developing real estate and selling it to clients.

In all, the main objective here is to make a marketing piece that sells the dream of the property, especially when the home is currently in pre-construction. Does this sound familiar to you? Recently, I've helped a lot of real estate developers to work on a 3D visualization of their listings for marketing purposes that led to a huge successful campaign for them.

I helped them to create visualization products for their property. From helping real estate developers with the production of 3D floor plans, 3D renderings, and virtual reality 360 tours specifically for their property listings. I understand that you're the listing agent, but I'm not sure if this falls under your purview within.

Regardless, maybe this sample will spike your curiosity about the kind of conversion on prospective buyers that you can be getting through your listing. This is something you can use on your listings as soon as next week, if you like it. Are you free anytime this week or quick check?

Best. Oh my God. Like this might be a really good test.

Like if you get tired after reading your email, it sucks. Like I'm already like the words, like my tongue got twisted, tired. Like this is like no good.

So proofread your text. Like if it takes you, I don't know how long I read it, like a minute over a minute. It's too long.

It needs to be like 10-15 seconds max. But now let's get into like the specifics. So I understand that offer seems to be the studio is making 3D visualizations of properties to help real estate agents sell more.

Stature offer like take away all of this stuff like you don't need it. So I would start straight away like, Hey, name. I saw your listing on Zillo maybe.

So I'm going to start lifting on Zillo. Looks pretty good. Then have you thought of adding a 3D, it's good for 3D plan visualization.

Visualizations could work with too long. Have you thought of adding a 3D plan to your listing to sell more? Maybe it's the main interest point to your listing to Spike Curiosity, prospective buyers, to convert buyers.

I'd love to send. Mind if I send over a sample. Hey, name.

I saw your listing. And you can add here like apartment, house listing in Zillo. Looks pretty good.

Have you thought about adding a 3D plan to your listing to convert more buyers? Mind if it's in our sample? I might be a little bit off on the terms and angles because this is not my market, but you get the point.

So I saw the listing on the listing site. Looks pretty good. So you give them like some kind of compliment.

But then you add on top of it, how to make it better. Have you thought about it? So you're not like pushing, you're asking them like, have you thought about it?

And then they're like, hmm, this actually might be a good, interesting thing. Have you thought about adding a 3D plan to your listing to convert more buyers, to get more views? Whatever the offer here is.

Mind if it's in the sample. Best. Like this seems already much better.

You can read it without getting tired. 10, 15 seconds. So I think like take this and work around with this sentence.

So you can test different options, different angles. Like what's the combination of words that really resonates with those real estate agents? What are they looking for?

Like what are their KPIs? Is it like more views, more buyers to check out their listings? Actually to get more queries from the website, like whatever that is, add it in here and test it out.

So this is already much, much shorter and better. So next one, first impressions, shorter, better. But again, feels like it's, it can be even shorter, but let's read through it.

Hey, first line compliment. I want to contact you since we are helping online stores in the niche scale their sales through our unorthodox Facebook ads method. We were recently able to skyrocket the sales of one of our clients in the niche, which is why we decided to reach out to you as you would be the perfect fit for us.

If this is something you'd be interested in, we made a quick video for what we would do to scale store name. Would it be okay to send the video here sincerely? All right.

So pretty good. But again, it got a little bit all over the place. We're like talking about stuff that we didn't need and a little bit saying the same stuff in different words.

So let's make sure the version. So, Hey, name. Okay.

We want to contact you. So again, let's try the second one that we just like used. Have you thought of, or like I noticed, I noticed you're not using our, I like the word unorthodox.

It's like interesting. I haven't seen it much. Like it caught my attention.

I think it's like Facebook, maybe Facebook ads. Method for store. We recently, we hear like the skyrocket.

I would remove that. It's like a fluff word. You, if you have actual results, like tell those to recently help.

Or name that you actually helped. Add 50k. MRR with our strategy.

With. Let's say. I noticed you're not using our own Facebook ads methods for store.

Recently helped store them. With this. With this exact.

Strategy. And it can even be like straight away to call to action. Mind if I send more info.

And then I noticed you're not using. Maybe this is a little bit like too upfront. I noticed you're not using.

One of the. Newest. This is like more.

Intriguing maybe. I noticed you're not using one of the newest Facebook ads methods for store. Recently helped store name.

Add it. K with the six. Strategy.

I'm gonna do some more info. And it seems pretty good. And.

A quick tip. If you're. From a non-English speaking country.

And you have like a non. Regular English name. I would recommend like using initials.

Or just like a. Shorter version. Like a nickname.

Because this. Helps. Add more trust.

To get more replies. So for example here. I just add like.

Al. Yeah. This is like.

Seems pretty good to me. So these would be the two. Lines I would work on.

So the first one is just to. Turn it interest. So your unorthodox method.

You can use it here. Here. Hey.

We just. We just. Discovered this like method.

That would work perfectly for your store. And we recently did this for an exact type of store. Like you are.

Mind if I see any. Mind if I show you. How we can do the same for you.

Because again. Much shorter. Sweet.

Straight to the point. I can read it in 10 seconds. Let's get on to the next one.

Hey. Again. Nice.

Break your first line. We are talking to marketing leaders. From the hotel industry.

We discovered that traditional marketing strategies. Are becoming outdated. Hotel marketing leaders.

Create data driven campaigns. And can easily uncover main loyalty drivers. Or for guests by using our solution.

Would be crazy. And there are more details. So length is pretty good.

But it's like. It reads again. More like a brochure.

It's not. Like I understand. This is not sent to me specifically.

Maybe with the icebreaker. But this one like. By talking with marketing.

Marketing leaders. Seems like. Something you say on a convention.

Or like read on a. Like a big. Big ad.

So I would make it more conversational. More. Again.

Like it was typed up. On the spot. So let's go through it.

To understand the offer. So. They help.

Hotel managers. To data driven. Campaigns.

Which. Encore the main loyalty drivers. Okay.

So. If I'm getting this correctly. They help.

Hotels make more money. By understanding their guests better. And understanding what makes guests.

Stay longer. Book more. I like this.

Would it be crazy. Crazy part. So this one.

I would. Pretty much. Completely remove.

And just add like. Hey. Hey.

If you want to add something like that. I would use. I was just.

Chatting. With. Hotel.

Traditional marketing. Strategy. Are being outdated.

I would add that. I was just chatting. With a hotel owner.

About. So this is like. Uh.

Something that they are driven approach. But something like. Very specific.

Cheers. Yeah. Yeah.

This. So. This seems.

Like already again. Like. It's already short.

But I made it. Even shorter. Even more straight to the point.

And. Yeah. That's pretty much.

Uh. I think. Like.

The main takeaways. Make your emails much shorter. Make them more specific.

Remove any buzzwords. Uh. Take away.

Everything. That doesn't need to be there. Don't.

Just say the same things. In different ways. And.

Stop trying to put. Everything into one email. The.

Goal of the first email. Just. To open up the conversation.

Uh. Open a relationship. You want to pique your interest first.

And then. Start pitching. So.

Don't think of it like. Just you have to do everything. Into one email.

You have follow-ups. You have multiple ways. To start contacting them.

So. Hope it helps. Don't forget to subscribe.
