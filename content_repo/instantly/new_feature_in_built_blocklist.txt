Hi everyone, Rayo from Instantly here and we just launched our new inbuilt Blocklist system so I wanted to make this quick video to talk about it and show you guys what exactly changed. So the first thing you may notice is if you're in your campaigns tab, the old Blocklist button is gone. So it was right next to this add new button and now it has been moved to settings.

So you want to go to settings, navigate to the Blocklist tab and you'll find everything you'll need here. So the first two things you may notice is the default and Google Sheets option. So the default will be the inbuilt Blocklist which is the new system and the Google Sheets one is what we had previously.

So this will continue to work as usual but you may want to consider moving these things over to the default tab and the way you do it is just click on import, choose Google Sheets and you place the Google Sheet link in here and that way it will be imported to the inbuilt Blocklist system. And this is just a more stable method of using the Blocklist so it doesn't rely on your browser and multiple other factors that may make it more unstable. And yeah, as you saw there's multiple ways to add leads to the Blocklist.

It's kind of similar to the way you import leads and as usual you can add entire domains or specific email accounts. They both work just fine. You can enter them manually through Google Sheets or through CSV and yeah, once you do it, they appear here and you can select them, you can delete them, you can import new ones and that's pretty much it.

So the Blocklist has been moved to settings and the way to make it the most stable is by using the default or the inbuilt Blocklist. And yeah, so that's pretty much it. Thanks for watching.
