hey guys Raoul here and just this video about five cold email niches to avoid got a lot of attention a lot of comments and a lot of people were asking like what are some good niches so i thought i'll do the opposite video five money making niches for cold email in 2022 2023 so before we get into the examples i want to go through the anatomy of a good niche good offer for cold email it's a little bit different than like a generic good offer because cold email is like you're coming in cold they don't know anything about you so it has to be even better than your typical offer so first the most important thing is it needs to move the needle it needs to have a clear roi so the biggest thing that companies want to do is make money like why you're watching this video is because you want to make more money with cold email you want to grow your business if you can tie your offer to that it's much easier sell than selling something that's not going to help them make money in the short term another part is save time so if you can offer to save me 20 hours every month and i can use the time to put it to focusing on something that helps me make more money for a company it's also a good offer then priority it needs to be on top of their to-do to-do list so again most of this is for making money growing the business if you're contacting ceos c-level people that's what they're looking to do if you're selling a productivity app that's not going to be on top of their list even though it's it can be helpful for them you can sell that but something that helps them make money is much higher on that list so it should be emerging or growing niche needs to be where that tension is right now needs to be something that everybody's talking about right now everybody knows they should be investing right now and maybe not everybody has invested into that yet so i have the read hundred million dollar offers link here so that's like one of the books that you should read to get better at offers and choosing a niche but it has a good example for example like you wouldn't sell newsletter newspaper ads to e-com stores like newspapers it's a declining market rate there are much better ones that i'm going to go through that you want to sell so sell something that's on the come up it's super popular right now jump on the bandwagon jump on the hype then if you can offer a performance base or a guarantee and make it a real no-brainer it's going to help you a lot like i said it's a cold email you're coming in cold they don't know anything about you so the biggest thing you have to overcome is trust so how can they trust you if you offer it by performance you don't get paid unless they get paid and you have a really good guarantee that always helps and fifth if it's hands off or done for you it's going to be much easier to sell most ceos most founders super busy people they don't want to take more stuff onto their plate every day they're doing so much so if you can take that away from them and just give it to them hands-free it's going to be much easier so let's get into the examples first tick tock ads so this is has been working for a while now and still is working really well and let's go through our checklist so needle moving it will help e-commerce stores make more money like you do ads to make more money it's not because of like branding not so many vague reason it just helped them get more sales so check it's a priority for them so it should be by growing the business getting more sales usually it is the priority for income stores it's a growing market tick tock is getting bigger and bigger more people are getting into tick tock there's still a lot of market share that tick tock hasn't grabbed so it's growing it's emerging it's popular right now you can offer a performance or county so we're going to create tick tock ads for you and we're only going to take 10 of the revenue that will bring you with tick tock ads there's like nothing upfront of course you can have a retainer model but you can use the performance if you're starting out if you're coming up with an offer to make it even a better offer for yourself and for them and then done for you so if you start an e-com store you can completely do everything for the company so yeah we have the e-com store we have the products we know what you're doing so only thing maybe you have to do is send these products to creators they were great ads but we take care of everything we create the tick tock ads account we create the ads we talk with the creators we put them up we report to you you don't have to do anything so check check check check check good offer another part another one similar to tick tock a little bit different is influencer marketing and user-generated content so this is like besides tick tock you can offer influencer marketing pretty much wherever like giving email lists youtube whatever challenge you want to do same stuff you want to angle using influencers for making more money for the company so it mostly it's a priority again it helps to grow the business priority it's a great market select influencers uh influencer marketing is super popular growing uh more companies are getting into it so it's top of mind same thing you can offer performance based or guarantee like i guarantee you will get three influencers for one of your product or performance based uh we have let's say a retainer 1k 2k plus from the revenue that you're going to be making from this influencer we take a cut take five percent ten percent whatever it is and fifth done for you again you can do everything for the company they don't have to do pretty much anything they just have to sign off on ideas sign off the influencers just give you feedback and that's it again really good offer for colima it works so third short form content so we recently got into this because we've been creating more content like this video and we have a short form guy that takes all our content like this one and creates short snippets from them and post them on youtube shorts tick tock instagram so again it's need moving it helps us get the word out there each video is equipped with a link to instantly so it will bring us visits sales per day like we're investing in the content obviously it's a priority for them for us so if you find companies that are investing into content they know the value of it like youtube content is evergreen like it's going to be up there forever so if you can take that content and make more of it like it it's a priority for us growing market again youtube shorts it's pretty new tick tock is getting bigger instagram reels like it's a growing market i don't have to explain much here same you can offer performance or guarantee for example i'm gonna choose short from content for you and if you get below 100 000 views in a month i'm gonna give you a 500 discount so you put a little bit skinny in the game and completely done for you so that's what really sold me on the short form content when i found a guy don't like a raw you don't have to do anything i just take the youtube content that you already have for making podcasts this kind of videos and they just take it and they post it too like i don't have to do anything it's it's like a no-brainer for me so i really love this offer right now fourth since i had in my last video about why seo is a hard niche but like i meant google seo for youtube seo and tiktok seo i feel it's a really good time right now uh and we're getting into youtube seo as well and really understanding how we can get like up there it's super important for us and it's not saturated saturated and again it's needle moving once if we get higher results on youtube we're gonna get more visits we're gonna get more customers again it's a priority for us we're doing youtube content so obviously for us youtube is a priority right now like we want to get better and better at this it's a growing market youtube is the second biggest search engine in the world it's getting more popular what companies are coming there it's growing you're gonna have performance or guarantee so you can offer that you're gonna get more visits from youtube than you're getting right now we can you can offer a guarantee after three months you're gonna be in the first page for this keyword whatever it is you can do that to make your offer even better and if you can offer it done for you again like you have your videos we send your editor a list of instructions that i have to do we do the keyword research we tell you everything you need to do you just have to confirm and that's it so again five checks good offer good niche and last one conversion rate optimization so for e-com for sauce wherever kind of business if you can help them make their landing pages convert better they're going to make more sales need a little more again priority it's going to help them make more sales no-brainer it's a growing market and it's evergreen like you're always going to need somebody to make your pages convert better so check performance guarantee so this is like super simple let's say you you put a baseline of where our conversions are right now for e-com stores and so i'm like we're going to increase your conversions and so if you're really good at this you believe in your offer you can offer that and again done for you just give us access to your shopify store give us access to your web flow we'll take care of everything you don't have to do anything check check check so these are just like five examples but the more important thing is to get into the mindset of using these checkpoints and understand like which niches are good because there are so many other ones that you can use these are just examples these work great right now they might change in the future they might get better they might get worse but understanding these five points and anatomy is the most important part that i want you to take away from this video and if you like this don't forget to subscribe and like it's free it will help me feel more positive get some positive feedback and more
