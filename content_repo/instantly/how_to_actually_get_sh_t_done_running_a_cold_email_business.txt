hey guys in this video i'm going to show you the most important free i should have it here free tool that you're not using this is uh super surprising for me in our lead generation agency uh our campaign manager wasn't using this once we showed him how to use it correctly like everything got better it's going to help you be more proactive it's going to help you get it done and it's like it's a must-have like i'm using this to this day and the tool is google calendar and it's so powerful tool if you actually use it people have like uh to do list apps everything like that you just need google calendar and then you need to split it out on the most important tasks i'm going to be focusing mostly on cold emailing if you want to become a cold email bro if you have a lead generation agency if you want to work on your business your agency or sauce and have a killer cold email outreach engine machine up and running this is what you want to do you have to set up daily tasks for the most crucial parts of the day and then you have to stick with them so let's go through them i forgot to say like and subscribe please so we can get this channel into 5k followers and let's get started so first off i like to start with my day with inbox zero this just means i open my inbox i have two one i have a personal gmail and then instant email i just go through every email i respond to most of the ones that is like super easy to respond to i just go through it so i'm using mac that in my mac mail i don't have any notifications it's clean i have no stress i've dealt with most major stuff that came up since last night is i think the most proactive or like the best way to start a day next up team call super underrated if you don't have a team you just have like two members of a partner you still should be doing this you should be reaching out to people you should be talking to people especially with the current world like if most teams are remote you wanna have this motivation boost this connection you're gonna feel it after you jump off the call you're gonna feel much more motivated you get that energy exchange you get so much more stuff done in the team meeting but you have to keep them like super fast like 30 minutes maybe max sometimes it goes longer if you have a bigger team but keep them simple have an agenda i can go through maybe in the next video for a team called agenda but just daily commit to it build that report with your team and make your entire team feel like part of the company so it's not like a fragmented section of what you guys are working on every day jump on there do it it's worth it next up copywriting so a big misconception with cold email is like you just say it and forget it but every campaign will stop working so that's why the next three things are stuff that you should be working on every day in the beginning every day and then you can do it a little bit less and less you want to start with copywriting i like more creative stuff in the beginning so you sit behind a computer you take your client or your own outreach and you just come up with at least one new sequence even one email daily imagine where you will be after a few months after a year you're gonna have so many different options you're gonna have the skill of copywriting much better even if you're not good copywriter go through instant accelerator take our templates edit them but every day commit to writing up at least one new copy that you can test and set up in instantly once you add that second part also very important is lead mining we want to consistently get new leads even if you have apollo you want to go to apollo create a new search you want to export another 100 leads you want to have a certain amount of leads that you get every day or you google a new database b2b recently funded sizes non-profits in us you google you find the database maybe you want to do an upward post to have somebody scrape them for you but every day find new leads leads are one of the easiest ways to stand apart from the competition because right now everybody's mostly using the same leads and if you use custom scraping or if you use a channel a database that not many people are using you're going to get more responses and you're only going to find them if you commit to this daily finding researching and searching like seeing if there's something out there that's a completely untapped gold mine you'd be surprised how many different things we found there are so many options you just need to google there's not much to it and then very important new campaign setup again daily you want to set up a new campaign you want to get into the habit of testing new options new campaigns you don't have to launch it if you're already like running your email accounts on max volume but just create that campaign so you have it there once the one campaign stops working or it's not producing results you can jump to the next one either counts there boom launch and we're good to go this is one of the most important things getting comfortable just quickly coming up with new angles using that copywriting handle that you figured out using that new lead source maybe those new leads that you pulled from apollo from ocean those new leads that you scraped adding them into a new campaign and daily creating a new campaign so again imagine after just a month if you do it like only weekdays you're gonna have like 20 22 new campaigns each one of these campaigns can bring you multiple clients thousands of dollars you're only going to find out if you actually try them so again commit to creating new campaigns daily and you can also use this window to work on your current campaigns you can scale them up you can maybe edit and post the campaigns that are not working so just like optimizing also is part of this so all this like in the beginning of the day is more getting the structure building new stuff and then i like to leave a section of a day for sales calls so if you use calendly you can just like book a slot or like have an empty slot where people can book meetings i would usually have like after lunch free for calls whenever you want to do it but have like a specific portion don't have the entire day scattered that you're doing a team called and sales called then lead mining just to do them one go it's much easier much simpler and you get into rhythm you jump off a sales call it went well you do it even better next time you jumped up the sales call it didn't went well you learn from it jump another one so have this like a strict schedule for yourself when you want to do them and same one client calls and for client calls if you're an agency you don't have to do it every day you might want to leave two three days a week where clients can book meetings with you just figure out your own structure what you like but have a couple of hours daily for a certain amount of days every week directed to client calls if you're doing them but mostly you should be doing sales calls so in the in the morning it's like putting more wood into the fire and then the sales call is where you actually like bring in the deals you close them and then in the morning we have the engine running and then we just like close them get the money and get much better at that part there and then also like what you can think about this from a Jordan Peterson like if you're doing this stuff if you're trying to better yourselves you don't have to be a tyrant it might seem like super hardcore in the beginning but this can be like 15 minute calls 15 minute like meeting windows 15 minute lead mining it doesn't have to 30 it doesn't be an hour just every day small pieces and then for example like Friday i like to take like Friday afternoon i'm not doing any calls again on Friday is my chill day i work most on the campaigns and the creative side maybe i brainstorm some ideas but this is going to help me relax a little bit more give myself time to recoup because sales calls are super tiring and you can get burnout if you're if you're not that kind of person that loves doing them so figure it out on your own you can even do like maybe you don't like Mondays you get the barrage of emails over the weekend and then on Monday just focus on answering them maybe doing client calls maybe you don't want to do any calls at all and just focus on building the engine building that outreach machine for yourself so start super simply inbox zero make sure there's no pending items on team call get aligned with your team get motivated get pumped set goals for the day set goals for the week what you want to achieve what other main stuff you're working on then copywriting come up with new sequences new emails daily lead mining come up with new lead sources pull new leads daily create new campaigns daily and work and optimize on your current ones and then book a window two three four hours five hours however you want to do it for sales calls when client can book calls and then figure out the best time for you when you want to do client calls you might want to have maybe like it's deuce day deuce day is your client call day and you just like do it turbo ram all the client calls in one day super simple like if you open the edit event i just add repeat every weekday for the stuff that you want to repeat other than that you can just do them daily but yeah just start using google calendar there's a bunch of stuff that you can do here more like with reminders you can follow your teammates calendars you can see how they're doing when they're busy when they're not and yeah just start using it it's so underrated everybody should be using it especially in the beginning when there's like so much stuff that you can work on you might even like let's say if you're really starting out there's you're still learning what i would do i would actually add like let's say 30 minute learning learning one let's put it like 30 minutes so i'm gonna edit this i'm gonna repeat it every weekday and on this learning portion let's say i just go through instant accelerator i just read 30 minutes next portion i watch the videos every day you're getting more information you're constantly improving yourself so whatever it is that you want to get better at have a have a calendar little time date for that as well so yeah i think this is uh pretty good to get started and hope it helps start using it let me know if you have any questions like share comment all of the stuff and thank you guys see you in the next one
