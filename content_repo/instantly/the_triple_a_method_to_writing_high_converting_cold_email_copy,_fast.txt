In this video we'll be looking at how to quickly write cold email copy that brings in positive replies meetings and deals if you've ever had writer's block or you don't have the patience to spend a lot of time when you call the email copy then this video is for you let's jump into it going to break down our email copy into three building blocks the first one is attention and attention is broken down into relevancy question personalization segmentation i'll go into every single one of them later on in the video then the second building block of the cold email is going to be authority and authority is either case studies that are similar or a believable but compelling claim and your track record and then the third one is going to be the ask the ask can either be light where it's just more info like a light touch ask i'll give you some examples later on as well or a direct ask where you ask them to get directly on the call so to recap attention authority ask so in this video we can workshop it through you can go through this here with me and what we're going to start with is going to be the authority section so let's let's start this you can go through this here with me just think about your past customers right so the first thing is you think about your past customers or your past experiences or track record what you want to do now is write in bullet point format what results you got for them so just write without holding back so i'm just going to go to instantly now and we can just go through this here together i'll go to just set up a campaign you can set one up here go to the sequences editor just so i have something to write on here and yeah so i'll i'll tell you i'd write without holding back um for example i can just show you a couple of examples that we put here right you can say for example i'm thinking about past some past customers when you had the lead generation agency or for i instantly offer now right you can say hey like i had this one client visionary planner got him an additional 50k and deals closed i have another client got them four clients 4k month each helped xyz get three more meetings a week help james see add 400k arr with instantly obviously i go through all your case studies in the past everybody did you helped get a good result an impressive result or even just a regular result which is something believable but that's still compelling so just write them down here either in a word doc or here in the instantly editor but yeah just think about that right just think about your past customers and go through that let's say you don't have any past customers then you can just say you know we specialized in getting companies like company name this is where it will automatically insert a company name and then you insert your value prop you know you can for example say that if you're a lead generation agency you're specialized in getting companies like company name five additional qualified sales calls a week or you can say we're special if you're an seo agency you can say hey we're specialized in getting companies like company name um thousand clicks a month through our seo strategies and our backlinking whatever your value proposition is okay so right we wrote down a bullet list past customers that we got results for we don't have customers if you don't have past customers we can says you can just say hey we're specialized in getting companies like company name and then the result that you promise and then you can say like that so okay so we talked about that now let's turn this into the authority building block of the email so what i'm going to do here is i'm just going to you know take this i picked out a couple here just going to say this right help visionary planner get an additional 50k in deal in deals in the last the last 30 days i think we can do the same for you it's gonna it rounds up the email a little bit and this is the authority section so moving on right the last part is just going to go round it out round it out and um you can do the same now for you all right like let's say or if i have i have another case study i want to use i can just say add that instead you know we helped james c add 400k in ar um i think we can do the same for you all right this is just case study here um okay moving on so the next part is going to be the ask right ask is building block number three um where we have attention is one authority is two ask is free so ask is super simple it's the easiest component here just pick out one of these call to actions right this is just why you want to get your foot in the door you better you do a call to action you ask them to take an action um or you ask them hey are you interested to hear more modify some more info got a quick 10 to 15 minutes to review this might if i share some examples of what's possible so i'm just going to pick the first one very basic one proven as well i'm just going to use that right you have the third portion we have the ask portion interested to hear more okay so moving on right this is really easy and i'm going to add this into the youtube description as well just so you have it there and just pick one of those uh call to actions one of those asks for for your ask okay good now attention attention is going to be building block number one this is the most challenging one in my opinion authority pretty straightforward just think one of one of your customers ask super simple but now we want to look at attention so what we're going to do is there are numerous ways to go about it my personal favorite is to have the first generic the first line be generic enough so i can send it to a lot of people but it still feels relevant to every single recipient that way i don't have to use ai or manually write personalized first lines to get their attention let me just show you some examples and on this entire list i'm going to have it in the youtube description as well so you can say you know we help companies with their what your audience offers so what they offer not what you offer but what they offer so you can say you help companies with their offer is that right the reason i ask and then you transition into component two right authority part so you can say something like hey you help companies with their branding is that right the reason i ask or uh yeah the reason i ask and then you transition into building block two so for example you can say something like uh first name uh you help companies with with their with their funnels or with their sales is that right and you can say you know the reason i ask is is because uh we helped james c at 400k in arr and i think we can do the same for you are you interested to hear more right we are we're fleshing this out now right we're putting out all the different building blocks we're putting them together and fleshing them out let me show you a couple more examples um you can also say really impressive what you did that company name not a lot of target audience with that type of track records so for example you can say hey really impressive when you do that company name not a lot of recruiters with that type of track record or not a lot of coaches with that type of track record or uh not a lot of uh ceos with that type of track record right it's kind of a a generic sentence but that could that feels like it applies to them specifically you can also say something like hey i noticed that you run the show a company name so i thought you'd be the best person to discuss this with this is also a good one um or you know you can kind of keep more a little bit more casual more informal you can say hey do you help folks with their your audience's service or what they offer right so for example you can say hey do you help folks with their sales mojo or do you help folks with their branding mojo or um with their content marketing mojo and something like that it's a little bit more casual doesn't look like a promotional pitch cold email just a straight up a promotion but keeping a little bit more casual you can also say something like hey i've heard good things about your and their specialization call out their specialization again for that reach out so for example uh i've heard good things about your executive coaching skills for that reach out or you can say hey i've heard good things about your content marketing skills for every child right then let's say they come back to you and say hey like what did you hear about my executive coaching skills right you can just take a look at the website look at one of their case studies and say hey like i've seen on your i've seen on your website that you helped come that company with the executive coaching or that company with the content marketing right if they ask about um what what caught your attention um you can also say maybe did this right you can say hey most people get content marketing completely wrong after checking what you've been doing over at company name i had to reach out you can also say i have to say you are a your audience service wizard right you can say hey i have to say you are a seo wizard let's say you're a lead generation agency and you promise uh seo uh other seo agencies more meetings you can say hey i have to say you are an seo wizard or you're a recruiting wizard it's a little bit more informal it looks less like generic doesn't look like spammy it really looks like you've taken a look at the profile you've taken some time to write a default for all called this one is a very simple one but it can also work hey really impressed by what you've been doing at company name this one wouldn't be my favorite but let's say you don't really wipe or the other ones the other examples don't really click you can always use this one as a backup um and yeah also something along the lines of hey not a lot of recruiters in the uk with that type of track record you're putting a little compliment in there it looks like you've done your research like you um you really looked at what they're doing and calling that out a couple of basic ones here great profile pick on linkedin uh probably this one that was just some notes i wouldn't say this uh um you can let's remove that and um you can say hey so you're on instagram had to reach out your tweets are wild had to reach out um maybe you can say hey you know as a title of a rapidly growing sales company you may be frustrated by your reps performance you're trying to tap into a potential pain point is a little bit more risky right you're putting out there by asking this type of question but if it's true they will respond and say hey yeah you know um i need something to get my team to the next level and uh yeah there's a there's a couple more i'll add them into the list but let's continue with building out our building blocks here so right building block one again is attention you're gonna say and notice that you're running the show at company name so i thought you'd be the best person to discuss this with so here right we're going back by the way we're gonna add first we're gonna add a subject line here as well and let's say which one of the building blocks we want to pick here so building block number one right out of these ones i'm just going to look for the list see which one could be the best right you can say something like i noticed maybe not this one we're going to put all these building blocks together attention authority ask um i already prepped this here i picked one of one out of the list so i'm just going to put this here hey i noticed that you're running the show a company name so i thought you'd be the best person to discuss this with this detention block then let me insert the authority block and right then you just transition it transition from one sentence to the other right good way to transition is just to say so right and notice that you're running to show a company name so i thought you'd be the best person to discuss this with so we helped james see at 400k our revenue cold outreach tool called instantly i think we can do the same for company name and then the ask again like this one is super super easy to do and when you're putting these building blocks together you know just read it out loud like i just did just to see if it if it flows if it if it's easy to read easy to adjust if it does make sense sometimes you'll have to change a couple of words here and there just so it flows more naturally but so we put right all the free building blocks together from what we had here and obviously the offer i'm promoting here is instantly our uh outreach tool 10x your leads meetings and deals so this is what i'm doing outreach for here just for some some contents context but yeah right this could be a really broad offer we can have really broad targeting and still in a way uh even though it's not hyper personalized it's not super specific you can still get good reply rates i did it don't it won't take us a lot of time or a lot of resources a lot of complexity to add personalization and personalized lines or whatever it may be and we have all the building blocks covered okay we have attention 40 ask now moving on i showed you how that looks like into in the instantly accelerator uh these triple a method attention authority ask um initially i learned this from alex berman with the free c method which was a complement case study call to action or the free rs method by jesse oluette so make sure you also check out some of their stuff i'll put their twitter profiles into the description also as the last part of this video i'm going to throw in some bonus ideas that came to mind when i was preparing this video i think it they'll be useful next time you're looking at the blank page in the sequence editor and you're looking for some impulses to start writing but before we do that let me just you know i'm going to format this a little bit just so you can see how that looks how that would look in real life um hey first name you can see how that looks like you can see how the email is going to be able to get the email right now we methodically structure this cold email and now it's ready to go we schedule it we select a couple of uh sending accounts that are going to be rotating and then click launch and we're good to go so just the following in a couple of bonus ideas is um compressing your value prop so when you're in that authority section or you you're showing your valid proposition instead of having like a super long sentence sometimes i see that when people ask me hey can you review my copy and they have like this super long sentence with abstract words transforming radically transforming right this doesn't mean much seamlessly schedule unprecedented number right all of these stuff this is mumbo jumbo in a way you don't want to be using just go straight to the point keep it a simple language and compress it into one simple sentence that's easy to understand and it's believable and compelling okay um another idea that you can friendly to call the email is sports references something i learned from ken falk from the autoop.io agency or let's say you're targeting new york you can say something like hey like we'll help you conquer their marketplace leaving your competitors in a new york nix like rebuilding phase maybe you can put that into into the ps of the uh cold email and you can go here uh and put that in maybe that will get a get a laugh from some people sometimes humor works and cold outreach uh as well and something you can experiment with uh also and then you can use other words uh other than just sales averse right if you say hey we'll get you five more meetings a week with your dream prospects you can say hey we can connect you with um we can connect you with more potential like x potential clients that need help with the service so this is something else that you can think about you can also ask chat gpt to say hey how can i say this thing in a non-salesy way and yeah just a couple of bonus ideas but going back really to the main pillars the main structure of the cold email start with attention then authority and then the ask and that's it and that's it i hope this will help you write cold email copy faster if it was valuable please like and subscribe and talk to you soon
