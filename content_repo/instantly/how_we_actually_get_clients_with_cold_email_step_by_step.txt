Hey guys Raoul here and if you want to see how we write emails and set up campaigns that actually get your clients this video is for you if you like it subscribe leave a comment and the videos i make for whatever reason in sunglasses always get more views we're just gonna roll with it but the content is gonna be as good as ever so let's take email apart there's so many different things that go into it i'm gonna walk you through everything one by one and then explain what we do and why it matters and how we actually turn those emails and all those little things between into clients so let's start with the first one very important thing your emails are not gonna work if you don't nail this down and it's niche and the offer if your niche is saturated it's bad it doesn't help everybody it doesn't hit on the pain points of the main priorities of a company everything you do after like writing the email is set up it doesn't matter like what the esp you're using what tool you're using presenting it's not gonna work if you use a bad niche everything you do after is not gonna work so you want to make sure in the beginning if you don't have a clear niche in mind if you don't have a working agency at the moment just look what's working and do something similar to them just take something that's proven don't try to reinvent the wheel don't try to think of cool things just take something that you know is working that people have gotten some case studies ideally you want to have those case studies but if you don't just like look what is working for other people and then go after those niches and those offers so there are a bunch of examples like even saturated niches can be actually better than unsaturated ones that are unproven so like econ saturated but you can still make it work you just need to find like a unique angle for your offer same with seo everybody's receiving seo offers for 10 20 years if you can make something unique make your offer a little bit better stand out from the crowd then you have a chance of actually getting meetings and getting clients from this email but the niche portion is super important i've made a video about exactly how to select niche how to hit on those priorities for companies if you think about it a cold email angle somebody sends you an email you don't know anything about them and they mention they can help you uh increase your client happiness like is that on your to-do list it's like a good thing to have don't get me wrong but like it's not on a ceo's or a founder's to-do list but what is on their to-do list what's my to-do list is just like increase revenue increase customer lifetime value save time save money decrease costs decrease customer acquisition costs all these things that are priorities for companies are very good offers and work really well with cold email because we're reaching out cold we want to hit on priorities we don't want to sell them something that's at the very bottom of their prior list hope that makes sense and check out our other videos about niche and offer which i'm going to link below so let's say we have a really good niche now we know it's proven we have some case studies our offer is good we know people want it it can actually help people so next part is the setup and here i think the biggest mistake people are making is just over complicating it it's just a cold email we're just sending emails to people don't worry about google workspace or soho or outlook what you have to use just select one if i would recommend one just like google is the best to get started it works it has good deliverability it's a little bit more expensive but just like in the beginning stick with the main guys don't go wild with all of these like custom smtp servers and stuff that you can do but if you're just starting out there's like too many options just pick one you can do all the stuff later if you want to test it out once you have the workspace get one domain get two three emails for that domain whatever domain provider you want to use doesn't matter again just get those three domains connect them instantly set them up correctly we have all the help desk articles about how to set them correctly click the button and instantly to check if everything is set up nicely and then warm them up two three weeks and you can start sending nothing else here in the beginning it can be a little bit intimidating it's actually simple again we have help helpdesk articles and videos about it to help you through it you can reach out to our customer support if you have any questions but once you've done you only have to do it once and you have those accounts you can start using them and once you have the niche and offer our emails have been warmed up for three weeks we can start sending emails but those like through two weeks that we wait in the beginning like we shouldn't just be doing nothing what we should be doing is focusing on getting leads so the lead sources the people that we're going to be targeting there's so many leaders out there but again this shouldn't be like one and done thing you can start with the main players like apollo but you can always just google let's say you want to target recently funded sauce businesses you just entered up to google sauce businesses that got funded or go to crunchbase they have a nice list for it just like google target database your target leads and there's going to be a bunch of other options online again if you're just starting out stick with the main ones apollo you don't have to go crazy but then you can start figuring out stuff that other people aren't using as much you can do custom scraping you can hire people to get leads for you there's many things you can do to find those like unique angles because at some point the lead pockets that other people aren't using are going to be super valuable and that's how we at our lead generation agency we're able to get very good results to some clients there was they were going after some like obscure niches we were afraid in the beginning for example one client wanted to target only sustainable e-com stores and we thought like oh this is like very niche is it gonna work but it actually worked great because we can tie that very niche lead sustainable e-com stores that care about the planet and use that in our email copy that will resonate with the audience much better than just if we're targeting like the entire e-com ecosystem as a whole so go in the beginning broad use the main tools and then start branching out looking other lead sources that are out there and once we have our initial leads then we're going to the copywriting and here's here again like if you go to instant accelerator we have 600 templates in the inside the sequence editor we have tons of templates you can just start with those if you just starting out those are good enough but then going forward you want to when i start getting into the mindset of like the emails that you respond to for me it's like super simple straight for point no fluff and very low action from my part if somebody asks to jump on a call straight away with me it's not gonna be as easy as for me to just like hey can i send you an offer or mind if i send more information i just respond like yeah sure send it and then there's some info and if it's interesting then i'm going to take the step to jump and go with them so try these low effort low touch point ctas they work much better it's a little bit longer sales cycle but that's why it works so those two weeks working on leads copywriting coming up with different angles and for the sequences we're doing around four emails in a total sequence so the first email plus three follow-ups and the follow-ups again like don't overthink it use your templates but the main thing is just to reach out some people were interested they just forgot about it people are very busy hit them up with case studies some new insights that you got very similar clients that you've helped to them just like asking like hey did you see my last email we just helped this client might want to check out this this this our video our bdf my device and adobe just super conversational simple just follow up with them that's easy and the campaign setup as well it's going to be actually there's nothing much to it you can set up like multiple campaigns do av testing and test different angles let's say we're going to be targeting ecom stores so with one email you want to send them over let's say we're google ads agency or ecom stores with one email we can target we can help you grow your revenue that's one campaign for growing revenue one of the top priorities another one can be like decreasing your customer acquisition cost how do we decrease cost try these different angles try case studies try if you have a different pricing option a lot of people are charging based on a fixed retainer if you're pricing on like revenue or like revenue share basis that's a good one to try test it out and just test out these different options until you find one for some clients you're gonna and yourself you're gonna find it like super fast with the first campaigns sometimes it takes 10 20 30 campaigns to find one and for that again in instant accelerator we have tons different options that you can test and once you have those campaigns set up for like two weeks when emails are warmed up let's say they're warmed up now you launch everything start slowly just sending five ten emails a day per email account and you start looking what's coming in if it's positive just go to the inbox turn those leads into meetings i'm going to talk about that but if it's not working you're seeing issues then it's like just daily working on that and again you can jump on webinars with us we can help but it's usually like the same thing you want to play around with those levers that we've been talking about maybe your niche isn't resonating you're not getting like any traction at all you might want to work on your initial offering a little bit maybe your leads weren't good you want to try different lead sources maybe the copy you can try different copy angles but always just test one thing at a time then you can actually find what works if i change everything together i won't know what actually brought in the results if i get results later so you want to be continuously optimizing and once you find a campaign that works then you just scale it up so if you find something you're getting responses don't scale up just by volume because you can burn your domains but you can get more domains you can buy more email accounts and add those to the campaigns and scale it up that way that's how you can long term scale up without the worries of burning down your domains and now let's talk about maybe the most underrated part about turning emails into meetings and turning those positive responses into clients so once you get a response in instantly inbox you have to think of these people as thousand dollar clients they can be like even more let's say you're a seo agency google ads agency you charge 2k a month average client is with you for six months so that's like 12k a year it's a 12k client for you and you get an inbox imagine you get like a note that says like this client's worth 12 000 you wouldn't just like respond like willy-nilly just like softly would be you would go hard you just custom email you would like look at the website see something that you can do you would go the extra mile like this is what you need to do the first email customize it go the extra mile uh write something that's very specific to them that hits on the pain point like make it based on what they asked if that's like hey you can call me actually call them don't send your calendar link if they ask like hey you have time is this in this time and again yeah perfect i booked you in for that time i call it book them in if they propose a ton of words for you so base it on their email and then go the extra mile and then if they don't respond to your list next email that you respond to their interested email you need to follow up you need to follow up until you get a no that's how you're gonna get again so many more of these meetings that turn into clients you need to be relentless and understand like like i mentioned every opportunity in your inbox is worth thousands of dollars you just need to go the extra mile and these are the where the money is the closest to you everybody likes to like work on the campaigns create these like new stuff but these are like it's so close like they're already interested they showed they want to see more information you had them on the hook now it's like on you to go really hard and get them on the board get them to that meeting with you and offer them something that can actually help them to turn them into a client so i would say like this is the first part of cold event that people are underestimating how much effort they have to put in because it's a cold prospect it's not like a referral where it's like oh my friend recommended jump on call already trust you no this is cold same as we have to be very uh our offer has to be very big priority for them it has to be same with the inbox management like we have to be on point all the time they know anything about you they don't have to care it's your job to make them care and once you have them on the meeting that's the next part like we've done all the email stuff we've done the setup we've done the copywriting now we have them on the call and if you don't know how to close like those emails again are not going to work so it's very important to look full up and be good at closing even so i recommend going through the closing section in instant accelerator it's free you can check out all the videos and articles we made but pretty much what you want to do is you start the call by asking questions you want to honestly learn about them see what their business is doing see what their business's goals are see if they align with your offer and then show your offer show the case studies if you have them what you've done to very similar class customers and then walk them through high level of how it works and then q a have them ask questions and if it works then you can show the pricing you can start like asking straight uh on the call like if you're interested usually they say they have to talk to partner whatever you can do some objection handling trying to get them over the line main thing here again same with uh the inbox management if you get a lead you have to be relentless and i don't mean in a bad way that you just have like push them like don't be pushy like i don't like that be respectful of what they want but it is like yeah i need to discuss from the team like great i understand i'll do the same uh is it okay if we book you in for a meeting in like two days uh three days and then book them in on the call it's like always have the next step ready and don't leave the call oh yeah we're going to talk with the team and let's reach out uh once we've done that then that's never going to work so we just want to focus on what they're actually doing and then offer it straight away on that call book in next steps and after the call is over then again now again a lot of people do the demo and they don't message people back reach out straight away send them a conclusion and then you can send what we call carpet pools you can message people like hey we had a great call uh if we can get you started this week i can get you 1k discount if you are willing to give me a referral so go through our sales part because it's very important it's the last part maybe the hardest one but if you nail it down and you do it nicely in a consulting manner and actually help people you're going to turn so many more of the initial work and leads that you did into actual clients and then once you get those clients you can use those clients to get more clients and it gets easier and easier and easier so to recap have a really good niche working an offer the setup just select something go for it like use our instructions don't go crazy don't go trying something while leads start with the basic stuff then go in depth copywriting just try different angles campaign setup just simple use one two three four messages in the email all the other settings just keep them as ease automation scaling if you're not if the campaigns are not working daily look what you can change try different angles try different options if it's working you want to scale get new email accounts instead of firing the email limits to avoid burning your domains once you get an interested reply go hard these people are very valuable write custom emails follow up with them until you get a no once you have a meeting be respectful learn about your business see if you can actually help if you can help them then there's no reason why they shouldn't buy for you if that money makes sense again follow up with them until they close that's how you actually turn how we turn our code emails into clients it takes a lot of time but once you get it down you can hire people from different portions of it it doesn't have to be you always that does this but in the first if you're starting out you should be learning this you should be going through everything all the parts creating SOPs for a team and after that you can scale so i hope it helps and let me know if you
