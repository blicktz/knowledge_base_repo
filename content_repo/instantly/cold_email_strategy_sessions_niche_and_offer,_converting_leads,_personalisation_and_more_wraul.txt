hey guys welcome to the incestly strategy webinar if you want to jump on here and ask the founders of incestly everything or anything you need about cold email you can get our live coaching calls in here strategy sessions and let's jump into the first question hey i need some help selecting a niche for pitching marketing and rebranding services too so that's first off it's like really broad marketing and rebranding services what i would do is i would go to internet accelerator initial offer so we have our initial for master class just to quickly give it a feedback of what i would focus on is the offer with cold email has to be especially good simple and a priority for the company so imagine we're reaching out to these people completely cold they don't know anything about us it has to be something that's on their priority list something that's on their to-do list if you're targeting ceos like what do they want they want to make more money for the company so that's something that you should pitch on so the niche for like marketing rebranding i think like rebranding or like design is a good example of like something that's like very hard to sell if you come from that rebranding or design angle because it's very situational right i don't need new design before i need it and you could use an angle where you use like design that helps you convert more clients that's better like we help to create converting landing pages that's something that i would do then second part it saves time so again like if you're offering marketing services if you're spending right now doing it manually or their team is spending a lot of time if you can help them save time then you should mention that saves money again if you have an offer that's cheaper than what's out there use that then it's a priority for the company then again like that's the biggest thing like i received so many emails but i only respond if it's right now my priority for instantly so multiple providers that's a really good one it pretty much means if you're selling something that's common asia services facebook ad agency development services something that every company almost has it's very hard for you to come in and just take over their spot right it's very hard unless you have a unique offer much cheaper you do it much better but the niche for like what you can use this for like multiple providers is let's say sales commissioning sales right now if let's say instant has five sales people if i add more it's not going to take anything away from my offer i can stack these providers on top of each other but i can't have multiple facebook ads agencies i can't have multiple design agencies doing the same stuff right so that's what the multiple providers mean and all of these are like the best case the best of what you can do you don't have to have everything if you have a service that usually takes like one one provider for a company then you need to focus very strong on other ones you need to make them understand why you're better while you're doing this better than other ones and same for fast results so whatever your offer is that you want to build go for something that you can show results fast even if it's just like the first one like if you're doing facebook ads i can get your first ads up and running in two days i already have the first ads designed for you mind if i send them over so the faster you can show results the more response you're going to get then a clear roi it's the same it's very hard to show roi just like rebranding just design but if you say like we create landing pages that convert more it's easy you pay us 10k you convert two percent more that's like 100k over a year easy roi right and then emerging but proven market here again marketing rebranding has been around forever but can we add something that's emerging and proven right now so if you think about it right now ai is huge can you use an ai angle can you bake chat gpt open ai some other ai algorithm into offering that would pique to interest more so if you're doing let's say copy you can start using ai if you're doing like personalization ads personalization for ads you can use ai to personalize for entire groups start thinking about these unique ways and again this is going to help you stand up if you're in a market where only one provider can do it so if i have an old facebook agency let's say for recently but someone came along and said like hey raul i have this new tech ai we built this for like six months it gets 10 better results 20 cheaper because like ai runs it we have like manual manual rules on how it optimizes the ads how it scales them up scales them down so it's much faster like that picks my interest even if i have an agency that already works for me i would love to give it a go again fast growing market same like stick with something that's like new growing experience again like if you're asking me about your niche very important part is like you have the domain expertise like if you know some industry specific knowledge not many people know you have a huge advantage so the example with facebook ads if i reach out to like hey i've been doing facebook ads 10 years everybody's doing it wrong right now or like they're doing it in a old-fashioned way the new feature that we built or the new strategy we're using this is like where it's heading like you know something others people don't that makes me interested i might respond then done for you so again like if you can offer something that is complete hands-off much easier to digest for a founder that is super busy and then adding performance based and currently just to build the trust okay we have a follow-up question okay so basically i'm offering the whole marketing and branding packages data to prospects but can't get around figuring out exactly what they need so really good question and it is hard so we want to focus focus again on this thing let's go to the actual niche calculator so this is all in the accelerator you can use it but what you want to do is you want to take all of these marketing and branding packages you want to tear them apart you want to separate them and create these like offers packages services that you can sell and for example if you're a marketing agency you can offer the entire marketing package you can offer seo facebook ads sales lead generation design so do all of this separately like web design go through it does that make money does it save time web development facebook ad agency go through all of the different angles that you can hit all the services you're offering pick them apart add them up here based on what we just discussed look at the score and start with the one that has the best score because that's usually the best one like it's going to resonate more it's going to help people more it's going to help them get results faster it's going to make them more money compared to other ones and like if you're trying to be this like one size fits all solution or like or do everything it's very hard to get your foot across the door you can always sell it later all the other services if you see a need for it but i would start with the highest highest score niches and offers that you can do so that's what i would start with and you can already get some like examples here that we've broken down and based on your own experience you can just like go down the line and start with that and then do let's say like pick three of these different ones and create three campaigns one for facebook ad agency one for lead generation one for web development web design and then send 200 250 emails see if you get a positive response and then go through that so if you go here start limits you see here so you want to get around like one positive response for 200 emails and change corporate targeting if you know responses and one close for a 2.5k email set this is approximate numbers but if you're not getting this you need to change something so change the targeting the copy the angle and yeah just you need to be testing and trying it out but the good thing is like because you are offering multiple services like 100 people need that like marketing is never going to go away it's evergreen we have services that help people make money you just need to figure out a nice way of packaging it by adding all the stuff we just discussed like can you add ai can you try something more here follow-up question should i write more generic copy which includes everything include the points you made or something specific in which process reply and talk about bigger picture so you can try both but based on my experience more specific is better i give you tell me all like we take care of marketing services we take care of everything marketing related it just sounds like too broad like you're sending this for everybody you want to show the prospect you know what they're dealing with like what their problems are right now you want to show them that you know the market and then offer a solution based on that how can you offer like hey we do everything for you if you don't even know if they need it it's not there for you to be in the the business and you don't know if they don't have any other differently so on the call you can really dig deep into this learning about exactly what they're doing what they need where you can help but for a cold email like i mentioned people are busy you need to make them understand like hey i know what you're dealing with so that's where the targeting and and like focus comes into play and it meshes with the niche and offer so let me see if I can find a good example if you go to copywriting operating masterclass maybe even the avatar sheet so if you take this one and you understand the target niche like maybe there's like a sub niche there so instead of going after e-commerce stores you help sustainable makeup stores sustainable ecosystem it's already better you know their mission you know their perfect client and then you bake that into offer so instead of this generic like hey we can help you do seo facebook ads this and that or an e-commerce store hey we help sustainable makeup stores producing quality products while putting the people in plant first find the perfect clients you can even join them like women between 25 and 40 with our new ai generated facebook ads uh might have a share more info this is always so much better than this generic offer and then you know like ceos they need to run the team increase revenue marketing managers they need to hit the quarterly benchmarks so maybe start with this avatar sheet sheet understand your targets first what they need what they're struggling with and then write your emails based on that underneath based on that try different value props for example increase sales with tiktok ads some people just want to like grow sales or grow your audience in tiktok they just want to get more visitors reach millions of people you can try from zero to 10k in a day in two months case studies we already helped this kind of company guarantee but i think maybe like the case studies also super underrated because if you already have case studies you know what worked you know what kind of companies you helped and then you can just reach out to similar companies and tell them like you can do the exact same thing and then try different ctas and then you can try like some random stuff that also work is more like copywriting but let's say you're targeting people in la or uk you know some uk specific slang some words for example we had a really good campaign we targeted people in the midlands which is like a region in uk okay also know each other from midlands and that got a really good response because people are like i am from midlands too putting all these pieces together and then you're going to start getting more and more responses so i hope that makes sense so if you go to accelerator copywriting take the avatar sheet then mission offer take the niche calculator split it up order offers and see what's the best and highlight those with the best angles that you can come up with and then you're already ahead of 90 people that are doing cold emails all right next question about how can i convert leads from my inbox to meetings not having a lot of success so again if you go to accelerator sales sales master class and turning industry leads into meetings so a couple of things here so first quick turnaround is like obvious you should have instantly open all the time uh like as long as you can because if you get a buzz response the faster you respond the more people can get on calls because they're right now in the mindset they're interested if you respond like tomorrow they've already maybe forgotten about it so the best response is better and then you're like book a 10-15 minute slot from time to time in your candle if you want to like check it for responding or you have it open all the time and then make your response specific and tailored so if they respond like hey can you call me don't send your calendar link if you respond like hey monday 1pm works again book them in for monday 1pm don't send your calendar link so be make it specific and then another one to make it specific is you can have like macros there's like pre-made templates that you can respond like this one i said like hey can i send you a loom on how we did this and she said like yes please send so the lazy respond would be just hey here's the loom let me know if any questions the better approach would be i actually go to her website maybe check check what they're doing i want to check out your website seeing what's it about and i must look hey check out the website seems you're doing this for this i know exactly what works i record like a loom check it out here and based on what i saw on your website i would love to try this this this uh are you available tomorrow or wednesday 1pm for a quick 15-minute call to see if we can help you so take that extra time to put it in like if you're struggling with converting them in the beginning make it more customized respond manually it takes more work but you're going to get the hang of it and then you can start doing macros and responding more more uh more generic i want you like learn what works and let's go back sales masterclass some final stuff yeah money's in the follow-up if they were interested you responded don't respond back then don't be afraid to just reach out again like reach out every day and they'll respond usually people are like thankful i have so many times just like forgotten about the deal and then i reach out because they followed up this works like just don't be afraid to follow up and especially if you're like an agency one client is worth thousands of dollars tens of thousand dollars over the lifetime like we should be treating them as ten thousand dollar customers not like this lease in our inbox like take the time follow up it's worth a lot of money initial call to it's super short as short as possible 15 minutes like don't ask them to book a 60 minute call if you don't even know if you have the money or if you can help them that scares people just like 15 minutes super quick and then yeah going the extra mile like one of our best clients in our lead change agency uh we targeted income stores and this dude actually bought their product of the e-commerce store that i got a response hey i tried this i received this product you put an instant story can't wait to try like you can imagine this gets many more responses you're taking the extra mile so again if one client's worth a lot of money to you it makes sense to do this so put in that effort and this is a little bit counterintuitive but be vague about your pricing and strategy you want to analyze your business first you want to understand if you can actually help them before giving a pricing you can give a range some people are like very persistent they want it so you can always like do it maybe they don't have the money so it's actually good you don't do a call if you tell them it's like 2k they can't afford it then like a call wouldn't have helped so but i try to be vague just don't understand the strategy and tell them like you want to understand the business first and just go over a high level of how it works so i hope that helped let's see next question how long should code even be because if i close all this stuff it's going to be way too long isn't it yeah so like i mentioned as short as possible again if you go to copywriting we have tons of examples and i wouldn't include everything just include like one but we have for example like even one sentence email okay we build a tool that can help to get 500 minutes a month might have to send more info like this will work better than long email so make it as short as possible just go through the different angles that we have in here and you see like all of these are like a couple of sentences it's not too long and you can also go to campaigns sequences templates so we have tons from like lead generation video production marketing advertising just go through the templates here we also have if you go copywriting 600 templates so you can get it from here and you see most of them like short couple of sentences max don't make it bigger unless it's tailored and very specific precise for them our next question if i export data on leads from a very large file more than 700 000 leads which categories are more useful which should we choose something later filter between these leads and play with them for a long time so there's a very specific question like i don't know what columns you have but fields are like if you take like this like lead finder i would start like if you're talking about a lead finder i would start as precise as possible let's say i take uh media uh so i could do like 1 million results but i would definitely do like ceos first so 11 000 i would even do less like let's say location i want to the united states so if you can already do this i would start with these like pockets i would split up that 700k leads into more manageable targeted approaches you can just like go out and blast 700k leads but it's gonna it's not gonna feel personalized right but with this one i can already say like instead of just hey we help media companies like i said we had media company ceos from united states already better then again if you go to accelerator copywriting and okay research collecting data so resonating variables so this is like the ideal thing what you're gonna do so if you have a large group you can just say like we help ecom source grow so this has two variables one generic niche ecom and one generic value prop will grow so like two points but if you can go more targeted or split up that list you can say we help female founders in la curter sustainable makeup brands while putting the band the people first so we have a gender variable female one position we help founders location la value prop grow sub niche so we help sustainable income stores not everybody just sustainable ones sub niche again not just ecom stores but makeup stores resonating variable like brands and then mission so you even show them like oh we know your mission because they're sustainable they want to help the planet and the people so eight points it's much better than this generic one so you should go through a list and seeing exactly what you can help with and what you can like get out of that list like all the variables if you start with lead finder just go as specific as possible in the beginning and then go generic after okay and final question it's like instantly plan i have purchased a 97 plan i get 25 000 contacts each so that 25 000 for the incentive plan is just like active lease limit just like how much you can have on your account at any given time so if you want to like you do a campaign for 25 000 people it's a huge campaign and then you want to do another one so you have two options you can either get the add-on for increasing your outreach plans so you get like 25 more so now you can have 50 on a contact or just delete the 25 and then reach out to new people so that's the two ways but it's like the activity limit but for the lead finder it is like you get 20 10 000 or thousand leads every month so hope that makes sense um hope it was helpful uh you can again if you're checking out next week's all the other live coaching sessions are in here and see you in the next one thank you
