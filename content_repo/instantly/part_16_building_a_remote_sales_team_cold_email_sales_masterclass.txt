so once you've figured out the sales process yourself you can predictably get leads and close them you can start building a commission on your remote sales team this is one of the highest leverage activities you can do for a business it's super valuable if you do it right and it's easy if you have a strong sales process and an offer making it easy for a sales rep to get started quickly and close more you should first build out the sales process yourself and once you're closing consistently 20 30 percent of qualified code leads you're going to start thinking about building a team without a proven sales process the reps would have to figure everything out on their own and it's going to be super hard for them to work especially to work on commission if you're already built an outreach engine with instantly you can start handing them demos straight away instead of having them build out the engine for themselves and getting leads later like we talked about the lag they should build it for themselves like the outreach engine they're going to get so even more opportunities like that but if you can help them already in the beginning by giving them leads they're going to get started faster you're going to make money sooner so the commission structure these are the examples make sure to make it work with your ticket size and public margin so usually you have a commission structure like this 20 for an open close if the rep gets the demo and they close this is the highest value they can bring you 15 percent of an impact close we get the demo for the sales rep and they close so here we do the part of just hand them the lead they get paid a little bit less and five percent of it closed them what they booked for somebody else so if they're not good at sales they just want to do getting the leads part you get five percent just by getting the lead and if somebody closes it and then showing reps the earning potential so let's say they want to earn 5k with 25 25 close rate you need five closes at 5k ticket you need around 20 output demos a month with 25 close rate you need to send around 2 000 emails monthly with 1 booking rate you would need to send out 83 emails daily for 10k just double numbers or sell higher tickets just again making them understand realistically what the numbers are use your numbers in here what your close rates are don't show fake numbers or just like some theoretical ones show them the actual numbers that you've seen with your own outreach and then how you can find reps once you have a good converting offer you can find reps pretty easily you can post your offer the earning potential and tell them you have a pool and sales process reps are looking for this they're looking for good opportunities where they can just close they don't want to deal with figuring out the materials like working on the documents if you build this up for them it's going to be relatively easy so you can use Twitter reach out to sales reps post on Twitter AngelList really good and meet Frank like these three are already really good to get started and then onboarding you should create a checklist to get them started quickly and here's an example that we used so it shows exactly step by step what I have to do access to the accounts system folder slack access sending emails and then closing reading through the materials getting comfortable access to everything deck access all the tools they need just create this kind of like token for them and just like start checking it off one by one make it easy to onboard the sales reps so you want to be organized and have all other sales materials in Google Drive folder you can easily share them you can eliminate guesswork for them make it as easy as possible for your reps to start closing and then management and tracking sheet so very important part is just tracking the performance and having a tracking sheet ready for them again the documents are going to be in the guide and I'm going to link them below where just like mark how many demos scheduled how many showed up you can see the show up rate they must close close rate revenue sold cash collected and they should fill it out daily and then you get a monthly overview in here and then you should do daily calls with reps where you go over the tracking sheets and help them with the questions or problems they might have let top rep share what's working for them your templates your demo recordings this is how you make your entire team better and create a strike to slack zap to celebrate means inside slack when reps see other reps closing and winning it pushes them even more and creates friendly competition so here's another one 6500 everybody's congratulating auto rep seats working they get pushed more and more so this is mostly the management part but you have to do daily just keep to moderate to daily calls and ask them what would help them make their life easier and work on those assets as a founder it's the highest leverage activity that you can do
