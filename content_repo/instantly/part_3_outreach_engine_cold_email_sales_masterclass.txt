and before we get into the steps and setting everything up you're only going to get good at sales if you do a lot of sales calls so Alex from always just tweeted about the same thing 10 000 cold calls will teach you more about sales than any book will and this is so true there are so much content out there this guide included which will give you some tips and tricks and how to make your life easier when you're doing sales but at the end of the day you're only going to get good at this if you actually do sales calls so the most important thing is to build yourself an outreach engine to fill your pipeline with leads when starting out you should do everything you can to get at least one sales call a day set that as a benchmark and then get better from there keep improving and optimizing the sales process on the feedback that you're getting from the calls and this is our step-by-step guide we used in our agency to book one to ten meetings daily and the link is in the description and also in the document but this is the exact same outreach engine we built for ourselves with all the numbers all the tools just follow this if you don't have any experience start with this set this up first start reaching out to people and then start working on the sales process it makes no sense to start working on the sales process before you're actually getting leads and this is what I noticed a lot when teaching other people called email or closing there's so many things you can do right it's it's overwhelming so instead of doing everything and looking a couple of months in the future focus on what you need right now if you don't have any demos in your calendar why would you start creating and working on a sales process you need to fix that part getting demos on your calendar when you see the demo for tomorrow they're like oh I need to start working on sales process then you get the motivation and you're much more likely to actually build something and of course it's not going to be as good in the beginning but start with one step just build the Legion engine set this up first and then start working on the sales process also remember that outreach and sales has at least one to two month lag all the accounts you're going to set up and the campaigns you create today we start getting your meetings in two to four weeks it's not going to be instant they're going to warm up the accounts you're going to send them out it's going to be a lot of testing in the beginning to figure out what works in two or four weeks you're going to start getting meetings and then once you get those meetings they're not going to close straight away it's going to take one to four weeks minimum to start getting closes and getting money in the bank account once you get the system rolling it gets much much easier but you need to be willing to keep hustling for at least one to two months with minimal gains and this is the main reason why most people won't do it and give up after a week or two so I think pretty much everybody has felt this when you try to go to a gym I'm going to try a diet you can do it for a couple of weeks like easily you can motivate yourself but then you're not really seeing the gains and then everything else seems like more lucrative you're going to try this system right now maybe you're pumped you're ready like you're willing to do it you do it for two weeks and haven't had any closes and then you should tweet about something new some new system and you give up and that's the reason why many people fail and I've had the same thing jumping between different strategies different courses instead of focusing on just one thing and making it happen I remember with our incident department meals we were in Georgia last year and when we start the agency I think it was one two months after we started the agency and we've only had like a couple of closes and we're already on the board like hey should we do this like should we try something new but for whatever reason we said like no let's keep pushing it's going to be a lag but if we keep pushing we just focus on this we don't do anything else we just focus on sales let's see what happens and we agreed to focus at least a couple of more months on it and then the next month after that was a best month it was literally just it was a lagging all the work we did in the months before then started catching up so if you ever feel like it's not going to work give it an extra two months and then see if it doesn't work after you've tried it for three or four months full time you're given all your effort then yes maybe this is not for you but don't give up easily that's how most people fail just step by step build the outreach engine then start working on the sales process then you're going to start seeing the results okay let's get into the next video you you you you you
