welcome everybody to another episode of cold emails hot takes cody it's great to have you on the podcast awesome no thanks for having me this is awesome yeah awesome yeah for the viewers listening cody is the cmo and co-founder of in-house outbound systems.io i've seen him on twitter post some insane results that he's been getting with his cold email campaigns so i had to get him on the podcast to learn more and i have to say just reading some of your tweets gets me hyped up and cody can you tell the viewers listening a little bit more about what you do yeah yeah of course knows um so basically what we do at in-house outbound systems is we set up in-house cordial infrastructure for companies who you know if they already have like the foundations of you know a good cordial campaign which is you know they have a good offer they have social proof they have some sort of product market fit and then most of the time they already have like a video sales letter and then a solid landing page and some sort of decent online presence we essentially set up the cordial infrastructure personalize each cold email so like the offer is basically like we'll give you the vehicle and set up the system so you can send 20,000 personalized cold emails every single month to your idle clients and then also that's that's kind of like my end what my partner does as well is like that's the top of the funnel which is the cold emails and then the middle of the funnel would essentially be like the sales process the automations which i'll get into a little bit later but that's kind of like what we do at in-house outbound systems me and my partner build the in-house cordial infrastructure and then also crm automations to automate a high percentage of the sales process as well okay gotcha so you you alluded alluded to it a little bit but what are some components to this in-house outbound systems what are the pieces that go into it yeah so basically like it's it's a variety of different moving pieces but generally speaking like it's quite literally just like you know a healthy number of secondary domains usually connecting one to two inboxes per domain whether that is you know google inboxes outlook inboxes slash microsoft inboxes or zoho inboxes as well and then scraping list of leads um you know scraping list leads whether that is apollo um crunchbase find email linkedin sales navigator depending on like what the targeting is whether it's b2b or b2c and then also verifying the list of leads cleaning the list of leads um you know verifying with never balance cleaning with scrubby.io and then that's the domain side the lead side and then scripts as well using script frameworks um that are kind of like proven and tested and like plugging and playing like their specific offer their specific like target market like pain points their goals their desires like plugging that into this system and then also leveraging personalization at scale um in terms of you know leveraging either ai or vas to research specific touch points that's kind of like the cold email aspect and then also when it comes like this entire system like i said luke is luke is very very good that's my partner very very good at like the crm side so not only do we set up the kind of like the initial cold email automations and then the follow-up automations on that we also set up so like as soon as a prospect does respond they're either you know inbox management automations follow-up automations pre-call drip sequences to warm up the prospect before they even hop on the call and then also post-call nurture sequences after the call and then you know no-show automations client onboarding automations like this entire system and funnel like it basically it sets up like their marketing it can essentially like replace like a cmo or like some sort of marketing director or some sort of sales rep on the on the marketing side but also like the sales side as well like it you know covers a high percentage of like all the these sales processes as well so that's kind of like what it looks like on like how exactly we work in terms like the marketing and then the sales we kind of just like combine both of our offers um into one and just doing that for the done for you right now okay awesome man that sounds like a really good offer like really covering all the bases not just bringing in the interested lead but also everything that happens after that and exactly you mentioned personalizing cold email at scale when you're sending high volume how do you still manage to personalize without spending a lot of energy or resource resources into that yeah so there's a couple different tricks um that i found out i probably can't go into every single one right now but if you're targeting like let's say for example most people like they just scrape like 10 000 leads and then they just like put it all in one campaign i like to do if it's like 10 000 people like five different campaigns more or less like one campaign very very targeted towards if it's a cmo versus founder and then like use their specific pain points use their specific goals and like tailor that like tailor that copy specifically towards them and then obviously the founder as well if it's d to c i always get vas to manually research specific things so for example if you're targeting e-commerce you need to get very very specific in the targeting like you can't just target all e-commerce i think everybody knows this like you can't just target like all e-commerce brands you need to target like looking for beauty brands that are running ads that are at this amount of employees and then like the cmo right what i do is like if it's like some sort of like ad creative offer or like like you're offering ad creatives or like you're offering tick tock ads facebook ads something like that i get vas to manually go through and see their facebook ad library and put inside the google sheet like number one like put the word put the number one if they're running video ads put the number two if they're running like still ads like you know regular ads or number three if they're not running ads at all or number four if they're running like ugc and then like like filter them specifically like export them and put them inside of instantly so like this campaign is only going to guys who are running ugc ads this campaign is only going to guys to e-commerce brands that are running um video ads or still ads and basically like tailor the copy towards them specifically like hey saw that you're running ugc ads on facebook and then going to the actual pitch that's one way as well like to get very very very niche down and personalized i also like to use ai it's like quick lines or line.ai and it basically like you just i'm sure you know about this you basically just put in like first name last name job title company name the website and then the linkedin as well it's going to essentially like do that research aspect for you look on their linkedin their articles their website any sort of podcast and bring out a research first line from there sometimes as you know like ai is a little bit kind of like robotic so i get va's to go through that manually as well and basically like if it sounds robotic like i need you to say it out loud so it sounds very very natural and either using that research first line which most of the time it's actually pretty good like it's not bad at all it shows it shows a prospect that you did research touch points which is like the main thing that they want to know you either use it as the first line or the ps or the second email as well so i've i've done a bunch of a b testing it kind of depends on the target market and you can run that test as well but that's kind of like how i personalize that skill it's d2c also using like the product names so just like adding that extra bit of personalization like by the way love your product name seeing if they're running ads or like any sort of like research touch points that a virtual assistant can do like you got to get super i always get like super creative like a couple coffees maybe a cigarette or two like get super in that creative flow state and then also like see like what exactly i can like extract from virtual assistants on my team virtual assistants like go through find this touchpoint and then instead of like writing a personalized first line for each one which takes like dude like like last year i was doing this i'm pretty sure everybody was they were paying like one dollar a first line i just pay you know it's super cheap to like not like write a personalized first line but like just to like find something like a key factor and like what exactly differentiates them and like say that inside the actual code email um and that's super super easy to do at scale okay awesome man those are some really really good pointers that people can implement and the next question would be um i've heard you talk about using different email providers at the same time right usually people only use g suite they ask hey should i use g suite should i use outlook should i use zoho i've seen you talk about using different pro email providers at at the same time can what is that about how did you come up with the idea yeah so i actually so nick abraham talks about this a lot and he's kind of i would say he's like a mentor to me like he's very very smart with code he's been in the game for a long time um he's an awesome dude as well yeah he basically talks about like nick one of the smartest dudes in the cold email game i learned a lot from him as well yeah shout out nick he's a homemate um basically so like instead of doing like he basically says so like buy the domains and then set up it's like outlook zoho and then g street as well and the base actually i saw this in instantly earlier today you guys added this like mx matching which is super sick i didn't know that until today i'm not sure like when you guys added that just added it today oh sick okay cool yeah basically like it's it helps deliverability for all the viewers basically it helps deliverability so like they can see and i'm sure like there's a system on the back end of instantly where like as soon as you put in the list of leads you can essentially see like or actually the software instantly can see if you know the prospect's email address is either zoho outlook or gmail and it connects your gmail with their gmail your outlook with their outlook your zoho with their zoho and that kind of like stops through balances it increases deliverability tenfold um in terms of like you know open rates are obviously going to increase the reply rates are going to increase as well not a lot of people do this most people just set up like you know g suites and then if the prospect's email address is you know something other than g suite sometimes the deliverability lowers but this is a very very good way to like ensure i mean there's so many different factors in terms of like going straight to the inbox but this is another like very very it was kind of esoteric but now now it's a little bit more known but like it's very very it's a very very good way to like increase deliverability ensure you're seeing like 95 to 97 percent delivery rate i think everything else is in place in terms of delivery no definitely yeah we're going to start recommending that also more and more to use a variety of different uh sending providers or email providers um not just not just having one um great yeah so um i was looking at your twitter earlier and i saw a couple of days ago you mentioned a loom personalized video strategy for positive replies can you tell me more about that that one and you mentioned also something about embedding the calendly cta in the loom how does how does that look if if you're down to share it yeah and i can share some sauce so basically as soon as soon as a prospect so this was like this was like 10 days ago the friday that friday and saturday we got like eight or ten leads from cold email that like either wanted a video or wanted more information i kind of like i was you know i think this was a saturday where i posted that i was basically you know ripping a ton of loom videos like five and the videos that go over the entire process they're all manual as well i'm sure there's a way to automate it like the first half is personalized and like the second half is automated but i set it up so like as soon as you know they responded to cold email i put in the loom video record a quick loom video have my face my voice as well going over my process because most people just do written text right prospect says you know can i have more information they write it out some sort of copy and paste template i like to get a lot more personal and i like my clients to do that as well basically you know have you have your voice out there your face the thumbnail as your face like on their website to show that you know you actually took the time to you know record a quick video tell them about yourself colleagues after you can help them your offer your social proof and then obviously call to action as well so that's kind of like what to do in terms of the process i always do like like top right like at the end of the video i'm always like click right here if you want to if you wanted to hop on a call or learn learn more it's basically just like the embedded link of my calendar and then that's kind of like so record the video send it in the email embed the call to action and then also we have automation where we essentially like as soon as a prospect does respond excuse me and then they're put in the interested um category inside of our crm it automates a linkedin connection request so not only did we send them a cold email did they respond with positive interest we recorded the loom video embedded our calendar link and then we automated a linkedin connection request now for linkedin's like i always recommend a very very optimized profile so you know good headline a lot of recommendations a lot of endorsements and then like a featured section needs to be filled with social proof filled with value um and filled with things that you know your prospects or you like other like your competitors are charging for right i give them so much value they think to themselves like well this guy knows exactly what he's doing he's solving my problems for free i cannot imagine if i actually paid for him or if i actually paid him and worked with them so there's so many like moving pieces like with my linkedin like i always try to post every single day like super valuable content so not only are they getting the cold email like they see that you know i i post a lot of content most a lot of valuable content on linkedin but i'm not sending sending them a loom video with a call to action on the calendar link and then i kind of like warming them up so once they do hop on a call they're a lot more inclined to like trust me and then a lot more inclined to actually like hop on the call as well with like this many like foundations and then also the video sales over on the landing page helps a ton yeah people underestimate uh how many people that before they reply to a cold email they're going to check out your social presence linkedin they're going to check out your website look at your vsl and that can really help boost your reply rates or even after they replied said you said sure i'm interested to hear more or sure i'm open to get on a call they're going to check you out so make sure uh you know your social presence and the website and everything is on point it really helps with the actual performance of the cold email campaign no it is that's like that i think that's like one of the most important factors of the cold email campaign like usually me and luke who are done for you offer like we only take on people who already have a good offer they already have good social proof and then they already have some sort of product market fit and then if they don't have you know those things those key those key factors that we just said knows in terms of like a video sales order they actually have a decent landing page decent vsl decent linkedin as well like we kind of we kind of add that on as a bonus because we're obviously going to see a lot better results if they already have some sort of social presence because like you said as soon as someone gets a cold email like they don't know who you are so i think the best thing to do is just like build content outside of cold email which is inevitably going to help cold email see the better results um not a lot of people talk about that but that is such an important factor no no definitely and at the beginning of the conversation you talked a little bit about copy frameworks as well right you in this in-house outbound system you help people create the first copy or come up with the first copy with the messaging what's your creative process like you mentioned the smashing some coffees some nicotine as well what's your creative process like to to write some really good compelling cold emails yeah so i really like if you know christian from knowledge x um he's a homie as well he helps a lot with copy um i learn a lot from him he's he's very very awesome at writing cold email copy um but yeah basically use the same like very very similar frameworks and then add a little bit of sauce as well but yeah in terms of the creative creative process like i said a couple coffees couple cigarettes um and then some sort of like deep flow music as well um and then in terms of the frameworks just literally leveraging already existing social proof that you have and then low friction call to actions leveraging sales assets as well leveraging personalization at scale like there's so many things that there's so many a b tests like there really is like so many different a b tests that you could you know leverage and then also um if you're sending like if you're sending like 10 20 30 000 cold months a month like there's so many different tests that you could create um same thing with like ad creatives and laying pages it's like you don't know what works until you actually try it so just testing so many um different you know different initial quality most follow-ups angles messages sequences offers as well and then like seeing what works turning off what doesn't work and then optimizing and scaling up with the ones that don't work but usually if you're sending that many cold emails and you're testing a variety of different a b a b testing um you're definitely gonna find a winner if you have like all those foundations and you're sending that many cold emails okay great you mentioned uh going heavy on on social proof and you mean like uh adding case studies like specific stories of other uh customers that your clients helped or like is that case studies or how do you mean social proof yeah so in terms of social proof like there's so many different ways to leverage social proof so i like to use like if we're targeting like i only target companies most of the time i only target like niches that my clients have case studies and have solid case studies in so we're using those case studies inside of the actual cold email whether that is like a recent win or once in its case study and then also using that case studies inside of them on the landing page whether that's you know i always recommend get video testimonials video interviews before and after screenshots um case studies i get a quantifiable results in a quantifiable time frame and then also in the vsl as well so go and go over your process and then at the end or in the beginning depending on like what exactly they want to do put that case study like talk about it like absolutely like exert that bit those bits of social proof into the ether into the world and make sure that you're actually like telling people about that because if you have some people are super shy about this it's like why would you be shy you're literally showing a company that you felt a company very very similar to them so like don't be shy about that at all make sure that they know that you know you've had you have such for helping a company very very similar to them you could help them so put it in your full email your video sales letter your landing page and then your linkedin featured section as well which not a lot of people do but i think that's so important okay great yeah definitely like it's one thing to get people results but then you also have to capture the testimonials from their results stop being shy and then like really presenting that to the world shouting it from the rooftops exactly great uh cody quick intermission uh you call if you switch to a couple a cold email rapid fire questions sure let's do a couple quick ones what are your favorite b2b data sources b2b i like i usually use find email.com linkedin sales navigator apollo uplead lead shark um that and then crunchbase as well sometimes but those are kind of like the b2b databases that i use okay gotcha uh what are some of your favorite subject lines here's subject clients i mean quick question never fails quick question question for company company name something keep it super simple okay gotcha fair enough uh what's your favorite call to action in a cold email call to action in terms of the style like low friction call to actions like making it super easy to say yes to it's like mind if i share more info mind if i share a quick video explaining xyz um usually like low friction called actions like that tend to work pretty well okay got it what's your favorite follow-up messaging follow-up i would say i'm actually going to start testing it so like the follow-up is like difficult email we landed the inbox and then leveraging either like gifs like hyperrise or pitch lane as well because after we landed the inbox like you definitely we can definitely test gifs and videos maybe not like sending thousands and thousands a day but like as follow-ups as well i'm going to test that i'll start testing that and i'll let you know the results but just leveraging the fact that you know sales assets as follow-ups or some sort of video or gif um usually i kind of like those as well okay awesome yeah gifs actually testing that and gifs and in the follow-ups and step two or step three of the sequence work well sometimes like just putting a funny twist on it even depends on your target audience obviously but like gifs and media and images uh can work definitely in follow-ups um awesome man cody like you really know your stuff i can uh i can see it from like how granular you're able to go into these topics uh you delivered like a lot of value in terms of like cold email strategies and tactics uh before we wrap it up as a last question i would love to learn more about your mindset uh you know i see you on twitter or just in general i just see you taking massive action um you're running your own campaigns you're running your clients campaigns you're building in house up on systems you're growing a personal brand you do a lot of stuff um is there any advice you would give to people to become action takers as well what's what's your mindset around that getting stuff done taking action fast that's a good question i would say i kind of like adopt this mentality from a couple guys one being if you know on twitter hassan basically mr overpaid um his as at his mr overpaid always and then tate as well entertain always talking about just like attacking life at full speed like literally what do you have to lose like you're just young like you literally like there's nothing to lose and everything again so i'm always like going in the day basically like you know what do i have to lose if i just like attack at full force like i want i want to get to a very very high level at a young age so it's like these are kind of like the steps i need to take in terms of like you know business inputs every single day fitness inputs every single day etc just like getting to a high level at a very very young age because if you're like 40 or 50 and you're rich i mean it's kind of like i wouldn't say it's normal but like it's definitely not as normal as like you know being in your mid-20s like super at a very good financial level and then like you know in good shape as well as well like all these different moving pieces so i think that's like one of the things that motivates me the most just like that mindset just like always attacking at full speed um always having goals because if you're if you're a man like literally just treat life like a gta even if you're a woman as well like you can literally you can literally achieve so much before your mind is something so just like conquer like whatever your goals are um and just like enjoy the journey as well like i i do sometimes i kind of like forget that but it's like like the actual process of like attacking the full speed like going going going um i love doing it but sometimes i forget that you know this is actually a good process i needed to enjoy um yeah i usually say that's like the main thing um especially like if you know if you're young or even old like just like going at full force towards life like your goals like you're literally not going to regret it one second yeah awesome yeah there's so much opportunity out there it's it's like it's so exciting this we live in amazing times there's like so much going on there's so much opportunity if you like just charge forward if you always push forward you don't get complacent even if you've achieved a little bit of success it's just that intellectual stimulation of tackling more challenges i'm yeah i'm with that that's uh yeah inspiring like we have we have started like think think about it now like everybody here is like if you're living in like you know 2023 like having access to the internet especially like money twitter or like agency space online money like even like 10 years ago like nothing was around like this like it is so i wouldn't say it's easy but it's like it's literally a hundred times easier than it was 10 years ago 20 years ago 100 years ago like there's so much opportunity and people just like they kind of like waste their potential right like you literally have something to be financially free you have some sort of freedom most people kind of take that for granted and still like are super lazy but it's like you gotta you gotta realize like that perspective it's like you literally have such an opportunity like you were like one of the luckiest people um if you're on this space if you're in this space at this even it like doesn't even matter what age you are like you literally have the opportunity like make five figures a month just from your laptop and talking with people um you don't have to work in some sort of factory some sort of underground tunnel and don't go into wars which is like you know people how many however many years ago they were doing that at this age um or any age so it's like you gotta kind of like look at it from a 30 000 foot perspective and realize like you're so lucky like you need to you know fulfill your full potential and then also make sure that you know if you know like your ancestors are watching like you got to make them proud as well yeah really well said especially also like this is an example right this youtube podcast it's it's just going to be for free right and you drop some strategies some tactics people can use that right away it's there it will just have to you know get excited and take action and exactly yeah awesome cody it was it was great to have you on the show also learning from you you dropped a lot of value and for people who want to learn more from you or work with you where should they go yeah so my twitter is the cody karns um website is in-house alponsystems.io and then also my youtube channel i think you
