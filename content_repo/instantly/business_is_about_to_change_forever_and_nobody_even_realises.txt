Running a successful business as we know it is about to change forever. And 99% of the people have no clue this is happening. You see, most business owners are too busy, caught up in the day-to-day operations of their business to even realize that something bigger is going on.

And the reason I'm even qualified to say this is because I used to be one of those business owners struggling to crack the $100,000 per year mark. But once I noticed a few key things, I was able to completely reframe my business. My business is now doing well past $3 million per year.

So if you wanna do the same, there's a few things that you need to do and fast. So today I'll break down six things that you need to know if you want to grow your business and win this year. I'll show you all the changes that I see coming and everything that you need to implement inside of your business as soon as possible.

First things first is simply the end of the learning curve for starting and scaling a business. So starting and scaling a business used to mean paying a massive tuition in time, money, and mistakes. You'd spend months, sometimes years, just getting up to speed.

You had to learn the industry from scratch. You had to figure out the market dynamics. You had to test different offers.

You had to build systems to deliver those offers. And then you had to hire expensive experts to fill the gaps that you couldn't cover yourself. And here's the thing.

That was just to get things off of the ground. Scaling was a way harder battle to even do it. It meant even more trial and error, bigger payrolls, slower execution, and really just like the risk of being outpaced by someone who had already done what you're trying to do.

In the old world, the experience gap was huge. And it was brutal for many. If like someone had been in the industry for 10 or 20 years, they didn't just have a head start.

They were operating on an entirely different playing field. But that entire learning curve is now optional. AI can compress years, literally years of hard earned experience two days.

And it's not just theory. It's happening right now for founders in literally every industry. So with the right AI stack, you can identify profitable niches.

You can craft compelling offers with validated pricing and position. You can build your acquisition systems. You can create fulfillment processes that can scale from day one.

The scarcity of knowledge that used to slow new businesses down is gone. The only real advantage that matters now is just execution and speed. And AI lets you move faster than anyone still building their business the old way.

Here's how you can use this starting today. If you do want to have the AI advantage, pick a market audience that you want to serve, whether it's a niche you know, or one that you've always wanted to enter. Feed AI everything you can.

Industry reports, interviews, YouTube transcripts, customer reviews, whatever it could be. Have it break down the top players, the biggest gaps, and the proven revenue models in that space. And you as AI to help map out your offer, your launch plan, and your marketing assets so you're not guessing.

You're executing with clear data-backed plan. The old path was always learn for years, then start. The new path today with AI is learn in days, start now, and scale fast.

This is why you're seeing people launch with no prior experience, launch and scale businesses in months that would have taken seasoned entrepreneurs years. They're not smarter. They're not luckier.

They're just using tools that remove the learning curve entirely. And if you're stuck in the old way of thinking, you're going to spend years building what someone else could do in a weekend. Number two is the AI-first business model.

For decades, the default way to build a business was human-first, tech-second. You'd hire people, you'd assign them roles, and then you'd look for some sort of software to help them be more efficient. That may have worked in the past, but here's the uncomfortable truth about that situation.

If you keep running your business that way in 2025, every single weakness in your model is going to compound fast. Because here's what happens. Your competitors who embrace AI will run leaner and faster so they can undercut your prices and still make a profit.

They'll be able to respond to customers instantly while your team is getting back to them tomorrow when they can. They'll scale without adding payroll while your overhead just gets heavier every quarter. The AI business model flips the game.

What we want to do is we want to design our business so AI is the default operator. Humans are only added for creativity, for leadership, for relationship building, and your marketing. AI agents can help with that.

Your sales. AI can do all the prospecting and personalization and follow-up and even help with closing. Your customer service.

AI systems that understand the context can resolve problems and never take a sick day. Your back office. No code workflows that handle invoicing, scheduling, onboarding, all of the things.

And here's the part that should scare you. If you've been in business for a while, if you don't actively strip out manual processes and replace them with AI right now, the gap between you and AI is going to get wider and wider every single month. Your team will get slower.

It's going to be more expensive to operate while other teams get faster and cheaper. It's not just that you'll be behind. It's that you'll be compounding in the wrong direction.

In the old world, scaling meant more people and more revenue. In the AI first world, scaling means more revenue without a proportional increase in costs. That's how someone with a team of three can out-compete someone with a team of 30.

If you're watching this and you're like, okay, what the heck do I need to do? Well, if you've already built the business, here's how to transition without burning it to the ground. One, audit everything you do.

List every task, every task in your business, daily, weekly, monthly. Mark which ones are repetitive, rules-based, or predictable. For example, it could be like your lead qualification, your invoice creation, your onboarding, your email follow-ups.

Second thing that you can do is you can match AI tools to each function. For lead gen, you can use a tool like instantly.ai for scraping, warming up domains, personalizing outreach at scale. For customer service, you could build an AI help desk that could basically answer all of the questions for your clients.

For ops and admin, Zapier or Make could automate a bunch of your workflows. Airtable for data, maybe ChatGPT for drafting responses and reports or integrating in that with Zapier. And number three, replace before you hire.

Any role you are about to hire for this, ask, can I handle 80% of this with AI? Start with obviously the low risk, high volume functions to see quick ROI. And then fourth, integrate, don't isolate.

Connect your AI tools so they share data. Example, AI leads from instantly, could connect to a CRM, which would provide AI follow-up sequences, which could go to an AI scheduling tool. This isn't just a mindset shift.

This is something that we need to be executing on today. Our third thing is building no code AI system. Once you decide what you're going to run and you have an AI first business in mind, the next step is simple.

Wire the whole thing together so it actually runs like a machine. Now, here's the part that most people get wrong. You don't need to hire a developer.

You don't need to spend six figures and you don't need to wait six months for some custom software build. That's the old way. With no code AI systems, you can turn ideas in your head and turn them into an automated process in a day.

Here's why that matters. Most businesses use AI tools in isolation. One tool for emails, one tool for scheduling, one tool for CRM, and each one is just doing its own thing.

But when you use no code platforms like Zapier, Make, Bubble, Airtable, or Software, you can connect all of them into an automated pipeline. So instead of your team just manually moving data around, chasing leads, or updating spreadsheets, it's happening in the background 24-7. Let me give you an example of what this could look like.

Let's just say you run a service-based business. Here's how you could fully build an automated client acquisition system with no code using AI. Step one, you could do something like instantly.ai, which could scrape your ideal leads, warm up your domains, and send personalized emails to them at scale, and even analyze them using the instantly's copilot.

Those emails are gonna be sent automatically. And step two, if they reply, an AI agent can score the lead based on the budget, timeline, and fit. Hot leads get pushed into a CRM and get notified, and the dead leads stay dead.

Step three, once these hot leads come in, your CRM can be triggered, and we can maybe send them a calendar link or an internal notification to give them a call. And if they don't reply, we can set up an AI agent that can follow up with them with personalized message or send them content that's relevant to their industry in a follow-up. And by the time you get on the call, you've done zero admin work, no manual prospecting, no cold research, no chasing.

The AI has warmed them up, qualified them, and booked them, all while you were doing something else that actually matters in your business. So if you wanna build your first no-code AI system, here's how to start. Pick one bottleneck in your business, and then you break it into steps.

Assign an AI or a no-code tool to each step. Then connect them together with Zapier or Make so the process runs end-to-end without you. Run it for a week, week what's not working, then lock it in.

And here's the best part. Once you've built one of these, you can do it for everything. Lead gen, onboarding, content creation, reporting, invoicing, all of it.

This is how you build a business infrastructure that can run itself while making you more profitable without spending developer money and without getting stuck in setup mode for months. By the way, everything that I'm talking about right here, I've packaged into a free guide. You can grab it by clicking link down in the description.

It's called the AI First Business Playbook. It walks you through the seven biggest AI shifts happening in business right now and how exactly you can use them to move faster, cut costs, and scale without adding more people. Plus, I give you the exact tools I'm using, concluding I'm using instantly.ai to fill my calendar automatically.

So if you're serious about staying ahead, go grab it now. It's free. Link is down in the description.

Number four is AI-powered outreach. Here's the problem. Most businesses are still doing it like it's 2010.

They grab a big list of emails, they slap together some generic template, they press send, and they pray. It's lazy, it's outdated, and worst of all, it's expensive because when outreach is bad, you're not just missing opportunities. You're burning time, you're burning money, and at the end of the day, you're likely burning your reputation.

Here's what the old way really looks like. You or your team spend hours manually researching prospects. You try to write something personalized, but it's just like a mail merge with their first name.

You track follow-ups in a spreadsheet that get outdated by a day or two. Half of your emails never even get opened, and we don't even know if they actually end up in the inbox. And the ones that do sound like every other cold pitch in their inbox, and if you're lucky, you get at least a 1% reply rate if you're even tracking it.

And to be honest, half of those are gonna say not interested. So what happens? You send more emails, you hire more people to do the same broken process.

Costs go up, results stay flat. AI flips this on its head. With the right setup, you can have AI do all of it for you, scraping the right leads, researching them in depth, writing something that actually feels personal, sending it at the perfect time, following up automatically, and even replying when they write back.

That's exactly what a tool like Insulin.ai is built for. They have Insulin.ai co-pilot, where you can literally research and personalize emails in minutes. Insulin.ai co-pilot is like having a personal research assistant who never sleeps, trained specifically on cold email.

For every lead, it will pull in recent LinkedIn activity, it can find company news, it can analyze the pain points, then it can write a custom opener, an email body, that makes the person feel like you've been following them for weeks, not high first name, real specific human sounding context that makes them stop and read. There's also the reply AI agent, which is instant follow-up. Getting replies is one thing, responding fast and well is another.

And that's where the reply AI agent comes in inside of Insulin.ai. You can basically respond to inbound messages, qualify the lead, answer their questions, and even book the meeting all while keeping your tone and style. No more letting hot leads sit in your inbox for two days.

No more losing momentum because you were too busy to reply. Next is the multi-model AI. And here's what's crazy.

Insulin.ai doesn't just use one AI model. It blends multiple models, picking the best for each job. One model for persuasive cold openers, one for summarizing LinkedIn posts, one for writing a whole email.

Every single part of your outreach is handled by the AI that's best at that specific skill. Meaning you can choose between Claude, Chachibiti, Grok4, so that you can personalize lines, personalize emails at scale. Instead of sending 5,000 generic emails and getting a few half-interested replies, you can send 5,000 hyper-targeted emails at scale, have the reply agent instantly respond every single one of them.

And you can walk away with 10x, if not more of the results without even lifting a finger or touching your keyboard. So here's how to switch. Identify your perfect lead profile, load it into Instantly, let it scrape and build the list for you.

Turn on Instantly Copilot, have it research and write good openers. Enable the reply agent inside of Instantly so it can respond and qualify the lead and launch your sequences inside of Instantly and let it do all of the work for you. Look, if you're still doing outreach the old way, you're not wasting time.

You're stacking costs and losing deals and training your prospects to pretty much ignore you. The businesses using AI outreach will own the inbox in the next 12 months and actually get results. You want to be one of them.

Number five, AI agents are replacing entire internal functions. Look, if AI can run your outreach, it can run departments inside of your business. And here's where the change gets real because the way most companies still operate on the inside is completely outdated from what I'm seeing.

They have departments full of people still doing repetitive manual work. Marketing teams are still spending days writing ad copying email campaigns from scratch. Sales managers are sitting through hours of call recordings just to find the good parts.

And customer support is answering the same questions 50 times a week. It is slow. It is expensive.

And it is holding businesses back. Because in that old model, scaling is a trap. The more customers you get, the more people you have to hire.

The more people that you have to hire, the higher your payroll. And if revenue dips, you're stuck with the same costs and the team doing work that could have been automated months ago. The new way is you replace those repetitive functions with AI agents.

Not the clunky chat box from 2016. I'm talking about intelligent content aware systems that can write copy for your marketing team in minutes, research competitors and market trends instantly and keep that data updated in real time. Analyze every single sales call and flag buying signals or objections.

Handle 80 to 90% of all of your customer support tickets instantly with human on brand like responses. And can completely automate your onboarding, sending the welcome emails, collecting the client details, creating accounts and scheduling kickoff calls, all without a human touch. And the best part is these agents don't take breaks.

They don't get tired. They don't forget things. And they scale infinitely without adding a single dollar to your payroll.

Here's why this matters right now. Businesses that switch to this model get faster, get leaner and more profitable every single month. Businesses that don't get slower, more bloated and less competitive every single month.

So here's how we can start right now. Audit every department and list recurring repeatable tasks that your team does. Identify the high impact wins, marketing copy, research, sales calls, analysts, support, onboarding, whatever it is, and then pick and build the right AI agent for each job.

You can use a tool like chip.ai to feed all of the context, all the information, and chip.ai will build an internal AI agent for your team to use, or it can even work for the people using it that you're actually working with from a client perspective. And next time you think you need to hire somebody, ask yourself, can AI do this? The businesses that adapt will run with half the headcount, twice the output, and none of the bloat.

The ones that don't, they're gonna be stuck paying more for slower results while AI-first companies get ahead so fast that they'll never catch up. Number six, AI agents are replacing entire external functions. So far, we've talked about AI running the inside of your business, but here's where things get really interesting.

AI can now run the services you deliver to your clients. And if you're in a service-based business, this is going to be a wake-up call because the way most companies still deliver for their clients is exactly how they did it 10, even 15 years ago. They have a team of designers designing, writers writing, marketers managing campaign, analysts crunching numbers.

Every project is a chain of human tasks passed from one person to the next. And if you want to grow, you need to hire more people, which means if your payroll grows up, your margins shrink, and your management headaches will multiply. Your growth is literally just eliminated by how many people you can find, train, and keep.

That is the old model. And the businesses that keep operating this way are going to get crushed because AI has completely rewritten the playbook for client delivery. Now you can have AI agents running huge parts of the fulfillment process end-to-end, yes.

And these aren't basic automations or just like those corny chatbots. These are intelligent, context-aware systems that can actually deliver high-value work at the same quality or better than a human. Let's take a marketing agency as an example.

In the old world, you'd have a strategist research the market, a copywriter draft the headlines, a designer create the images, a media buyer set up the ads, and analysts review the results. Now you can build and train an AI agent on your process that can research the market in seconds. It can write the copy based off of it.

It can create the headlines. It can generate the emails. It can even launch the ads and A-B test them and kill the losers and scale the winners.

And it can send a full polished report back to the client without a single human touch. If you're a consultant, you can have AI collect data from your client. You can analyze it.

You can highlight the key problems and you can build a detailed recommendation report all in your voice, in your format, ready to deliver. What used to take weeks, now it takes hours. Let's just say you run a e-commerce growth service.

Your AI can now write the product descriptions, create the landing pages, draft and schedule the email campaigns, and even run split tests on pricing or offers, all while you focus on strategy, rate of direction, or higher value client relationships. Here's the key point. Anything that's rule-based, data-driven, or repeatable, AI can now deliver.

Your clients don't care how it gets done. They care that it gets done faster. They care that it gets done more consistent.

And they care that the results are better. The shift here is massive. You're not just using AI to support your business and even more.

You need to actually produce and deliver work you sell. That means you can scale revenue without scaling headcount. Your costs can stay flat while your margins expand.

You can offer services that would have been impossible because AI has removed the labor bottleneck. This isn't theory anymore. This is happening right now.

The question is, are you going to be the business that adapts or the one trying to figure out what happened while all your competitors pass you by? Because if you take just one thing from this, it's that speed matters. Early adopters are going to pull far ahead and you won't be able to close that gap.

So you might be thinking, okay, this sounds great on paper, but what does it look like in the real world? Well, if you click this video right here on the screen, you can watch me start and actually sell a service-based business offer from scratch and build out everything that you actually need using what you saw inside of this video. And not many people are willing to do this on YouTube.

So if you want to actually see what this looks like in practice, I will see you on that video.
