If you're not getting as high of response rates as you should be or you want, you probably need to be verifying and cleaning up the emails on your lead list. Doing this can get you up to a two times better response rate and your emails will actually hit the right inbox every single time. All of this is a positive impact just by validating the email addresses on your list.

With a verified list, you won't have to stress about burning your domains or having your email accounts shut down, which is, let's all agree, very important. In this video, I'm going to go over a quick and simple tutorial for you to verify the email addresses in your lead list. If you're reaching out to an email list that isn't clean, your reputation will sink because your bounce rate is so high, you're going to be flagged as a spammer.

So you're going to be actually going to the spam folder rather than into the inbox, which doesn't help you at all. So let's just jump in real quick. I want to show you how to do this.

First, you need to be within Instantly AI. How you verify a list is you come over here. You need to have a few credits.

So you're going to hit settings, and then you're going to instantly see that there's a verification button. And down here, you can subscribe for either monthly credits or just a one-time credit. You pay for what you believe you need.

After things are verified, you can see here, this email's flagged as risky. This one's invalid. These ones are verified.

What happens is if they're flagged as risky or invalid, automatically the campaign will not be reaching out to them. I'm going to just show you two ways to validate the leads that you're wanting to reach out to. First is if you're uploading a CSV file, as an example here, all you're going to do before you upload it is you're just going to click this verified leads box and then hit upload, and it'll automatically verify the leads that you're uploading.

The other way is coming over here within the leads in your campaign, selecting either all or just the page that you're wanting to reach out to. And over here, right by the trash can icon is a verified leads button. All you have to do is hit that, and it'll automatically verify the leads for you as well.

Now, what's important right here is once they're verified, you'll see that they're flagged as risky or invalid or verified. That's how you can verify the email addresses in your lead list really quickly, and it's important to have it within your outreach process because it'll increase your response rates. So to ensure that you're landing in other people's inboxes, make sure that you add this to your process.

I cannot emphasize this enough. You have to clean your list if you want to get in the right inboxes. By the way, this is one of the latest features inside of our cold email software over here at Instantly AI.
