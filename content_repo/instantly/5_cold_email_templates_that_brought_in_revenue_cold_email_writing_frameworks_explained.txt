hi there and in this video we'll be looking at some cold email templates some cold email copywriting copy that's worked well for us that's brought in some revenue i'll just show you a couple of examples uh you know for you to get some more ideas to get the creative juices flowing and then maybe for your own offer you can spin something up and come up with something new so let's look take a look at this one have a couple more in this other document that we'll be going through and i'll just show you if you like the main takeaways and why it worked and so on but let's take a look at this one first so this one goes like this the subject line is the first name quick question it's kind of standard subject line it's been it's been working well for a while now still still works well and then it goes into the body copy so hi first name and yeah basically just quick question you do sales coaching is that right so here you can obviously see that that cold email that we sent out was uh to for we sent it to sales coaches then we're doing that particular type of coaching so already in the first sentence they they'll probably see the preview also of the cold email right before they even open it they see the preview and they see hey like someone asking me if i do sales coaching like why you immediately get their curiosity they can also see that it's relevant to what they're doing like it's it would be difficult for them to not open this email right it could also imply if someone's asking me if i'm doing this it could imply a potential opportunity a potential collab and uh you know it it really piques their interest and it also um shows them gives them is gives them relevancy right it's not just a generic cold email that's sent down to like a bunch of people but it's it's targeted it's segmented then uh we transition into the second question we have there it's it's the hook we have their attention then we transition into the second question which is are you looking to go more meetings with companies who need some help with their sales mojo and then that's already it so for them we want to make it concise uh short and sweet and make it very easy for them to reply with a yes in that case right we didn't share too much information it's not a huge wall of text but we want to get the reply first and then later on we can explain them more exactly how it works but create like a relevant email that's targeted to them and uh it's very easy for them to say yes in that case and uh yeah so this was this was this one uh that brought in uh the person who replied to this eventually became a client and uh yeah that's it also this one is a little detail but like kind of saying sales mojo it's a little bit informal it's a little bit unique but um again it doesn't seem like a sales email necessarily or it doesn't seem like a generic email where you didn't really put any thought into who you're sending it to um and it makes it also you know a little bit funny a little bit informal uh sometimes helps depending on the context okay so this is the first example i'll show you a couple more here um let me zoom let me zoom in here so you can see it okay so zoomed in here uh this is another one this is similar but you can see it's even more concise it's a little bit different targeting so again here hey first name quick question you do leadership coaching is that right are you looking to get more meetings with cxos who need your help here again like with this question we call out who they are and it also implies a little bit of an opportunity um we kind of what they're doing um this really like speaks to them directly we also call out their target audience so cxo just stands you know for any like chief uh chief executive um c-level uh c-suite uh executives which is exactly the target audience for leadership coaching in that case but this really works in any right it could work in any industry um let's say you're targeting branding agencies who their customers they're targeting the targeting of your targeting uh is e-commerce stores for example so let's say you're you're sending and cold email to a branding agency to help them get more meetings think about okay who are the customers of the branding agency running agency uh it could right it could be e-commerce stores or any like direct-to-consumer product so call out who their customers are so they know that you get them the more they feel like you get them and you get what they're trying to accomplish the more likely they're uh they're going the more likely that they're going to going to respond to you also again like keep it simple like people if you look at this you can read this in in in five seconds in 10 seconds you get it immediately it's easy to digest as well and it doesn't seem salesy uh let's move on to the next one here let's move on to the next one here so hi first name really enjoyed your article on how to balance a strategy on purpose so first line this one is personalized and we don't always do a personalized but sometimes we run some campaigns with personalized icebreaker lines intro lines and they work well so if you have the time or you can use ai tools sometimes with the ai tools uh you know double just double check the quality um or have a virtual assistant uh do it for you uh or just do it yourself you know just write like 20 personalized lines real quick and then send them out or like 30. it doesn't take take up too much time and can really move the needle um so this first line is personalized i was just looking at okay what kind of articles i was looking at the website and then on the website the first page you know just pick out something that's on the first page and there uh it was showcasing one of the articles that they've they've uh written recently which was about the strategy and purpose then second line b btw so by the way are you good at helping helping coaching executives to get to the next level um so this batch of cold email templates you can see it's a little bit is tailored towards you know coaches and so on but think about how this could this these same principles also apply to any niche right let's say if you're in b2b sas or you have an agency um or your recruiter or whatever it may be think about how these specific concepts could apply to you um so with this question the second question is also you know when i'm asking somebody are you good at this it's kind of it's not really a sales pitch but it's me flipping the script a little bit and challenging them hey like are you are you good at this like and once they want to be able to say yes to this they say yeah of course yeah i'm good at this like is there an opportunity like what's going on uh so you can there's a good way to flip the script script a little bit by asking them hey are you good at what you're doing uh if you are you know there's there's a bunch of um people we can connect you with people we can get you meetings with uh so this is like a question that works uh quite well um so yeah ask them a question that's a little bit challenging where they want to say yes again he also called the target audience and geography so with geography and instead of only saying c-level executives you can say hey c-level executives in europe or c-level executives in the middle east or in north america maybe north america doesn't it doesn't sound as custom tailored because that's usually where the main market is but you can see how even adding like another layer of segmentation of uh of calling out with the target audiences really helps with relevancy and and response to it then also casual call to action you know doesn't hear like lmk if if interested right lmk stands for let me know if interested it's it's kind of casual call to action then next one uh hey first name your linkedin profile is impressive so i want to reach out directly um you know if you've been in the cold email game you've probably seen this personalized uh first line uh it still works quite well uh so you can use that if you don't have any other ideas uh again here you know we call out what they are we call out who they are and who they want as customers both of these layers increase relevancy so they know okay like this is for me this email is for me this message is for me let me respond let me or at least continue reading what this is about then uh something that works for us also like a realistic promise which is more believable right here we say hey we help you get an additional five to eight additional meetings per week uh right we're not saying anything crazy this sounds kind of believable they say oh five to eight like this is beneficial to me but it's not like some crazy promise it's not like some some bodacious claim right it's much more believable if it's a little bit realistic too if i if i tell them hey i can get you a hundred meetings a week they're like okay whatever like this person uh is over promising or like you know it's not really believable then the next sentence here i'd love to share a couple of great examples of other coaches with health scale so you can see what's possible i really like this line of i'd love to share a couple of great examples right instead of saying hey can i get on a sit do you want to get on a sales call with me you just tell them hey like i'll show you a couple great examples of of what worked for people in in the same industry as you so it's still in the context of kind of you presenting something to them and potentially being a sale but it's not like a pure sales pitch right no nobody really wants to show up for a a high pressure sales call or demo uh really but if they can see okay like greatest examples maybe i can get some ideas some value from it let me see let me see what this is about and then the next sentence here is this of interest to you and are you free anytime this week for a quick chat uh this kind of soft landing uh it's quite polite and um embedded in that sentence are two are two yeses in a way right we were asked is this of interest to you which is already one question by itself are you free any any time this week for a quick chat so probably this is of interest to you right if they believe you uh like getting an additional five to eight meetings per week is like it's quite good or whatever your value prop is and they already say oh yeah this is of interest to me and they're free for a quick chat most people are free for for a quick chat if it's something that's valuable for them throughout the week so they always say yes to the first part of the question which makes it in a way like easier also to say yes to that second part which is actually asking for the call or you know they're just going to say yes and say yes it's of interest to me i don't have time for a call but just send me some info over there's already one step further in your sales funnel you share a little bit of information and then later on uh get them on a call if that's um if that's what your model is then moving on here to the to the last example uh here again use this uh first line your linkedin profile was impressive uh you can use that or something else i mean you can also say hey i saw your twitter if you have twitter information if you know that there have also have a twitter profile you can say hey i saw you on twitter and follow reach out which is also in a way like you're personalizing but you don't have to write a specific personalized line for every single lead you just know okay all these people have a twitter profile and then say hey i saw you on twitter i thought i'd reach out then again second self sentence we help email marketing agencies get 5 to 15 additional demos a week with e-commerce brands so here again email marketing agencies that was our target who we were sending cold email to 5 to 15 additional demos a week was the promise the value prop and it's you know quite believable it's realistic and then e-commerce brands is the target audience of the target audience so these email marketing agencies they're working with e-commerce brands then the third sentence i've added some more details so in detail like i was thinking okay what do these email marketing agencies want they want e-commerce brands but what type of client do they want right there's good clients and maybe there's bad clients or there's clients there that are not ideal but for an email marketing agency if you understand their business and you know who they want to work with ideally then you can say that too and then they understand that you understand them so in this case i was saying and not just any e-commerce store but brands who have a good amount of organic and paid traffic already coming in so that you can get them quick wins by adding or optimizing only a few email flows so right if you're an email marketing agency or if you're a branding agency and you know that brands that you're working with already has a good amount of of traffic coming in then it's much easier to get them to get them wins it's much easier to get the results which makes you know the entire process for them much much much more uh much easier and makes them more money and the clients are going to stay with them longer because they're getting results so we also hear like this sentence really tells them hey like we get you we know what you're looking for uh let us find more brands like this for you right here in the context of lead gen agency then again you know i'd love to share a couple of great examples so you can see what's possible are you free anything any time this week for a quick chat and uh yeah so this is this is a couple of examples hope that gets the uh creative juices flowing just you know just look at some of these concepts of why it worked uh you know calling out who they are who their talk who their target audience is the realistic promise understanding in detail what they want um generic personalized lines um sharing examples call to action instead of trying to get tell them hey let's get on a sales call tell them hey like let me share a couple great examples of what's worked for other people in the industry and a casual call to action can work too you know it looks a little bit more casual looks less like a mass email and challenging them a little bit too like flipping the script a little bit asking hey are you good at this and um yeah not making it look salesy implying an opportunity is some of the concepts that work well here so yeah these are the uh colliement templates that brought in revenue i hope that's helpful um yeah let me know in the comments and i'll talk to you soon thanks
