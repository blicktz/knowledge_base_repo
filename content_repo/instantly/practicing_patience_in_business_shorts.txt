if you get everything that you're praying for today, would you be ready for it? That's the quote that I always run with these days, because I remember back in the day, I'm like, yo, I'm so ready for 100k months, I'm so ready to 50k, I want to, I want to make a million dollars. And I will start every business with the sole intention of making a million dollars by the end of the year.

And I realized that that was never the case. The journey that I'm on the cycle that I have in my life is all about patience. And I have to stay patient, I have to learn the foundations, even on my last partnership, when we had the 75 employees, I wasn't a big equity holder.

That's the honest truth. I did not take a lot of money home. I was managing, we're making millions of dollars, but I wasn't taking much home to myself.

And I realized, you know what, was this is just a part of the journey for right now, I have to take a step back and enjoy the fact that I'm able to, to act on a vision that I'm able to lead that I'm able to generate revenue. And in the future, when the time comes right, then I can focus on making money myself. Right.

And I switched the mindset of how long is it going to take me to actually start making money when I start something to, okay, how long will it take me to master the skills, right? How long will it take me to become a goat inside of the space? And then the money comes.
