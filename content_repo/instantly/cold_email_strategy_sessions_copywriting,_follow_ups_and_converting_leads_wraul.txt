so hey guys welcome to the instance this right session we have some people already joined that are asking good questions so I'm going to go through them one by one so first question how do you write the first cold email plus follow-ups for a service business so with a service business I think you mean like an agency type thing and we start as an agency so we have a lot of experience with this and what I would do first I would go to Insta Accelerator and I would go to the copywriting section we have everything we've learned in here so you have the copywriting master class that has exactly the anatomy of a good cold email how to structure it how to cut data and then all the strategies that we're using but how I would start first is I would go through if you have already case studies I would go through a current case studies and see what worked for them and then I would craft emails around that so if we go go here and I'm a good cold email personization offer CTA for example hey Tom the Twitter posts are amazing because it's personalized to show them I actually went through the Twitter have you thought about turning them into videos because you create a tool that turns your tweets into TikTok videos automatically this offer and CTA might never send more info so this is how simple it can be and I would just start by using the offer that you already have case studies for so if you have an SEO agency okay I can help you get to this spot on Google I can help you get backlinks I can help you write SEO optimized content and then using one sort of personalizations but all the strategies are in here and what I would do is I wouldn't get stuck in one idea or one strategy you want to go through multiple ones let's scroll down a little bit further so here so strategy two one sentence email so I'll try this one I'll create one campaign let's go into campaigns add new continue and when I write sequences let's do the first one it's like regular email then add variant this I'm gonna do one sentence email I'm gonna save this then I would go back to accelerator check another strategy I will do strategy three I think like three is enough first one even like one two just trying different angles but that's the key you should be doing this like daily or minimum weekly that are trying out different angles to find what works the the only way to find out is by testing like I can give you suggestions but even I don't know what's going to work for your niche unless I work with that specific niche so that's where we start with and then trying all these different angles all right let's take next question the email copy sequences would be interesting so yeah pretty much what I covered and then let's see if there's like something more with the sequences so with the follow-up strategies what we're trying recently now is right now a lot of people know what they need to personalize the first email right but what we're seeing a lot of success with is personalizing the entire sequence so you can do the first email with the person's first line second email you can use open AI to get information from the website personalize that even more personalized so try to go a step further and put more effort in than other people are doing and try to personalize it even more so that's another good strategy that we're trying right now then Eric asks should you guarantee result right in the first email so I would definitely test it out it's the guarantees work really well and it comes down to like your offer I did a video recently it's not up on YouTube yet it's going to be soon but how I craft like the best offers and how to create an offer that is pretty much like a no-brainer so if you think about it let's take a lead generation agency the best type of offer maybe I even have the list demo method yeah I have it here so the demo method for million dollar offers so let's say I'm a lead generation agency let me zoom in and I tell you my offer is this I can send you as many clients as you can handle for no charge it's like amazing feel like every company would take this like somebody reached out to me like Raul hey I can send as many clients as you want for no charge that's the best offer possible try to figure out what's the best like no-brainer offer that you can offer and then start working down from it making it more reasonable for example here the first one was with no charge but this one I can send as many clients as you can handle for 20 commission so we're now adding a little bit more reasonable angles to this so we can actually make a business out of it then a step further I can send you five clients weekly so not as many as you can handle but a specific number for 20 commission and then I can send you five sales meetings so we're not even clients it's sales meetings with clients weekly for 20 commission and then you can go down from that five sales meetings with your deal configuration for 20 250 per meeting and then let's say you want to add a guarantee if I don't get you five meetings you don't pay anything for that week so you can use these guarantees to really pump up your offer and show you have some skin in the game but having guarantee is like one of the best ways in the beginning so you can really leverage the trust and show you have some skin in the game if you're confident to show the guarantee it's going to work so much better than a generic one for example let's take like this one I can send you five sales meetings with your ideal plans weekly for 250 per meeting it's like pretty good but a much better one would be if I add the guarantee so definitely add that if you can do that okay so Aiden has a question about follow-up I've had responses but then no response I'd like to check my process around this I can post a script I can use for a loop media and get your take on it yeah sure you can share your script we can go through it and I think you mean about if you get a response in your inbox right so we get a response how to turn those leads into meetings so this is like a game of its own and it's a really important one and that's like one of the main reasons why we create this deal flow CRM view and why I would recommend like using this it gives like super clear over like yes I can see everything here but in the CRM it's like much clearer I can go in here I can respond to them I can add notes I can know exactly the thread what was going on and most importantly what I would always do is like add the prospect value here add how much this prospect is worth for you for like their lifetime value and you're going to put so much more effort in and just seeing like random responses here like yes please send but if I see like okay this she's worth two thousand dollars I'm going to put so much more effort in already so psychologically I recommend using the CRM stuff stuff to keep on track of these leads and then I was good to accelerator sales sales master class and in here we have turning industry leads into meetings so some key aspects let me zoom in so first quick turnaround I'm going to cover like the manual stuff first and then we can uncover that automations but the sooner you reply the more likely you are to book a call so have your instantly open you can add even integrations so you can get notification in slack but the faster you respond the faster you're going to get responses because if they responded in an instant way they're already in the mice okay I want to learn more if respond in a day or two or next week they're already forgot about this so be fast and then yeah like booking daily slot or just like having consistent instant open uh that you see when something comes in and you respond straight away or you get a VA or a person that does this for you uh make response specific and tailored to what the prospect told you so if they say let's say you ask for a meeting and they say next Monday 10 a.m works nicely book them into your calendar yourself instead of sending over a calendar link and they have to like click it and choose a time again maybe your calendar isn't open that time so if they say a specific thing or they say like yeah call me instead of booking a can meeting you should call them if you want to increase your rates and the specific and tailored part is also if they've already responded in an interested way for example let's go to the unibox and I have Polly here so she responded yes please send I send I can send her a loom so what I can do is I can actually go through like easy way would respond like hey here's the loom like that's it right but if I want to be more precise what I can do is I'll go to her website this is like maybe tech let's see if I can like copy this it's gonna maybe tech dot com I would go to her website okay social media management get to guess where are the social media so I would like go through it see what they're doing and then I would go here and I would craft the response like hey thanks for your interest just checked your website and yeah let's say like the offer that I have it's like instantly and I have three ideas on how you can do outreach for your social media management tool and then I would create a custom loom for them again like showing this sharing screen recording this and making the feel that I actually put the time into understanding the business that's what they want to know they want to understand if you actually know and if you can actually help them so I can do a generic instantly pitch for them okay instantly you can send uh campaigns here but if I know they're a commercial media management tool so they probably want to target let's say e-commerce stores so what I can do I can craft my loom specifically for them show inside lead finder let's open this instantly I go to lead finder and show them hey uh Polly so here's what we can do so let's say we can use technologies we can use Shopify I can find the Shopify leads exactly that you want to target so I'll find all the Shopify leads and then you can create campaigns to them let's take only the CEOs or target decision makers and now I can create a campaign all these Shopify e-commerce stores CEOs and we can show them a client that you had let's see if they have a client training I can't see like a client right now but that would be a good one if they actually have like Nike as a client and reach out to exactly with the same case study that's already have we can reach out to these people and send them emails and then I sent this loom in this video so you understand how putting more effort like this is going to resonate to Polly so much first it's gonna make the chances harder it's gonna actually click link because I put some presentation in and then because the loom is personalized much higher chance it's actually check out instantly and join so that's what you want to do if you really want to and I think in the beginning like everybody should be doing this like there's no excuse in not doing this you want to like learn how to convert them so you do it manually understand what works and then you can start with automation okay let's go through this like other ones quickly yeah so you can make your life easier by copying the answers you can use macros and then follow up so exactly so this is like what you want to improve again let's go to the unibox so you can see like Polly right now we don't have any reminders but what you can do is if you respond and if no reply in let's say one day then remind me to follow up and it will come on top of the inbox like a reminder and you just like follow up follow up follow up until they say like hey stop like I'm not interested anymore so these are the main ones that I would do and then for automation parts I would just set up some simple sequences but in the beginning right now if you're like struggling with getting those leads and like turning them into clients and meetings just start manually put some effort in learn the process and you'll get better and better at this and we'll book more meetings so hopefully this helped let's take the next one Eric asked how do you personalize if you want to send 300 emails daily so same thing you can start by personalizing manually this helps we actually did this in our leadchers and agency you take a lead list and you actually go through websites and write personal lines and if you after you've gone through like five or ten you're going to see some things that are repeating all the time so you can use these things you can also use if you go to accelerator copywriting masterclass research and collecting data so the resonating variables so let's say the simplest way is to say like we help e-com stores grow so we have a generic niche e-com and value prop grow but you can do a lot of presentations by using the same email list and it's like using the segmented variables for us we can say we have female founders in LA grow their sustainable makeup brands while bringing the plant and people first so female that's like if you only target females founders like their position in LA if you target a specific niche so this all of this is presentation already so you want to send 300 emails you take the location you take their niche you take so let's say we want to target sustainable e-com stores instead of just e-com and we target them this already will feel personalized and then of course there are like personalized first line tools but I will start with this go through a copywriting masterclass and try these resonating variables and try to figure out how many of these you can come up with so the segmentation like you can use location you can use e-com or like niche you can use time I use this one like hey want to reach out before you go on summer holiday this is like right now or if some big uh holiday is coming up or weather so it's raining in like location you can legit just google weather in Sydney as I saw it's uh 35 degrees in Sydney training topics show positions channel specific if you're targeting people from Twitter or you can use like variables angles but yeah just go to the masterclass we have tons of different ideas in here how many emails need to be sent for you to confidently evaluate the performance of a variant so what I recommend again accelerated start and the frequently asked questions so here you want to get around one positive response per 200 emails sent change copier targeting no response I would want to get one close from 2 by 5k email sent in the beginning like don't worry too much about open rates or reply rates you should focus should be getting on positive responses and closes like even if I get positive response I get 10 positive responses but no close like if I'm not getting close as it's not a good campaign like we want to make money so then probably if you get positive responses no close you want to work on the sales side but if you're not getting positive responses then work on a copy and targeting if no close then you have to change the niche or the copy completely but around 200 emails sent the next one if I don't have access to recipient first name what would you recommend to do so you can use enrichment tools uh we're going to add this soon to instantly but you can also use like uh you don't have to use name always you can just like use like hey and go straight into it you don't have to use the name but you can just google like enrichment tools and you can find it there okay Eric asks hey how many domains should you have so again we recommend three email accounts per domain and like have as many as you can afford I recently did this one 10k uh like how to reach 10k a month with cold email so if you have 15 accounts you send 450 daily which is 30 per account you send around 10k a month 45 of them open it's total over 4 000 opens 1 response positively you get 44 positive responses 40 out of those you get 37 to book a meeting you get around 60 meetings you close every fourth 25 you get four closes at a 2500 ticket you get 10k revenue and the setup cost with instantly is around like 474 roi 20x so based on this I would get like if you want to get to this kind of level I have like five domains and three emails each you can do less but I would invest in back into every month into getting more domains every time you get a close get one two more domains get five more accounts so you can send more and more so you can scale up sending more and more so that's like how you want to think about it just if you're making money always invest back more think about if you're doing like Facebook ads our campaign is profitable we just increase the budget same with code limit we just increase the budget by getting more domains and more email accounts okay Aiden said reply let's actually share this in this one talks new so we can go through this live and zoom in okay hey that's getting back to me here's the link to Luma made for you showing what you did and where the case study is here's linked to the page right in front of the video as I mentioned really happy to get on a quick call to fill in some gaps if you want to do that here's my booking link happy to share what I know so first thing I think is like pretty good but I would make it much simpler there's like so many things there's like loom link there's the link for this one and then you have the calendar link so you're asking them to do a lot of things I would I would simplify it try different variants but I would start with what I showed you in the previous example just like customizing it more I can thanks for getting back to me I checked your website here's what I saw here's the loom video and you don't even have to do the customer's loom but even just like quickly go to the website check something on the website that you can message or include in this like follow-up message it's going to increase the chance that you're actually going to check it uh then maybe I would like take out this one for now you can add it in the loom and then for this one as I mentioned happy to get a quick call to fill in some gaps I'll focus on this so depends on what your offer is let's say I can I can give it easy sample with instantly I show them loom and then I use the call to action or the value prop here to like not to fill in the gaps like nobody cares about filling gaps everybody wants to get results they want to get meanings they want to get money so it is that like happy to jump a quick call to show you how we can set up a cold email engine that reaches out to 10 000 of your ideal prospects every month and then I'll book it in and then also what you can do simpler is instead of asking them to book a call ask them would you be free for a call tomorrow or Thursday at the same time tomorrow Thursday 1 p.m. or 2 p.m. I try to give specific examples maybe that works and instead of sending um handling so make their life as easy as possible so here's like a couple of things that I would try I would start with the personalized approach that's going to help a lot simplifying it removing some of the stuff that you don't need and then already proposing some times to ask them if it works and then also like working on loom making it better and asking feedback and you can also do maybe not ask for a call straight away you can do a longer uh like more effort sequence where you ask them feedback on the loom uh get their feedback see if it was interested and this is like follow up if you don't respond to this one then follow up hey did you have a chance to check it happy to jump on a call to show how it can help you do x and then just follow up follow up follow up follow up okay and we have the loom screens yeah so Aiden says he's been making custom looms but out of 10 only two or some watched so yeah like that should be the first thing like don't even worry about the loom script right now if people are not even like watching them you need to work on the copy to get them to watch it and I think what I showed before like the presentation helps so like hey thanks for getting back from me I checked your website uh I created a loom that's exactly how I can do x for their niche like try that angle use that angle in their uh like emails that they get so they will actually check out loom so that should be your only focus I wouldn't worry about the loom I wouldn't worry about like these parts if they're not even watching the loom that should be their first thing and for the loom script uh I think just uh making it even like simpler making it more concise and really just maybe like try different angles for loom video maybe not being like too generic it's like showing a specific example like hey this is how I help this person and I think it's like you guys have a lot of similarities I can do the exact same thing for you I'll send you a couple of options where we can like meet let's try different angles for the copy and not being like too generic and showing like everything but specific case studies okay so I think we have like time for one two more questions I call it ask recommendation for the copy for this code email let's open it okay I just saw your app on the Play Store you've done a great job this kind of app that inspires me I'd like to work with you if you're looking for new how much new traffic we're we offer our app partners each month for every exterior you pay every two weeks this doesn't affect your new experience change app function can afford to talk with others what the offer is so this is pretty good um we'll copy this so let's uh work it just sort of up on the Play Store like you've done a great job this seems like uh I don't know I don't know like a vanilla uh uh compliment so you can make it like better just like uh uh just sort of up on the Play Store love the let's say design whatever love the colors love the icon something like more specific like you've done a great job it's like so vague love the design love the name whatever like this is more specific also this one like this kind of app that inspires me like nobody cares about this what inspires you uh I'd like to work with you if you're looking for new as a matter so this one again like I it's like a little like I just like start with like you it's about like them like it's like I I we I just like uh for um even this one your app on the Play Store called my I love the name I you again like let's say how can I think like I can show you away how to monitor this traffic but what we can do is like you could be monetizing your app traffic you could be monitoring your app traffic with x like your offer and this one or maybe like you can try this one but then maybe like make it simpler or functions and this one mind if I share more info so this one like again let's do hey name if you have it hey Tim your app the best one would be if you actually have a name so like you can have if you can scrape the company name or that name let's say Angry Birds on the Play Store called my love name uh maybe like you could be monitoring your app traffic with x maybe even like uh usually we see x percent revenue growth with similar apps it doesn't affect your user experience or change the add functions minus here more info so I would try this one so take a screenshot record it just make it simpler more unique like uh and just really go in on the revenue part and don't talk about yourself like talk about them and that's all they care about and then yeah try different angles around this and yeah hopefully this helped we're now done with the 30 minutes transition really good one hope it helped uh go to the install accelerator like all the materials in
