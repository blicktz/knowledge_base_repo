Welcome everybody to another episode of cold emails hot takes Tom it's great to have you on the podcast how's it going man thanks thanks for having me yeah doing good for the viewers listening Tom is the founder of marketable media a boutique lead generation agency and he helps b2b companies get an additional two to five qualified clients every month with his outbound systems and strategies so he's an expert at generating meetings with cold email and today on this episode i'll be asking Tom a couple of questions about which cold email strategies have been working for him and share that with all of you so yeah Tom all right let's let's do a couple rapid fire questions here right off the gate and then we'll jump into some more open-ended or broader topics are you ready for a couple uh cold email rapid fire questions hit me man let's do it all right great so first one is what are your favorite b2b data sources yeah of course so um for me and my clients i use two data sources i use store leads for e-com leads and then i enrich them with find email um and then i also use uh sales navigator as well which is pretty good so pretty simple um but i just use two data sources at the moment for for my leads um and i found them to be pretty successful so far got it what are some of your favorite subject lines that are not quick question yeah that's a good one dropping some sauce so um i always like to use their first name in some way so first name question mark or i found a lot of success with first name dot dot dot sounds a bit ominous but it's sort of like click baits them into opening the email okay got it what's your favorite call to action in a cold email yeah of course i like um would you be open to exploring this further because i find that it's it's soft it's calming and it it often elicits a really nice positive response okay what's your favorite follow-up messaging yeah so my follow-up messaging is just pretty relentless to be honest i just follow up until i either get a positive response of them or they tell me to leave them alone um just offering different times um i know it's a bit of a taboo to send your county link but i do like to send that because i find that sometimes people click through i actually get a lot of meetings book through with people just clicking on the county link so offering times you know presenting different ways of um framing the meeting itself as an order as a strategy session something along those lines um so it's not too heavily sales focused and then presenting the prospect with different options all right what email provider do you like to use for cold email is it g suite outlook soho any other provider i'm purely on g suite at the moment but i might delve out into um into zoho i might check them out so but purely g suite at the moment okay great awesome um let's move into some more open-ended uh question questions how did you start with your e-generation agency and where are you at with it now yeah of course so um i've been in the sort of like digital marketing space for about three years now um off like the back end of the start of covert actually when everyone got sent home from work i started a paid ads agency did that for a few years um and then when ios 14 rolled around that all kind of just went kaput um so started learning about lead generation started learning about cold email and different ways to generate clients because that's what i was struggling with like most agency owners um so started learning about cold email started learning about cold outreach and got heavily involved in twitter met a load of amazing people on twitter started networking and learning different strategies testing them out um yeah so started my lead generation agency back in august of 22 and started bringing on an onboarding clients at the end of september early october and so i'm now at six clients now um most of them in the e-comm space but i do have a few of the clients that are in different areas as well okay interesting yeah i know that e-comm space is quite uh competitive right how do you handle their like the competitive environment how do you uh keep innovating how do you like uh win in that space that's so competitive do you have like any creative angles any new angles that you use to to stay ahead of the curve honestly i found just keeping it simple and to the point and having an absolute killer offer is the best way to succeed everyone looks at e-comm as this sort of like really scary beast with cold email like oh it's so difficult to get results i don't think that's necessarily true i think cutting out all the fluff in your email just asking them a pain point question do you have a problem with your paid ads or do you have a problem with i don't know your email marketing or something like that and then frame it in a different way and find different angles to to attack uh to sort of attack that that pain point then produce a relevant case study so if you're reaching out to brands that are doing i don't know a million plus a year have a case study where you've worked with a brand that's doing a million plus a year and how you've scaled them um so i think relevancy is massive um and then having a killer offer as well so some sort of guaranteed results paper results something along those lines um seems to be generating great meetings and you know great consistency within the e-comm space i'm finding okay great yeah even if it's competitive if you have a good offer and you take massive action and you keep it simple yeah you can still uh you can still win lots of volume as well okay it's definitely a volume niche okay interesting yeah do you mind sharing like how much volume you're sending like across all of your clients how many cold emails are you sending yeah of course i think i sent um in the past 30 days i looked just yesterday i think i've sent like 70 000 cold emails or something like that um that's some solid volume i know yeah it's pretty heavy so but it's but it's great i think my average reply rate is something like three percent so across all my clients and all my different offers and niches so it's pretty solid okay great yeah that's healthy um good stuff what are some like beginner mistakes um that you see other people making or that you've made yourselves uh in the past when doing cold outreach and scaling an agency do you mind sharing any tips there yeah i think the first thing is not doing enough like not doing enough volume if you're just starting out like there's literally no point in sending 10 to 20 cold emails a day like you should be testing 500 cold emails every single day so you can actually get a good feedback from the market see if you have a product market fair and then you can scale it upwards from there i think not doing enough volume is is gonna sort of kill your effort straight away or just elongate the time that it takes to actually achieve results um you know you can do 10 times as much with 10 times as much volume that's that's what i that's what i believe um another mistake as well that i see from a lot of people that are just starting is having way too much information in their cold email like their emails are way too long you've got to realize that the people that you're reaching out to are normally decision makers when you're reaching out to with cold email so these people are incredibly busy they're doing stuff all the time they don't have you know they don't have a minute to read your blog post that you've just sent them you just need to get across your value and put a put a soft call to action in there straight away so you can basically make it as easy as possible for them to reply but that's some that's some of the beginner mistakes that i that i see people uh that i see people doing and also putting links in their cold email as well and that's what i see all right and then let's say someone is um a little bit more advanced like intermediate um what kind of mistakes do you see them making uh apart like from not doing enough volume or keeping cold emails too long what are some like other uh mistakes to avoid uh when doing cold outreach out there yeah that's a good question um i think relevancy is a big thing that i see a lot of people getting getting wrong like even if you have a crazy offer if your case studies and your email isn't relevant to the person you're reaching out to like i touched on this before if you're reaching out to brands that are doing like a million dollars every single year then you need to have case studies that show you taking a similar brand in a similar niche from a million to 10 million or something along those lines so that when they're reading that they can see okay this person has worked with brands in the same echelon as me in the same niche as me and they have proven results that's a that's a such an added bonus they're looking at you with trust straight away so that's something i see like when people are sort of past that beginner stage and they're still struggling with cold email i think that they need to look at it from like a relevancy point of view like how relevant is your cold email to your prospect yeah that's a really good point with the case studies like also if you're getting your clients good results not being shy about asking them for a testimonial like mentioning the case study uh getting a video testimonial oh you know you mentioned just uh just getting a video testimonial uh yesterday or today like how did you go maybe like other people who are in that situation and they're getting good results for their clients how do you go about asking for a testimony or video testimonial yeah um how did you how do you pull that off i don't want to sound big-headed but he offered it to me so okay great that makes things easy yeah yeah no it's because i booked him like he had like 10 calls in one day so he was um yeah he just came to me that that evening he was like do you want a testimonial i was like of course yes please if it could be a video testimonial even better and then you just send a loom video but i mean if you're looking for a testimonial off your clients then the first thing you need to do is get them great results that's just a no-brainer and once you've done that just ask them like very kindly ask them like would it be possible to do a video testimonial and if they're feeling a bit shy about it or they don't know how to do it then provide them with like a script or um some key points of like what to hit you know with a video testimonial you want to you want to hit a few things you want to show the pain that they were in the you know the initial conversations that you guys had and the sort of onboarding process and how slick and smooth it was and then the results that you've got them and how much better they're feeling now it basically needs to go through like a journey so by the end of the video the video testimonial the person that's watching it has seen how you've solved this person's this person's problems yeah got it yeah it's also people have to know before they reply to a cold email a lot of times they will check out the domain they will check out the landed page yeah and if you have some like good case studies on there some strong marketing assets that will make uh you know that will really help with reply rates yeah um okay great now let's say you get it you're doing your outreach you're getting positive replies obviously we don't want a bunch of positive replies we want to turn that into meetings and clients as well how do you go about turning positive replies replies into meetings you just mentioned this client where you got him like 10 calls in a day like how do you turn these replies into actual calls on the calendar yeah of course so i mean like positive replies can be like there's there's different areas of positive reply and you can sort of read very quickly how interested someone is some people are like yeah great i want to know more info like i'm desperate to hear about this some people are like yeah sure you can send over more you can send over more information it really just depends on like how into it they are and you've got to learn to read that with the replies um if someone's really desperate to get on a call i just straight up say look let's jump on a call here are two times within their time zone i just define some times that match up with my client's calendar and their calendar um and then put the candy link as well if they want to book direct if they're sort of like interested but you can tell that they're not that desperate to jump on a call straight away they're not fully sold on it then i like to send over things like just a evergreen loom video with more information like i get my clients to make them which basically just cover um what they do the process of how it works and just some like very quick case studies of like what they've achieved in the past like one to two minutes super quick um i find that it's great for building rapport you know the prospect has already heard the client's voice they've seen their face and they've built that little bit of trust with them and i find that that's a lot easier to get people onto onto meetings and also as well like don't be afraid to follow up like following up is so key again these people are super busy they've got a hundred things going on and a lot of them are grateful for you to remind them about you know jumping on a call with them or finding out more information sometimes it's taken me like 21 emails top 21 follow-ups to get oh wow 21 yeah like i know you just gotta keep following up and then people will be like yeah okay great oh thank you for the follow-up or yeah this is now now it's the time to to explore this further so yeah so keep following up okay very interesting with um what you said with the evergreen loom video like you get your clients to do one of those uh two three minutes um can you tell me a little bit more about what's being said in that video to try to convince uh the positive reply to book a meeting as well like what do you tell them to say in that loom video in that evergreen video video yeah of course so it's normally like a more info like so it's nor it's normally replying to people that are asking for more info or interested in finding out a little bit more and it's just basically like a very sort of high level view of their process and where they normally take clients from to the point where they achieve results from so like the little journey like it depends on what their service is you know what i mean like this is what we'll do this is our unique mechanism to achieve the results that we achieve um and then just to show some case studies like oh like we did it for this brand and we did it for this brand and that brand and that brand so just very quick honestly like one to two minutes and super fast and just like a very high level overview and at the end of the video as well just always pushing to a call to action to say look if you want to run through this in more detail or if you'd like me to show you exactly how i generated the results for this client then i recommend that we jump on a call and then in that follow-up with the evergreen loom you have the loom and then below it do you have the calendar link or some some times again where you you know besides the call to action inside of the video you also have it like in written text for my imagine below just so people can imagine how that looks okay yeah so this would be like um here's the here's some more information for you colon video and then underneath and if you'd like a full run through or a full you know sort of demo or explanation of how we do this um i'm free this time on that day and i'm also free this time the day after here's my calendar link as well if you'd like to book direct let me know what works for you thanks client name okay interesting you do it like you manually propose times but on top of that you also add the calendar link which kind of covers all the bases that's exactly it because some people some people like to book time and calendly and some people don't like to book time and calendly so i like to just sort of cover all the bases there okay great and then once you have that meeting let's say you know for yourself as a lead generation agency how do you turn the meeting into a client if you can share a little bit more about that yeah of course so i've just started implementing um like a pre-call flow like drip sequence um to to convert people to easier so basically what i do is when i book someone in for a call for myself for example i send them over information so like i've built our landing page um which is which has like a headline and then a video underneath it which is about a seven or eight minute email so it's a longer than a normal vs like normal than a quick vsl and it just goes through the exact process that we would work together on as as a client and an agency sort of relationship and the exact thing that i would do for them so by the time they get on the call they already know my process they've read through a sales letter that i've written for for them to read um you know they know the pain points that they're dealing with and it's also at the bottom as well i just say on the call i'm going to ask you these specific questions so come prepared like i want to know things like what you've tried in the past for lead generation i want to know things like your clothes right i want to know things like what your best case studies are what your offer is so when i actually get to a call i can just run them through discovery very quickly and confirm that everything's correct confirm that they're qualified and then you know once they know my process i can pretty much just just close them okay great yeah that's key just to before the the sales call also having them to really consume these marketing assets spend some some time with you asynchronously through the vsl yeah um that makes the sales call much easier i find it's like building a parasocial relationship with with your with your prospects before you jump on a call like it's so important like if they can trust you and they've heard you before then it's no there's no shock when they jump on a sales call with you do you know what i mean yeah okay great and uh how do you how did you go from like having zero clients just starting out or maybe you just have one client to having five plus clients like how did that journey look like how did that process look like for you of course yeah so for me it was just a case of like i knew how to call the email i knew what i was doing um i just wanted to to start the lead generation agency so basically i just went crazy on volume like i just you know i bought 10 domains which then expanded out into 15 domains and 20 domains started sending cold email every single day from those domains um i scraped loads of leads off sales navigator that matched my my icp and then i also did a linkedin campaign on the side so reaching out to those prospects at the same time on like two channels um which i found was really really effective um but just going sort of crazy on on outreach i think in november it's not a crazy number but i did like 35 sales calls for myself um which was the most i've ever done in a single month um so it was a very very busy month yeah but um but it was really interesting to find out more about you know what the problems people are facing it was it was quite illuminating into into the sort of the market that that i'm that i'm reaching out to um yeah just really just going crazy on volume um following up like a madman um and also like if you're just starting out and you don't have any any case studies then you know it's worth taking a risk like you have to take some risk otherwise you're never going to succeed in you know offering a guarantee like you know i will book you this many calls not charging a setup fee um or you know finding someone that you can partner with who is you know who is willing to experiment with different offers or something along those lines um yeah just putting yourself out there and just trusting that you will get results and and delivering those results okay great yeah you took massive action and it paid off that's uh great to hear yeah and one bit that you said you you're scraping like uh linkedin sales navigator it's going a little bit it's a little bit of attention for the b2b data sources but i mean curious to hear how are you scraping linkedin sales navigator what type of tools are you using for people who are looking to do the same yeah of course so i use a tool called find email um there's a guy on twitter and valentin he's really really nice guy um really great tool it just embeds natively into sales nav and you can you can scrape leads directly from there so put in your icp learn how to use boolean searches on sales navigator and you can unlock a whole world of a whole world of different leads and qualified leads and quality leads and then just scrape directly from uh from linkedin okay yeah great yeah find email is legit we use it ourselves for our own internal campaigns yeah okay great so yeah coming to an end to this podcast just last question and i want to ask you is like tom if you could go back in time meet your younger self that was just starting out in this whole email journey or just your entrepreneurial entrepreneurial journey in general what would you tell him i'd probably slap him in the face first of all that would be the first thing i would do so i tell them to stop being so lazy and uh i i think what i've realized over the years is that you know you can't coast your way to a successful business like you're not just gonna like like happily do four hours like this whole like four hours a day work thing like i don't think that's true when you're first starting out your business you need to drag it kicking and screaming to the place that you want it to be like it it's going to be tough like you're going to be working 12 hour days you're going to be you know grinding there's going to be headaches there's going to be fires that you're putting out every single day you're going to be stressed out you know it's not going to be a simple process but that is the beauty of building a business and that's the beauty of building something for yourself is you know it is that fight and that journey and if i could go back to my younger self i'd just be like prepare yourself for it and stop being lazy and just do the work that needs to be done okay great yeah man tom it was it was great to have you here on the on the show cold emails hot takes you dropped so much value and for people who want to learn more about what you do where should they go yeah of course so
