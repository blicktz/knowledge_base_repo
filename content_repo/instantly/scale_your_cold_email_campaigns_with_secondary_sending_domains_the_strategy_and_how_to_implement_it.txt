Hi there and in this video we'll be looking at the strategy of creating secondary sending domains to scale up your cold email for more replies more revenue so then you can really increase your volume when you're doing the outreach and reach more of your target audience so to give you a little an overview of what i mean with secondary sending domains these are just domains that are similar to your main domains so top level domains work best you know like .com i always prefer myself .com domains you know agency tech there's these two out there but you know if you can go with the .com so let's say you know funny example here just to make it memorable is shrimp.com so let's say your business is shrimp.com then buy domains like get shrimp.com try shrimp.com shrimplabs.com shrimppro.com tasty shrimpapp.com and so on so just to illustrate this example on on how it will help you scale so already looking at shrimp.com your secondary domains can be try shrimp.com shrimpapp, shrimp.com shrimp.com shrimp scale shrimp pro and so on and then you know you wouldn't be sending you wouldn't be doing your cold outreach from your main domain it's not something we recommend but if you really want to you know have the best results send up secondary domains from which you do the outreach uh like i i've shown you here so just buy this additional uh domains you know domains are cheap these days anyway they've always been cheap 10 bucks uh or whatever it is and then for each domain you can set up three to five email accounts so these are inboxes right with which you reach out to your target audience let's say you target on sorry ceos cfos head of business development founders whoever it may be but you need those email additional email accounts to reach out to them so let's say for example uh you set up your main domain is shrimp.com you set up a secondary domain just for your cold outreach try shrimp.com and let's say your name a name is john smith just gonna you know set up a john.smith try shrimp.com so with each email address each inbox you can do 30 to 50 emails a day so you can see how if you have three to five inboxes per secondary domain how you can really scale up campaigns right you can send more volume without raising any red flags while and keep keeping deliverability high so in this example right i listed five secondary sending domains here let's say each one has three inboxes john.smith try shrimp john.s at trash shrimp j.smith at trash shrimp.com in total there's going to be 15 cold email accounts with which you can do outreach so you really have like 15 at your disposable disposal units always good to have a little bit more um in case one goes down or you know more importantly if you see a campaign is working really well you say okay look this target audience is really resonating with this messaging that i'm that i'm sending out i'm getting a lot of replies let me scale it up even more like if you see that something's working you can double down on it and just drop more cold email inboxes into that campaign so they can reach more people more quickly so in this particular example we have three inboxes per domain we have five secondary sending domains three times five 15 cold email inboxes let's say each one is sending 30 a day you can easily with very good deliverability and consistency also longevity send 450 emails per day so this is how you can scale up your outreach and reach more of your target audience then also something i'd recommend is you know all the secondary sending domains if someone types in try shrimp.com just make sure it redirects to shrimp.com right because sometimes before somebody responds to a cold email they'll check out your domain they want to see what it's what it's about so having a good landing page there is good and then you know you don't have to build a separate land landing page for your secondary domains it will just redirect to your shrimp.com and they'll see a little bit more about you and they say okay like this looks legit let me reply to this cold email and uh yeah so this is really how you can scale uh your campaigns you know usually with cold email tools you'd have to pay for each one of these inboxes 30 50 bucks or whatever it whatever it is so you can see if you have 15 and it costs you 30 bucks per inbox that's per seat that is that is connected that will cost you 450 a month with instantly you can do all of that all of that volume you can do with a hyper growth plan which is 97 which is significantly cheaper we have some users you know they come in they're spending two three thousand with other tools and they can do everything on the hyper growth plan and they can really scale the campaigns and get more replies and without crazy costs so this is the concept of secondary sending domains you know just set them up here you know the whiteboard will be illustrated also as a quick hack uh if you want to quickly see you know which ones are available i recommend namecheap beast mode just to get additional ideas and right you have these ideas of what could work but let's say you go to you go to the main website you click on um you click on beast mode here and then uh you're here and let's say you know again example shrimp just put in one of the keywords and then it will give you ideas you know because sometimes you try a domain and it's not there and it's a little bit tedious but here this will quickly show you what's available and you can really quickly like you know buy a bunch of domains um so just go tld here i always select only.com i click hide unavailable and then this is a neat feature prefix suffix so just enable that and you know some of the stuff that we said try get uh labs and so on uh it will just pull that up so let's see and then i also want to you know reduce the price range so it doesn't show me expensive domains you just have to have a regular dot com domain let's click generate so yeah let's see what's available here and like this is really neat right it will quickly show you uh what's out there what's available let's see if it loads up a little bit more more example with t okay so i'm just running this and it's a little bit funny because a bunch of them i mean i would suppose that a bunch of them are already taken in our shrimp example uh but let's see so let's say you know i'm buying a couple more sending domains for instantly because we also are you know doing our we're using instantly to grow instantly uh so let's take another example here let's say i've just i've just had instantly what kind of secondary sending domains we see here just just so i can show you a couple more examples of what that would look like in practice no not that many uh uh instantly and then you can also just put in a keyword so i related uh positive replies warm-up yeah any any keywords that might be related to your offer uh you can you can add them here but let's say you know let's take the simple example again uh you get my point anyway like we put some prefixes suffixes uh around the primary keyword here put dot com generate a couple results and then you hear you quickly see it will generate those results it will mix and match and then you can just grab okay trash shrimp meat shrimp open shrimp shrimp uh and just either buy it directly from namecheap or just yeah here you see that it's available great and then you can go to your uh to to go daddy and buy it from there i mean namecheap and go daddy both are pretty much the same thing and both are good um so you can buy from here or go to your domain name provider but this way you quickly see okay which one of the secondary sending domains that you want to use are available and uh yeah that's it so to recap you know just if you want to scale campaigns i recommend this strategy this method um of setting it up that way scale your volume and a name sheet piece mode is a good way to you know uh quickly find what's find out what's available and quickly buy it and then uh you're up and running all right hope this was uh useful and talk to you soon
