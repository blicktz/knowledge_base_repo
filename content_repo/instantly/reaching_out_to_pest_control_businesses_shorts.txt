What we were doing is looking for like pest control companies, like it's like really, really niche. And these guys are on LinkedIn. They like got far enough that they know that they need to be on LinkedIn.

And we were messaging to them. So like, hey, first name, saw you've been running company name for, you know, whatever amount of years. So the way we were doing that was finding the owner of the company and scraping sales navigator for that, taking that list, bringing it into clay, using their LinkedIn integration, and then enriching for the person's profile and then the company profile.

So we can have the founded year of the company just like straight in our spreadsheet. So that we could say like, you know, so you've been at this company since, you know, or you've been running this company since 2012, right? So we have a great first line that definitely is in the preview text when they open it up on their phone.

Digging a little deeper, I saw you had whatever Google review count reviews on Google, averaging a Google review score. And then I saw your Yelp review score as well. Always such a tough crowd over there.

The reason I reached out is because I'm curious if you'd be open to selling a business. Let me know if it's something you're considering.
