in this video we'll be looking at the optimal number of steps in a cold email sequence this is based on an analysis of 32 million plus cold emails that we've done recently so i get the question a lot hey how many steps should be in the sequence should i just have one step should it be two steps three steps or should it be seven steps now we can see based on numbers what the answer is and then i'm also going to tell you at the end of the video when you should break this rule but let's scroll down here and look at the results of the analysis so you can see what it is so the zero is actually the step one the one is the step two the two is the step three so you can see most the majority of the replies really 69.19 percent come in on step one of the sequence then we have another 17.42 percent that comes in on step two and then seven percent on step three you can see there's a drastic drop-off here so from this we can say as a general rule right let's say you're in a beginner or an intermediate cold email cold emailer or a cold outreacher then i would keep the sequence really on for two steps or three steps maximum now let's say you're more advanced cold emailer and you really go that cold email and you really go that copywriting and you know you talk about it as well then you can probably break this rule but cheer is just like a general rule of thumb keep the sequences a bit shorter keep the two steps maybe three steps but again this is like the uh 80 20 rule right the pareto principle the majority of the replies will come in in the the first or second the third step and you can see really after step four it's going to be less than one percent of replies that come in so i haven't even listed this in this tables so imagine if you continue sending from step uh this actually step five step six step seven if you continue to send but you're not going to get any replies this can lead first of all is bad for the free reputation if you're not getting if you keep sending you're not getting replies it can lead to more spam issues or bounce issues so really try to get to that sweet pot the optimal of like two free steps um in the uh campaign uh yeah so this hopefully this answers the question right how long should the sequence be and uh let's also set up a sequence real quick like how would that look like just a three step sequence let's say you know we're trying to capture here let's say this is like let's run it out to 70 percent plus 17 87 plus 7 uh 94 so we really like with three steps in the sequence we can already like capture uh 94 percent of the replies so let's jump into instantly and we'll set up a campaign together very easy to do so i mean depending on who your target audience is right you can scrape some leads let's say you're an e-com email marketing agency you're targeting beauty brands or fashion brands then you can you can target that let's say uh econ fashion brands cmo founder let's say your need to be sas and you have an hr solution that's targeting hr directors then you can right set up the campaign name for that obviously you need the leads first but that's how you can structure the the campaign name so you know who you're targeting and for which country and then let's say your lead agency that's selling to recently uh funded uh startups right i'm just tapping out this company name so you can kind of see what's possible what what you can target um and how versatile it is really like in any b2b context whether you're an e-com email marketing agency a branding agency a recruiting firm a b2b sas um lead gen agency in any b2b context you can really launch a campaign here inside of instantly and get more leads and get more meetings so um let's say uh you know maybe recruiting firm it could be a recruiting firm targeting companies uh that post a lot of job posts but let's go with this example let's say retargeting i recently funded uh startups in new york and that could be a company right let me just let's say i'm setting up a campaign for own offer for instantly let me just do that as an example because i have some templates ready already so let me just show you how easy this is just click here import click on csv import your lead list it will catch it automatically it will match the uh custom variable with the column name so if the column is named email it will automatically recognize this as email obviously first name last name company name i'm gonna uncheck this because i uploaded it already but if you want to check for duplicates it will do that if you have already uploaded that list then you should uncheck this but we'll have pacman working here checking everything and 588 leads we'll upload that you can really see how fast this is this is super quick uh fast and simple now let's set up this um three-step sequence right we can see from here from this graph the three steps will cover really over 90 of the replies so let's just do it three steps but we don't want to make it like seven steps or eight steps we want to be have the optimum and be efficient so let me just i'm not going to write it out from scratch here um just for the sake of brevity but i have some templates saved from some previous campaigns some stuff i've run so i'll just use this template you know you can do the same for your campaigns like let's say you're a lead gen agency or your b2b sas and you know a template is working well for you then you can just reuse that and into a new campaign when you're launching that for subject line let's go super simple first name quick question that would be that then i'll add a step and usually between the steps right you see here sequence uh how many steps in the sequence but usually i like to put three days interval between the steps or two days you can do that that as well so three or two days is what i see is working well then let's put in a second step here um let me see if i find something uh good yeah so let's say you know your second step can either be like you're providing some value the second step can also be uh let's say maybe something like more cute more funny that's working as well like some endearing gifs or you know in the follow-up you can also do something very simple and let me just adjust the time interval i'll add two days between step two and step three and then the the last one we can say uh first name um are you the right person to discuss this with or spare someone else at a company name i should be directing so it is or you can also go super super super super go super simple first name thoughts save it i have everything saved and then go into the schedule let's say you know i'm targeting new york or america let's say if i was targeting the us i would just change the uh if i was targeting the u i would just change the time zone here save that and then click options i select a couple of sending accounts this will do inbox rotation which is very helpful to scale by keeping deliverability super high so let's say i have 10 email accounts connected right if we go back to the beginning remember we uploaded 588 leads so the email account number one will reach out to lead number one email number email account number two will reach out to lead number two email account number three will reach out to lead number three and so on and so forth so we distribute all those leads across these sending accounts but obviously the sequence the messaging will be the same that way you don't send 500 email from just one sending account which will you know get you spam or it really hurts deliverability if you can spread it across diversified across 10 sending accounts that will be much better then i'm going here also with this strategy right keep in mind we really are capturing like almost 70 of the replies on step one of this sequence so what i want to do is with the show advanced options is i want to prioritize reaching out to new leads over scheduled follow-up right this will prioritize step reaching out to new contacts instead of prioritizing follow-ups so right if you see maybe the campaign performance is dropping off and you have a lot of follow-up steps the campaign may be spending too much time in follow-up land instead of reaching reaching out contacting brand new fresh contacts so just click this um check mark here and then you're good to go just like an additional boost it's not absolutely necessary but um we'll do it here as well so and and then you don't have to click save and you can launch i'm not going to launch this now i don't want to go this i don't want this to go out right away but you can just click launch and then all the replies will show up in your unibox one more thing daily limit but we said 10 email accounts are selected as a general rule of thumb here for the sending volume you can send 50 cold emails per day per sending account so in our case with 10 accounts 10 times 50 we can contact 500 per uh 500 called emails per day to the lead list we recently uploaded with that sequence we set up and we're good to go and that's it just click the blue button and yeah i hope this video was helpful uh recap 80 20 really like the majority of replies come in and in the first two steps maybe three steps as well but after that you can see a point of diminishing diminishing returns it converges to zero uh unless you really really know what you're doing i know obviously some guys who are able to pull off seven step sequence seven type sequences but they're really good at copywriting they really know what they're doing if you're starting out or if you're intermediate and just want some like launch campaign quick and want some quick wins just keep it to two steps or three steps and then later once you've mastered it you can break the rules again and maybe do some longer sequences here with five six seven steps but yeah that's it that's the video hope this was helpful like and subscribe comment and if it was helpful and i'll talk to you soon thank you so you you you you you
