So another thing you can try doing is just lowering your outgoing volume. So sometimes all you have to do is just lower the outgoing volume of your cold emails by let's say 20% and already get better results that way. So one way you can think of it is for some reason people are obsessed with maximum sending limits.

So they ask what the sending limit, like max send limit is, and then just send that limit out like at all times. But yeah, you should be obsessed with deliverability and not by the maximum volume. You can think of it similarly as with like buying a car, you don't really ask like what's the maximum speed of this car and then get the car and just drive around with the max speed at all times.

So that's one way you lose your license, lose your car, like getting into an accident. So you can think of it similarly with email domains. It's always better to go slower than push like every limit that there is.

Some people make it work, but it's just much more risky to do so. And yeah, to make sure that your outgoing volume never goes above any limits that you want. What you can do is go into each email account you've connected to instantly and in the campaign setting set a daily campaign limit.

So in this case, you can set it as 30. That means that this account will never send out more than 30 cold emails per day, no matter in how many campaigns you put this email address in. So yeah, another super simple way you can actually just improve your results right away.

Because your sending less, it gets you better results. Thank you.
