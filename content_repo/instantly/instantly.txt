hi i'm nils co-founder of instant.ai and in this video i'll be doing a demo a walkthrough of instantly kind of showing you all the different features um what's included instantly what you can do with instantly and also the overall flow of it how to set up a campaign and so on but the main value proposition of instantly is really it helps you scale your outreach campaigns through unlimited email sending accounts unlimited warm-up and smart.di so you can really get more leads get more meetings and scale up your campaign so let's take a look at what that looks like in practice i'm going to log into an account here and the first thing you'll see in your instantly account is all the outreach accounts that you have connected all the email accounts that are doing the outreach you know on your behalf so that's always the first step connecting your outreach accounts here so you can see we have quite a bit of accounts connected you can connect as many as you want and you can also warm up as many as you want and if you've been in the cold email game for a while you know that usually you have to pay per inbox 20 30 50 dollars per inbox per month um which let's say if you have 10 or 20 inboxes to do the outreach it can really add up in terms of cost so with instantly you can scale up your volume without really scaling up your costs at the same time now first step would be right if you come into this account and there's you just signed up first step would be to connect your outreach accounts you can connect gmail g suite outlook um and zoho and really any provider through imap and smtp now when you have it connected then the second step would be to uh put it into the warm-up pool and what the warm-up pool is you can basically think of it as a big community of people emailing each other back and forth uh basically you're instantly friends and you're emailing back and forth with them they're replying to the email just like sending the right signals to the email providers to google and saying hey like this is an email uh that should land in the primary inbox there's all these other people replying to it and that's how the warm-up pool works so if we go to the settings we'll see a little bit more about that you'll see the deliverability score of the warm-up emails here you can also see like a gradual ram ramp up uh up to uh 40 a day you can set these settings but this is how you're going to do the warm-up email so let's say if you have a brand new outreach account um you want to put that outreach account like two three weeks into the warm-up and then as you know once you're running campaigns with it you also want to keep it in the warm-up but here you can see how it gradually builds up and you can see a summary of the stats now settings for each uh inbox email inbox that you have connected you can adjust the names you have the daily campaign limit uh you can also add a custom tracking domain which helps again with deliverability and some of the metrics so really important always right the number one priority of the cold email is to keep the deliverability high and having a lot of sending accounts having unlimited warm-up uh are just two of the main things that really can help you with deliverability the customer crack custom tracking domain is also one of those things it's um it's very easy to set up we have a two minute video on how to do that and you can add it add your custom tracking domain here also now next step would be to set up some of the warm-up settings these are some of the basic settings you can set the increase per day daily warm-up limit reply rate just some basic stuff here where it gradually increases the send per day let's say you have a an outreach account you've been doing cold email for a while already you have an outreach account um that's not new you can just disable slow warm-up and it will jump right to this limit but if it's a new account we recommend you know starting at two and then gradually increasing the amount of warm-up emails you're getting then uh next step would be the advanced settings here are really cool the read emulation so it will spend time and scroll food scroll through your warm-up email to emulate human-like reading it's really cool um one of the advanced settings one custom tracking domain random email range and open rate spam protection mark important so these are all important signals that we want to send out there to make sure that you know when we're doing the cold outreach uh that our delivery is high deliverability is high we reach the main inbox we reach our primary inbox and your potential clients see your message and they reply to your message to your offer now this is in terms of the settings for each outreach account um you know when you come in here just click on the little flame when it turns green it will enable the warm-up and again connect as many as you want you can really you know really really scale here um so this is the first step connect your accounts put them into the warm-up then the second step is going to be uh setting up campaign so let's set up a campaign together real quick this doesn't uh take a long time long time i will just like give you a little bit of an overview of what the flow looks like so here on the left hand side we'll we were at email accounts now let's jump to the campaigns we'll click here add new and let's set up a campaign together i have prepared prepared a lead list um this is just a new list i prepared uh verified it so i'm gonna set up a campaign here the targeting obviously everybody has different targeting in this case i'm gonna message companies that have that were funded in may uh in emia so in europe and so on so we'll click we'll add the campaign name click continue and now let me download this lead list i'm gonna download it as a csv and let's go back here to instantly and then let's import these leads that we want to call the email import upload csv so i've uploaded the csv here and then you can see the email it will directly recognize that match the attribute to it verify status we don't really need to import here but we want to import the custom variable first name last name that's usually a good idea so we can write dynamically say hey first name um with the variable company name also something i don't like to import here corporate phone we don't really have any data for the corporate phone here so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna import that and yeah company url company linkedin we could uh if we wanted to we could import that as a custom variable but i'm not gonna use the linkedin url in the cold email copy so um let's see let's check if this looks good email first name last name and the company name those kind of important variables for this specific campaign um you can also create uh custom variables and personalized lines variables and so on when you upload it here so let's upload all the leads are you sure yes let's upload them and all contacts have been uploaded so it will directly bring you to the sequences editor uh you can see here the leads were added all here now first step uh right now we have to come up with a message i'm not going to do that here on the demo just to save some time i have a template prepared uh you can also save custom templates right so if you have something that's working well for you you can just you know save it and then use it uh later on so let me see um let's use this one as a first step first name congrats on launching company names we'll dynamically insert that uh subject line one i like to use is just called it's just false question mark usually works well then you can add as many follow-up steps as as you want usually i do three to five steps in a sequence but that depends on you and then two to three days uh weight between the steps let's add a follow-up step here too uh so we're gonna add this here let's add a second step and let's see what we have here let's use this one uh just as a follow-up step so we have it here okay great so um i'm not going to set up more follow-up steps here but um and just to save some time again but you can see just add as many uh just build out the sequence as you want then next step is going to going to be to set the schedule so these uh these leads are primarily primarily in the european time zone so let me just put it for the european business hours uh let's say on the north and then save it and um yeah great so we upload the leads we upload we created a sequence and we set the schedule and then options and then this is a neat feature also you can see we can just the accounts the sending accounts that we connected in the beginning we can just add them in here into campaign and we'll do inbox rotation so it will just rotate all these sending accounts these outreach accounts and uh it will rotate them so you can connect as many as you want i'm just gonna add the ones with my name here for now we have a couple different names that are doing outreach here i'm just gonna use mine here so you know you can if you want you can just connect 24 outreach accounts that drop them into that campaign and they're they're ready to go again you have you can connect an unlimited amount of accounts like if you connect five or ten or fifteen accounts you can still do that with the growth or the hypergrowth plan so the growth plan is 37 a month just everything included hypergrowth is also 97 a month everything included um so you have inbox rotation here open tracking you can leave that on and some default settings and let's see we have 24 accounts connected usually i recommend 30 to 50 emails outreach emails per day per account so um let's see 24 times uh 30 emails with this one we can send 720 so 24 times 30 is uh 720 uh if i'm mistaken but we can send 720 emails in one day and then we're ready to go so we can send it to the campaign so all the sending accounts are connected they'll do inbox rotation this also helps with deliverability make sure your open rates and your reply rates is high and making sure you know that you land in that primary inbox and then we're ready to go so we can send high volume it's high volume for the campaign but on a individual inbox level it's not that high volume so it doesn't really raise any red flags and it flies on the radar so to say um because each individual inbox is not sending that that much volume you can still send 30 to 50 per inbox which is uh good but you can see 720 good volume so let's launch this thing uh yes for sure and we're gonna launch it okay so we launched the campaign uh before and now uh i'm gonna show you what the analytics looks like so this is this is a campaign i launched uh the other day and just to show you a little bit what the stats and metrics look like uh you can see here the sent email how many opened the open rate how many replied the reply rate you can see the graph also um when and how many replied so this in in terms of the graph and the analytics then the next step would be the leads right if you want a more detailed view of the leads you can set check uh check the filters let's say you know you want to see any everybody that opened but hasn't replied or people that haven't opened yet or people that replied so you can apply these filters and you can then also export that data and maybe you know for anybody that's open but hasn't replied uh maybe put them into new campaign with with new body copy um so this is in terms of what it looks like with the analytics you'll see it like that um for your campaigns then the next step right we connected the accounts we warmed them up we set up the campaign we launched the campaign we're looking at the stats now the replies have come in right which is ultimately the goal so we're going to move on to the unibox which is the centralized master inbox where all of the replies are aggregated in one place and where you can easily reply to each each one of them so let's jump in here um so let's see from all the outreach inboxes right this is actually a live account so i'm showing you some live data here you can see everything is aggregated in one place so let's say uh this one this campaign here um the this follow-up seems to have worked it brought in the reply from from the person uh that we put that we want that we reached out to and did we want to get the reply from um so yeah let's say you have a positive reply here uh it just came in like um two three hours ago um and uh let's say they're interested you can mark it as interested you can set up a zapier also to just automatically push that into your crm if anybody's interested and then if you want to reply to them you can do that here uh and reply to them and say uh sounds great um does tomorrow 1 p.m or 3 p.m est uh work uh for you or you know whatever your approach is after that once you get the positive replies depends on you if you want to send the calendar of course you can do that too and then um you can see um from here you can really manage all your you know all the all the positive replies that come in um so yeah so to recap we have the email accounts we we set up the campaign um launch it look at the analytics and then you'll see the all the positive replies all the replies in one place which makes it easy to reply to them push into your crm continue sales process from there and yeah scale campaigns from there really so um this was a overview of uh instantly and uh what it can do so uh and how it uh how it could help you get more you know more replies uh more meetings ultimately more revenue more clients uh hope that was helpful uh if you have any questions uh let us know uh and um talk to you soon thanks you
