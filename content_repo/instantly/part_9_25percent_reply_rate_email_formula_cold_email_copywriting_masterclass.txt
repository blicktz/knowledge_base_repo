all right finally we can actually start talking about the strategies the actual templates to copy everything we're using in our code email so the strategy one is 25 reply rate email formula yeah it's 25 reply rate but it's pretty small volume but this formula works and when we start with new targeting new copy new offers we always start with this uh good starting point and then we can work around that to tweak it find out different offers different combos that works and the secret to the universe and code emailing is simple you get what you put in the more effort you do researching your niche their businesses everything we went through before the better results you're going to get if you understand your prospects better because most people are not going to do the research most people are just gonna google code email template copy the first one use it try it for a month if it doesn't work they're going to quit you're not going to be like that you're going to actually put in more effort and you're going to get those results so starting from the beginning adding it to your process that you have a calendar where to copy every day you start using our templates the strategies you're going to get more results if you create 100 customized emails you could possibly get too close to 100 reply rate but in terms of creating code email campaigns at scale here's exactly the templates we use and just again to give you insights most of the big players they don't have the best reply rates but they make the most money because there's a balance between sending out volume at scale and reply rates for us too our goal was to rather go after a lot of people with a little bit lower response rate while getting more customers like net and total compared to the end of the day we're going to do the best campaigns here we're going to do the best campaigns so we're going to do the best campaigns so we're going to do the best campaigns and we'll be able to get higher reply rate so don't get stuck on reply rate it's a really good metric in the beginning to have you still want to have a really high reply rate but 25 here is just one of our best campaigns usually it's much lower like even five percent reply rate at scale is good for us and this is the main template we use and you can just change up the offers to copy the cta to figure out what works best for you so let's get into it it has these pieces personalization your value prop target niche sub segment location your targets cone your targets value prop relevant case study cliffhanger value prop and a call to action so here's an example for offering lead gen to tiktok market agencies hey tom just saw that you helped nike get 1 million views which latest tiktok campaign that's amazing i wanted to reach out because we connect e-commerce focused tiktok agencies in la like yours with low ticket e-commerce stores perfect for tiktok ads that are already making over 100k a month and looking to grow with tiktok ads just help dormify book 17 meetings i would love to show you my plan of getting you 50 meetings with e-commerce stores like that we work mostly on performance by the way do you have any time this week for a quick chat cheers alex again it seems pretty generic but it has so many resonating variables that will resonate with the targeting now let's go deep dive into each one of these parts to see why they work so personalizations i've talked about this but you want to go through the prospects websites or linkedin because something unique about them or the company write a quick sweet compliment this is the only minor part and will take 30 to 60 seconds rest of the email is targeted but not customized my favorite and fastest way is to find success stories and because something you like just so that you might get 1 million views you can also switch it out for that segmentation a targeted generic first line that i talked about before but in the beginning i would recommend doing fully personalized first lines second part your value probe here's where you can brag about what to do best don't hold back put your best foot forward and make it as specific to your target as possible so here value up is like simply like we connect or we bring you more leads then target niche the sub segment location again you want to be as specific as possible instead of e-commerce stores you want to call them out as much as you can luxury watch stores in new york city the more specific the more it will resonate you want to make them think damn like that's exactly me or if they did it for this very similar company probably they can do the same for me the targets cold most cold emails just mentioned the niche but we go a step further to show our process of action or what their goal is instead of saying we just help them connect with the best price for decom stores we can tell them exactly which kind of stores low ticket best price for tiktok agencies and are already making 100k a month so we're not just connecting them with random stores these stores are already making 100k a month they're successful and we're just going to help them unlock that tiktok audience then your targets value prop another step further a little step deeper showing them how well we know audience by calling out their value prop too this is what they help their customers do looking to grow with tiktok ads this is the kind of perfect client for the people reaching out to we show them we know who they want to attract by adding this then relevant case study short and relevant case study to show you can actually do this and date for a very similar company just helped this company book this many meetings and then cliffhanger now let's get bold and put our money where our mouth is let's show the prospects that we know exactly what we're doing we have a plan we're an expert it's just all like i'm gonna figure this out i know we have such good skills we're expert this that we have a money back guarantee or performance based pricing model tell them you send them a burger with uber eats if you don't find a call with you valuable make it interesting and as much of an open as possible to get them a call with you for example i would love to show you my plan of getting you 50 million to decomsters like that we work mostly in performance by the way so i already have a plan of getting them 50 meetings with exact kind of ecosystem you want to get on calls with plus we work on performance you're not going to pay us if you don't deliver and then call to action just enter email with a clear call to action either ask them for call or if it's okay for you to send personal speed or a proposal or more information during time this week for a quick chat and that's it you'll take some research in the beginning but reverse engineer case studies talk with your customers and honestly try to understand your business that's how you will get higher response rate so start with this email copy and we're going to go after some different strategies more unique strategies in the next videos but don't skip this part start with this go after all of these variables that you can this has been consistently one of the best templates that we've used you might want to tweak it might remove some stuff but don't skip this part go through with this and create at least one this kind of call in a template
