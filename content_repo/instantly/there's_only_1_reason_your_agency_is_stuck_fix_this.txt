hey guys if your agency is stuck and not growing fast enough there's only one reason for it and i'm going to show you in this video what it is and how you can fix it before we get started please subscribe like this video so i can keep creating more of this content so let's get into it so the only reason your agency is not growing is because you don't have enough sales opportunities it's super simple if you don't have opportunities you don't have meetings your calendar is empty you're not getting any closes that's the only reason why your agency is not growing and then there are two reasons why you don't have enough sales opportunities first you don't have any product market fit so you're doing the right work but just there's no fit your product or service is not needed it's saturated it's just not working out and we'll show you how to fix that in second part you have product market fit but you're not doing the right work you're focusing on the wrong things wasting your time and that's why you're stuck before we get into how to fix that i want to show you our campaigns instantly so here's like our campaigns pretty fast four weeks and check that total replies so how many replies we're getting 32 55 60 38 here 51 86 95 99 so imagine if you could get 99 sales opportunities in a day of course not all of them are going to be positive but just 99 opportunities per day imagine how fast your agency could grow if you could get them even if 50 30 of them are positive imagine how many good demos and calls you're going to have with potential prospects so this is the goal this is where we want to get to we've done it i'm going to show the exact ways how we did it you can just copy our strategies and i promise you if you stick with it it's going to work for you so let's get into it so first part if you don't have product market fit you don't have case studies you're starting out you're sending emails doing the right job but it's not just it's not bringing results so first what you're going to do go through our niche selection masterclass and choose a new niche or tweak your niche to make it better for cold email so all the links are going to be in the description i'm going to share with this later i also made a video about this couple of days ago so just go through our offer niche selection document learn how to select the good niche that's like half the battle if you have a good niche everything you do forward is going to be much easier then set up campaigns and send 5000 targeted emails instantly so i don't care if it takes you two months three months whatever you gotta do however much money you have to spend on like getting more domains email accounts send 5000 targeted emails follow our copy strategies target the emails personalize them if you send 5000 emails and you get over two closes you can scale up one close can be a fluke if you're two it's a good sign that you might have product market fit scale it up if you have under two closes after sending 5000 emails go back to step one go through our offer and niche selection again find a new niche tweak your offer to make it better save another 5000 emails and then if you get over two closes scale up so that's all you got to do the main thing here is not to give up we've tested a bunch of different angles bunch of different niches a lot of them didn't work out the main thing is you keep testing and you just send more emails and now the second part but most companies are struggling with with no growth they have a good offer they have closed already they have case studies so why aren't they growing they're doing the wrong work so stop working on your website your logo and branding writing blog posts for now buying courses talking and onboarding on qualified prospects all of this if you're not growing is a waste of time for the next few months cut out everything that doesn't move the needle and just focus on stuff that does and i'm going to show you what it is but this is key there are like so many things we can be doing and it feels like we're doing something we're doing the work but all of this isn't going to help you grow your agency as fast as working on the right stuff will so just remove all of this you don't need to do this right now if you already have closes you've gone through the program if you have at least two case studies you've proven that you can close you have made money with email so the only thing you need to be doing is start working on getting more domains and email accounts it's simple you just want to send more volume you want to set up more campaigns and send more emails jump on calls and close more prospect we're giving you our exact guide you don't need to buy any courses we're going to give you a quick start guide just follow this exactly how we're getting once 10 demos every day i showed you here imagine if you can get the same numbers 50 30 60 90 100 opportunities per day that's how you're going to grow your agency don't do anything else before you get to that kind of level just focus on this and it might feel like a little bit boring a little bit like stale but this is like what most need like if you want to grow your agency you have to do this and the hard part is it takes a little while to get started and that's where a lot of people drop off they lose motivation because it takes four weeks just around that to get revenue from a new email account two weeks for warming up a new email account and then two weeks average sales cycle so emails warmed up you send out emails you're going to post a response you jump on a call they think about the offer you go back and forth so it will take some time to get going so be prepared to not get those results for the first four maybe even six weeks but still keep working on targeting copy and sales invest money into more domains more sales we have the all the guides you need go through a copywriting guide tweak our offer work on the target it makes you're targeting the right people the results will come just stay consistent don't get sidetracked just work on getting more domains sending more emails the more emails you send the more money you're going to make it's as simple as that so i hope it helps just get rid of the distractions focus on what you need to do we're giving you the roadmap exactly what you need to do you have the clarity we just take away all the crap that's out there and just show you what you need to do so hope this helps again if you liked it please subscribe like this video and see you in the next
