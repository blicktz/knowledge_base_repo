So now if you've already set up all the technical stuff, the final thing you want to do before moving forward is to verify and make sure that everything you did is done correctly. And thankfully, there's a really easy way to do it with Instantly. So if you've connected your email accounts to Instantly, what you can do is just click the test domain setup button, which will be on your email account screen in the top right corner and that will basically check if all your MX SPFD Kim D-Mark records are set up correctly.

And if they are, you'll get a confirmation screen so that way you'll know that everything you did works and is done properly. So for the custom tracking domain as well, if you're adding it for an account in Instantly, you will get this CNAME verified SSL verified status that will confirm that what you did just now works and everything is set up properly. So yeah, that's super important before you move forward, making sure that basically everything you did is correct.

Because yeah, we've seen people that enter all kinds of DNS records, think they're set up correctly, but they don't work. And it's exactly the same as not having them. So yeah, make sure these work before moving on.

Next, we'll cover the actual running of the email campaigns. Okay. We'll cover the album.
