we did it by getting a bunch load of domains so here are all the instantly sending accounts we're using right now to get more clients for instantly i can scroll for minutes and it just keep going keep going keep going and that's pretty much what we did to grow instantly using this strategy that i'm going to link down in the description we didn't do anything special just using the exact same strategy but the main goal was we just got so many domains that we just got so many opportunities when i started we had a call with alex berman and i asked him if instant was yours what would you do to grow it and he said just get more domains and it's like makes sense it's simple but that's what you have to do and nils made a really great video a couple days ago like how to get secondary domains all the technical side but for this video i want to focus more on the high level zoom out a bit and tell you about the roi and why it's so so positive so first i create this document i can share this too in the description below and here's an example with 15 accounts if we're sending 30 emails per accounts we're going to be sending 450 emails daily that's almost 10 000 emails monthly if we have 30 open rate so i've tried to be conservative with the numbers that's almost 3 000 opens if our positive response rate is one percent we're going to get 30 positive responses and if you have 35 meeting rate we're going to have 10 meetings with potential customers and if you close every fourth person on that list 25 we're going to have between two and three closes if we're a regular agency our ticket size is 5k a month we're going to make around 13k while the setup cost for the domains and accounts it's going to be around 225 and the roi is almost 60. so it's like crazy roi and obviously on the setup side like you're going to have some more like cost for leads and instantly but the great thing with instantly and why we graded it was like before we're paying so much per warm-up subscription for email subscription the cost just kept rising as we added more accounts but instantly it doesn't you have your subscription just add more accounts and you can send more volume and earn more money if your ticket sizes are lower like it still works if your saws add your lifetime value here let's him with like a thousand still 11 x roi and we still make much more money back than we put in right and that's the that's the thing you just want to have a system where you know if you put one dollar in you get three out like there's nothing more to it if you're an agency you can use the same roi calculation sheet to sell to your clients and like explain to them why it's so valuable let's put it to five thousand again but the biggest part like i mentioned is the actual volume so if instead of 15 we're going to get 100 accounts all the numbers go crazy but the revenue almost 90k instead of 13. roi system setup rises but revenue will increase you're just going to get so many more responses so many more opportunities so many more meetings so many more closes and if you have any issues in the funnel like you're not getting a lot of positive responses just work on a copy if you're not getting a lot of meetings uh try a better targeting work on how to close more people from emails like how to get them on calls if your close rate is low invest into learning your sales process have a better pitch deck read alex hermosis create a no-brainer offer and work from there but in the end this is like how your regular funnel should look like and the only thing i want to give you from this video is just get more domains whatever you're going to do like the first thing after you finish this video go buy more domains as much as you can spare use this strategy again link in the description and then after two months come back and tell me like rawr thanks so much because i invested more into domains i made so much more money like there's literally nothing to it so right now do me a favor go buy more domains set them up instantly and send out more emails
