hello everybody so i was working on this thing until two in the morning yesterday i finished it up it's 59 pages and what we're going to cover here and i'm also going to link the document in the description below but we're going to be talking about lead mining strategies and frameworks we used to get 400 positive replies monthly so how we mine and scrape 40k targeted leads a month um so yeah i'll show you this is a long document it's kind of a mixture of more like high level strategies and then specific tactics and sops so in this video i'll be more talking about like the high level strategies and then the tactics sops you can just you know go take a look in the document and maybe give it to a team member or give it to a virtual assistant and then they can do it for you so first things first with those leads and what i'm going to cover in this video is all the different lead sources also how to do initial research how to organize name lead lists and the different lead sources and how you can leverage them to get more positive replies to get more clients more revenue and more customers for your business so first we'll zoom out then we'll zoom in a little bit look at the different lead sources then we zoom out again so first thing first right you can uh if you have instantly already you have a really really good tool to warm up your sending accounts uh you have you can send a lot of cold emails but you also need data obviously right so you need good data you need targeted data cleaned and verified data and we recommend the wide variety of sources uh which i'm going to cover here but yeah like having good data is really important right now we're saying that lead mining is one of the closest thing things to modern day gold mining we can get so basically with this guide we want to arm you with pickaxes tactics and give you a map where there is a highest chance to find gold once you stumble upon a real gold mine gold mine you'll know it right away you know some lead databases can be expensive i'm only covering lead databases in here that we're using ourselves so some of them can be really expensive if you just you know google and like pick up a random one like data can be expensive but if you do it the right way if you have the right strategy the right combination of sources then you can get away without having to pay a lot for leads and still getting a high amount a big volume of quality leads so yeah just keep in mind you know one one good lead can be worth uh 10k 100k for high ticket b2b offer depending on what the pricing structure is for your offer but yeah one good lead could be you know a client that stays with you for a year two years um for your 5k 10k a month uh service whatever whatever it may be so just keep that in mind and yeah so how to succeed with this guide is also important there's more like high level strategy so just you know create a 30 minute calendar event daily to scrape so import with cold email just generally in life right as you know if you want to make progress you just have to be consistent and you have to pin in the work consistently and just show up so just create a 30 minute calendar event daily just to scrape clean fill your campaigns with leads go and build lead lists at the beginning you can do it yourself but i recommend that you know after you've done it 10 15 20 times just give it to a team member and they'll be able uh you know to do it for you just give them give them this guide and they'll know how to build the lists so yeah just do it consistently also i recommend doing it this yourself at the beginning because uh you learn about the different filtering options and the different targeting options with the lead sources right and then if you have to come up with a new campaign a new angle you can you can think about you can brainstorm different options like what could be possible okay who else could we target like what's possible could we target by technology should we target by different title what kind of con countries or regions can we target here what type of industries there are what type of keywords all these things you learn about when you just use it and click around and this will give you like the unique perspectives unique insights on some fresh lead lists to build so yeah just do it daily and do it consistently initial research uh this is also important we have a copywriting avatar cheat sheet here let me click on this and open it just get really clear on like who you're targeting who is it that you're targeting and that way uh you can create relevant and highly specific lead lists too right do you want to target ceos marketing managers head of business development or hr directors um is it people who use specific specific types of software let's say you're a clayview agency um helping e-commerce stores with their email marketing or then just find users who are already using clayview for example you know just a very specific example here or you know you you're a branding agency and you want to help e-commerce stores with their branding you know just like talk thinking about the e-commerce niche right now but there's so many other niches that's really important to think about like who's the decision maker in this process so let's say you are you are a success coach maybe your target audience is more hr directors rather than the marketing managers so this is stuff you really have to be specific about and there's also something where you can test offers you can see okay who in the market resonates most with your offer and then double down on that when you find something good uh also countries is important like obviously us is a huge market it's a really good market um but you can also go outside of the us you can target canada you can target you know all the other ones the english-speaking ones native english-speaking ones but there's also a lot of other countries with high purchasing power that maybe are not as obvious you know maybe um luxembourg or like belgium or netherlands or switzerland um or the middle east or singapore um and panama you know like smaller countries that may be overlooked or scandinavia you know scandinavia is a good one everybody speaks english there they have money uh and yeah just think about who you can target in terms of geography also all right so this covers it just get clear on it uh it's not only one avatar you can have multiple different avatars test different messaging for different segments uh that may resonate with your offer all right moving on here uh organizing naming leaders is also good like you know as you build out your lead lists and you extract all these leads and all that data from the services just put them into your own google drive folder like name them appropriately and uh yeah drop them in there because you can reuse them in the future right uh just because you sent a cold email campaign to uh a batch of lead ones of leads once doesn't mean you can hit them up hit them up again in two three weeks right uh the people that are subscribed are on the on the block list anyway so you're not gonna uh necessarily bother them uh just hit them up again with different subject line different body copy you know and uh yeah so you can reuse it reuse leads and recycle repurpose leads so this is where this comes into play as well um so yeah let's go through the uh different lead sources quickly here apollo is a good one is is cheap uh it's effective so uh also has good filtering options options you know it's not the most incredible lead source but when i when i look at like the uh cost versus value it's a very solid source and you can really like send high volume with it so kind of covers the basis basics uh of what you can lead uh of what you can use b2b outreach for cold email then you can just layer other more advanced lead sources on top of it um yeah with this one you know a little problem with apollo that i noticed is sometimes you know you ex you tell them to just export the verified leads but they're not actually verified so you have to run them through a bulk email checker or million verifier which is a lead list cleaner which i'll show you at the end of this guide also so yeah just do this couple times and then give this to a way for example in the beginning when i was starting out with cold email i was doing this myself a lot and then now we have someone in the team that does it and that just for example can come up with ideas and then they go ahead and build the lead list and you know put the clean the lead list and then put it into instantly then maybe me or someone else on the team comes up with that with some copy so yeah just give this to someone on your team or learn it yourself in the beginning and then you're good to go now next one also with apollo you can enrich a list of domains so let's say you only have domains and like the dot coms and you want to find out okay what kind of email addresses can i see here for this particular company domain what kind of people are associated to this domain which is helpful sometimes especially with lead lists like built with or other other scrapers all right exported next good one sales nav scrapers this is good one too um three different linked from scrapers uh everboot lead type find email um so with lead linked uh sales nav scrapers i recommend you learn about boolean search right did you really learn about the search filters how to this is also again where your avatar cheat sheet comes in right you know when your target audience so you can apply the filters and apply some of these booleans to exclude stuff to make sure you're very specific in your search uh here are instructions on how to use these how to use delete um linkedin scrapers and then we'll go to the next one when you find email is where you want to um we go to the next one which is scrappy word so with scrappy word you can scrape the followers of certain twitter profiles and find their email addresses and then send them an email and then you know easy transition is in the email as an icebreaker you can say hey i saw your twitter profile and the father reach out and if they're following a certain profile let's say you know random example here but uh i was looking at some international tax consulting out of interest and there's this profile called nomad capitalist and a lot of people follow this profile to find out about you know how to set up uh an international structure for the for tax optimization so you know these people are already interested in that in tax consulting let's say you have a similar offer just hit them up with a cold email and say hey i saw your twitter profile that you that you've been following this prof uh this this person um i do this and that and the other thing so you can swoop in here maybe you have a biohacking offer you know maybe you have a sales coaching offer just scrape grant cardone followers or whoever is the most popular sales coach right now uh if you're targeting a server if you have a service for accountants or you have a software for accountants um or you help accountants yeah you help accountants grow their business go to accounting today or just type in the keyword accounting and then you'll see the most popular profiles scrape it bomb and send a cold email uh you can get really creative here and really create highly targeted campaigns a built with uh is a really good source too you can scrape you can find technologies that certain websites are using so let's say uh certain websites are using a a certain crm software or a certain landing page builder or just software that's on the page and you have a competitor you can just you know find and you have your own product that competes with them you can just you know these are customers of the software software right let's say um you create a crm that's competing with hubspot just find all the hubspot users and then you can it will build with will give you a list and then you can enrich that domain list inside of apollo get all the email addresses and email them verify first though and here instructions exactly how to do that too crunchbase good one too you'll you'll find uh recently founded companies startups b2b uh sas companies uh tech companies are really interesting to uh really interesting data source as well next one is launch gravity so this one i discovered recently and it's signal based data so for example it will give you a report of new founders from last month or it will give you a report of last these were companies that were funded last month right they were just recently funded you can swoop in with an icebreaker let's say hey congrats on getting funded last month um and transitioning to your pitch you know so now they have money you know maybe they need some help with their growth if they're whatever service it is that you're offering um so next one is some custom scraping right just some ideas here that you can think about sometimes it's good to be outside of the box because if you're doing stuff outside of the boxes are like really untapped fresh market and um you can get creative here uh for example in the past i scraped angel list angel list is also it's kind of similar to crunch space but there was a lot less competition so i hired somebody to scrape angel list for me and uh yeah booked a lot of uh booked a lot of discovery calls uh through that find different directories a clutch is a good one a directory for b2b companies and yeah you'll find on opwork or fiverr you know there's plenty of people who know how to how to scrape stuff and they can do that for you and g2 trust pilot review sites are good to scrape to um then we have niche specific databases uh for example you know get latka is a podcast company and he interviews sas companies so he has like a kind of a directory of different sas companies uh e-commerce leads so this one is specific to e-commerce um let's say you know random example here but it kind of shows you that there's something out there for everybody there's a directory for almost everybody out there like let's say you're you're selling uh your bulk uh wholesaling uh mma equipment or you have like a marketing program for mma gyms like random offer right but you can find mma gyms just go to the directory get the domains enrich them with apollo or uh find email find the email addresses and um yeah then email them cold email them and uh yeah so next thing lead validation so once you have your leads once you have your uh you know all your leads ready they're sitting somewhere on a google sheet on a csv uh just make sure that you verify them so all right you know this quote from the from the walls of wall street movie it's a fugazi it's never landed it's no matter it's not on the elemental chart so right it doesn't exist so sometimes it will say this is a lead that exists but it doesn't actually exist so we want to double check ourselves because the problem is if you send emails to to list uh to email addresses that don't even exist it will bounce and bounces reduce your reputation of the sending account and then you can get into a downward spiral of better deliverability and so on so you don't want to go there uh at all so double check verify we have i recommend two tools bulk email checker is a good one to verify it's cheap a little bit slow but it does the job million verifier is a new one i've been testing it's more expensive at the lower packages but if you buy a a bigger package let's say uh if it was the 200k or 150k uh or the 100k plus credits package uh it's the same price as bulk email checker and it's much faster yeah so depending on what kind of volume you do if if you don't do like very high volume you can just start with bulk email checker maybe save a little bit of money there um if you're patient but if you're running high volume anyway and you want things to move much faster than i recommend million verifier to verify everything and yeah so this is our a guy 59 pages uh of pretty much you know everything you need for cold email and to hire uh to scale your cold email campaigns also this i talked about hiring lead miners uh just having somebody on your team that's really good at lead mining and understands the process um uh is a good move right as a business owner if you're running an agency if you're running a software company uh it's good to understand these things but you can't you know spend too much of your own time you know out there like building lead lists uh just have someone else in the tomb in the team take care of that for you then that's it so 59 pages here you'll have all the information you need uh really to really scale your campaigns um to get to hundreds of positive replies a month and so what are next steps yeah if you don't have an instantly add uh and you want to get more positive replies of cold email more scale
