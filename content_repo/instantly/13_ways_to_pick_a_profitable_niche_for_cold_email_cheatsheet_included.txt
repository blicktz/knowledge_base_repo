Hey guys, Raoul here and today I'm going to walk you through the best way to choose an offer or a niche for cold email and having a good offer is like a cheat code because with a saturated offer you can try 30 different angles and still not get any results and I know it because we've done the exact same thing with our leeching agency. So with this document I went through the main things that we look at while choosing a niche and then you can use the same thing and Alex Ramosi wrote a great book 100 million dollar offers you can use that in general to craft your offer but this is specifically for cold email which is a little bit different because you're coming in cold your offer needs to be such a no-brainer that a stranger that doesn't know anything about you just receives something from you might be interested. It has to resonate, pick to interest and be top of mind to make them actually respond to you and once you have an offer like this cold emailing becomes easy.

Every angle that you write, every copy that you use it's going to work much better and we've sent hundreds of thousands of emails and work with tens of different niches and trust me like once you find that niche that works you'll see it straight away it will become easy and at the end I'm also going to share and show you this cheat sheet how to use it how to find niches with this how to rank them and see if you actually have a good niche so stick with us and also don't forget forget to subscribe like this video to keep receiving this content so let's get into it so the anatomy is first it makes money so the best offers will help your prospects make more money because this is every business goal their priority if you offer a service that can help your prospects make more money and get more clients like you're going to succeed if you can actually do that if you're targeting source companies go after domain kpis, MRR or helping reduce churn if you're targeting e-com stores revenue average order value so a bunch of ways and you can be a specific for that niche and examples so everything sales related sales reps we're just going to help make more money ad agencies you're going to make more money for a company with ads conversion with optimization you're going to help them make more money by optimizing their website your marketing making more money with email so it makes money one of the key metrics and if an offer like that you're going to succeed second part it saves time so time is one of the scarcest resources if you offer help them save time on something that they're spending a lot of time on right now it's going to resonate again important note that saving time on itself doesn't have much weight you want to save time so they can work on something they actually want to do like growing their business making more money and automating manual labor which one of the simplest examples if you're still sending emails manually for example use instantly because we automate that process for you examples automation services customer support chatbot so instead of having customer support answer all the questions you can have a chatbot that takes care of 70 of the most asked questions bookkeeping again you don't have to do everything manually there so third it saves money and again who doesn't like to save money on something that already doing with a cheaper alternative if your offer saves money that's a good sign use that so all the cheaper versions of something again customers support chatbot saving money and paying salaries tax services payment providers if you can offer something cheaper say it in your email say it with your offer next it's a priority for a company so this is very important and what most companies or most offers why they struggle with is because it's not a priority and every business owner has a to-do list and an opening offer will be on top of that to-do list like the three main things the company is looking for to do it should be there it's close to that to the kpis so keep that in mind so if you're going to the sauce mr churn if you're going after e-commerce stores it's like revenue average order value and so know the kpis of the market you're going after and important while ceos and customer support matches priorities are different and you can craft offers for both you'll have an easier time with offers that more than most for a company so you might have uh like a sales offer directly tied to company success which is going to be much easier to sell than getting a company to invest in the mobile app that helps employee fitness training it's important but it's nice to have and if again you take the priority list like an employee fitness app 99 of times is not going to be on top of the ceo's priority list but increasing that revenue is going to be examples churn reduction for size and everything that increases revenue is going to be a priority next multiple providers so this is i was thinking about to call it you can also call it stack it stacking and every successful company has a website already they have an ad agency they have an seo agency it's going to be hard to get your foot through the door if your offer is something that isn't limited to one provider you're going to get more calls so if it stacks if you can there's like never going to be enough of it your offer is going to be very very good this is rare but some offers fit this imagine you have a really good sales team they're starting a lot of sales and you get an email of a sales rep that says they're going to work for you you're in commission you'll only pay them if they close and they'll get their own leads there's no downside to it they get the leads you pay them only after you've closed it like there's nothing you can always like increase your revenue like that this doesn't guarantee response because there are like a lot of dumb business owners out there or they might have a reason to not stack or add more revenue but it greatly increases your options when you can just like plug it in even if they already have a service provider so uh an example of bad offer like this is like an seo agency most already have that for saving like ads agency for e-commerce most really good e-commerce stores that are good clients they already have an agency a facebook ad agency that's that's helping them so it's really hard for you to cut in there and take over so good examples commission only lead generation commission only sales these are really really good issues fast results again you're coming in cold you don't want to offer something that takes a while the shorter the time to results the more replies you're going to get i can help you get 10 sales calls with your ideal clients with six months versus i can help you get 10 sales calls in one week interested just the faster you can offer your service the easier it is to implement the faster you see results the better it's going to be all offers that require months to get results will be harder to sell via gold email this includes but it's not limited seo web development web design so we have developed in various situations web design also very situation you don't need it until you need it good examples fast results email marketing conversion rate optimization short-form content repurposing automation agency so clear roi it's not enough just to move the needle and help companies make more money but you want to have an offer that clearly shows they get more out of it than they put in if i can get you extra 1 million in revenue but just to pay me 10 million to get it it's not a very good selling point right but if i tell you i can get you 10 million revenue for 1 million investment that's different story 10 nix roi at the very least i will hear you out and see how you're going to accomplish that so tie your results to clear roi so good examples again everything sales related ad agencies email marketing leads relation very simple to show you pay me 1k i'm going to bring you 10 leads you're going to close one lead for 5k 5x roi from that 1k investment emerging but proven market so if you want to have a good offer you have to have a better success you want to avoid saturated markets and offers that people have heard hundreds of times unless you have some kind of unique advantage but this is this is rare so good rule of thumb is offers that are no older than three to five years because if it's older than five years like 10 years everybody's been hit with those offers so many times it's so saturated you don't want to use a niche that's too young and unproven because that's more risk for the client and you can also do a policy search for your niche to see if there are at least 10 000 leads in your niche you don't want to go too small because then you can't scale up so imagine pitching tiktok marketing two years ago when it was mostly like more dancing gap without any substantial marketing and ads platform it would be much harder yes you might have gotten like some of the very early adapters but it wouldn't be insane as it is today it would have been too early but when it's like maturing they created a solid ad platform now thousands of companies are flocking onto tiktok and successfully roi positively marketing there there are still more companies that aren't advertising on tiktok there's a good growing emerging market to go after so keep an eye for people attention is at right now and used to strength so some examples tiktok agency short form content also right now tiktok instagram reels youtube shorts short form is really good niche so fast growing markets a little bit similar but just avoid declining and state of market stagnant markets i wouldn't recommend selling newspaper radio ads with cold email so it's similar as an emerging market so go for something that's popping all over the media and only getting bigger and better again tick to catch short form content so experience and domain expertise this is going to be personal to you if you have a lot of experience in a niche you have a unique advantage domain expertise use that that's going to stand out and you're going to be much more confident in sales scores you're going to close more if you choose a niche where you have that expertise it's just going to work so much better you're going to resonate you're going to know exactly what's working in order that you don't have to figure it out and you also want to have at least two case studies in your niche to show it's not a fluke if you're one case study it can be fluke if you're two it's already showing a little bit of product market fit it's proven example for me personally i have experience with deterioration sales and that's why we started with a lead generation agency and you can see again lead generation is something that has been around for a while but because all the other attributes are so strong it helps make money it's a no-brainer clear roi priority and i had a personal experience i still went after it and made made it successful so done for you very important everybody's busy and if you tell me you pitch me right now that i can make extra 10k a month but i have to put in 10 hours a week on top of what i'm already doing into learning a course and committing it for next 12 months i will say no even though i can make money because of the time investment like i just don't have the time even if the roi is positive i will say no i can't be bothered and taking on something new because i'm already doing so many things every owner is the same if you tell me i can make extra 10k a month without doing anything and you take and you take care of everything for me then i will ask them okay how much you hooked me and the only real question is what kind of money makes sense for me to invest to make the roi a no-brainer so the more hands-off you make your offer the more appealing it's going to be example again done for your lead generation short from content we just take the content you have right now and turn it into short form youtube reels instagram so just use something that you can automate for the client in full and you're going to have so much easier time closing them and getting responses the next performance-based offer if you take a good offer and add we work purely on performance it's going to be a no-brainer so you eliminate the risk for the company and show you have some skin in the game so important you shouldn't blindly offer performance-based pricing it should make sense with your offer and the client needs to have a strong proof and case studies to make it worthwhile so a lot of companies when they start they just start offering performance offer without any proof going after like bad clients if you go after like smaller e-commerce stores and offer them performance-based tiktok ads and you don't have experience with that it it's not a no-brainer like it still can fail you want to offer performance-based for proven offers for clients that have really good case studies they already have product market fit for a new company it's going to be a struggle so always be mindful of that with the best scam established companies and clear sales process and numbers it's going to be much more reasonable to offer this example performance-based ads commission only sales performance-based commission only lead generation and also a guarantee so the biggest objection to overcome with cold prospects is trust and guarantees will help you because you have some skin in the game and you just can't figure out the best currency you can offer it doesn't have to be money back current so deliverability-based guarantee if you don't do x you'll do x asset-based guarantee if you do audits we guarantee that you have a new website we guarantee that you have facebook ads with at least 10 ads in two weeks and action-based guarantees if you have a course if you follow all the steps in action plan and you don't see results we're gonna x and then those are the main points that i would look at when choosing a niche and like i see it said this is just like a north star for you you can make it work with other offers that aren't hitting all these points but if you have something that hits all of them you're gonna have such much easier time in getting more responses and i created this cold email offer calculator which you can use to fill out to see how good of a niche you have so let's go here and you can see i have the exact same 13 variables makes money saves time saves money is a priority you're gonna multiple providers fast clear roi emerging market current market you have experience done for you performance with offer and guarantee and then the score here and you can see i've scored some of the ones tick to cat agency makes money doesn't save time directly it's not the main offer it doesn't save money they would have to invest more it is a priority usually for income stores right now to make more money you can't have multiple providers usually if they're an ad agency they already have one it's fast you can get results relatively fast clear roi it's an emerging market growing market i have experience with that it's done for you you can offer performance based and you can offer a guarantee so score 11 compared to for example like web design if you just offer web centers like branding it's not very directly tied to making money it doesn't save you time doesn't save you money it's not a priority if you already have a website you can't have multi providers like doing multiple websites it's not fast usually no clear roi not an emerging market everybody has one another real growing market i don't have experience with that it is done for you i can do the website for you you can't really offer performance based and same thing with guarantee you can offer like i would have a website for you but it's a very weak guarantee it's like very very weak score so maybe let's add a guarantee it's like two and you just want to go through honestly and rank your niche you can just make a copy of this add your own niches in here and i wanted to walk you through like finally like one of the best niches that i know for colima which is commission only sales so it will make money for the company will save time because they don't have to do anything you take care of the sales for them saves money because you don't have to pay for sales reps it's a priority it helps grow sales you can have multiple sales reps multiple sales companies it's just bringing more and more sales you can get results fast clear roi emerging market growing market i have experience with that it's completely done for you it's performance based and you can have a guarantee as well so this is like what i call unicorn slam dunk home run 15 if you find a niche like this usually i wouldn't recommend sharing it keep it to yourself use it max it out then create a course or share about it but if you find something that's like so good right now just use it in secret and yeah go for it and i had the rankings in here as well so one to three you want to avoid usually like not a good fit four to seven use only when you have very unique advantages you have something different very strong case studies or something eight to eleven good niche 100 go for it 12 to 14 very good niche you will get responses you will make money 15 unicorn don't share with anyone and that's it use the drinking sheet go through this figure out your own angles and variables maybe
