now you can see how much money your campaigns are bringing in in instantly so i've been waiting for this uh functionality for a while now and it's the most important feature for me because most people are using instantly ourselves included to make more money to get more clients and we haven't had a way to really understand which campaigns are working best right now people are optimizing for open rates maybe reply rates and replies but that doesn't give you a clear picture you can have 50 replies 25 reply rate and make zero bucks or have five percent reply rate and make a thousand bucks so you want to optimize for the campaigns that actually are bringing you money actually bringing your clients and with this new functionality you can do that so how it works is you can set the lead value and we're going to go into this of exactly how to calculate this for yourself and when you get responses in unibox get into the habit of marking the positive leads for example this one please send more positive lead i'm gonna mark is interested and now it will be attributed back to the campaign where it came from and added here so this campaign has 29 positive leads and then you can go even deeper so i sent 1400 emails and i made 14 000 so it's pretty much 10 bucks per email that's sent up that's crazy like i should invest more into this campaign i should scale it up i should buy more domains i should buy more email accounts add them and just scale it to the moon that's the real reason why i'm so excited because you can actually see now what's working yes you will have to do a little bit manual work right now with marking the leads as positive but that's all and then you can see which campaigns are working well so now let's get into the how to calculate how much a positive lead is worth to you it's super simple you can go much more in depth about this i'm going to add this sheet in the description but just to get you started you want to add your ticket size if you know your customer lifetime value add it here and then your conversion rate i know it's going to be like not every lead is going to show up so just going to have some approximate ballpark convey conversion rate for your leads right now so if you get a lead in how many of them are closing every fifth every tenth so i just added like conservative number every tenth right now and if the positive lead value then is 500 because if i send 10 emails i want to get one close on average so that's how you want to do it if you're an agency just add your lifetime value here if your product is 2k a month and people are with you for 10 months on average at 20k here if you're a sauce add your customer lifetime value here if you're a leeching agency that charges per positive lead then you already know like that's the number is going to be how much you charge per positive lead and you can add it straight inside instantly so that's it start using it start marking those leads as positive calculate your positive lead value and then really start understanding which of your campaigns are working well and scale those up buy more domains buy more email accounts and stop optimizing for open rates and reply rates blindly that's it good luck
