hey guys i'm rol from instantly and i want to create this quick cold email copywriting course on exactly how we're getting 400 replies monthly with our copywriting framework and just to give you some background i'm not a copywriting expert at all but we're getting tons of replies monthly we had the lead agency where we got a lot of meetings for ourselves and for our clients and now it also grew instantly to 100 kmrr with the exact same strategies that i'm going to share with you below so because i'm not an expert that means that you don't need to be an expert either but the bad news is that nobody knows what's going to work there are so many cores out there that have like strategies that may work for you but they might not but the good news is that if you test enough targeting and messaging combos you'll 100 find a combo that works for you or you will find out that there is no product market fit and if you don't have product market fit and are testing out new offer it's especially important to test up tons of angles and instead of giving you one strategy i'm going to give you tons of different strategies and angles so you always have things to test for some offers we found working campaign after three drives for others it took three months and 40 plus campaigns you need to get into the habit of testing new things daily weekly and when people ask me raw like how many campaigns to usually create my answer is as many as it takes so that's the mindset that i want to give you that you always are in a testing mood and if you really want to succeed with this so this is what i recommend you do first you create a 15 or 30 minute copywriting calendar event every morning this is not going to be for the rest of your life but it's going to be in the beginning when you really want to learn this the most important part is creating your own processes around this so you become the expert so i recommend creating that event pause this video go do it now so you have it every day at a certain place in the morning afternoon wherever you want to do it but make that calendar event and when you're first starting out with a new client creating campaigns and copywriting or for yourself create at least four different campaigns and instantly each with a different strategy from this guide or whatever kind of method you want to use so four campaigns each with a little bit different copy because we don't know what's going to work so we want to test out some different different angles and then once you have those four campaigns running you want to get into the habit of creating a new campaign daily and instantly with different angles or strategies so again we don't know what works we want to continuously get into the habit of adding new ones and this was the secret of our success like if there is a secret this was it we just didn't give up we're trying new angles every day if we run out of ideas we just googled we looked at some templates everything that we learned is going to be in this document so you have a really good uh like base where it can go off and you never should run out of ideas but get in the habit of adding at least one campaign daily at least in the beginning when you're learning this once you're an expert once you've done hundreds of campaigns you already know a little bit quicker what works and you don't have to do it quite as often then you keep testing new angles until you find a winning targeting and messaging combo once you find that you really want to push all of your focus into that and just scale it up as much as you can but at some point it will get saturated so still keep testing new angles and try to write at least one new copy one new angle daily next to your winners and if you do this like you're always going to have something to test something to work if you're offering as a service you can show it to your clients they're going to love that you're always coming up with new ideas if you're doing it for yourself it's also really good to understand your customers trying different angles you might even find out something to make your offer better and just get in the habit of doing this if you want to really get to be an expert at this start the calendar event and just making those strategies from this document and next videos i'm going to show you more in depth how we create the campaign how we write the copy subject line call to actions everything like that and i'm going to create a playlist so all the videos should play in a row also the document that i'm sharing i'm going to add link in description below so you can read this copy the stuff from there and it's super easy for you to follow everything thanks see see you in the next video you
