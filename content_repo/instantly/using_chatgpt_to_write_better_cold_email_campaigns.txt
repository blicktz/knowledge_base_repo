inspiration there are a bunch of ways you can prompt chat gpt to help you improve your cold email campaigns and in this video we'll go over a few that will take most of the effort and creativity out on your part this is how you can use artificial intelligence to get you more clients with cold email like the video subscribe to the channel leave a comment below if there are any other ways you've incorporated chat gpt in your cold email campaign and let's dive in all right let's jump into chat gpt and let's see what this artificial intelligence can come up with and if it can actually help us write some cold emails so let's go to the prompt bar here and the first thing we're going to do is just you know tell it what to do so i'm just gonna type here hey write a cold email and then we need to give it a little bit more details and more context of what the situation is so let's say um i'm offering a tick tock repurposing service to e-commerce brand owners right random example but whatever you offer is uh whatever your services uh mention that and mention who your target audiences as well so it can kind of the ai can wrap its head around uh who you're trying to talk to who you're trying to uh contact and pitch so let's see what it comes up with here so first we keep it a little bit broad um and then we're going to refine we're going to add additional prompts to to refine the cold email that it writes let's see what it comes up with here takes a couple seconds to load maybe you know i want to make sure it includes a case study maybe i want to make it more casual making maybe i want to keep the cold email shorter and maybe i want to change the call to action a little bit let's see all right so this one is already looking quite good i started to read hey are you looking for a way to increase engagement with your e-commerce brand on social media tick tock is rapidly growing platform that offers huge potential of business like yours i like it it's pretty it's pretty solid considering that uh you know it wrote it in in uh in a matter of couple seconds that this tool is free uh good stuff so uh let's see uh let's have it add a case study add a case study that we're gonna add we want to add some proof some evidence uh that uh we know what we're talking about and then we got the skills to deliver and probably like looking at this cold email i would also want to make it a little bit shorter uh this is a little bit long-winded uh for a cold email uh for a cold email also what i don't like about this right you can kind of see what you don't like you can see hey like don't miss out on this opportunity it's a little bit too salesy for me so let's say if it gets that um if i tell it hey be less salesy let's see if it if it's gonna be able to do that okay good yeah so here you can see that it added the case study um it added the case study obviously like in here just mentioned your case study right don't uh just grab what what the ai said but just come up with like a success theory but this is a good way of saying it hey one of our clients whatever your case studies saw a 10 15 20 increase in in website traffic 20 increase in sale after using a tick tock uh um our tick tock repurposing service for just one month this is good right it gives you gives them like the benefit also gives a time frame uh so the ai come up came up with a good structure on how to present the case study uh say let's make it shorter say it less than uh or let's uh make it shorter uh make it shorter simple i was thinking about hey make it less than 200 words 250 words but i can just be super broad just make it shorter let's see what you can come up with uh it's really artificial intelligence assisted right it can make it it can do a lot of the thinking for us and we only have the ideas the impulses and it will do most of the heavy lifting here let's see okay so yeah i would say this cold email is solid i mean this version is not uh great but it always already gives you some like ideas and structure right it's not going to be perfect ultimately um you can kind of edit put your own spin on it but it will already give you like you know the raw materials to work with right if we really have writer's block and you're looking at the blank page it can give you some impulses or ideas um for me personally um i like this hook a little bit better that it came up with here so i would use this and then you can mix and match um and uh maybe let's try uh let's see i haven't tried this before but i just had an idea um write a follow-up a cold email to the above let's see if we could come up with something so this would be the first step in the sequence and then step two in the sequence a follow-up let's say we're going to schedule that in for two or three days later that they receive the first email and see if we can come up with a follow-up cold email as well but yeah imagine how much time it would take to just write this out or even come up just come up with the idea uh of just you know just writing this out and it does it in a couple of seconds which is pretty amazing and look at this it it understood what we were trying to do so um it understood that we're trying to write a follow-up email okay and also i like this uh this call to action here so sometimes comes comes comes up with new new stuff um okay so yeah that's it right you can really see you know um just tell it write a cold email talk about your service uh put some restrictions to it ask it to make it shorter more casual add a case study right you can really refine it and you know just work on the this video so far is like six minutes so within six minutes we have the first email and the follow-up email but probably do some a little bit of editing on that before actually sending it out to prospects but there's there's not that much uh left to do and uh yeah yeah then once you have that email so let's say you know i'm gonna grab this one um i would go to instantly you know just go to instantly ai you can connect a couple outreach accounts here just connect them we offer unlimited seats which really helps you uh scale your outreach campaigns add as many seats as you want go to campaigns and let's set up a campaign here just to show you how uh quick this is import let's say have a lead list ready i'm gonna upload that upload all my leads and then we're gonna set up the sequence so what we just had chat gpt right i'm putting that into a sequence and just typing it in here so then you have to let's see if it uh and you know just type it in here um right like i said i don't you you have to do some edits on it but it really like saves you time so i wouldn't say this you know don't miss out on this opportunity um um let's say uh just interested to hear more right or uh bad idea to jump on a quick call uh to to find out more um you know something like that then uh your brand owner right here it's more say hey uh first name so let's say i'm first name here uh and yeah then you can add a follow-up step right we'll do what we had there and you know the proven subject line really uh let's say we're gonna add a quick question here it's gonna prove one or even do like just tick tock let's say you have you were actually a tick tock agency uh but quick question usually works well and and yeah so you can use uh what the ai wrote you know as additional help when you second setting up your sequence we have a lot of templates here you can just use templates from here we have dozens and dozens of templates this was written by professional copywriters or a real human being a copywriter and adding 20 templates as well so you can use ai to write your cold emails you can use existing uh cold email templates that we have here and just pick out the one you like right maybe just this you know thoughts that's oh actually i didn't want to do that um um add this as a second step so let me do it again just very quickly let's just base in here a little bit change this interest here more and again this and okay so let's do it properly now i go here templates and i look up i look for a nice uh follow-up let's say i just use this one and that's it so and then you know you just go to uh to schedule here you can set the schedule of your sending you can set the options just collect all these um you know connect all your sending accounts this will do inbox rotation right the 17 outreach accounts will rotate and reach out to the leads one after the other this really helps you know keeping deliverability super high making sure you land in a primary folder and uh also allowing you to send a lot of volume um because it will distribute the volume across all these inboxes and then you just click the blue button launch and you're good to go so yeah one more thing you know a little hack that you can also do if you um with this ai is just go to one of our templates inside of instantly so let's say let's see if i find one here so let's say this one you know you can just go to chat chat gpt uh rewrite the following uh cold email so this is another use case on how to use chat gpt so let's see let's see what it can come up with uh all right now we have like a completely new uh new called email um um like something fresh something new uh this doesn't make uh too much sense i'm uh i came across your linkedin profile and was impressed by ability to close deals when you always uh the artificial intelligence can do a lot of the heavy lifting but you still have to check some of the details so um i wouldn't say this like this necessarily and uh you know maybe like say it differently occurring of course your linkedin profile and you look like a person uh that's able to close deals you know can say something like that if you want to say that let's try let's try another one um let me just grab this one let's see what it can come up with here uh rewrite the following cold email and this is going to be the last example but i'm sure you have a ton of ideas already on how you can use this for yourself you can have it rewrite templates you can have it create templates from scratch you can add additional prompts to just refine it like i said you know you can ask it to make it more casual to to make it shorter to add case studies uh and so on and so forth so this really helps with shipping campaigns quickly too if you if you're not sure what to say in the cold email okay and yeah there it is so i'm sure you're going to have a lot of ideas just from some some of these prompts like play around with chat gpt yourself at first i was a little skeptical uh but it was really it was really amazing what what it can do so i hope this is helpful to you and that wraps up this video this is literally how you can land new clients for your business using artificial intelligence the potential for this technology is pretty crazy and it's only getting started and i'm sure you can come up with a couple more creative ways on how you can use it you know to scale your campaigns and if there are any prompts or interesting things you found using chat gpt comment them below i would love to hear from you and with that being said make sure you
