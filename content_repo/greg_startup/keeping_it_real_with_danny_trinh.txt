you need to divorce two brains if you're a product builder in this space one is like why you're building and what you're building what you're excited about and the second is like degenerative greed degen greed on like trading and and making money because i'm like if you let the two brains come together it's going to get very messy for you and your enthusiasm your motivation is going to be this like toxic mix of like why are you building you know um and so i think obviously for anyone that's in it for degenerative to degen greed uh they've lost a ton of enthusiasm as things cool down and then you gotta like you know seek shelter but i think for a lot of people they're building it for what i would call the right reasons which are like the primitives are changing and it's the promise of like a better future all right new episode of the where it happens podcast welcome welcome today's episode i want to start off by telling a little story when i was 21 i was working on a app called five by and it was this video discovery app that allowed you to find the most interesting videos on youtube and i was living in canada at the time but i had to make a trip to silicon valley i had to see like where all these big companies uh started and and grew from so i went there for a few weeks and i got introduced to this entrepreneur who had started and sold a company uh to google i was already following him on twitter so someone who i knew about so i was really excited to meet him and i met him for coffee i remember it was super rainy out and i and i you know i walk in there wet a few minutes late and i was just so excited to be there um i apologize for being late and i asked him you know what are you up to what are you up to now and he told me about how he was starting a video discovery app how he had raised millions of dollars and i just i felt my stomach turn i was like oh my god is this is this my idea is he's is he working on my idea of course he couldn't be but i ended up asking him to tell me more about it and i said hey could you could you maybe show me what you're working on so he pulls up his laptop and he starts pulling up the mock-ups for this app and literally pixel for pixel it was the same like we had the same idea and i cringed right i was this i was this early 20s uh you know not as much experience as him living in canada he was this big shot raised millions of dollars had hired all these google engineers uh and it was tough and at the time you know i left that coffee shop and i didn't really have like a support network of entrepreneurs to to to call and say like you know to voice how i'm feeling and that's why this episode i wanted to bring on my good friend danny trin uh later i moved to san francisco and danny became one of those friends who i could definitely vent with and i think that it's really important for entrepreneurs founders makers to have someone or ideally multiple people that they could be real with so during this episode there's tons of gems from danny about the importance of having that support network um and you know i hope you really like the episode before we bring on danny trend i wanted to make an announcement the reason why we started the where it happens podcast was we wanted to give you an inside look into what happens behind closed doors there's so many conversations of well-known people happening behind closed doors what if these conversations conversations were open to everyone what if it was like a facetime basically um that you know two well-known entrepreneurs are having that was public and one of the things i realized you know we've done a ton of interviews is the most interesting conversations happen with makers they happen with builders and they happen in these three categories community people commerce people and creators and why well it's because those people are shaping the world um and we're shifting the format to only interview those types of people so if you're interested in those categories you are going to be so excited about the the guests we have lined up uh the other quick announcement is my co-host sahil bloom is no longer going to be co-hosting with me it's just going to be me um he's focusing on his book and i'm focusing on this podcast uh as well as my company late checkout so i'm excited uh for him and i'm i'm really excited about uh where the podcast is going and i know you're going to enjoy uh this conversation with danny trinn and what we've got cooking for you because it is incredible thank you well well well speaking of that by the way i remember the last time i was on it's crazy to think that it was six months ago um so much has changed this year i feel like at the end you all were jokingly mentioning partiful and i think i joke is like are you all behind partiful let me tell you partiful since that time good lord i i feel like i see it everywhere and um it's just been uh it's been crazy to see good for them you know yeah so you want to do you want to describe what partiful is for people who didn't listen to that episode and why why you might think it's interesting yeah i mean it's like it's uh paperless posts uh brought into the new era for mobile uh or like you know for sms and just the way people might do invites and as obviously things like facebook events and other things have died uh there's been obviously a need for to make it really easy to organize um and at least here in new york i've been seeing part of will go out even some of those birthday party or or whatnot or a dinner and they sent out a partiful link um and it's it's really smart you know it's on sms um like it starts with a website that you can say text or snap to somebody um yeah i'm just genuinely surprised to see that it like has consolidated and it's like the thing for sending out like a really quick and prompt to invite you know yeah i think what's cool about it is like when i when i chatted with the founder she was like yeah it's basically like i don't know paperless post but for gen z and when i when i go to websites where it's like hey it's this product for gen z or it's this product for millennials like that never works like you can't say it's for that person you just kind of have to like when i go to i just went to the partyful website and it's like it's not like it says gen z anywhere on this website yeah just like i mean i i know nothing about the team behind it but uh i wish them all a success it's pretty cool uh especially in a space that's so crowded or it's full of so many uh so many dead folks who could try it out uh yeah wait who are the partyful founders today's episode is brought to you by a company and product that has literally changed my life and one that i use every single

internal tools to help my sales teams or engineering teams work at blazing speeds but the catch with internal tools is it's really hard to build from scratch and maintaining them also requires a lot of engineering work and it's just frankly super tedious thankfully there's now retool retool is a much faster way to build internal tools it has a complete library of a hundred plus fully featured accessible ui components that you can just drag and drop into any interface retools platform lets you build the custom internal tools your team needs 10 times faster it's a one platform to build your interface you can connect any data source any api and publish employee facing apps in record time it's also super flexible you can write custom code nearly anywhere to customize how your app looks and works and app environments sso permissions and other critical app functionality are all available completely out of the box the result you can build production grade internal tools without the wasted effort of googling component libraries debugging dependencies or rewriting boilerplate code thousands of teams at companies like amazon doordash nbc late checkout collaborate around custom built retooled apps to operate faster operate better also teams of up to five can build retool apps for free so you shouldn't be surprised why we're big retool fans at where it happens to learn more you just got to go to retool.com um i only met one of them um i'm blanking on her name her name is let's see pull it up um i think her name is joy tau oh no shreya that's who i met um and yeah she's probably in her mid-20s really product design or like focus like you can see it in the product like it feels very much like i mean you get it it's like when you use the particle product it like it feels really good when you use eventbrite like you want to take a shower yeah well i don't remember the last time i've used eventbrite but uh yeah i guess and by the way it looks like you just used eventbrite because you know that hair is looking looking real real real real clean you know oh yeah exactly yeah i just got out of it i just got out of an eventbrite uh session that's why uh yeah for the listeners i just i just took a shower so yeah oh well yeah i guess uh what else what are you seeing these days you see anything fun lately that uh that's caught your eye um i'm curious like you know i've been seeing a lot of stuff you know we chatted a little bit about web3 um you know obviously a lot has changed in web3 over the last six months um and i was just right before this uh in between shower and this call i was i was uh i was reading koopa troopa's uh newsletter around music nfts yeah um and i've just been fascinated with like web3 and music uh thinking about royalties thinking about like you know the role of the label um curious your perspective um on music nfts and then also just in web3 in general like um what has changed are you still bullish you know talk to me yeah i mean it's two things a especially music entities definitely not my bag um i know a lot of people who were were really kind of excited about it or and i know there's a lot of energy there i think obviously a lot remains to be seen so you know um i think i saw something actually something randomly it was like called sounds xyz or something they released as like some protocol or something and anyways very excited for them or like whatever finding out there's a there there but i think that's the question is there they're there so i think you have all these people like kind of just telling each other it's going to be awesome or it's the future um without you know not a ton behind it and but i but that's not to take away from um them i'm trying to change uh the foundation of it all i think web3 in general kind of reminds me of web2 right now and that like i don't think a lot of people remember web2 how web2 at least from where i'm sitting ended and that you have this like oh the future of the web is social and you had all these like micro blogging competitors like oh web2 is so exciting it is ajax we're gonna age everything's gonna be alive and it's gonna be awesome but there was definitely a moment where like things got really tough and rough like 2008 ish or like things consolidated a lot of that stuff is now dead you know and it's nothing wrong with those founders or those people but just you know even though there was this generation you know the internet becoming more modern or things that we now accept to be table stakes a lot of stuff was cleared out and i think you know as we're in winter we're so firmly in winter again uh you know there's there's a natural consolidation happening of like you know some of the less sturdy and frankly some of the more hypey noisy stuff uh is getting washed away um and it's yeah it's forcing folks to go back and focus it's like you know it's it's beyond winter now it's like nuclear winter it's like um and i think it's bigger than any of the just web3 stuff it's like the world we live in today um where where it's just really really rough i mean one thing so i'll segue really quickly like i'm pretty excited about october 11th japan's opening its borders um for like non-business um excuse travel and it's like the us dollar versus the yen is as an all-time crazy high um and it's like that's a bang got nothing to do with like crypto that's just the world we live in like the you know things are just getting crazy and hectic like i think the euro is at a 20-year historic low against the dollar and whatever like all i'll say is um it's kind of a crazy time we live in so i think web3 yeah suffering for like that entire uh generation of companies right now but so many others are too um so it's uh it's interesting to watch because i i will say i think some of the best most resilient founders and teams tend to get started or tend to survive improve themselves for surviving periods like this um and you know this period is far from even over or frankly even getting started i think we're still in the free fall into like in this the depth of some darkness so um yeah uh god wishing godspeed to all the folks out there trying to darn this to stay afloat and uh keep building and stay focused um yeah could you uh about you yeah could you talk like i want i want to come back to the web 3 thing but i want to actually jump to to web 2 for a second living in san francisco during the heyday our buddy addison just sent us a uh who was also you know in that in that scene just sent us a text message of like a video of our buddy jeff and a few other people just like being in san francisco at that era and you know social era mobile was coming out it felt like really exciting um could you talk more about like and and you were in it too dude like you were yeah you were at dig which was like one of the most you know hottest startups in social at the time path one of the hottest mobile startups at the time talk like what was it like in your in your mind being in sf at that time yeah um because like we've got thousands of listeners who just like well weren't there one thing one one thing i'd say is that okay that's definitely 2008 you know financial crash everything in its own right you know that's that's the year i got to sf um you know everyone now knows i have to be displaced people like way overpaid like the minimum like salary out of college for a good cs degree is like something crazy you know like everyone basically has expense lifestyles with like free kitsch mini kitchens and laundry and buses and stuff um and i think the one thing i'll say is like when you got to sf 2008 like there wasn't a ton of money floating around like it wasn't like every company that was alive was overfunded and you know there was just cash everywhere it was kind of like this um it was this place where you you went there because you're just attracted to hanging out and seeing what other people were building you know and it wasn't because it was super lucrative i'd argue you know facebook it started google done public but it really was probably until facebook ipo 2012 or so when things got kind of kind of crazy you know um and so i'd say what was great about that period that's from the same time you know addison and was out there and then we all you know so many friends friends that i keep to this day lifelong friends were made was it was just like hey uh what do you have to what are you building uh my first apartment was in hayes valley because it was the place i could afford not because hayes valley which is now like the cool the cool kids little mid-market area like it's not just like you were kind of surviving and and and trying to build stuff and like again it wasn't this crazy like overvalued time it was just a lot of fun i think frankly there were so many people that had such bad terrible apocalyptic experiences with the first bubble like 2000s that they would almost like laugh about this idea of web 2 or people doing startups again um and like trying to make businesses or or whatnot figure it out and you know a lot of that was fair because a lot of those companies didn't make it uh but what's funny is some of them are still still going strong today um yeah and it was a fun time i think what was cool about sf in that time in or you know i don't know if your question is just about sf or web 2 but i think it was what was so cool about the time was he had bumped shoulders casually with some of the best builders ever with like no agenda and there was no ego it was just like hey oh shoot like oh you're working on that like oh tell me more uh and you're like what do you want to get a burrito like you walk around the mission like get a farralino or something or grab beer somewhere and and it was uh it was just a really i don't know it was it was just a really so yeah a couple of free time yeah yeah a couple things here so first of all i completely agree like the start like today like there's tons of startups that are like flush with cash back then like even the startups that were quote unquote flush with cash like when we we didn't there wasn't that much money there it was very much like us versus them like didn't path you know i don't know yeah path was tried or google tried to buy path at one time and i remember like i think it was like a hundred million dollars or more and i remember like everyone was kind of like no we can't do like path users were like no no way they can't do it like it it felt very us and them now i mean i guess it feels like that a little bit uh or sorry it felt very us versus them back then it still feels that way a little bit now but it's not it was way it felt way more of that back then do you agree yeah i i think back then everything was just a little faster and looser so you didn't know what you didn't know right like i think 2010 that that particular year things changed the iphone 4 changed like it was like a seismic shift right finally the camera was good enough right and then in the following years as connections got better and like the mobile your cellular connection got better there was a seismic shift and so there was no like right or wrong way to do things right whereas i'd say like if you look at consumer now like i think it's a pain cave for a founder to go out without some angle or strategy and how they're going to get distribution you know like what advantage you're going to have because say you make something great it's going to get copied or snatched up by somebody so fast you know um and and so yeah i think especially around then it was a little bit of the wild west but you didn't know like you were undergoing the shift to mobile and i know there's an entire solo mo movement which made me cringe at the time it still makes me cringe to say it out loud today uh but like explain explain what that is for people who don't know what that is well they're pillars that now sound really damn obvious which is like can you make social location mobile um experiences or companies or products and yeah at the time it was an entire wave right like it began with like the first bit i think it's you know south by 2009 where you had um foursquare and goala you know and it's like at the now seems so medieval and primitive to be like oh my phone knows where dps i might be able to check in to a place where i'm at right and obviously so many people have built on that right um but i yeah it it's there was this crazy cambrian explosion of people you know taking different bits and legos and and assembling different ideas you know off of these like big new things that were unlocked right like goala was the competitor and it's cool to see josh williams and co and he's gotten like a lot of that original koala team back and they're out trying to do it again um but you know go all was the exact same time and was building some very different things with like little collectibles uh and little like passports you know that you you could uh you could drop or leave for others you know and so those are just the first two like i think you know there were so many other companies they've got going around that time you know obviously instagram won it all at that time um you know but but there's so many others right like they're i mean so i give it it's it's uh yeah it's it kind of is a reminder that like any given moment especially like when you talk about web 3 or anything like next generation of companies yeah a ton of the things that sound great and awesome are probably gonna go you know be be like be you know erased or or or or or not make it but um yeah it was it was a fun time um yeah so my mind just randomly thought of vine for a second and i was like oh i miss i miss vine i don't know vine it's firmly under the solo it was definitely this a social and mobile i don't know if there's a ton of location stuff in there but uh yeah vine i'm honest crazy um yeah yeah i mean i think like vine had a magic moment for so many people when people downloaded it and it felt just so different like it was six seconds i think right those six second videos and um it was also so you know we're talking about partiful like really well designed like vine was also really well designed um totally right um yeah i think the other cool thing about it was you i mean it was the precursor to tick tock of course but like you could post something on instagram get no love but post something on vine and like you know yeah i have a friend you know i had random like my friend jerome jar who got like millions of followers on vine was like this random french guy who just would post funny videos and then change his life you know and yeah i think that's the crazy the crazy part to me is that probably there's there's there's hundreds of millions there's a generation of tick tock um either users or creators who probably may not even remember vine but uh yeah vine is definitely in the dna you know like the looping video the talent show like how how funny can you be within those constraints you know um even the idea of stitching things together right like obviously fine wasn't the first to do that but they were the first really to bring that um you know that that mechanic out there yeah i miss it now yeah candidly they they they died a slow and painful death um but you know it's just the nature of our industry right it's like everyone's kind of building on the shoulders of other people um yeah and it's uh what a good app i guess that's kind of where i want to shift gears a bit which is okay i figured it out i want to shift gears to we we lived in san francisco in our 20s during the height of you know social and mobile and we we partook in that economy and we had some really high highs and some really low lows um right yeah i can picture that now and um there's a whole like we were the young kids then like we were the gen z back then right like we were we were the up and comers now and we're in our 30s like we're we've been there and done that and we're kind of older so what like what can we what do you take away from your time doing social mobile sf that you can impart to the next generation in terms of how do you build products that are gonna they're you know that people are gonna love i you you know one thing i'd say there's a lot to unpack there but but i it's funny when you said ben there done that i i actually something i try to pride myself in is this notion of the beginner's mind um but just because you know you maybe maybe learned a particularly painful lesson or you learned you tried something that didn't work um that you can like continue to like i keep that freshness and that that enthusiasm to keep exploring you know things you're interested in um it's funny how i said i would never work in consumer social again but look at where i am now um then it's like how did we end up back here um one one thing i'd say is with the benefit of hindsight on that time was the joy of beginning the joy of starting was a superpower right like something i tell all kinds of young people is when they get started especially designers and creatives our industry is like you may not be money rich but you're definitely time rich and when you have when you're time wealthy which means you have like a ton of times like work nights and weekends and like work maybe of like uh on a schedule that it would be uncomfortable for a lot of other people who have other likes whatever they're like kids or whatever um there's nothing wrong with having kids by the way um it's just that you you can try more things and you can be a beginner much more frequently um and that's something i think is super important you know like especially as our industry gets fuller and fuller people just like you and i who've had a certain set of experiences in certain years out there it's all those people who want to tell you like how you should be doing things or how you should approach things or let me tell you about that time we were growing linkedin or let me tell you about that time we were making tinder grow on usc and ucli's campus and it's like okay sure maybe it worked that way then but it may not work that way now and i i think that that that was one thing in sf that really caught on i i if some of my most painful memories were like when you're listening to the experts or listening to like the like you know the people who've been there done that tell you how you need to be growing or tell you how you need to be approaching a problem um you know it was it was uh it was often really bad advice um and so yeah i don't know there's one story that actually resonates really specifically with me which is we were you know all in on mobile and like building out apps for the iphone and android um and literally there was someone who insisted that because his grandmother didn't have a smartphone we need like dedicate two web engineers to sending out an email digest to her uh for her to like you know um be able to follow and in hindsight now i'd be i would tell that person to off but in the moment you're like oh wow this is a very experienced smart person who's telling us about the total addressable whatever bing bap that and the other okay yes let's spend two of our four web engineers that makes sense right um and and and yeah what i'd say i don't want to cherry pick on that person um but i'd say like in general sf i'll probably carry these values with me lifelong that there will always be some notion of like experts are like the right people telling you how things need to be and that especially in consumer the way you would grow it's constantly evolving right it's it's so dynamic um yeah i'm curious for you but your tech because i know that you we had we experienced over the highest size and lowest lows together i'm very curious for you uh but you put the question on you um you know what comes to mind well i mean going back to our earlier conversation about where the pod is going like i i i want to bring on builders like i don't want to bring on vcs like and i i think that and this is kind of a hot take i think but just because you invest in a company doesn't mean it's your company so a lot of vcs what they'll say is oh one of our companies oh i'm so they invested out of their fund which they invested from lps so not even their own money yeah they're going and they invest and then they're saying oh particle yeah that's one of our companies yeah sorry sorry chad um yeah but just because you wired the money does not you are not in the trenches and you are not in the trenches you play a meaningful role in your connection with the business and it wouldn't exist in its current state without you but but i still but i still think that you know i'd much rather when i when i'm trading notes around building consumer products i want to talk to shrena i don't want to talk to yeah the vc here yeah okay i think yeah all perspectives are valuable that i i can agree with you that i know there's some sometimes folk like vcs are a little like it's almost like they're claiming credit for the success of the comp singular credit i mean it's like yeah of course you help them but like it's yes it's a little dirty when when they it's almost like they're taking credit for the success of this and what's it was especially funny though is like when they take credit years after or like talk shade what's worse is not even taking credit when they talk when they really talk shade on a founder who has been successful after them whatever and i think that's the that's an entire other tangent um but yeah man like uh builders tend to be the most fun to hang out with you know shared misery and shared joy you know uh of of the process and yeah i don't know that's how that's how we bonded like we bonded i don't know if you remember but we it was right before you you know you had a trip out we went to what was that beer garden in southern pacific yeah yeah and i remember exactly where we were we were set we were at the second level and you were just telling me about free which you should tell people what it was because it was like ahead of its time so like crazy ahead of its time and it was so right on so many levels and you were having a hard time frankly like in you know and and you know not because you weren't executing well just because startups are difficult and consumer social is difficult and teams are hard and and it and we were bonding over that shared misery i think um but yeah tell folks what free was the timing you know because i think it's relevant well so i'll give some context that basically at path one of my last things i worked on was our messenger and i remember i literally put like the targaryen symbol the dragon symbol from game of thrones on the room when we shipped that messenger and mind you this is before facebook messenger got their act together like your facebook messenger like use was like a very basic thing at the time um and and we wanted to really build like what would be what would be paths to take you know on a messenger and like kind of went crazy there and so i'll say is from building that messenger saw holy cow the numbers around the messenger are just different you know like we also technically have the same loop as stories but you now would consider stories where you could post a photo and someone like you'll post a photo once a day and like come back like five ten times a day to see who else has seen it because that's what we call them seen it um but the numbers change for messenger like the the amount of time someone uses that happens the messenger just like crazy right and so i was like okay i really want to go build a messenger but i want to build a messenger um with a purpose and the purpose is like it owns that first message in the conversation um and and the classic picture i would tell everyone is like reminds me of like this is a zizan's re joke where he says like if you look on my phone on a sunday i look like a psycho because i'm texting all my friends hey i want to grab brunch hey want to grab brunch hey want to grab brunch you know um i think our friend nikita has a funny joke where he says like every social founder at one point tries to make an app for like getting people to hang out together irl um and it's it's so true i think free free is definitely my look my uh my my version of that lesson um i think free yeah it was it was the the other way i would refer to it was like i grew up on aol instant messenger and i missed the green dot when you go home sign in and see your buddy let's see who's green and like for the green people you can chat with them and they were your friends and i wanted that for the real world and so i just wanted to see who was free any given moment and like the horn of gone door or like the bat signal whatever we built it i won't bore you with all the details or built more of the people here little details but um solved so many problems i think there are pieces of its new user experience onboarding that still echo in a lot of apps today um you know i i um we had a ton of fun building it but also a ton of yeah a ton of joy ton of misery um and yeah i i think uh when at the time i i also remember distinctly that they were at southern pacific i i think it was one of those moments where as a founder you kind of like you have you start to get a muscle for sketching out 9 12 18 months in advance even which at the time as a 22 23 year old i was not very good at you know um and i was like damn i think i think this is i don't know i don't know i don't know what's happening here um and and what i'll say is i think a lot of my conversation with other founders today and i see myself in so many founders i hang with today like it's that realization of like damn i don't know who else i can talk with about like this you know because they're using because think about with a team you have to like give great you know you're trying to keep the inspiration like that that energy on mondays and through the week of like yeah here's the vision and like maybe your investor updates maybe you don't know truly how to be that candid like you know you know you or or to speak that bluntly because you also want to like inspire confidence and faith in the team i think it's a very special type of like trusted relationship it can be with investors too but or like other founders or operators you you you you you trust but it's a very specific type of relationship where you can like kind of share that you know um and and talk through it and really sketch out all the options you know for what they all look like um yeah and i remember that day it was a special day and a special weekend but we don't have to dive into that um you know i uh yeah but um that was that was a good that was that was a meaningful that was a really meaningful time for the last 10 years i've been building internal tools to help my sales teams or engineering teams work at blazing speeds but the catch with internal tools is it's really hard to build from scratch and maintaining them also requires a lot of engineering work and it's just frankly super tedious thankfully there's now retool retool is a much faster

insurance you won't regret it yeah i think um you do have to put on a bit of a face when you're talking to your team or vcs or advisors like it's it's hard to be a hundred percent unfiltered but with other builders it's hard not to be it's hard to be anything but a hundred percent unfiltered right so you it's your time to be like okay here's what's really going down i'd really love your opinion on xyz and i don't think i told i don't know if i've said this on the pod yet but um every year me and a group of uh six or seven entrepreneurs used to rent a house in la um and it was like a mastermind basically of founders and we actually hired a moderator and we hired like a chef and i know this is sound bougie as hell but like not you know initially not not a lot of us had money we just like poured it into this um and we would sit there and we would all work on each other you know work with each other unfiltered mastermind founders and like we had like sean pori was one of those founders um julian smith who you know who's been on he's a guest friend of the pod uh you know he came up with breather there um i came up with islands there flow water nicholas reichenbach who create you know it's in every whole foods across the nation he came up with it there uh it's now publicly traded company and i've been thinking a lot about masterminds and i want people to hit me up if this is interesting to them um but like we gotta we gotta we gotta we gotta bring it back you know i think it'd be i think it'd be awesome to to bring it back yeah i think it's awesome also because like especially because so many of us live on twitter and and places like that where it's just like you just okay there's a couple things so people are you know spend a lot of time on twitter and you can't really get feedback really on places like that and then big events big conferences and stuff like that is just like you're not it's so hard to find your people there so like these smaller like six to eight ten high quality trusted people bring them together do you know do it proper um i feel like that first of all i know i feel like that's it's a huge opportunity for founders and also like i feel like it needs to exist and all like i also think you can build a business around that i i'll tell you i had this like weird epiphany of the day not epiphany but just like how i think of things and it's funny that we're talking about this such a public or a semi-public uh forum but it's like the more public it places even if it's for discussion you know conversation the more judgment there is right and i think judgment like the level of judgment in an area is inversely uh correlated to how like actually meaningful the interactions are going to be you know like they got on twitter like oh it went viral with a hundred three hundred thousand likes you know you feel this like dopamine rip of like wow all these awesome people may have liked it or a lot of people saw it but like how meaningful was that versus a room that's low judgment where someone can bring up some really deep or like some whatever's on their chest and like talk about it and know that like no this is not like something that's going to people like screenshot and share around and all that toxic you know whatever stuff is going to go there but it's a meaningful place and so yeah i i think about at least for builders you thrive in low judgment zones um i look i've never been to burning man and i i think everyone has their their say it's now actually a high judgment zone from the from the lapina gallery of like what actually happens at burning man these days but i think the idea of a place where people can actually kind of let their hair down and be themselves amongst a similar all you know amongst other people whether they know them well or not and and to share ideas and talk through their shit sounds kind of awesome so anyways your masterminds sound dope i mean uh i'd love the i'd love to join the the one that you the first one you do when you bring them back you know yeah i mean maybe we can even share this like i think it needs to be sort of like it also needs to be fun right like so we would do you know 50 like structured okay everyone has a certain amount of time these are the questions you can ask like i think the structure is really important that's why the moderator is key to the whole thing and then we would have fun at like night times like dinners going out i don't know if we can show this image i i saw like on a like you know one time the only time i've shot a gun was in la at one of these events um oh and uh yeah maybe we can like post the like in the show notes i'll i'll find the the picture it's like 12 years ago by the way non-sponsored uh plug if you ever want a cool place to shoot guns in a place that isn't about shooting guns drive tanks dot com uh i don't even know if it's still around but it's in the mid it's like two hours outside of austin you can literally drive tanks and then the belt it's like it's very safe they take care of it for you and should you desire to you know build like a used car like they'll let you aim the cannon and shoot it also you let you shoot a howitzer i actually now remember you can also shoot actual guns like like bear decals like mini guns it's very safe very supervised very like team off-site e energy but uh it's a great place to you know like blow off some steam you know it's pretty cool yeah i mean listen i'm uh i think uh if you're gonna do an off-site mastermind type thing like that like put it around something like that so you also have these like new experience like how many times have you driven a tank like for me like never right so then like not that i really want to drive a tank at all or shoot a gun but like the fact that i'm going to do this with this group is like a bonding experience yeah i i'm sorry just opened drivetanks.com and look at their sizzle reel on their front page and uh it's it's pretty it's pretty awesome you know i i kind of oh man this is literally amazing first of all wow so what i'm looking at is i can't i can't believe this exists it looks like dude it's a tank literally going over a fully like tank that could be in iraq or whatever like going over a car and like shooting missiles from it i look i've done this i've done the like crush a car underneath it i've definitely done the shot and i actually like this website it's a pretty good um you know like when i talk about like it was conversion like front page conversions i'm like it's so simple it's called drivetanks.com the three offerings are drive a tank shoot a tank shoot big guns uh you know uh they got to the point really quickly it's um it's pretty good okay i'm pulling up the price list i'm curious how much this cost wow okay so there's a bunch of tanks they've got like 12 different types of tanks i got to be real with you all i have no idea what the different tanks are but the the cheapest tank to drive is going to cost you uh 600 bucks um yeah yeah which is totally doable the most expensive like baller you came up with a billion dollar idea today at the end of the mastermind is the stug three it's twenty two hundred dollars you know that's some good and and yeah it's uh i you know i'm not i'm literally not here to bug them i think they have some packages too but you know hey uh for what people spend on like bottle service in the club versus uh a once in a lifetime memory driving a tank you know i think they're they're you know um yeah cool no i'm happy you made i'm happy you talked about that so no i think yeah i think it's really important to to to drive tanks at your at your at your mastermind and i think like um um yeah just do do things that are that are going to open you up both on on the structured piece of it of coming up with ideas but also on the bonding piece of it too yeah um yeah cool um going back we talked a little bit about you know sort of web 2 sf and but before that we talked about web 3 and i want to i want to understand what what danny trend's current state you know lay of the land of how you're feeling about web 3 and and right now oh gosh i i think uh my my short answer would be you know it is it is definitely absurdly winter i think there's a lot of really cool people that i'm seeing charging forward and continuing to build um and i think it's it's it's kind of poetic that one of them is kevin you know i i think he recently just moved down to la and and like there's really building out the proof team from my understanding there and like really going for it um i'm excited yeah and it's yeah it's it's um excuse me last week yeah i just realized that a bunch of other great people uh in that same in the same crew and family are all there and kind of pushing and so i'll say like it's kind of awesome to see you know um that yeah that is that same kind of uh what's the right word for it um yeah the the perseverance and also the conviction to keep going like it's that's awesome to see now overall web 3 a lot of other crazy like doh kwan you know he's got interpol he's got a code red on out for him uh that's kind of awesome uh sorry i don't want to i don't want to laugh at other people's misfortune i think it's just you know there's all kinds of corrections on the good and bad um and yeah it's it's it's it's a spicy time i mean it's it's absolutely winter so you know a lot of the jokers are gonna leave a lot of the tourists are gonna leave um and it's it's probably it's definitely for the best i think this time last year you're probably at peak hype mania uh just left like uh bad uh not and okay i want to probably simply not bad that like it was all bad just that there was a lot of noise that probably wasn't healthy absolutely is not healthy um yeah we're back to winter uh if you believe in the space you believe in the space if you're someone who was talking about it all for the last 18 months or years you feel very right you feel very like uh validated uh i don't think this will be the last winter i i think that there will absolutely be a future here um and yeah i i i'm excited to see how it all goes down um yeah i think if anything it's it's good that teams can be quiet less distracted like think about it if you had a team in this space over the last 18 months especially on the run-up you're probably dealing with a bunch of more than 18 months years you're dealing with a bunch of crazy distractions or probably everyone's trying to hire their other other other people constantly wondering like am i working on the right thing am i missing out on like life-changing opportunity working on something else or trading something else or whatever and now that things are more quiet like there's going to be a ton more folks who are just focusing like you know kind of really pure about things and and do it and you know making making the moves they want to make and i think we'll see where it all nets out who even knows what the rest of the world nets out you know um right now like i think we're probably another six to nine months of a minimum of like sliding into finding where the bottom of in darkness is um so something i definitely know i don't think about every day it's not my it's not my day job uh but it's definitely something i'm keeping keeping tabs on you know yeah how do you um like i know i know you've got a day job but i do know that you're also like a lot of web 2 founders in that era like we talked about josh williams like he's in web 3 now kevin rose web 2 you know prolific web 2 founder yeah he's in web 3. yeah i've been doing a lot of web 3 stuff and a lot of our friends in that you know donnie dinge web 3 now um what do you like why do you think we're attracted to web 3 and why do you think that we're still excited about it um and do you have like are you less or more excited about it than let's say a year ago i i so there's something that there's some advice i give about this stuff to literally this time last year to someone was just getting into it i was like you need to divorce two brains if you're a product builder in this space one is like why you're building and what you're building what you're excited about and the second is like degenerative greed degen greed on like trading and making money because i'm like if you let the two brains come together it's going to get very messy for you and your enthusiasm your motivation is going to be this like toxic mix of like why are you building you know um and so i think obviously for anyone that's in it for degenerative the degen greed uh they've lost a ton of enthusiasm as things cool down and then you gotta like you know seek shelter but i think for a lot of people they're building it for what i would call the right reasons which are like the primitives are changing and it's the promise of like a better future um yeah i think a lot of those people and everyone i talk to is it's almost like business as usual like they're continuing on amidst the challenge right and this is not the first or last time that people in this space have dealt with crazy challenges or being told they're completely wrong and silly like it's funny to me i actually remember probably around that time 2016 when you and i were hanging out in southern pacific where like i feel like it was chat bots ai and crypto were like the three like laughing like you could like they were like the butt end of every joke right like oh remember that person who worked on chat bots remember that person who worked on crypto stuff remember that person who worked on ai and it's kind of funny now at least in 2022 that i'm like ai like nothing to joke about with ai like some crazy truly like crazy is happening before our eyes like making it into very like into the mainstream right crypto like and no one's laughing about i mean you may laugh at the collapse but like if you're laughing at that collapse you're laughing at the economy's collapse which is you know um you know that that's your prerogative and maybe yeah chat bots yeah like if anyone's working on a chat bot now i'd still be like what are you doing there uh folks um but so so what i do is like what are you doing there folks like uh that's probably my pc uh it's my like pc uh uh whatever but like but you know cycles right and like i think the thing about people who are generally excited about these things like their enthusiasm gets tested and retested and the the ones that tended to last through multiple winters and do the best are the ones that keep persisting right like if your conviction in some of these spaces is so low that you get you know you can drop this quickly you probably aren't working in the right space you know um and if anything i think one thing we can't deny is that the the conversations change right like the conversation on the types of people who are interested in this stuff and the types of things are building is is now like we we've opened we've we've gone through a one-way door right because so many major companies so many major like universes of ip are are into this now it's gonna be really exciting to see what happens um i i think that's the one thing about right now you're like oh are you so excited about it like well whether i am or not excited about it i'm absolutely not going to ignore it you know like the the thing about it right now is like it's it's it's typically the people that ignore shifts like these are the ones who are the cautionary tales it's like the nokia guy talking about the iphone you know or or like uh every or like all the like the big consumer web apps that were like they kind of shitting on like the move to mobile in general you know um and yeah it's i think typically the folks who were default dismissive of of of interesting new things that typically take years to bore out those are the ones that like uh you know history always remembers as the fools and so i think right now look tough times like guess what been here before multiple times you know and so i i think it's um it's interesting to see you know so you know what are your thoughts what are your thoughts on web3 loyalty i saw a few weeks ago starbucks obviously launched a a really big push into loyalty i'm curious uh what you think i think around that that that's in the i i hope that a recording of this podcast doesn't become like a cautionary tale me sounding like an idiot a few years from now um i think my immediate reaction is like it's cool to see them build it's cool to see them experiment back to what you're talking about like sf 2008 it's like when i was teenager still my youngster and a beginner's mind at heart i'm like it's awesome to see people experimenting even if it doesn't work out i'm like net net something they did in that experiment will probably be a building block that someone else grabs and uses and takes off i think starbucks is probably going nowhere maybe this is like the funny quote where like three years from now starbucks implodes um but like i don't think starbucks is going anywhere so cool them to experiment with some stuff maybe they'll change their approach maybe they won't you know it's kind of like motor before the iphone motorola made the rocker with apple which had a 99 song limit on it and everyone thought like this if this is the iphone this is not the future i'm like okay i think people will experiment with loyalty stuff just as like music entities are trying to figure out what the part like yeah what the that actually all means you know uh but yeah i think that's essential to getting there um there's a book i really love about like you know like a good model for innovation is like you have artists and soldiers right and like if they're defined by their relationship with risk right it's like soldiers are fundamentally about low risk because you don't want to kill everybody and artists are fundamentally about high risk you're rewarded to take lots of risks and to fail a lot fail a lot and typically soldiers and artists hate each other's guts because they misunderstand each other like soldiers look at artists and like you don't do any work you don't have any discipline you're just trying a bunch of stuff that goes nowhere and artists look at soldiers like you're so like like unafraid of trying anything new and like you're so you're like you're gonna be like left behind and i would say that's the moment where we are right now like in one of these like like you know winters where the artists and the soldiers look at each other and and and think the other one is the fool right like the the there are many artists like you're talking about don't like you're talking about some great friends they're going to continue to push on and try things starbucks whatnot like i think there's a ton other companies trying stuff and the soldiers who are like trying to survive you know in economic recession or worse are looking at them like you idiots i can't believe you're continuing to move on you know and that's my take of right now is that it's it's artists and soldiers i use this same model actually like for people who are working teams where you have an office still you know the people who come in super early and we also leave early and people who come in super late and leave late and i'm like oh there's those two people judge each other just at different times of the day like those early people come in they're like oh i can't believe so and so is not here yet and then those people that come in late see those early people leaving early you're like oh i can't believe you're calling it you're throwing in the towel so early you know and and so you know fleshing out my answer here i i think when i look at stuff like starbucks or i see people trying out stuff i'm like okay i think i net bias towards the artist lens which is i love seeing people try stuff even if it goes you know to zero and fails because that's what gives me energy you know like uh seeing people like take take a shot now yeah i do i advise the artist lifestyle for soldiers or the soldier lifestyle for artists no um and so you know i think especially when you look at something as polarizing as web 3 right now it's like really easy for folks on both sides to get really entrenched in their positions um and so maybe my my last thing on this long ramble i'd say is like i would ask someone where they think they are like deep down on it and if they could empathize for a second for a little bit with the other side um and and that that's my my take on web 3 is like it's it's a look in the mirror for how you feel about these things in general um and so someone who's a soldier by day works a big company life and like only like scales things looks like two to five to ten percent covered gains uh looks at some of these moves as like really risky or like like career ending and i'm like okay that's that's just what the way it's cool that people are experimenting like it's like and i think you know i'm i'm i'm happy that on on the start you know from a startup of one to a startup of starbucks or a company of starbucks like that we're kind of we're not taking the status quo as like okay this is the world we live in and like these are the products that exist no we're gonna like push the envelope over here push the envelope over here try different things and we'll find out what what is gonna resonate with with folks um yeah but i think um i think it's cool that first of all i love the soldier um artists and like kind of way of thinking about it and i also think it's cool that i happen to be on your camp like i love i like when i see people um on twitter for example like seeing the launch of a startup and being like but actually you know like the but actually guy um but actually this is a bad idea because xyz and it's like no like we need to celebrate people builders yeah i i mean if anything think about like i look at this like if you're a meme account that loves to like trade on being like you know making hilarious jokes but other people and god knows i love a good meme i love i love there's so many accounts i find very hilarious but net net i think a lot of those meme accounts pander to like the soldier type who likes to be you know like yeah look at that failure or like oh so clearly dad or like oh god you know god yeah god and you know like oh and i'm like okay go back to your like whatever life you know like they look they chuckle at the meme they they heart it and they move on with their like whatever the they're doing for the rest of the day and it's like okay you know the it is it's it's what makes this account successful and like it's what gets their engagement up you know and i can't knock that hustle either because they're slowly trying to like get x like blow up and then make a business i'm sure whatever they're doing like it'd be pretty hilarious um it's just not you know i i'd like to think in my pure heart that i i i'm not uh i'm not there even though i know i'm probably very guilty of that same type of uh dunking sometimes but yeah like i think that that it's uh on on the on the spectrum of like soldiered artists like the audience of the people like giving all that like feedback of i got them are just like they would tend not to be artists you know like that and that's fine it's totally fine um yeah cool let's uh that's a mic drop i think that's a lot for people to to digest and think about where they sit on the spectrum and um artists versus versus soldier and um dtren you're you're you're in your family you know you're not just a friend of the pod you're you're in the family so thanks for coming back on and uh where could people find you on the internet yeah just dtren is my my twitter and what i'd say is i hope you stay safe with hurricane i hope that maybe when this comes out there hopefully hurricane is well past you know um or else your hair is gonna get a lot more wet you know what i mean you're gonna you're gonna record a podcast like in the middle of a little hurricane uh but yeah it's it's always a lot of uh eventbrite rsvps you know hurricane ian it's just hidden hidden that eventbrite rsvp a few times yeah um so yeah wishing you all the best man and and and and candidly i i think if anything this is just like a semi-public face time with you so i i'm like i'm glad to catch up and then see yeah and hear your voice it's great to see you it's great to hear you

people listen to this and you're gonna be smarter because you're gonna listen you know you might not agree with everything we say oh yeah go for it danny no i have a crazy idea for your format i mean if you call it like based on my friends it could be literally like your screen recording and like you're actually it's like it's enough to make keep it authentic it's like you kind of tell maybe you tell it's almost like remember like who wants to be a millionaire you would tell the phone or friend people roughly to be available in case their friend was on the show and they're being called but like you could show literally you're facetiming some people and they're not there they hang up or like they say like they don't answer the call and then finally someone picks up and they're like yahtzee you know um and like and that's who we got this week you know uh but like you're just keeping it real they're like hey yeah we try a few people like uh you know and then bam like right now we're just gonna face time with friends and keep it super chill um i like it i mean dude there's enough interview podcasts like where it's like okay hey like so tell me about tell me your story and it's like okay i went to here and went to there it's like no i think that's you know going back to like the trenches and stories in the trenches i think people that's i think that's what people want
