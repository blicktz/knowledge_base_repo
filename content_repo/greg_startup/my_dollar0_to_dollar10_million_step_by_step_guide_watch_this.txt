Okay, so today's video I'm gonna talk about the clearest path to ten million dollars of liquid network And I'm just gonna outline all the steps gonna go through each one gonna expand on each one Let you know how I'm thinking about all of this Let's get a few things out of the way. The first is it's really hard to make ten million dollars It's really hard to make a million dollars. It's really hard to make a thousand dollars selling something on the internet, but this is Your my opinion best way to go about it and where the most opportunity is So this is the blueprint.

This is the playbook. I've seen this work And you know a little bit about me if you don't know me I started and sold three venture-backed companies Before the age of 30. I was an advisor to reddit advisor to tick-tock I've done the vc thing.

I've done the bootstrap thing and This playbook, you know why i'm putting it out there is because I think it's going to be helpful to someone I'm not selling anything And hopefully it makes the world a better place. You can make a little bit more money you can provide for your family um, and uh, that's why i'm putting it out there so So step one is to pick your niche I use the example of pick ai for solopreneurs not business tips The riches are in the niche niche Nah, I hate that saying riches are in the niches. I actually call niches um, my point on this one is I've made this mistake before where I just put like a I create a general business In some topic and picking your niche is really um Picking the right niche is almost one of the most important things as of this entire list.

So um, I use a few tools to uh, figure out How to pick pick your niche? I've talked about some of these in the four i've used. Um gummy search before Which is built on top of reddit and uh gives you ideas and pain points on top of reddit Uh, you don't need a tool on top of reddit.

You can literally just go on reddit um, and you could Go into different subreddits and you could see What people are saying? I like to go to the top And then pick let's say this month and you can see in this fire community financial independence retire early community What are people saying? And it just gives you this ability to say like, okay, how can I create it a niche within this niche?

So I like reddit for that Google trends Um, it's an obvious one, but it's so so powerful I don't know why more people don't use it when you have an idea for a niche For example, um The fire movement Um, you can see what's going on and I actually use this other tool called glimpse which just basically supercharges my um Supercharges my google trends I'm not affiliated with the with this product or anything like that, but I Uh, just think it's really cool that it gives Um, just additional search terms. It's acting a bit slow right now There we go So I really like that it says like what is the fire movement? Um Fire movement and health insurance So, you know, there could be an opportunity to build a whole business around health insurance and within the fire movement Um, so this this will just you just scroll through all this and this is going to give you ideas on which Uh niche to pick oh the fire movement only for Australia or Canada or France.

Oh my god, maybe there's something here So Pick your niche Make it niche Actually make it niche The second Uh step hit 250 000 impressions per month one viral hit can do this But consistency wins post daily engage and be the person in your space so Some people are gonna Listen to this and they're gonna be like 250 000 impressions. How am I able to do that easy for you to say greg? You have like 400 000 followers Well I do this with a bunch of new accounts and I start from zero and it's totally doable that within 90 days You can start getting 250 000 impressions per month Now it's just about uh Understanding your niche creating content that that niche is going to share Um, and then also just replying to other people in that niche get them to see who you are Um, and be the person in the space.

So pick a name Uh, that's gonna really resonate with people Um, so that then they see your you know, they see Um, you know, not necessarily your name when I say name it could be a handle but can also be the bio like your bio Needs to be really good I actually Tweeted about this guy over the weekend Who had a great bio and great uh cover photo So his name's marty bootstrapping a video platform for realtors profits to buy first house Twitter homies get housewarming invite hashtag project x And then his cover photo is his dream home zillow sucks $629 000 I mean Amazing Amazing like you want to root for this guy and that's why you're clicking follow and I you know I've never met this guy or anything like that But I just think it's so cool that he he's you know, he's doing the playbook So hit that 250 000 impressions a month Don't tell anyone but i've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions And i'm giving them away for free These aren't just random guesses They're validated concepts from entrepreneurs who've built 100 million dollars plus businesses I've compiled them into a one simple database Compiled from hundreds of conversations i've had on my podcast But the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor Some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet The idea bank is your startup shortcut Just click below to get access Your next cash flowing business is waiting for you Then what you got to do is convert 0.5 percent to leads So you want to convert some of those impressions to leads Uh, so about 1200 that'll give you about 1250 organic leads per month Uh, what I like to do here is create, uh, irresistible lead magnets So good they'd be not, you know, they'd be dumb not to grab it So that can be a calculator it could be an ebook could be a video Uh, you name it just some piece of content that is going to be valuable that you can gatekeep Some of the tools that I like to create lead magnets Uh, it's called one is called gamma dot app gamma ai Um, so you can create these like beautiful presentations documents websites You don't need to know how to code or anything like that and then you can gate it Um, so you can go ahead and gate it Um, so you can create like put photos and gate it Videos and gate it Charge diagrams gate it. There's all these like templates that you can use You can import existing documents and it makes it look really nice So, um, you you can use something like gamma to create it. I, uh I have like a bunch of lead magnets on my website gregeisenberg.com Um, so like for example find winning startup ideas using reddit and ai startup ideas bank and how i'd start them things that I know that my audience would Use and then I just create simple these are framer framer.com Uh landing pages Um, and look how like Simple this is I just put an image Through you know bolded the title You know, it doesn't need to be fancy, but these are lead magnets that convert your impressions And this this uh, this adds you know At least five to ten thousand subs To my newsletter from these things so these things these lead magnets do work Once you okay, so now we have these leads And the mistake a lot of people make is they don't monetize their leads immediately So what you can do is you know, say someone Signs up to find winning startup ideas.

I actually don't do this, but I should I could say like Hey, you could sign up to you should sign up to framer.com Or whatever and I get an affiliate cut to framer.com um And That's just a great way to at least generate you a dollar per lead um, so you're what is happening here you're you're getting organic leads every single every single month and now you're getting paid One dollar at least, you know, i'm making up the number of dollar, but usually it's it could be 50 cents It could be three dollars could be five dollars seven dollars. It depends which um Which I feel like how you're affiliating what what? Uh, like which affiliates you choose it depends on Are we talking?

uh A very high value customer or low value customer so it depends on that But the point is you can make money from these leads and then what you do is you take that money So let's say it's 1250 bucks, which I think by the way is super conservative here And you uh, you buy more leads So you take that 1250 and you buy leads at two dollars each Um, which isn't crazy by the way, I think you know, you should be you can you can easily buy leads on meta for a dollar $2, $3 and now that's bringing you in 625 additional leads per month So now step six Hope are you are you following here? We got 1875 leads We've got the 1250 organic that we were getting we're getting from you know, twitter tick-tock instagram, whatever social platform linkedin whatever social platform uh, you You choose and you think that you know, you're great at And then you've got the six you got the 625 you've purchased so now you've created this lead generation machine You've picked a niche like where okay, let's take a step back. Like where are we?

You've picked a niche that is id ideally validated by google trends data or reddit And it isn't very competitive You have content market fit Meaning you're creating a type of content that is really resonating with people It doesn't mean that you're going viral every day, but you're going you know, you're going somewhat viral once twice a month you're Converting these people into leads Meaning they're eventually going to buy your product And you are getting paid per lead um, and by the way, you can also I talked about you know partnering with software companies or other affiliates You can also sign up to something like spark loop um Which is I'm sure you've seen this before where it's like you sign up to a newsletter and it's like people who sign up to this newsletter also sign up to these recommended newsletters And basically they'll pay you anywhere between you know 50 cents to three dollars for every recommend recommendation that you give to other people So for example, you sign up to greg eisenberg.com and then I go ahead and recommend the hustle And for every subscription that I give to the hustle They're going to pay me let's say a dollar or two dollars So this is that's a form of affiliate as well Then You've got all these leads you got the organic over here. You've got the paid over here And now you've become this lead generation machine. This is like a really good place to be if you can do this in like 120 days You're you're looking really good The next step is to nurture like crazy So great you have all these leads, but if you're not nurturing them They're gonna forget about you So you can either do something like a weekly newsletter where you're keeping people up to date uh giving them Value left right and center or you could you know create a community uh, you know, whatsapp community a school community facebook group Uh, most of our communities we run on school.

It's just it's sort of easy um And you give so much value that they're They feel guilty not paying you basically so you just make them you just pummel them with value The next step, uh, before you actually you know, you haven't built any real products yet So the next step is you ask the community what you can build for them And then you prioritize that those pain points So you ask them Okay By the way right now you might have 50 000 leads So you're like hey, you know in a weekly newsletter you're like hey I'm thinking you know, what is something you know, what are your pain points? How can your job be better? How can this how can I make you happy?

How can I entertain you? Whatever it is, I don't know what you're building But you have to figure out what their pain points are And and then you just write that down in a google doc. Maybe that's 10 15 30 um of the high of the you know, most valuable pain points Um, and you pick one right some pain points you won't be able to create software agency marketplace uh You know a business an info product for them because My point is there's some products that are easier to create and some products that are harder to create so uh, you're not going to be able to solve all these pain points and you want to pick a A pain point where it's quite easy to solve and easy to build in a minimal viable product Step nine launch a 30 a month offer aim for 300 plus per customer annually Make it feel like a no-brainer They're tip to you for all the free value.

Yes, the point here stick with me is directionally you want to basically make a few hundred dollars Per customer annually Step 10 You convert three percent of total leads which is 56 new customers per month 1875 that was the total amount of organic and paid Into 56.
