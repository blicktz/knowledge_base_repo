all right so sahil lavinia i actually just want to catch up with you to be honest and before we started this call you were saying how excited you are for 2023 why are you excited yeah i mean i i love change uh and you know there's a great book by nasim taleb anti-fragile which kind of goes into this concept of you know there's certain things that get more resilient as as you shake them up and then there are other things that completely break right there's sort of fragile things and anti-fragile and anti-fragile is kind of this interesting concept because it's not just like it doesn't get worse you know at a at a it's sort of you know better at staying good no it actually improves in chaotic kind of environments right so like evolution you know things like that the human body the human brain like these adaptive systems and i just really try to run gumroad my venture stuff like everything that i do in a very anti-fragile way where basically everything can kind of go to zero um and i will outperform the competition in that way um and so i'm just i'm anytime there's like any real risk or change in the environment ecosystem whether that's covid leaving covid and whatever it is i'm i just i get super psyched um it's frustrating i think the last two years have been frustrating for for for people like me who like to build stuff because they're just you weren't you weren't really rewarded as much for that uh and i think this year next year it's gonna hopefully it'll be it'll be much more valuable to to actually build valuable things right um and then i'm confident that i know how to do that uh and so that's kind of why i'm excited as i guess you know like the tides the tide is very quickly going out uh and i have no concerns about that you know uh so uh i'm i'm excited do you think there's gonna be more builders now or less builders there'll definitely be less less builders um as a percent it'll go up right because you're gonna see tons of people who who don't identify as builders leaving the ecosystem i consider these people like tourists basically who got in when it was like really sexy um but like are gone already frankly right they've peaced out like in january of this year the first couple quarters uh but i think i think even the builder persona is is going to shrink too right where there are lots of people and the reason is because builders are also relatively rational people and and sort of factor in risk quite significantly most builders are not risk seeking at all right so when you look at founders like the founder personality type you have to overlay so many things that are like in the minority uh to get someone like a patrick hollison or a dylan field or a mark zuckerberg or an elon musk or whatever right you have to overlay quite a few things um and and so i think a lot of builders who are not you know who are doing the math for example and saying hey robin hood being 80 billion makes me want to start a company but robin hood being worth 4 billion doesn't make me want to start a company there are a lot of people that that that make those kinds of decisions and will say hey you know i'm actually going to go work at amazon or facebook or google instead also like robin hood being worth 4 billion but having 4 billion on cash on hand right yeah and to me i mean to be honest like it's irrelevant i really don't care like i did not build stuff because there was money to be had in building stuff like when i started making iphone apps when i was like 15 years old this was before you know instagram and snap and uber even like one of the first things i built was like an uber basically call a cab on your phone app but i just did it to solve my own problem like i didn't think about it like oh wow there's like we can completely reinvent transportation or something like that right and so for me it's like cool like engineers are cheaper they're easier to hire um designers are cheaper easier to hire uh and that's all i need i don't actually don't need anything else um those are the two most valuable you know resources on the planet uh and now they're you know they're sort of two to three times cheaper than they were like six months ago which is amazing you know i would say the only other thing i'm waiting to crash the only other thing i'm super excited about is to hope that is i hope interest rates continue to climb and i hope that stock prices continue to get crushed i hope that housing uh gets destroyed completely you know like i would love to be able to buy a house in san francisco you know for two hundred thousand dollars and i think that's possible um but it's going to take you know 10 plus percent interest rates so that's what i want like fingers crossed um we'll see what happens and where are you spending a lot of your brain power think you know thinking about you you know are there particular industries or ideas that you can share that you know are on your mind yeah i mean obviously you know the big one that everyone's talking about these days is ai right um so i think that's that's that's pretty interesting um i don't think it's as notable as people it's i don't think it's a step function increase for example i think we've been basically seeing this gradual thing happening which is we take work that is valuable but wrote and automate it and we've been doing this for a long period of time like i would say the largest example of this is open source software right so i can build a new product that really to build the product it's hundreds of thousands of lines of code uh but i only have to write two to three hundred lines of code right because i'm able to basically like abstract away all of the complexity to you know open source software and so i think ai is just basically like that but for like language that is just much more probabilistic and less deterministic right language is not as it's not math right it's it's it's actually like there's it is relative right when you learn a language you're kind of learning how all the words connect to each other but there's like nothing outside of it which is like super strange right you don't learn from like a base level of knowledge and build up you kind of piece things together into like a puzzle um which makes no sense like the the reason that that works is because we humans came up with it right nature didn't come up with it uh so it's not great um but yeah i i i just look at basically all of these different kinds of jobs basically any job in which your output is digital um you know i i see that that that will kind of be replaced with basically a computer predicting what that human would be outputting um and i think a lot of my brain power right now is spent on basically reading up on these papers uh like right now i'm reading up a paper on it's called fusions it's called fusions of consciousness i think just came out today um but basically we're learning a lot of stuff about neuroscience about the brain about intelligence about neurons and how they work and you know it's sort of the last problem because if you can figure that out then like you you know it's kind of like what google says like you figure out how to solve the information problem and then you can solve every other problem with with the information problem right like everything else is a is a problem of lack of information um lack of understanding the patterns right like magic is just like definitively when you don't know what the math is it looks like magic if you understand the math then it's not magic right and one of the amazing things about this new wave of ai which i think started in about 2017 is transformers transformers and now diffusion models but basically the transformers are are at least to me very very cool very awesome because before if you wanted to understand a lot of these concepts there's a lot of other things you there are a lot of things you have to piece together to figure out like okay what is intelligence how does this thing work transformers are super simple like it's kind of shocking how simple they are i think they were invented in like the 70s with the perceptron uh but basically you're just looking at noise and signal and then you're trying to draw patterns between the noise and the signal and what that means is as long as you have enough data you can kind of apply this problem to anything there's nothing that i said there that is domain specific whereas for example at gumroad we have a risk model at gumroad right every purchase that goes through kind of and it looks at all of these you know hundreds and hundreds of feature flags like a human had to come in and say okay we should have a rule that you know looks at like the the letters in their email and you know kind of creates a model you know a tiny model based on like is it asdf gmail.com probably fraud right or whatever right and like you basically build these hundreds of rules and then you have this sort of tree function and then it kind of does this thing it comes back with a risk score saying hey you know based on what we've seen in the past you know like uh or and what humans think looks risky or not right and and basically just get rid of that and humans think right and you just say based on what we've seen in the past is this risky or not and if you think about how little code is actually required to do that it's almost nothing it's like a few dozen lines of code so what it means in practicality is that a startup like gumroad or really an indie developer can now compete with youtube on youtube recommendations which four years ago or even two years ago would not have been the case right basically gumroad could not have really entered the discovery we had to kind of outsource it to twitter and facebook and you and you know all these other services because there's just no way that a tiny company could do recommendations at scale uh what whereas now i see the problem and i'm like actually you know i plan to tweet tomorrow that we we want to hire one ml engineer who to basically build recommendations for government like i don't think it'll take more than one person um and that's amazing right i mean like to think about like you know the hundreds of people that would have been required to build a model like this maybe five to ten years ago and did at youtube before uh before their new stuff right but now i mean it's it's a 10 or 100x and so when i look at ai like ai is automating 99 of those engineers right now i only need one um and so it's funny because people think all of these other jobs are getting automated away but the number one job that's getting automated away is actually the software engineering job right like why is software engineering such a valuable skill it's because we've automated the crap out of it so that the people who are still able to do it are insanely highly leveraged right like i built gumroad in a weekend and you know like obviously we've built stuff on top of that but the core stuff took about 20 hours right and today would probably take about four hours or something right because i would use chad gpt to write you know the majority of the the code um and so that i mean that that i think is pretty pretty pretty pretty amazing i think it'll be a while until we get to hardware like but but the cool thing about the whole transformer model is in a sense you can apply it to hardware right you can apply it to real life experiences and so imagine that as long as you have enough cameras watching what humans are doing just like you have you know could you know you you record all the text that gets inputted uh when you buy a product on gumroad imagine if you have cameras everywhere recording all this stuff and then report you know you can totally automate tons and tons of stuff um it's pretty fascinating i mean i think i think we could see for example my guess is 10 15 years from now we'll start you know we'll be watching robots play soccer instead of humans because you can't a human cannot physically like the complexity required in my view to like build a brain it's similar to like like creating leonel messi's neural pathways in his legs right like it's just it's it's possible but it's math at the end of the day but the complexity of it is like millions of lines of code like you're just never going to get there with humans but if you can take all of what's happening and just build a model and say here based on all this data and here's here's the inputs here's the output and now we want this new output we want a goal to get scored right what do you do in this scenario oh well based on the million pieces of data we have uh from messi and every other soccer player we you know the only the really only like the only real problem but basically it's gone from a science problem to an engineering problem like the science is solved we've like basically solved the science that sports thing is interesting so yeah i mean the only thing you have to do for sports is get the data which is you just which is like neural link like why is elon working on neural link right like we just need to get the sensors in the place where we can get the math and the math simplifies down to zeros and ones right and so we just need to get basically the what's like the brain and and the leg are talking via nerves which is basically the you know our electronic circuit and so we just need to basically like look at what's happening there and we will we will 100 basically be able to to you know get rid of pain um probably you know short circuit depression like all these sorts of things we will be able to do without needing to know exactly what you know we'll know the math because you can look into this function right just like you can look into stable diffusion and and do the math and figure out what's actually happening but you won't need to right it doesn't it doesn't happen overnight though i feel like let's just use the sports example for a second so let's think about how sports and sports viewership has evolved over the last 100 years or whatever so in the beginning like you you know we would play soccer together we'd be on a field then you know radio comes out all of a sudden you're listening or television comes out you're watching other people play on a field and then you know video games come out and at the time it's like what do you mean you're watching someone play video games you're what you know you're watching counter-strike on twitch like that's that's not even you know those are that's fake bodies right those are essentially just like fake bodies playing connected to a computer and then all of a sudden there's hundreds of millions of people watching that and now you know there's you you know i believe what you're saying is true which is you know everyone's seen or a lot of people have seen those um those dog videos what's the robotics company boston oh yeah boston dynamics when you watch these dogs basically move around and they look and feel like you know real dogs or real animals and it gives you this weird feeling everyone sits there you get this weird feeling and it's because you can kind of see where it's going to go so yeah could i imagine that like instead of a dog it's a human and instead of a human maybe they're playing soccer and instead of like being trained by a human behind it maybe it's trained you know with ai etc it it makes that's the arrow of progress or or yeah i think that's that's certainly the arrow of technology right like if you wanted to build the best soccer player on earth 100 it would be a robot it would not be a human being right uh the question i think is also like what does that mean right like for example will people replace dogs with robot dogs because they no longer have to take them for walks if they are functionally as similar as a dog right um and i think a lot of people will not i think a lot of people will say will basically reject uh this stuff just like they're i still paint with oil paints right for example um but will you be able to make money no because what it does is it shows you that this is basically valueless i think these things have value in this weird cultural sort of bubble and zeitgeist but the minute that a human or a robot can kind of do it just as well as a human it sort of reveals the illusion that this thing is actually useful and interesting and people will just move on to something that only humans will do i think that's really what the pattern will be is that people will play soccer for fun but not to make money i think there will be new sports that robots cannot yet do like surfing i think my my my feeling is that surfing is much harder um than soccer uh for a robot to do and so you know you'll you'll kind of move the the goalpost essentially right but just for example like how many people make a living playing chess nobody right like basically four people or i don't know how many people uh but very very few um um and i guarantee you if you look at like you know the the sort of i'm sure like when robots started to be able to do this stuff it's like okay then why would i bother right like well if it's fun do it um but certainly to make a living like getting into chess is not no one would tell you that that's what to do right um or getting into horseback riding uh but guess what like that's every job like every job is basically going to go through this thing and people i think that's the thing that the sort of like the like guys hasn't really figured out there are all these artists getting really mad that like ai is going to take their jobs or whatever but the truth is like ai took art away from their job long ago like these people are painting rocks for pixar right like they're doing a rote thing they're not artists they're executing a director's vision their hands they're being paid for their their hands they're being paid for the training data because they painted a lot of rocks in the past so that they know how to paint rocks now um they're not painted for like their creative talent their taste that's another thing i think is interesting about the video game sports thing is that basically what it's done is people who may not have had the physical stature to play soccer but did have the hand-eye coordination and the intellect to play soccer can now play fifa and kind of can get really good at that but what it shows me is that basically everything below here is going to be done you know you're going to be judged more and more just based on what's in here and almost nothing else and to be honest like that's going to lead to a very unequal world because we like to think that everyone is identical here and we're just different below you know and by the way if you're listening right now and you're not watching us on youtube oh yeah yeah he's describing his head yeah my you know like basically what we're doing is we're we're we're saying that like any privilege associated with with anything else height or body mass or you know fast switch muscle fibers basically is not going to matter 100 years from now right just like for example height doesn't really matter in today's society but it used to 100 years ago um and that's going to just continue to happen until basically we're all just able to like you know we were kind of born we we like reach puberty and that's basically as as functional as we're ever going to be because everything else you know all the training all the memorization all that stuff where we've sort of already outsourced um and really the only stuff that differentiates us is stuff like working memory which all the stuff is basically genetic so that's going to be weird i think we're going to severely have to rewrite like how how we how we think of of human beings and values and taxes and income inequality welcome all these things are going to have to change pretty dramatically probably should have in the 70s um but you know it's going to get worse and worse and worse not that did did you see this thread by this guy uh francois choley he's um yeah deep deep learning guy um at google um so he tweeted for those who didn't see it the current climate in ai has so many parallels to 2021 web 3 it's making me uncomfortable narratives based on zero data are acceptable are accepted at self-evident everyone is expecting as a sure thing civilization altering impact and a hundred times return on investment in the next two to three years personally i think there's a bull case and a bear case the bull case is way more conservative than what the median person on my timeline considers as completely self-evident and the actual outcome we'll see is statistically likely to lie in between somewhat closer to the bear case what do you think about that i mean i have i don't care at all about the the financial investment piece of it right so uh is it going to be 100x is there any way to make money on ai like i have no idea um but will it dramatically transform society yeah 100 i mean i i don't i don't think this is anything new i think this is what data does it automates wrote uh input and i don't see why i don't see how i mean definitely i can see why people are saying oh this is just like web 3 in the sense that there's lots of people loud and proud on twitter um but i think you can apply the same thing to tons and tons of other stuff right um that people just we we coalesce mimetically about certain topics and then share those things and the truth is people on twitter uh are attention whores and so we are i mean that's why i love the uh the view count frankly because it exposes us for the attention whores that we are that's why we tweet we want views um why do we want attention is so we can make money at some point in the future based on that attention and so yeah of course you're going to have like a similar sort of zeitgeist build up around ai um 99 of it is is bs um however like i spent most of the web 3 stuff reading papers and i spend most of my ai time reading papers uh and so i can compare the papers from ai and compare the papers in crypto and the papers in crypto are actually quite interesting i can give you two or three that are incredibly compelling i can give you two or three a week in ai that are incredibly compelling right and so i think that's very very different i think crypto is mostly engineers outside of academia i think ai is mostly engineers within academia and so you have i think you have a much higher bar to get stuff funded in academia um you have many more diverse uh viewpoints in in in ai um my guess is in web 3 there you know almost everybody was anti-web 3 except for like a few hundred people right that made a lot of money um so i don't i don't think it's the same at all i think he probably just follows like a a very uh you know small slice of of the population i will agree with him though on that 100x invest thing right because that i do think is a problem i never thought that that went through was a great way to make money necessarily um i again i'm a builder i like technology right like if you ask me what's interesting about crypto i'll tell you the interesting technology um like the general the byzantine generals problem that led to bitcoin for example that's super compelling the turing completeness of ethereum super compelling and my investments follow technology so i cannot invest in something unless there is a paper or unless there is some code that's interesting that hasn't been written in that way before because that's how you you make money as a vc like like i do um and so yeah i definitely agree with him that like i could 100 see that like 10 years from now there's there's no way to make money in ai right like basically nobody made any money on ai all the returns basically just went to you know whoever like basically gets attention so that they can monetize via ads um i actually think that's quite likely um and that's why i like being an investor so i can invest in a bunch of stuff but i'm not you know spending my you know i'm not putting all my eggs you know in one basket i'm not a ceo of a company um in this space i would say by the way that like that's always the other thing is like i just like like there's all these people who have opinions uh on twitter like you should ignore 99.9 of them right because what really matters is like what's on like what's on their screen like what are they looking at um are they they're not looking at code i don't really care about their opinion to be honest um and i've held this view for a long time like if you if you i tweeted a while ago i was i don't know i've got some pushback but i basically said if you want to avoid scams only invest in people who know how to code um and obviously the counterfactual is a fallacy so you you can't reverse chain that and say oh well would you invest in people who don't know how to code of course i would um but certainly the number one you know thing you could do to to kind of invest in and make money frankly is to invest in people who know how to code because those people are the most leveraged people everybody else is basically building an audience off of of skill set that's just not that valuable in today's society and so we're really struggling to do so which is why we're hyping all this stuff on on the internet all the time can't you you know okay so i i understand your argument which is basically like if you want the most amount of leverage learn how to code uh because you're basically building a machine like like you you know you started gumroad uh which is essentially payments for creators landing pages for creators and you know i'm sure hundreds of millions of dollars have gone through the platform and you start you know the mvp was in two weeks the minimum viable viable product was built or sorry the minimal viable product was built in a weekend um so code is magical in that sense but can't you you know be a magician as a designer a copywriter a marketer is not that no yeah i don't think so explain why yeah i don't think so and the reason is because uh it's not a it's not an or uh the best uh painters i know write code so it's just not it writing code doesn't mean you cannot be a painter cannot be all of these other things and so what ends up happening uh is that the best painters are the ones who know how to code and because they know how to code they can basically automate 10 20 30 of their peers um and so that's generally like for example a really uh you can see this in art um in the entertainment industry uh for example because in back in the day like if you worked on star wars in the 70s you were doing everything traditionally and then basically photo bashing started happening so things started to go digital by the way artists freaked out about that change where they're like what no you can't do digital that's crazy copy paste what you know uh copy paste no way uh and then photo bashing became a thing because you could now basically like do a mock and then you could take a bunch of photos and skew them on photoshop and like get really you know and people are like that's cheating that's not allowed every single movie you've seen in theater it uses photo bashing avatar like this is how they get to like super highly rendered matte paintings in the background all the backgrounds are paintings basically and they're paintings that are photobashed together right and this is what every single amazing like dylan cole who's the that basically the art director behind avatar that's how he became famous is he basically pioneered this technique literally and so he's literally like in charge of the most you know the most important probably visual ip of this year because he automated his peers right um and he was shit on for that in the industry for a long period of time so i think what you'll end up seeing is you'll just see a continuation of that where the best uh the best artists are using ai in their workflow uh and they're just automating all of their peers they're able to do so much more work for themselves um and that's what that's exactly what i see happening to be honest like i see a bunch of my artist friends uh who know how to code code code takes about you know the thing is when people say like you don't want to learn a code to me that's like saying i don't want to learn how to speak english like it doesn't take a lot you know like i'm not asking you to get a four-year degree in computer science i don't have one i didn't go to i went to uh usc for one semester and dropped out all i'm saying is like google like how to you know start a blog and ship it to heroku um and and understand that piece of code um and you know obviously you don't need to it's completely a choice but as an investor like i can just look at my portfolio and i can look at you know anyone can look at who's successful google i mean if you look at startups right if you look at startups and you say okay 99 of the public value is basically or 90 plus percent is basically in four or five companies right if you get rid of like google amazon meta like we haven't done as an industry right in terms of actually creating value the whole reason venture capital exists right uh basically are all started by engineers computer scientists or software engineers uh even bezos i think had a cs degree um and it just it's a pattern i see over and over and over again it's kind of undeniable um and i think it's just kind of you know it's just it's just what it is you know what about like do you need to be writing code or could you just understand how to read code like you know i get the argument where it's like okay um you need to understand the structures and out you need to understand the fundamentals so for example if you want to be an artist you have to learn perspective you have to learn anatomy and if you are not able to do perspective and anatomy it doesn't matter how good ai is it will not help you currently at least do anatomy perspective design composition uh colors all of that stuff you have to learn uh and by the way if you look at artists who are not that good it's often because they don't actually have the fundamentals in place like they know how to draw dragons but they don't know perspective so the dragons look all stupid and wonky right or they draw eyes that look like almonds no you have to learn the anatomy of the eye and guess what is that fun no but what is it it's stem it's science and math it always comes back to stem science math and engineering um art is just like a tiny layer on top of stem on top of understanding the physics of the world and so i think when you learn computer science what i really mean is just this the equivalent of the those fundamentals which means data structures conditionals algorithms um you need to understand how like http works you have to understand how the internet operates like when you use an app like what's what's on your phone what's you know like because otherwise you can't build anything you can't really build anything new you can copy paste right like for example i can like if there's something i don't know how to do i can pretend but will i ever be able to contribute to the frontier no no and guess what guess who gets all the money all the reward it's not number two not number three right i can play chess you know i'm not making money as a chess player all i'm saying is if i'm trying to make money as a chess player i need to be the best and the best and i guarantee you this is true i guarantee if you talk to magnus carlson he knows how to code i guarantee you um because that's what chess is it's yeah it's and and he knows what that he knows that that's what chess is and that's why he's so good is he can figure out oh this is what it's i'm building a heuristical model and i'm exploring these paths and i basically have to figure out what's the longest path that doesn't lead to a loss um which is probably the right move to make which is guess what that's what alpha zero does yeah yeah i think just reflecting on what you really understand it and the truth is if you can't write it you don't actually understand it so you can pretend that you get it uh but the truth is if you read the bitcoin white paper and you haven't actually implemented it you don't actually understand it you don't actually understand what the math is um and therefore you're never going to build anything that's like to build something so compelling that it's created billions of dollars in value is so hard and so rare to think that the you know 50 or 100 hours of curriculum you have to do to like unlock that like that you like that's gonna like of course you're gonna need that right because it's not that hard of a barrier to to overcome so of course there's gonna be a thousand i don't know how many this is like 10 million people in the world that can code so why would you be you know if you can't like why would i you know it so anyway yeah my my takeaway from what you're saying really is you know one of the most important things that we teach our children is understanding physics right like if i take this apple and i drop it to the ground it moves down at 9.8 meters per squared i know that this uh this apple is going to hit the ground and i know how to navigate my world based on these laws that govern our world what you're saying is basically like we're spending a lot of time in these digital worlds and what governs our digital world are are these sets of laws not really physics but it's enforced by code so to if you want to you know go out in the wild wild west and you want to you know stake a claim basically you know you really need to understand like the equivalent of gravity but in our virtual worlds is that right like for yeah exactly like for example i own a house i bought a house you know 300 grand whatever but would i ever claim to be a real estate developer or an investor no because i don't understand like migration patterns i don't understand weather i don't understand flooding in this region i don't understand the atmospheric river whatever the hell that is people are talking about it's what i don't understand traffic flows like all of these things if you want to do you know you're not you're not living in a vacuum that's the other thing is like there are seven billion eight billion whatever the number is people out there who want to make money too right and so yeah if you are the only person then yeah you totally could do this without knowing traffic flows but in a world in which blackstone knows that stuff you are going to get destroyed by them right because you don't know that stuff and that's what i see all day in in in our field is that like i can build gumroad in a weekend um and i can outship basically any if it doesn't matter how awesome your team is if it doesn't have engineers on it i will beat them right i would just i will win um i can chip more code than most of my portfolio companies and i'm a technical person that generally only invests in technical teams uh and so i it just it's a i don't think people really rock the the sort of difference that can make right like i can make gumroad every weekend which means i can make a new company every weekend and that company can probably raise money at a 10 15 million post money valuation i can do that literally every single weekend that's like insane a lot of people ask me greg how do you build products that foster community well i've got good news that's exactly what late checkout does my company we partner with the largest brands in the world and fast-paced startups to design products that resonate with your community we add a couple interesting clients every single year so if you're interested and that sounds like you email frontdesk at late checkout dot studio with what you're working on what you need help with and don't forget to mention the where it happens pod thank you so what do you what do you recommend to people who might not be technical but who are listening to you now and be like you know what this guy's crazy but he might be on to something um so i'm willing to to dedicate some some of my time in 2023 to learning to be more technical and shipping one product or two products i mean i think that you know what i did was i really wanted to build something and the only way for me to build that thing was to learn how to code because i had no money to hire anybody else which is true for most people engineers by the way are very expensive so if you can't learn a code let's just say you're you're going to spend 250 grand a year on one person right so good luck building a successful company uh but with that that's just almost impossible um so i would say find something that you really want to build it doesn't matter how simple or easy uh the actually the simpler the easier the better probably and build that thing like the first thing i think i ever built was a gpa calculator where in just in excel you i put in my math classes and then i put it or you know my classes or whatever and then i put in like my you know a b c d whatever and then i just had a you know column that said like if a four if b three whatever and then you know like some divide by number of classes and that was like a calculator i built like a little gpa calculator in excel and then build that with python like build the exact same thing but just build it with python like you know use chat gbt probably write 99 of that code for you and then just write a python script that's just local on your computer but you need to solve like like some problem that and and and the way that i think about it is save time or save money generally like what do you spend time or money doing that you wish you didn't and then just automate that um and then you know uh you you know there should be something in your life that you're like oh i spent five minutes like doing these three things and it's like okay okay like for example let's say you wake up and you open like seven tabs right uh you open like twitter and reddit and whatever and it's part of your job well write a script that opens those seven tabs for you and then all you have to do is run it one script and boom it'll it'll open up and guess what when you have that script you can start doing other stuff once you have the glue you can start saying oh well what you know you could actually parse the tweets and turn it into like a you know i could like probably by the end of the day i could take i could probably take like my twitter feed and turn it into a 30 minute podcast that i could listen to like while at the gym or something right it would take me probably like a few hours uh to do with the current tech um i don't know if there's a product there i don't know if there's a business there but i know that doing that you know will teach me skills and certainly like in 2022 would have been enough to raise a million bucks right or whatever um and so i would just say always always start there um uh and then i would also to be honest like i have tons of friends who are like oh i want to learn to code and then like two years go by and they they haven't and i just tell them like you will never do it like stop wanting to do something you will never do it just makes you sad and depressed right like for example i don't intend to ever play in the nba never not in my you know you can't tell but i'm actually nine feet tall right um but uh no just it was never on my was never on my list of things to do uh because i knew that i would never be any good at it because i just don't have the i just literally cannot you know i don't have the height um and thank god i wasn't born in 1892 i would have been screwed at the factory right but luckily i was born in 1992 and the world is my oyster because i know how to code why i don't know uh and so that's the other thing is just like figure out what you know life's not a vacuum so like figure out what you want to do don't let other people tell you what you want to do um and it's never been cheaper than you know to be happier like it's it's like almost free to be happy like move to a place near the near the equator and you'll pay almost no no no nothing and you know and like rent will be a few hundred bucks a month food will be almost free uh if you speak english you can probably make that and just you know teaching people english let's come back let's come back to that quality of life thing because i want to i want to get back to that because i'm interested in that actually but on the on the how do you become technical uh how do you take someone who's not technical and make them technical it sounds like what you're saying is step one is find a problem in your everyday life and you know step two is use platforms like chat gpt to help you know write some of that initial code and just start you know trying to learn from there uh go online you know obviously there's you know tons of places where you can learn different different yeah well it's it's tough the reason it's so hard the reason it's it's like why isn't this easy obviously if you can code you can make like 200 grand a year in a year like why would more people not do that but it's kind of like learning english where it's it's not like there's a simple like learn this and then learn this it's like you kind of have to learn the whole thing and it's like a big puzzle piece and you're filling in the gaps like as you go and eventually you have enough knowledge that you you you maybe don't even know like i don't know english i can't tell you what the rules of english are right i can't tell you why like the old red car sounds you know better than the red old car sounds weird but it does so it's just built into our brains that way we have to learn it and so coding is i think similar in which you just have to learn this stuff by lots of rote practice and building stuff and you have to start small just like english and build up from there but guess what how many people learn a foreign language almost nobody right the way you learn a foreign language is you move to a place and you're like ah crap and guess what you you'll learn a foreign language about three to six months you can become basically conversationally fluent because it's not that hard um but you have to force yourself to right uh and so that that that that i think is a big one i i i think if if if the it also is like why do you want to right that's a big question if you want to build stuff like i want to build stuff by the way you'll do it the truth is many people don't actually want to build stuff they want to make money they don't want to work anymore they have these other things that they want and that's why they want to build stuff and that's honestly not i don't know if that ever has worked because learning the code is like hitting your head against the wall for five years it's very satisfying because you make millions of dollars you get to build stuff you don't have to work anymore um but it is you know frustrating on the path to getting there and so you have to build the building part the building part is actually like uh not enough people talk about like how amazing it is to just like you know using your example of like the a tab script and you put it out in the world and you like post about it on reddit or you post about it on twitter and all of a sudden it goes viral and you're like yeah or you don't you just realize holy shit like i'm or you don't yeah like i have i have an extra 10 minutes a day right and like with that 10 minutes a day i could have an extra 20 minutes a day and like with an extra 20 minutes a day i could have an extra hour a day because i'm constantly using that uh to automate more and more and more and and and the premier way of automation like i always joke with people like the the way you automate almost died um the way you automate people or sorry the way you automate you just hire somebody else to do your job so like once you can make like let's say two to three hundred grand a year you don't really have to work anymore like working is very much a choice and so i like for example like how many hours a week at gummer do i work in front of a laptop zero basically i don't i don't like i don't type i generally just respond to messages on on slack and notion and this is what most ceos do that's like you know why why it's appealing um obviously elon doesn't work at tesla and spacex at all and those companies are doing decently well even though he's technically still the ceo both of those companies right um and so he's you know he's automated the crap out of himself right and guess what he knows how to code it's probably not a coincidence that he he's able to do that um and so yeah i think that the the appeal is like you really have to know why you're doing it for me it's like i don't like doing things i don't like to do and so i just automate the crap out of everything and i just it means i have you know basically after this i'm done for the day right um but how badly do you want it like most people actually if they heard about my lifestyle they'd be like no way i don't want that like i live in oregon i talk to basically on average one human a day which is my wife i don't have a social life i don't have any friends uh in in the area i basically all of my friends are like talking about papers uh about ai and stuff um that's it that's my life uh if that's not you chose that life you chose that life right like that's that's the life you want for yourself and isn't that what a lot of people yeah 100 yeah i mean i could i have unlimited amounts of time and money and whatever i there's no bottleneck on what i can do right um it's completely but i think that's that's attractive to people what's attractive to people isn't the fact of how you design your life particularly but is the fact that you designed your life the way you wanted it to be and then you did it i think they're related the fact that i'm able to design my life like this is because i have a personality that wants a life that is like mine right for example if you like hanging out with people if you like hanging out with with your friends like every day at night you will never have my lifestyle ever because the way that i have my lifestyle is i spend my friday nights building software that's when i built gumroad i didn't build gumroad nine to five i built it when on the weekend if you don't build software on the weekend you will never build gumroad you will never have my lifestyle you just won't you just won't you have to do this stuff on the weekends you have to do this stuff on friday nights um and and again like let's say you don't because technically you don't right obviously like there must be an example but like let's go back to the ai thing right the cool thing with ai is you don't actually have to know how to do anything you just need data and outputs and they'll tell you can you do it or not right based on the data i see a lot of data i can't think of a single example to be honest i can't think of a single example of someone who is non-technical doesn't have any interest in knowing how to code and has built a 10 billion company like is it possible yeah of course it is possible but that person got killed by someone who was working on friday night right like that's what tends to happen uh like zuck didn't win because he was the best engineer on planet earth it's because he really wanted to build stuff um i don't even think facebook was his idea right like but he won why did he win like you know uh because he was the one who knew how to code yeah i think that's another another benefit like if we forget for one second like the financial benefits of learning how to code and building the other benefit i think you'll agree with this is it just feels really good like conceptualizing something and just like putting it out there like i remember the first time i coded anything i was lucky that the school i went to in the seventh grade they had a coding class took it and one of the first projects was um build something in visual basics six so this is a long time ago for those of you who know what that is um and i i built a slot machine i thought it'd be fun to build a slot machine i built it and just seeing it work like such a incredible feeling that i built this thing i published it other people could use it and it didn't make a difference if a million people used it or i just used it didn't make a difference if i you know created a casino around it and and made all this money from it like i didn't care i was just like wow i i got to build this and there's something powerful about like you could die and that thing still exists like there's something at least to me that was important it's like it was almost like a legacy of like if i can build stuff put it and i think tweeting and all these things are similar like when you write a great thing and you put it out there you're like this is part of your kind of your your public you know output uh that will exist long after you're dead or whatever um but for some reason building like i built like a game to like breakout you know and uh my teacher was like you can't play video games during class unless you made the game yourself and i was like cool i'll go build a game that i i want to play uh and did you know uh good good teacher by the way and uh you know it but it was was naval your teacher or something oh man i can't imagine naval i don't even know if naval would teach you'd be like here's a laptop here's math edition and and you figure out the rest i'm right yeah let's talk about that for one second what would if naval was designing you know a high school or something what would what would it be like i've talked to him about this actually i asked him this exact question i was like how do you you know he has kids like how do you think about how do you just think about raising kids and teaching them and he said he he said he may not too different i think it's like focus on math basically like if i think i think math is the underlying you know now i'm saying my own stuff but like basically math is the underlying substrate of reality it's the language that we use uh and so if you can teach someone math then they can learn whatever the hell else they want given the internet like you know math is the sort of like for like i've been thinking about this actually with ai it's like what is what is missing what is missing currently from ai right now like what is next right like how do you like can it get better what what what it does it take to get better and i think the number one thing that's missing is basically discrimination where right now you basically get all this data data and you just you know you use that data to but you like currently the ai doesn't get a choice of like did i learn the is this actually right or not right like it just says oh cool yeah like these strings lead to the strings i can do that right um and i think what's really important what a lot of people i think miss is like when you get new data right like what did you learn that was actually not correct and this is why the probabilistic piece i think is actually really important because almost definitely there's a probability assigned to everything the thing that you learn like how true is this thing and often you read a book and you're like oh my god i'm so much smarter right because i learned all these things very few people read a book and they're like holy i'm so stupid now because i think i'm smart but actually half the things that are in this book are actually completely wrong and so to me what's so important about math is that it allows you this objective framework in which to evaluate new information so when i learn a new thing most of the stuff i read to be honest on the internet i'm like this is wrong i just it doesn't go into my mental model at all um like that's why i have to read papers and i have to read books basically the only things that i can add to my brain are through books and through papers because nothing else has the foundational uh has enough foundational stuff there for me to feel good enough about adding it to my mental model um and so i think that's that's where you start and i i would say if you can't like you can't really teach anyone anything is my guess they have to want to learn it and so i think you have to give them access to a computer and you have to teach them maybe some basic skills like english you know speaking writing and some math maybe some physics or something and at that point it's like here's a laptop what do you want to learn what do you want to build what do you want to do like what do you want to understand and that's all you can really do uh like there's there's a big controversy right now in the uk because it's like oh like rishi sunak is like making everyone do math and math is super key and in the us we're talking about it like oh you know we more people need to know math like we're getting screwed by china and india blah blah blah uh and it's like well i think the thing that people aren't really questioning is like well what if you can't like but it's not new that like we've wanted to teach people these skills for hundreds of years what if you just can't there's certain people who want and it's not capability in my view it's purely a desire i i like i want to build stuff like when i share that thing and it works and it does its thing it feels super good like i get a a deep amount of serotonin in my brain um that i don't get if i like see a nice thing at the at the jewelry shop and buy it and take it home but i know that my wife is completely opposite from me she doesn't care at all about what i do and she loves what she does and so i think people are different and we have to acknowledge that and that will skew in these ways and i think we're forcing everyone to say everyone needs to learn math because math is essential in this new society uh it's like yeah you should learn addition and subtraction and multiplication and division which by the way was enough for the romans to function like they didn't even have the number zero which means they didn't even know multiplication the romans you can do accounting you can do real estate you can do all these things without without even multiplication multiplication sorry the romans didn't have the number zero yeah yeah yeah because you don't need it you don't really need it uh like why would you need the number zero what's what's the use of the number zero uh the number zero doesn't exist inherently right like it literally refers to the concept of not existing so the only the only reason you need zero is i mean there's a lot of benefits uh to inventing zero because once you have zero then you can you have the decimal system then you can do multiplication once you have multiplication you can do exponentiation once you have exponentiation now you can do predictions units statistical modeling so if you're an investor then yes you need multiplication um but basically if you're a real estate agent or if you're an accountant which were the basically the two core money related roles for a long period of time you only need addition i was actually talking to somebody and i was like yeah you don't need any multiplication for accounting he's like i'm the cfo of this major brand and you're telling me that like you can do my entire job with addition and like after five seconds he was like yeah i guess you can it's called double entry accounting that's why is double entry accounting a thing because there's no zero so how do you make a zero it's plus one negative so yeah you don't you don't need multiplication accounting uh romans didn't have it that's why they couldn't predict anything you know you can't you need multiplication to predict also what's really fascinating is in nature the concept of multiplication only exists once there's only been one time in the history of the universe where like multiplication has existed but beyond that we just basically from the big bang just like divided stuff into pieces which is dna life life is the only thing that actually has the property of multiplication that's it uh so yeah it's kind of crazy i think it's like it's fundamentally like it like kind of kind of crazy how important math is and also how long we didn't have it you know um but it also shows we don't actually need it like we don't actually have to like you know this is the other thing it's like a hundred thousand software engineers can run the world like we don't need a million we don't need 10 million and we'll by the way never get them anyway we can try we can we can give everyone college degrees uh by the way most people with ts degrees don't know how to code you know uh it's just we're we're we're we're like we just have to be okay with like there's a limited quantity of these people who want to do it and have the capacity to um and let's like make those people really really successful let's tax the crap out of them so we can all do pretty well um but i do think like this this is the thing i really agree with on like the whole like sort of ponzi stuff around crypto and stuff is like the vast majority of us are just grifters there's like a few people actually building the tech um and actually like the number of people because of automation is actually getting smaller all the time right i think this is a huge reason that like the managerial class exists because there are all these people who would have been automated away in the 70s because of computer science uh and are like no i still need a job that's nice uh air conditioned and i want to type on a laptop so let's create all this crap right um because how do you not uh but i totally think you could run like america with like you know like a few thousand people right um with software again like what is how many how many people like work for the social security administration i think it's like a hundred thousand people or something you know it's like maybe millions i don't know tons of people how many do you actually need again it's just so the irs hired like 87 000 new people to go you know audit people yeah and it's literally just math it's completely automated it's it should be completely automated uh it should require actually like the goal is zero like the goal is is it gumroad for example we have zero full-time employees the goal is zero right uh you can 100 run gum like the us government was like a bunch of part-time employees for a long time right like let's get back to that um and you can do it now with code um it's it's certainly possible it's just the problem is how do you actually you require you need leadership to actually implement all these things and you need consensus and like all these other things and it'll certainly happen in the next like few hundred years is my guess um but yeah i i again it kind of but it comes back to like well what do people do right uh what do people do well they won't be making art like people think they won't be poets because ai will show people that that's all kind of a bs thing that we just did at a period of time and like people actually don't like making art and poems uh if there is if there is no monetary or fame attached to it that's the truth i mean that's pretty revealed during what people what you know covet and the pandemic and all these things like it's pretty clear that people don't actually like doing this stuff um so what do people want to do well my guess is they they would move closer to the equator and use their bodies uh more uh is generally what i would and guess what this is what people do like what do rich people do want like they go to italy and greece and they walk around and eat food and they go to the african safari and they walk around and eat food and they go that is what humans do that's what humans would prefer to do uh if we had unlimited time and money we would do that and so why the hell are we all living in russia and like portland oregon and you know like we should all be moving closer and closer to the equator um it's honestly shocking to me that that like that isn't like a like we have all this like housing prices you want housing prices to go down get the people here who shouldn't even be here anymore they're just here randomly because they're like you know two three generations ago someone wanted beaver pelts to sell to chinese emperors right and move them the hell down uh like it's crazy to me um there's only as a as a canadian i i i don't i definitely feel for him feel that i mean i literally cannot live in portland oregon like i'm deeply vitamin d deficient because i have too much melanin in my skin so i i like physically get depressed like i physically feel it uh and my guess is actually i'm not the only one who physically feels that i'm just more aware of it because i have choice um and and freedom and grew up in singapore near the equator but like no i have a completely have depression like three to four months of the year because it's gray and there's no sun basically um like why the hell am i here i wouldn't be without you know without my wife basically um but then why the hell is everybody else here it's well they can't move anywhere they like they just like you know it's like the conceptual model to be like i can leave you know it doesn't really exist um well one is borders like one is like there's a legitimate 100 i mean that definitely needs we need to figure that out i mean that's what that's why i think there should be an effort like we should figure out how do we get where there's all these all these mexicans moving to america which is awesome they totally should but guess what should also be happening all these americans should be moving to mexico mexico is super cheap and way better weather like why are you here you know um you should be here if your if your goal is to innovate if your goal is to make money but as soon as you've done those sort of things you should like don't go to florida like go to costa rica go to like literally go anywhere else in the world where your talent is so necessary is so vitally important your your your your memes and genes are would be would do so much value in in these other places but but that i think that's a huge like liquidity problem that we have that uh that that that yeah that that should totally change um but it honestly blew my mind because i i think this was a bias that i had like i grew up in singapore and i was in sf and like was born in new york to indian parents like everyone i knew was always an immigrant it was always like oh you know and then like now i live in portland oregon and like 99.9 of the people i talked to were born and raised here you know like and then shock it honestly blew my mind where it was like it was like wait what like you can just never leave your little place on earth like even though you know everything is there um yeah i was like it's crazy to me yeah i mean i think i mean a lot of thoughts there and we don't have that much time but i think listen i think first of all some people are just you know they're they're in portland because they're in portland like there's an inertia to the place that you live and it's difficult to get up and leave everything you know for something new that's just like a difficult thing that a lot of people have to deal with the other thing is like family is a big pull for for a lot of people right like i guess it's honestly entirely family i actually don't think the first one matters at all i think it's purely family yeah yeah i think people stick here because they they can't imagine life without their family i see my family like once every six months this is it's just who i am it's my personality it's the personality of my immigrant parents um and i guess it's the life that you designed build billion dollar companies too it's the life that you designed for yourself right like it's the it's the life you want yeah and i think i don't value i don't value like hanging out with my parents weekly as so i think you know this is a great place to end which is if people want to get the life that they imagine for themselves like how do you recommend them to reach that life honestly i think everyone has it that's my current belief is that everybody basically has the life that they want because the truth is like people do have the freedom to change if they wanted to and they don't um so most people like don't want to leave their family and that's totally fine uh i did you know most people don't want to learn how to code and that's totally fine i did i think what's most important is that people should want stop wanting things that they don't actually want i think the the biggest concern i have right now is that people look at social media and they think they want all those things and maybe they even do want those things but they wouldn't have if they never saw it they wouldn't want a six pack if they never saw someone with a six pack uh right like these sorts of things and so i think most people should just really focus on what's really important to them and make sure that they're getting those sorts of things and i bet that they are uh and that they maybe just feel guilty because other people are saying oh no you should be doing this and you should be doing that and you should be doing that no like i don't think most people should be learning how to code i never said that all i said is if you want to like live my lifestyle you're going to need it because that's the only way you can automate stuff it's with code but have you have you read uh i'm reading it right now wanting the creative cycle yeah is that the luke borges book yeah so it's the power yeah the power of mimetic desire in everyday life and it's just goes through um this desire that all human human beings have to copy other human beings if i see someone with a rolex i'm gonna want a rolex if i see someone with a lot of followers i'm gonna want a lot of followers and it's an absolute must read yeah and and and i would say that there's certain people who don't have mimetic drive nearly as much as other people yeah right like i don't have a watch uh i don't have anything besides a t-shirt and pant like i have the essentials i wrote a book called the minimalist entrepreneur right like i don't have things i don't like everything fits in a suitcase um or backpack actually um and that's it i don't like i don't want anything else i really don't want like why do i have lots of money is just so i can invest in startups like i don't want any physical things i just don't have i have zero desires for that you know why do i have a house the only reason is because there are other human beings in my life now and that's why i need a house otherwise i don't really even need a house right um and so that's the other thing it's like this is who i am like i can't change it or i could but i don't want to i don't want to want more you know uh i i find it weird that people have more but like i've just never i've never been that person like in high school or whatever like i've never like who wants a nice fancy car like no that's ridiculous um however i would say that like one thing that was really important to me growing up is the fact that i didn't grow up in a single place right like my parents are from india i was born in new york grew up in hong kong standpoint london and so very quickly i think maybe that showed me that like this this whole thing is a memetic social game but like everyone is copying each other and when you constantly move from one place to one place you realize like oh there's a game over here people are playing that's the social game over here there's a social game over here that people are playing but what's really important is basically i think of it like there's three things which is family money and weather that's it those are the only three things that matter fundamentally and i think most people actually are memetic and buying all those things to get laid which is family they feel like they won't be able to do that thing that they really want to do which is have a family and so they need the watch they need the car they need all those things and by the way they might be right they might be right about those things because in many cultures those things do matter i don't need those things why because i can code so i can show people my status very easily i don't need to buy fancy clothes and cars because i can show people that i know how to code and everyone knows that i could get all those other things if i wanted to and so i don't need those other things at all so i'm playing the exact same social memetic game that everybody else is playing it's just i don't i can play it you know i can i'm just at a different level uh and i got lucky i think uh you know in being able to play that uh but it's not a coincidence that like bology and naval and me like have a similar aesthetic a similar life a similar disconnection to society we all know how to code uh we have lots of twitter followers um and we all have you know tons and tons of people who want who say they want to be like us uh but the truth is they don't otherwise they would be otherwise they would be building stuff on the weekends and living in the middle of nowhere but when you actually look at them and you're like oh no you actually like they'll be like oh i really want to be like you and i'll go like go to their instagram account like you definitely don't want to be like me like you're posting pictures on a boat like i would never do that so like they want money they want other things they want whatever whatever things that they think i may be able to you know i have but it's a package deal right at the end of the day you can only be jealous of someone if you want if you if you're willing to get everything that they have and to get everything that they have there's this big inertia that exists like a lot of people might be listening to this and be like yeah like i'd love to make something like sahil's made or i'd love to get as many twitter followers as sahil has but there's inertia what do you like you're obviously natural in the sense that you you're you know you you've got a bias for action so you don't have much inertia but how do you recommend to people who don't necessarily have a bias for action to how do you stimulate that i mean i would say the the most important thing you can do is to force it right so there's that scene from like the dark night rises where you know like the kind of the bridge burns and he has to do the thing right i think that's you burn the boats right like for example you want to start a company you want to do a startup move to san francisco i did work for a startup i did again like the data is the truth like look at what people have done me balaji and naval moved to san francisco and worked at startups in order to start our own startups and so there are all these people who are like oh i really want to do that but i have too much inertia i have too much family then leave move the number one most important thing by far anyone could do who's listening to this is literally physically change your location by far because that will sever all of these things in your life that are preventing you from from from moving forward um so you know just move like physically move um and if you can't do that just be okay with not moving which means not getting all of these things that you think you want but you actually don't want because your family is more important than those things and that's great i i wish i wish that family was as important to me as it is to them but it's not it just isn't um that might be due to childhood trauma that might be due to genes that might be who knows why that may be the socialization um but that's just the truth of of of who i am and the things that i get to do um because of it you know like i don't mind working 60 plus hours a week i love it you know um when i go on holiday like i wish i were working uh guess what if you are on holiday and you're like i love being on holiday i'm sorry to say that like you know doing a startup is probably not for you right um but better to be truthful about that than to to say hey you can like here's a million bucks and then like four years from now you're going to realize that this is not for you because guess what like the the company only matters 10 years from now that's the other thing a math teacher told me this one time where i was like this is math right math very key here's a good mathematical concept um which is like uh i think i i got close to doing something and i'm like i got 80 of the way there so like i should get like an 80 and he's like cool walk 80 of the way to the door and so i do and he's like are you out the door and i said no and he's like yeah so in math for example rule of math uh fractions don't exist they don't exist there's no proof of fractions you're zero and you have one that's it there's no proof of half of anything in real life because if you have half of something then you just have one of that half right you only have one uh and that was a that was a super important concept i think there are so many people right now i see it in my portfolio to be honest i see founders and i'm like you're you're gonna keep doing this thing and you're gonna realize it's not for you in two or three years and do do something else you know like i'm you're 11 years into gumroad right like seven years into gumroad it was a failure um and the only reason i kept going is because i knew how to code because i could run the whole thing myself which means i could automate the entire thing and go do other stuff with my life which gave it the time to actually thrive so if i didn't know how to code you wouldn't be listening to this today gumroad would be dead you know like there's so many instances that this this stuff has saved has saved me and that's the thing is when you look at facebook and twitter and all these examples of i was like oh what they're all they're all these other rules all these other things like yeah but like basically they all died like in the instance that elon didn't know how to code tesla would have died you know in the instance of naval knowing not knowing how to code angelus would have died like the amount of near deaths that these companies have is incredibly high and basically the only way that these companies exist is because the people at the top are insanely competent and self-reliant because the truth is when these things become near-death experiences everybody leaves everybody gets off the boat except for you you're by yourself uh basically you're by yourself the hardest decisions i look at gumroad i was the only person in the room making them uh you know i'm sure the same is true with steve jobs at apple and naval at angel list and elon at twitter like you're the only person who thinks this is a good idea you know um and the only way that's possible is if you are literally possible to you you can do it by yourself um like elon knows how to make rockets go to space i believe uh not because he wants to but because he has to like he has to know how to do all those pieces um so that that that i think goes back to you know your point around like inertia is like you have to you you have to want it so badly that like there's like you wouldn't frankly you wouldn't even be asking the question right because you would have already done the thing right like i i i love writing science fiction and fantasy i was talking to brandon sanderson about this and he said you know like the truth is like the people who write science fiction and fantasy and do really well they can't do anything else and the fact that you want you have a choice that you this is something you do for fun you're probably never never going to be able to do this at this level you know so i think i mean that's a he's interesting okay i've got i've got a few thoughts and then we gotta gotta wrap up um i love ranting so thanks for no no i this is you're you're you're gonna push a lot of people's 20 23 i'm trying to be more honest no i like it i like the honesty and like even if you know people only agree with 70 or 80 of what you're saying i think that the fact that if you're listening to this you're kind of like questioning things it's it's still an important exercise to do for yourself so you might not want to physically move for whatever reason but you know another you know one thing i recommend people do if they can't physically move is mentally move like mentally move in the sense of like okay you still live in you know portland oregon but like you know you follow or you consume content from people in san francisco or something like i also was one of those people like i i left where i was and you know in canada and moved to san francisco and like this conversation with you is like one of the reasons why i loved being in san francisco because like i hope you don't take this as like offensive like you're crazy like in the sense of like you're you've got big ideas and you've got crazy ideas and they're bold and stuff like that and like i had never met people like that until i moved to san francisco yeah um so i think that like having like you know what's the saying like you're the average of the five people you spend time with well you know you know you're the average of the five podcasts you consume is maybe another way of of putting it or the five twitter accounts that you follow religiously or the five youtubers or so i think the media you consume is really really important i think that's a an important piece that you're you're you're kind of i i know you believe in as well yeah no i think you're completely right and when i you know i grew up in singapore and like you know before before i was you know 18 i went to you know went to college in the u.s um i was like that where i was like i want to leave i can't uh currently and so i'm going to twitter was my you know social network even when i was you know back then like i'd go on twitter every morning and i'd be like these are all my friends that i don't know yet and then when i moved you know when i finally moved to la you know i went to startup school in san francisco uh to like meet those people you know um and it is yeah it is crazy um the way you speak and like i speak and like i have so much confidence and everyone should totally like add layers of of like self-awareness into what i say i'm i'm conscious as of the things that i say as i say them and how i say them um but i try to be but you know like you you want to you you really want to surround yourself your environment you know with with what you want in the future right make your environment in the current look like the environment you want in the future and if that means twitter and the books that you read and the people you follow you know resemble that um i think that does help a lot and you can learn a lot that way too um i would say the other thing i would just add is like also don't don't worry about unfollowing people too right like sometimes you do have to let go of certain things and you know i don't get to hang out with my high school friends as much you know as i used to um and it sucks and i wish i could do more of it but you know i choose i make certain choices and other other you know some of my high school friends still hang out with each other every weekend and i see them on instagram you know um so i think yeah at the end of the day you are mimetic right like you are going to be programmed by what you consume and so make sure that you're kind of consuming just like a diet like you're consuming things that you know you are what you eat in a way right um and i do i do think that is that is really important i would say the other thing is like do stuff with these people like don't just follow people on twitter but like what if you could work together on something right like what if two of you like learning to code is kind of like going to the gym like it's it's work it's like it's not fun in the beginning you know you're gonna hit your head against the wall if you could do it with somebody else or do it with 10 other people or start a discord or whatever like that's gonna make your life a lot easier too i think cool well thanks for thanks for coming on and and you know making our brains explode and i think a lot of people are gonna love this episode where where could people get more of you and add you to their diets yes if you want to add me to your diet that's a good one uh i'm on twitter at shl uh that's the best place to yeah follow me see what i'm up to and you've got a great book i've listened to it on on audible called the minimalist entrepreneur uh definitely worth a read um i think your next book should be caught be called something like you know get to zero and it should be an ai book ai plus automation book um i do have a i have a domain anti-work.com which is you know that subreddit which is really funny they have the problem is that they have a very pessimistic view uh i try to be a little bit more optimistic but yeah that's the goal i always joke with people like the goal like entrepreneur by definition is someone who does not want to work and so you you kind of build the company and hire the people so that you can you can make the judgment calls you can make the decisions but ideally you're not you know you're not moving the knobs uh and uh hopefully ai makes it possible so that more and more people get to experience what that what that is like all right man well we're out of time i'll see you i'll see you later yeah see you you later thanks so much again
