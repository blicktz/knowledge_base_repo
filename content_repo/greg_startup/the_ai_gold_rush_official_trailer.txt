AI systems may be more intelligent than we know, and there's a chance the machines could take over. I'd give humanity a 30% chance of surviving. If we create general super intelligences, I don't see a good outcome long term for humanity.

But what if I told you AI is also the biggest opportunity of our lifetime? AI is allowing people to express their creativity in a way that wasn't possible before. The world's biggest problems will be solved.

It further levels the playing field of all humans. We're only at the beginning of the AI gold rush. This is crazy.

What if we inspire millions of people to take the ideas in their head and get them to actually ship something? Man, I'm just feeling really inspired right now. Let's have fun and go big or go home, you know?

To capture this moment in history, we're launching a global experiment and a docu-series to tell the story. I did not expect this. Let's put it that way.

This hackathon is more than a competition. It's about seeing what you could create, how you can take your ideas and put them out there with today's AI tools. Why wouldn't you be part of it?

Most documentaries are one way. This one you can be part of and earn your share of the $1 million prize pool. Register, build something cool, document your journey, and millions of people could see it.

This isn't science fiction. This is right now. Welcome to the AI gold rush.

This is going to be sick. This is going to be a big part of you. This will make me sick.

This will make me sick. It will make you sick.
