# Most businesses have historically made themselves for middle-income,
##### middle-class consumers. This began post World War II, with the great rise and expansion of the middle class in America. This was the “keeping up with the Joneses” majority, so it made perfect sense to tailor advertising, marketing, businesses, products, and services to the move-to-the-suburbs, get-a-house-with-a-white-picket-fence, a new-car-on-view-in-the-driveway crowd. And a crowd it was.
 But, in more recent times, while the economic facts of American life went through great changes that hollowed out the middle class, business didn’t catch on or catch up to this, essentially continuing to gather around a watering hole that was drying up fast.
 Everything about the availability of consumer spending capability was changing much faster and much more dramatically than most businesses acknowledged.


-----

##### It wasn’t a difficult prophecy. In 2007, I first showed, publicly, the “new economy pyramid,” in the first edition of No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits (now in the second edition). A few years before then, I began describing it to private clients and talking about it in closed-door mastermind meetings and seminars. I forecasted a literal genocide of the American middle class. And I meant: genocide, for I view a lot of it as intentional, deliberate, and orchestrated by political and certain corporate interests. But with or without that, the evolutionary disappearance of the middle class was certain. This was not difficult to foresee. The writing was on the wall, in big letters and numbers, in blood red ink. Many refused and still refuse to see it. There were denialists—in government, in media, on Wall Street. There were the ignorant, eyes wide shut. But I saw everything there was to see and made my dire prediction. Here it is, in the same visual:

 This prophecy has come to pass, but it is not yet done. There is a lot more carnage to come. Temporarily, President Trump has introduced new dynamics, pulling the middle class—particularly its blue-collar members— back from the cliff’s edge. As of this writing, he has an agreement on restructuring NAFTA, pending Congress’s approval, and is otherwise dragging jobs back from Mexico and overseas, releasing manufacturing, drilling, and other industries from regulatory burdens and otherwise restarting a robust domestic industrial economy. More people now have


-----

##### jobs than at any other time in the past 20 years, wages are up and rising, and the middle class’ compelled savings, like 401(k) accounts, have soared. Of course, to some extent, labor shortages, open jobs, and competition for workers is inflationary, so much of the gains to those in the middle are only “on paper,” while gains toward the top are more real because of less impact by inflation. A significantly affluent person may spend only 5% to 20% of current income on necessities, so a big raise in income actually reduces the percentage spent on necessities, and the inflation becomes a voluntary tax. This ironically liberates spending more on luxury goods, services, and experiences, as we’ll discuss. The middle-income earner may spend 70% to 90% of his income on necessities or even above 100% by dependence on credit, so a modest pay raise still goes largely to necessity purchases, where the inflation offsets it very directly. In other words, everything done to rescue and preserve the middle class, while an admirable effort within the “Make America Great Again” vision, cannot alter the fact that it is an endangered species being made to die out more slowly, but dying out nonetheless.
 The impact of tech, automation, and robot-ization alone guarantees a middle-class shrinkage that has to, again, pick up speed. In the Industrial Revolution, job replacement vs. job elimination was close to one-to-one. Not so with the tech revolution.
 So, now, writing the third edition of this book, 12 years after the first one, I contend that moving your business’s target range up to mass-affluent and, better still, affluent clientele is all the more important and will soon, again, also be urgent.

 The Two Requirements for Your Prosperity Ultimately, to prosper you need an ample supply of customers with two attributes: ABILITY to buy and WILLINGNESS to buy. Both as a constant. Whether the economy continues to expand or reverses and shrinks, whether unemployment holds onto Trump Economy all-time lows or returns to 10- or 20-year-average norms, whether the middle class’s destruction slows to a crawl or resumes a fast pace—no matter what external conditions occur, you need a bastion of consumers with both constant, uninterruptible ability and willingness to buy. Such customers can only be found among people of


-----

##### affluence—not just in income, but in their net worth and emotional state. Organizing a business around any other population is, bluntly, self- sabotage. A business otherwise organized is always fragile. When heavy rains come, its crops and buildings are washed away. This book is all about building your bastion.
 To move you from curiosity and half-hearted, tentative action on the advice and strategies in this book to whole-hearted, passionate, courageous, aggressive, and urgent action, I want to take a few minutes to summarize the facts of this middle-class shrinkage, provide some evidence of its impact so far, and try to paint a vivid picture in your mind of this as a present and accelerating reality.
 We can begin with a few statistics. These are compiled from various authoritative sources. I have not footnoted each fact separately, but I have listed many of the sources at the end of this chapter.

 How Bad Did This Get? How Bad Will It Get? Beginning with the recession that was triggered in 2007–2008 and lasted through 2013, with the damage accelerating and peaking during the Obama years, the median U.S. household net worth plummeted by 43%. This manifested in many ways, with the upside down home mortgages being the most visible, and retirement savings accounts 401(k) the clearest loss to many. In these and many other ways, wealth—and with it the ability and willingness to buy things for years, even decades to come—erased. This damage at the top of the economic pyramid, while harsh, was and is far from devastating. If you have $10 million and lose 43% of it, you still have $5.7 million. It didn’t and doesn’t matter much to the bottom of the pyramid. If you have zero and lose 43%, you still have zero. But in the middle, it murdered and is a murderer. There it forcibly moves a middle- class consumer to a low-class consumer. There it changes a frequent discretionary spender into a buyer only of essential commodities. As it slaughtered those in the middle, it sucked the very life right out of the economy.
 More important, these lost years of lost wealth and spending capability will never be recovered from by these slaughtered middle-income consumers, so in your own business lifetime you will not see a rebound of


-----

##### their best spending. To add insult to injury, generational replacement spending by Millennials is defying historic trends, is at a minimum, and is concentrated into few categories. Where are the first-time home buyers, home furnishings buyers, new insurance customers, etc.? Buried under a stunning $1.5 TRILLION of college debt, in their parents’ basements.
 In those years, we saw a drop in net worth in almost all income categories, from the top 5% to the near bottom. Only the bottom 25th percentile saw an increase—but that is deceptive because in calculating, the government counts the earned income tax credit and food stamps as income, and Mr. Obama was the food stamp president. There are profound differences in how people in different income categories react and can react to net-worth losses. Toward the top, most high earners have options for amping up their earnings to replace net-worth losses. The high six-figure income professional can raise fees, take on more clients or patients, maybe cut overhead or staff. They have a great deal of control. My own earning capability has a dial like a thermostat on it, that I can adjust by my own hand. I always have options: writing three books in a year instead of two, accepting a few more speaking engagements I now turn down, promoting more and attracting more clients. Some top income earners have reacted that way. Others did not—but didn’t need to, and their discretionary spending capability and willingness still remained intact. They had ample money.
 Toward the bottom, they traded down in price. There was a bleed from Walmart to “dollar stores” as examples under economic stress. These consumers cut where they can. They may add a low-wage job to the household. They file bankruptcy in large numbers, expunge accumulated debt, and start over with some restored spending ability. But by and large, their total spending contribution to us marketers and to the economy as a whole varies only a little, because in bad or good times, they are still spending nearly all their income on essentials, holding nothing back, neither saving or investing.
 It is in the middle where stagnated and falling wages, loss of one of two jobs in the household, and cutting of hours—in part, the result of Affordable Care Act threats, uncertainties, and realities—had its most savage effects. The median income, in the 50th percentile, went from $98,872.00 in 2007 to $70,801.00 in 2009 to $56,335.00 in 2013. Take $40,000.00 out of a


-----

##### $90,000.00 household income and watch everything that happens. It was no surprise that home ownership dropped to a two-decade low, real estate values were slow to recover, the real estate market was poor in all but a handful of places, real estate agents’ incomes dropped, the population of active agents shrunk, and the mortgage broker and agent industry fast became a sad shadow of its former self. No surprise that roughly one-third of middle-class households fell out of that category. In short, not only did the middle-class consumer population shrink with far more falling down than climbing up, but its remaining population had shrinking buying power and had to use more and more of its buying power in fewer and fewer categories, probably excluding you and what you sell.
 All of this can happen again. Never lose sight of that. The middle class’s economic activity has always been what makes and keeps the rich folks rich and growing ever richer and what creates an uplifting opportunity for the bottom levels to move up. Small business provides most jobs and most low-skill, entry-level jobs, but most small businesses are started, grown, and owned by middle-class people, who were, for nearly ten years, severely limited in their ability to start or grow such businesses. The first year in two decades with a decline in the number of new businesses started was 2013. Middle-class consumer spending is what created and sustains suburbs, shopping malls, and the huge and wide middle of every business category: retail, restaurants, service providers. Temporarily, some of these categories can appear as healthy as ever by simply raising prices on fewer numbers of die-hard middle-class consumers. Movie industry revenues are up even as movie theater attendance has fallen and is falling. But this is the “failing condominium tower strategy”: five move out, so monthly dues are raised on the remaining 50. Five more leave, dues are raised again. Eventually, there’s one sod left with a monthly service fee of $50,000.00.
 The September 17, 2014, issue of The Wall Street Journal included a report headlined: “Incomes End A 6-Year Decline, Just Barely.” Any good news was welcome. But popping champagne corks or even beer can tabs was not called for!
 In 2014, the time of my writing of the prior edition of this book, there was little reason for anything but a gloomy forecast for, at best, a mud- uphill-slow recovery of the economy and a slowing of middle-class erasure.

##### Trump has changed all that, to an extent, in ways, and at a speed, few economists could imagine, and for which he gets far too little credit from most media and other observers and beneficiaries. I expected a significant reversal of bad fortunes and some sort of boom by Trump, but even I have been pleasantly surprised by all he has wrought. However, it is very dangerous to let this lull you into complacency. Macro forces continue their work. All things carefully considered, my forecast is for a brief Indian summer inevitably followed by a long, long, bitter cold winter for the middle class and its consumerism. If and when liberals get control of the levers of power, they will try warming up the shivering masses with socialism-lite, which will, as it always has, make things worse and lengthen the economic winter until another Trump arrives.
 So, I tell you: Use this Indian summer and these good days to proactively and creatively recraft your business to move up the ladders of income, net worth, and stability of ability and willingness to buy.
 There are two considerations that should govern your strategy, dictate where you sell and who you sell to. One is Comparative ABILITY to Buy. The other is Comparative WILLINGNESS to Buy. Nothing else matters more.

 A Look at Comparative Ability to Buy Consider three households—the Joneses, with low-wage jobs, combined putting just $30,000.00 a year into the coffers; the Smiths, with one at a good-paying job, the other at a low-wage job, combined $65,000.00 a year; and the Barons, who own a very profitable business from which they each draw a good salary and bonuses, and who have significant investment income, totaling $300,000.00 a year. All three households include two kids.
 What is the same about all three? The amount of money they have to spend on necessities. It goes up a little from Jones to Smith to Baron by choice. Ground beef, steak from the grocery store, premium steak ordered from and delivered by Omaha Steaks. But basically, all three families’ necessities are virtually identical. The Joneses and the Barons need the same amount of toilet paper, use the same amount of water and electricity, have to insure their cars, feed themselves and their kids, pay doctor bills and so on. Again, by choice of premium


-----

##### quality, or by having three cars instead of one, the amount spent may vary, but it won’t vary proportionately. The Baron household won’t spend ten times what the Jones household spends on necessities.
 That means that the percentage of income spent on necessities varies a whole lot. Allow for the increase in amount spent for premium choices, more, and bigger, and say that the household’s basic and essential needs can be met for $25,000.00 a year, so that’s what the Joneses spend, the Smiths spend 50% more—$37,500.00, and the Barons splurge, spending twice that —$75,000.00. Some do, some don’t, by the way. Look at this in percentage of income terms.
 The Joneses spend 85% of their income on basic and essential necessities. There are few choices in this spending. The grocery cart will feature low-cost “fill ‘em up” food. Brand loyalty is supplanted by coupons and sales. The trip to Walmart, pretty predictable. They have only 15% of income left free to spend flexibly on home improvements, on entertainment, on recreation, on elective health care, etc., and to save or invest, as long as nothing goes wrong. They have only $4,500.00 for all these choices for the entire year. $375.00 a month. One car water pump blown, one furnace repair, one kid toppled out of a tree and taken to the emergency room, and a month’s, maybe two months’ discretionary spending ability is erased. The Joneses that I’ve described are actually in better shape than most at the low- wage bottom of our economic pyramid. Most spend 100%, 110%, 120% of their income just on necessities. They are in debt, stay in debt, get deeper in debt. This is why the payday loan business exists.
 The undesirability of aiming your businesses at the Joneses should be obvious. You have to win a war of base commodities, where prices are reverse elastic; constantly pulled in and pushed down. Customers buy by price, often only by price, so creating quality or service superiority has little value. A lot of money extraction has to be done in a predatory way that you may find unseemly, and that is subject to disruption by consumer protection. Again, look at the payday loan business. The “tote the note,” dealer-financed car business. The furniture and big-screen TV and appliance rental business. Selling to poor people is a grimy, grind-it-out business. You already know you don’t want to be there or you wouldn’t have bought this book. I just want to emphatically confirm your own instincts.


-----

##### The Smiths spend 58% of their income on the same necessities. The Jones spend 85% of their income. The Smiths have a wider margin for error and for extra choice spending. They can be sold an expensive night out at the ballgame, a Disney® vacation, and new school clothes for both kids. With financing, they can be sold a new car or even a kitchen remodel. In dollars, they have $27,500.00 a year to use this way—nearly as much in discretionary spending ability as the Jones’ entire income. That’s $2,291.00 a month of flexible spending, saving, and investing power. A blown water pump, a broken furnace, an emergency room bill for Tommy may take a bite, but there’s quite a bit left afterward. Also, should the Smiths choose to live beyond their income—a blessed thing for us marketers—they can get a lot more credit than the Joneses, and they can service a lot more consumer debt. As of this writing, the credit card debt bubble is at its all-time high, in some ways a concealed cancer growing inside a seemingly vibrantly healthy economy. All bubbles burst. The question is when and exactly how, not if. So, this group’s ability to spend is artificially inflated and their willingness to spend subject to abrupt disruption. When I wrote this, in late 2018, interest rate increases from the Fed were happening, and more threatened, in reaction to a “too good” economy. That increases interest rates and, therefore, minimum monthly payments on all these credit cards. It also increases monthly payments on variable rate mortgages and the costs of trading in a car. Ooops. This is the danger of having your business tailored to and dependent on the Smiths. They can go sour on you with little warning. Their ability and/or willingness to buy rises and falls with winds and tides over which you and they have no control.
 Now, the Barons. They only spend 25% of their income covering the same basic and essential necessities that take 58% of the Smiths’ income and 85% of the Joneses’ income. Just 25%. That means 75 cents of every dollar stays loose. No locked-in commitments. In dollars, the Barons have $225,000.00 to spend, save, or invest flexibly. If they wisely split that in half, they can plow $112,000.00 a year into tax-deferred retirement savings plans like 401(k)s, into stocks and bonds, into real estate—so that, in less than ten years, about seven years, and every seven years, they accumulate another million dollars. By comparison, the Smiths can save or invest very little. The Joneses, zero. And even if the Barons act that responsibly, they still have $112,000.00 left over to buy all sorts of unnecessary goods and


-----

##### services and gifts and trips. A big, fat $9,333.00 a month. Should the Barons choose to throw all sane behavior to the wind and live beyond their means—a blessed thing for us marketers—they have the ability to get a whale of a lot more credit and service it than the Smiths.
 In big-thumb terms, the Joneses can handle almost no debt service, and are likely maxed out with their debt. The Smiths can handle about $200,000.00 of consumer debt, tops. But the Barons can handle $1 million of debt. Or, irresponsibly, even more.
 Simply put, if your customers are low-wage or middle-wage earners, the Joneses or the Smiths, you are in very serious peril. Think of these customer populations as a place. You live or have your business in this place. Once, it was a nice neighborhood with well-kept homes, safe streets—salt of the earth type people. Gradually, it changed. Homes declined in value, got bought up by landlords—more renters, less homeowners. Soon drug dealers were on corners with unsafe streets. Such decay rarely reverses.
 You have to get out. You can. Where to go? While the middle class collapse happened (and is in recovery), the affluent population has steadied, proved resilient and reliable, and even grown. From 2011 to 2013, the number of U.S. households with incomes exceeding $100,000.00 grew by 6%. Better, the average household income among these affluents also grew by 5%. Net worth also increased by 2%, to an average $1.1 million. The Royal Bank of Canada’s big, annual Wealth Report, released in June 2014, stated that the number of high-net-worth households with multimillion-dollar net worth rose by 11% from 2011 to 2012, and rose again by another 16% from 2012 to 2013. The wealth of those households rose as well; nominally, but a 2% boost to $5 million is not chump change. Throughout the top 5% of the pyramid, there is a growing number of customers to sell to and they have growing spending capability.
 More recently, even more wealth has risen to the top tiers. And since Trump’s election, truly amazing things have been occurring to the benefit of the affluent: corporate/business and personal tax reductions, record- breaking stock market gains, and with this, almost unbridled optimism.


-----

##### If you are going to choose your customers—as you can and should— why not choose ones with strong ability and willingness to buy, broadly, in diversified categories, with price-elastic decision-making, and imbued with optimism or, if need arises, resilience?
 Consider Comparative WILLINGNESS to Buy. Obviously, ability links to willingness. But there is a broader optimism vs. pessimism. A Gallup Poll in late 2014 showed 56% of Americans saying the economy was continuing to get worse—only 39% said it was getting better. An NBC News poll had a whopping 70% saying the economy was headed in the wrong direction. Within these numbers, there are biases by bottom, middle, or top of the pyramid.
 Optimism about the economy and about one’s personal economy favors marketers. Pessimism about these things stands solidly in the way.
 By late 2018, the situation reversed. Polling on consumer optimism and business leadership’s optimism were at record highs. It was hard for people not to feel this way. Unemployment hit a 50-year low, the stock market hit mind-boggling highs, and the daily economy news was virtually all positive. President Trump exuded optimism, unlike any presidents since Reagan and, before him, Kennedy.
 Pessimism is a headwind against willingness to buy with all but those of significant affluence and enough age to view negative economic situations as temporary. Optimism is a tailwind that spurs a much broader demographic swath of the population’s willingness to spend. It is fine to take some advantage of times of optimism, but also smart to reinvest the extra money that flows into organizing higher income and higher net worth customers so that when the next wave of mass pessimism washes through, your business will be on higher, safer ground.
 A collection of Gallup, The Wall Street Journal, and other surveys and polls that I re-examined when writing the new edition of this book revealed something most instructive about consumer attitudes from 2004, good times, to and through the crash of 2008, through the slowest recovery in history, to the present boom: the greatest fluctuations, the most erratic moves from pessimism to optimism to pessimism occurred with middle- income consumers. Low-wage earners and the working poor stayed pretty steady, from pessimistic-only to barely-better-than-pessimistic through all those years until late 2016, when they began to show a significant lift of


-----

##### optimism. High-income and high-net-worth people also stayed pretty steady, never dipping much below optimistic and at times more optimistic. Those in the middle were most subject to big mood swings; to excess exuberance and to fear and despair. In short, the middle-income consumers are least reliable with willingness to buy.
 There is a very nice neighborhood to move your business into, where you can be welcomed by a growing number of consistently optimistic consumers with fat, open wallets. It is the affluent consumer population.
 This book is the roadmap. It gives you the insight, information, inspiration, and practical how-to directions for moving from selling to Joneses or Smiths to Barons and even Big Barons. For many, this is admittedly far from a simple thing. You don’t just flip a switch. Your own thinking and attitudes and self-image may need a lot of recalibration. You’ll need vision and courage. Your positioning, your products or services, your price strategies, your marketing and selling process, and your salespeople may have to change. But I’m here to argue this is no longer a choice. The luxury of time to procrastinate about this is gone. Death is imminent for huge numbers of businesses refusing to move up the consumer income and net worth pyramid. You must now, aggressively, adapt. Or die.
 The Amazon-ing of retail is but one of these compelling urgencies. It is all about converting consumers from making differential judgments by comparative expertise, experience, credibility, quality, and everything else that supports price or fee elasticity and profit to buying based on convenience, speed of delivery, and lowest price. This moves the middle- income consumers. Only particularly affluent consumers can be depended on for continuing discernment. The middle-income people will get their wills done by LegalZoom, play orthodontist at home with SmileDirectClub, and maybe even buy their car from a website and have it delivered. The affluent person will NOT have their estate plan done at LegalZoom. They will take their daughters and sons to orthodontists. They will patronize the high-end, full-service luxury auto dealership or possibly even use a broker of exotic and luxury autos. This separation of behavior is occurring at a fast pace, so you getting on the right side of it must also happen at a fast pace.
 Also, inevitably, a stall, a stagnation, an episode of runaway inflation, a hefty stock market drop—as likely precipitated by meddling by the Federal Reserve as by anything else, or a variety of other kinds of economic winters


-----

##### will occur. People made “soft” by as big a boom as is occurring as I write this may react more badly to it than they did to 2008. Consumers greatly overextended on credit may have no choice but to stop all optional spending. This may be as much as seven to even ten years away. But it may not. It could occur gradually. It could arrive abruptly.

 Your Choice Ultimately, business owners have one of two attitudinal, behavioral, and leadership styles, choosing either complacency or urgency.
 Those who tend toward complacency are often late to see, predict, and act. Of big brand-name companies ruined, at least in large part by such management, you can list Borders, Sears, JCPenney, and General Motors. The entertainment industry’s ravaging by the #MeToo movement reveals a systemic complacency about a known problem. Facebook’s explosion of crises is the result of systemic complacency and, in concert, arrogance about known problems. Huge entities sometimes take a long time to bleed out and die from their wounds often self-inflicted by complacency. Small and mid-sized companies often move from leadership complacency to crisis to extinction much faster.
 Those who lean toward perpetual urgency, exhibiting a strong bias for decisive action, for proactivity rather than reaction, are often either advantageously early or at least on time. Instead of arrogance, these leaders live by healthy, motivational paranoia. They are never coasting, always innovating. My favorite big companies with CEO’s and other leadership on this list are Disney, Apple, Amazon, Cleveland Clinic, and many of my own clients, not with famous names, but with entrepreneurs making fortunes. These are companies and people who can walk and chew gum at the same time. They can execute on a current game plan, implement a future-oriented collection of next game plans, and envision and begin development of even more distant creative changes simultaneously. They act with urgency about both. Now and Next. If you examine the companies I just named, you will find a commonality of at least the past ten years and their present activities: an emphasis on being for and doing business with affluent consumers as a bigger and bigger part of their businesses.

##### My friend, the late, great Zig Ziglar, often told the “cooked in the squat” story: a frog thrown into a pot of boiling hot water will immediately leap right back out. But a frog placed in a pan of pleasingly cool water will stay put. He will continue to stay put as the heat is ever so slowly inched up, until the dumb frog is cooked in the squat. That’s what has happened to many small-business operators as well as big retail and restaurant chains and entire categories of businesses. The fundamental, adverse trends of middle-income consumers have worsened slowly, gradually, and these business owners have sat there, getting cooked in the squat. They are getting ever closer to a boiling point. Some even know and are splashing around trying to cool the water by blowing on it. Others are surrendering. CEOs running out the clock on their own careers, retiring, taking golden parachute treasure, and slinking away into the night.
 Don’t emulate any of these dumb frogs. Use your big, long legs. Now.

#### CHAPTER 2

### Who ARE These People, Anyway?

##### “With money in your pocket you are wise, you are handsome, and
 you sing well, too.”

—YIDDISH PROVERB

# I have always wondered about the monkeys on monkey islands in our
##### zoos. As we stand there looking at them, amused at their funny expressions and antics, are they entertained by looking at us in our funny clothes? Are the monkeys asking themselves, Who are these goofy creatures, anyway? I do know, from numerous conversations with my clients, that the rich are strange and odd and incomprehensible, that figuring out what motivates their behavior is as difficult as figuring out why the monkeys act as they do.


-----

##### While we’ll never need to decipher the monkeys’ thoughts and actions, we do need to decode the rich.
 We can begin by organizing the population itself. Throughout this book, I’m going to subdivide the affluent population many different ways:

 • Ultra-Affluent
 • Affluent
 • Mass-affluent

 … and specialty market groups, like

 • Affluent Boomers and Mass-Affluent Boomers
 • Affluent LGBTQ
 • Affluent Entrepreneurs and Business Owners

 … and then by gender, women and men. These divided groups meet, converge, and also act separately. It is up to you to ultimately develop your own carefully defined target group within the affluent population that is ideally matched with your products, services, even your own personality.
 Let’s begin with some basic definitions.

 •  Mass-Affluent. The income markers of this group have been raised
 since earlier editions of this book, reflecting the happy fact that, starting in about 2013, and dramatically accelerating now, all incomes —even those of the decimated ranks of the middle class—are rising. Most credible research sources, including the Federal Reserve, the Economic Policy Institute, and Ipsos, note sizeable hikes in median income. In earlier editions, I pegged the mass-affluent as having household incomes of $85,000.00 to $150,000.00 and/or a net worth exceeding $250,000.00.
 While the incomes of this group have shifted only slightly upward, the net worth is now above $350,000.00 and still rising.
 Another way to think of the mass-affluent is “upper middle class.” A mass-affluent consumer may shop at Kohl’s but also at Macy’s and sometimes at Nordstrom’s, probably shops at a main supermarket but


-----

##### is also very likely to selectively shop at Whole Foods. (Bezos strikes again!) These are the customers Buick aims at with their “surprised that’s a Buick” TV commercials, GEICO wants to sell insurance to, and E*Trade wants to get involved in stock market investing. The current mass-affluent class is the most demographically diverse in American history, by age range, ethnicity, occupations, and geography.
 There is upward mobility, too. According to Spectrum Group’s Market Insights Report of 2017, there are 31 million mass-affluent households, an increase of 500,000 from 2016.
 •  Affluent. These income and net-worth markers have also risen. In
 earlier editions, I put those with household incomes of $150,000.00 to $250,000.00 and/or a net worth, including primary and additional residences’ equity, exceeding $1 million in this category. According to Ipsos Connect, Fall 2016, 23% of the country had risen to a household income exceeding $125,000.00. Commonly held assets like 401(k) plan investments and real estate are also significantly higher in value.
 There is dramatic upward mobility here. According to Wealth Engine, the number of millionaires has doubled from 2008 to 2017, to a record high number exceeding 16 million. Millionaire status is more common than it has ever been before.
 I again adjust this category’s income levels up, in this case with slightly more and faster growth than the mass-affluent group’s, to $200,000.00 to $400,000.00, but their net worth by an even greater boost to $2 million and up, in large part by the simple fact that they are more invested in the first place.
 It is within the Mass-Affluent in move-up mode and the Affluent categories that we find what some demographers have taken to calling “middle-class millionaires.” They are of a very particular mindset, which we’ll be talking about at length.
 In total, the combined wealth held by the world’s millionaires increased for the sixth consecutive year in 2018, topping $70 trillion for the first time. There is more spendable and investable money in these hands than ever before.


-----

##### • Ultra-Affluent. Again, some increases here. Earlier, I had them with
 household incomes of $250,000.00 and up and/or a net worth of $3 million to $10 million. Their average household income is, as of 2017, $295,845.00, and, while the net worth still bottoms at $2.7 million, the average is $5.4 millon, and the top is past $10 million to $12 million. Here is where we find the top 10% of U.S. households in net worth. According to the Federal Reserve Survey, there are more than 5 million households in this category.
 This group controls 46% of U.S. wealth, 55% are men, and 45% are women—the financial gaps seen in the lower groups abate here. Fifty-eight percent are Democrats, sometimes called “limousine liberals;” only 38% are Republicans; 3% own boats, 1% own private planes, but nearly 10% fly private. The age of 55+ that has historically dominated here is slipping, as there is a rising number arriving at 45, with 18% of the total in the 45-to-55 bracket. They, of course, tend to be college educated. Nearly all own their primary residence and nearly half own a second residence and other real estate holdings.
 There is an ultra, ultra-affluent subset: the top 5%, with average annual incomes exceeding $350,000.00, snaring 22% of all earned income. Their net-worth range reaches from $10 million to $25 million. Their number grew by 84,000 in just the two years from 2016 to 2018, topping 1.3 million households. Above them are the much- politicized 1%, with an average income exceeding $1.2 million and with a net worth above $25 million to $100 million and much more. This group’s size grew by about 10% in the U.S. in 2016-2018. They captured about 10% of all the income growth. Average age is 57 and 70% are men. Here, the gender gap widens.
 Each year they report spending $30,000.00+ on wine and alcoholic beverages, $150,000.00+ at hotels and resorts, $115,000.00+ on clothes and accessories, $250,000.00+ on jewelry, $500,000.00+ on home improvements and furnishings, and they have multiple residences. As a practical matter, their spending power is unlimited. Their ranks include Fortune 1000 CEOs, Hollywood celebrities, executives, and professional athletes, but more than half are not famous or in exotic occupations or businesses but are, instead,


-----

##### “the millionaire next door” who has moved up. Many have built up and sold businesses or taken their businesses public, creating lump- sum wealth.
 • Affluent Boomers. You’ll find a chapter devoted exclusively to this,
 pardon the pun, booming group actively exploring and even inventing an entirely new approach to retirement and Act 3 and Act 4 of life— and funding it with an unprecedented amount of spending power. The comprehensive resource on this is a separate book, No B.S. Guide to Marketing to Leading-Edge Boomers and Seniors. Also, a related book is No B.S. Guide to Trust-Based Marketing.

 With all of this, the trend since my earlier editions of this book is more moving up, and the spending power of each group increasing. Bloomberg put it this way:

 With $25 million, maybe, just maybe you are starting to be rich. Call it “economy class rich.” Business class rich? $100 million. First class? $200 million Private jet rich? Try $1 billion. That’s how the various levels of wealth are viewed by the world of high finance.

 These groups, and other affluent groups, offer opportunity to marketers as unprecedented as is their prosperity, spending power, and attitudes about spending. In the chapters to come, you will explore the mechanics of exploiting these opportunities.
 Outside the U.S., in various parts of the globe, there is explosive growth of middle-class consumer populations somewhat mimicking our post-WWII boom, as well as explosive growth of affluent and ultra-affluent consumer populations. Their ability to spend tracks the U.S. groups, but their willingness to spend is more voracious, as these levels of affluence are still relatively new to them. Most luxury goods companies have, in recent years, seen more sales growth opportunities overseas than within the U.S. The U.S., Japan, Germany, and China are home to the most millionaires; a combined 61%.
 As 80% of my readers are with me in the U.S., I’ve predominately described U.S. market conditions; however, the marketing strategies that

#### CHAPTER 3

### The Ultra-Rich: Different from You and Me

##### F. Scott Fitzgerald: “The very rich are different from you and me.”
 Ernest Hemingway: “Yes, they have more money.”

—DOCUMENTED EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE FAMOUS AUTHORS, FROM MARK MY

_WORDS, COMPILED BY NIGEL REES_

# We are endlessly fascinated with the strange ultra-rich. Fitzgerald’s
##### 1925 novel was made into a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the enigmatic Gatsby. For years, a popular TV show, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, aired. Today’s cable networks are well populated with “reality” shows featuring the homes and “cribs,” cars, and lives of the super wealthy.
 A client of mine, a niche gun manufacturer, told me about a guy contacting him directly, identifying himself as a huge fan of this particular gun—the Hand Cannon (www.BondArms.com)—which sells for $400.00 to $1,200.00. The fellow bought half a dozen, had them delivered to his engraver, and spent over $5,000.00 having each one custom engraved for family and friends. The customer has, for years, been a member of the Forbes 400. But there are a whole lot more than 400 of these ultra-rich, price-no-object consumers. More like 6 million, with another 15 million or so running around just a step or two beneath them, striving to climb up, and often spending as if they were already there.
 The Forbes 400 list, compiled and published annually by Forbes magazine, is a microcosmic look at the ultra-rich. In 2007, the first year that admission required a net worth of at least a billion dollars, many former multimillionaires dropped from the list. In the book All the Money in the World, authors and researchers Peter Bernstein and Annalyn Swan provide a terrific in-depth analysis of the earning and spending of these wealthiest people in the world. I recommend the book for those seriously interested in


-----

##### understanding and marketing to the ultra-rich. Here, I’ll give you a thumb- sized overview of what they found out, as well as my own observations.
 First of all, you should be interested in who is on this list. There are many names you know, like Oprah, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and the omnipresent modern-day Barnum, Donald Trump—of whom I am a fan. I have appeared as a speaker on programs and spent some interesting “quality time” with him backstage, and I, in print, predicted his winning of the presidency beginning the day of his announcement, descended by the gleaming gold escalators from On High. Since becoming President, Trump he has fallen some positions down on this list but still holds a spot above 200.

 Higher Education Predicts Affluence—But There Are Plenty Who Defy
 the Norms You might find a variety of statistics interesting and, in some instances, useful. These are from one year of the Forbes 400 list. In the particular year I analyzed for this chapter, 2018, 241 of the 400 basically made their fortunes from scratch, and another 36 made a large portion of their money even if also inheriting some wealth. Translation: 71% of the ultra-rich got there through ambition, initiative, drive, grit, ingenuity, hard work, and entrepreneurship. Their wealth has not separated them from those values. Only 116 of the 400 inherited their fortunes. Thinking of the ultra-rich as a silver-spoon-in-mouth crowd born of the lucky sperm club would be a serious mistake. This is not who they are, and it is definitely not how they think of themselves.


### Dan Kennedy’s #1 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Make all your marketing to the affluent mirror the way they see and
 think about themselves.


-----

##### Forty-one of the 400 attended Harvard; 27, Stanford; 10, Yale; and 2, Princeton—a total of 51 from the top-rated, most prestigious universities. It is worth noting however, that a higher percentage of the ultra-rich attended run-of-the-mill universities or did not attend college at all. Mythology about college education as requisite for any success above serving lattes at Starbucks persists now, even as a college debt bubble that is bigger than the mortgage bubble that burst in 2008 grows, past $1.3 trillion. Further, while college enrollments have climbed from 47% in 1973, the year I graduated from high school and did not go to college, to 69.7% now, college graduation rates have stayed the same—62%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. So, while more are going, more are dropping out. Imagine what that statistic will look like if we make college free for all. Got lousy grades, no work ethic, no ambition? Here’s a free ride at Harvard. Have fun.
 That kind of talk—the criticism of the free-college plans I just provided —really resonates with the ultra-rich, by the way. They deeply resent the popular but erroneous idea that they got their money through inheritance or luck, and they bear even greater resentment for and disapproval of handouts and freebies provided to others. Fundamentally, the more affluent a person is by his own making, the more vehemently opposed he is to handouts to anyone under any circumstances, except severe tragedy, such as volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, floods, and fires.
 A wonderful example of talking to this audience in a way that resonates —what I teach as “marketing by values”—is shown off in the little article reprinted at the end of this chapter, by a client of mine, Ted Oakley (www.OxbowAdvisors.com), a wealth manager specializing in entrepreneur/business owner and retired entrepreneur clients with assets from $10 million to $50 million. This “article” sometimes appears as the second page of a two-page lead generation advertisement, offering free copies of his book, $20 Million and Broke, but it is also used as a standalone item in different information packages sent to clients and in web media. It perfectly syncs with the thinking of his avatar client, from affluent to ultra-affluent.

 Married, with Children


-----

##### The ultra-rich are a marrying bunch. Only 14 of the Forbes 400 list I analyzed have never been married. Thirty-one have been divorced at least once, but 281 are married, the majority to their first spouses—a significantly better percentage than the general population. Cynics would say that has something to do with the high price of divorce. Golfer Greg Norman’s divorce was reported to cost more than $200 million, and he wasn’t even on the Forbes list! When asked by Johnny Carson why Arnold Schwarzenegger was rich and he was not, Burt Reynolds answered: “number of wives.” Still, as many, including former General Electric captain Jack Welch, have observed, the reason divorce is so expensive is it’s worth it. My own affluence was wounded significantly by divorce, helped by remarrying the same wife. Finally, I got to marry rich.

 Age and Affluence Still Go Together The age of the ultra-rich skews mature, as you’d expect, but it does span wide. The oldest of the Forbes 400 members in 2018 was 95 and the youngest was 31. Average: 69. If you step away from the top of the pyramid, the Forbes 400, and look at the broader affluent population, you will still see age skew senior, pointing the ambitious marketer to the affluent toward affluent Boomers.
 There are many reasons for this marriage of affluence to age. One is that simple high income does not equal wealth; equity does, and that usually takes time to accumulate. There’s also a profound difference between making money and holding onto it. Wealthy entrepreneurs tend to have won and lost one or more times before proving able to hold onto their gains. Information, knowledge, and capability can be acquired rather quickly, but wisdom cannot.

 WHERE Are the Rich? There is geographic concentration. And there is migration. Only a handful of years ago, more than 20% lived in California and nearly as many in New York. In 2018, out of the Forbes 400, only 28 have their primary residence in California, and 24 in New York. As cities and states like New York and California ever more greedily tax-target the rich, more and more leave. Limbaugh famously exited New York for Florida, Glenn Beck for


-----

##### Texas, both low-tax states. Hollywood stars have fled Los Angeles in favor of places like Wyoming. Low-tax states like Florida and Texas have 16 from this list and are winning the competition for the relocation of the ultra- affluent. This is a factor in Google’s locating a large facility outside Silicon Valley, in Oklahoma. And in expanding there in 2012, again in 2015, and yet again in 2018. For a time, the Oklahoma Department of Commerce and its economic development arm, then led by Secretary of Commerce Larry Parman, was a client of mine. Its marketing targeted California and New York.
 The top ten counties where the richest people in America are concentrated are listed here, along with the average annual income of the one percenters in each place:

 Teton, Wyoming $28 million

 New York, New York $8 million

 Fairfield, Connecticut $6 million

 La Salle, Texas $6 million

 Pitkin, Colorado $5.2 million

 McKenzie, North Dakota $4.7 million

 Shackelford, Texas $4.5 million

 Westchester, New York $4.3 million

 Collier, Florida $4 million

 Union, South Dakota $4 million

 The top ten states for lowly millionaires and up (not just the ultra-rich) are:

|Shackelford, Texas|$4.5 million|
|Westchester, New York|$4.3 million|
|Collier, Florida|$4 million|
|Union, South Dakota|$4 million|

##### California, still #1 and New York, still #2, Texas #3, Florida #4 nipping at the old guard’s heels, New Jersey #5, Massachusetts #6, Virginia #7, Washington #8, Illinois #9, and Maryland #10.

 The top four ZIP codes for wealth are:

 Miami Beach, Florida 33109, Atherton, California 94027, Portola, California 94028, and Fremont, California 94539.

 If you market nationally, not locally, it is vitally important to stay on top of the relocation, movement, and concentrated “geo-pockets” of wealth so you can direct your mail, place your print ads, and otherwise focus your marketing there—and omit places wealth has left or is leaving. If you are going to open additional stores, sales offices, clinics, etc., this information is critical to making good choices so you plant where wealth is growing. This is fluid, and books are cemented in a moment in time. An outstanding book about the geographic movement of business, markets, money, and wealth is The Fate of the States: The New Geography of Prosperity by Meredith Whitney, but it is years old. One of the newsletters I contribute to, an extension of this book, The No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent Letter, stays on top of this, and can be obtained by Diamond Membership at www.NoBSInnerCircle.com.
 The top ten on the 400 list the year I analyzed (2018): #1 is Jeff Bezos, and just ten years ago he was not even in the top ten. In 2017–2018, his fortune grew by nearly $40 billion, the biggest 12-month gain ever. #2: Bill Gates. The gap between #1 and #2 is the biggest since 2001. #3, Warren Buffett. #4, Bernard Arnault, the richest man in Europe. #5, Mark Zuckerberg. #6, Amancio Ortega, the wealthiest retailer in the world. #7, Carlos Slim, the richest man in Mexico. #8 and #9, Charles Koch and David Koch, oil men. #10, Larry Ellison, cofounder of the software firm Oracle.
 Of interest is the diversity of industries and fields of enterprise. Basically the top dog or couple of top dogs of each field—tech, retail, energy, fashion, etc.—holds a top place on this list. This is one of many demonstrations of the pyramidal nature of achievement and accomplishment, of income and of wealth. Tech has more here than any other category, although pigeon-holing Amazon in that group or any other


-----

##### single category is illusory. In tech, I believe Zuckerberg is the most likely candidate for a huge fall, as Facebook is, as of this writing, a severely troubled business, under rising regulatory scrutiny and skepticism in the U.S. and abroad, embroiled in frequent disclosures of concealed data mining and insecurity of data, and being evermore exposed as a deliberately engineered addictive “substance.” For several years, I have been writing about it as a close cousin of the tobacco companies and of opioid drug makers, and I predict Facebook, Zuckerberg, and more of its top executives facing the same public crucifying, gigantic fines, endless litigation, forced use of warning labeling, and restrictions on advertising that the cigarette companies went through. The most concise book mirroring my cautions about using Facebook is: Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now by Jaron Lanier. I also stridently caution marketers and advertisers against being reliant on Facebook, and I advise investors to leave it out or get it out of their portfolios. I see a very abrupt and sudden ruin of its use as marketing media and/or collapse of its value as very probable.
 Following are some of the most interesting Forbes 400 members from the same year’s roster:

 Dietrich Mateschitz ($23 billion). A marketing executive, then cofounder of the Red Bull energy drink business—when there was no existing market for energy drinks. He aggressively invested in media, sports sponsorships, and publicity, linking it to extreme feats. Over six billion cans of Red Bull are sold every year worldwide, and he still holds onto the biggest market share in a now crowded, competitive field.

 Leonard Lauder ($12.9 billion). Grandson of beauty entrepreneur Estée Lauder, who started her face creams business in 1946, whipping up potions in a kitchen sink. She is widely credited with inventing the gift-with- purchase strategy commonly used in the cosmetic industry but having much wider application, including selling just about anything to the affluent. The leveraging of commodity consumer products to ultra-wealth is not at all unique, and there are other billionaires on the list at least in part by this strategy.


-----

##### Leslie Wexner ($6.1 billion) is an Ohio State dropout who started his first women’s clothing store with $5,000.00 borrowed from his aunt. His retail creations include Bath & Body Works® and Victoria’s Secret®. Victoria’s Secret is, incidentally, a clever marketing construct, a re-imagination of long-reigning then dethroned leader, Frederick’s of Hollywood®.

 Jack Ma ($39 billion). He rode his bike 40 miles every day to a hotel so he could practice his English by conversing with English-speaking tourists— every day for eight years, regardless of the weather. He met one rejection after another, including twice failing his college entrance exams and once being turned down for a job at a Kentucky Fried Chicken. It’s worth noting that this is a life experience theme of a majority of from-scratch affluent, and it’s important to acknowledge and respect when selling to them. They love telling their stories of facing and overcoming adversity. Despite knowing nothing about computers, Ma became interested in the internet and, in 1999, started an ecommerce company working out of his apartment, with 18 friends and $60,000 in capital put together by them all. Today, his Alibaba is the Amazon of Asia, publicly traded, and fast developing a network of major league partners including Disney.

 Sheldon Adelson ($38.5 billion). The son of immigrants from Lithuania, he grew up sleeping on the floor of a Boston tenement apartment. At age 12, he borrowed $200 from his uncle to purchase a newspaper route and at age 16, he started a candy vending business. He has created almost 50 businesses in his lifetime and owns 50% of the largest casino company in America, Las Vegas Sands. By age 30 he had made and lost two fortunes, another common life theme with the rich.

 Zhou Qunfei ($7.8 billion). The richest self-made woman entrepreneur in the world. A high school dropout, itinerant factory worker, she started her first company—a watch lens manufacturer—in her three-bedroom apartment. Her interests now include Lens Technology, a smartphone screen supplier to Apple and Samsung. The company has 82,000 employees.

 Phil Knight ($29.6 billion). Founder of Nike. He began selling athletic shoes out of the trunk of his car.


-----

##### Marian Illitch ($5.2 billion). Investing their life’s savings, she and her late husband Michael opened the first Little Caesars pizza shop in 1959, after an injury ended Michael’s pro baseball career. They built up a 40-store chain in ten years, then turned to more aggressive expansion, modeling Ray Kroc’s McDonald’s® franchising model. She also owns the NHL Detroit Red Wings and Motor City Casino.

 Rich DeVos ($5.4 billion). Rich just passed away in 2018. He and his high school buddy created Amway™, after several business failures and a stint in another multilevel marketing company that Amway later acquired. The company started bottling its lone product, an all-purpose liquid cleaner, in a garage in 1959. Its system of distributors recruiting distributors has led to more than three million of them worldwide generating over $6 billion in yearly sales. Rich also founded the NBA team the Orlando Magic. And a whole lot of Amway’s hometown, Ada, Michigan. I cut my teeth as a young’un in the Amway business and have both a nostalgic fondness for and a deep understanding of the person-to-person selling method as a result. This method of distribution remains viable and healthy today, including with mass-affluent customers. A significant part of the NO B.S. INNER CIRCLE membership organization business model that I developed borrows heavily from Amway.
 By the way, Rich DeVos’ autobiography, Simply Rich: Life and Lessons from the Cofounder of Amway: A Memoir, is an extraordinary book well worth reading for its entrepreneurial and life lessons, but also as an instructive window into the personality, philosophy, and thinking of a made- from-scratch ultra-rich business, family, and civic leader.

 President Donald Trump ($3.1 billion) is the first billionaire president, with a fortune initially built by real estate deals and investments, then brand licensing fueled by the TV shows The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice.

 What so many of these Forbes 400 members share in common is the startup of a small business, expansion of that business, then leveraging the wealth created to that point into diversified investments as well as multiplying the core business or brand through one or more means, such as franchising or licensing. These ultra-rich wind up with a unique mindset


-----

##### also held in common from this experience. Among other things, they are methodical. They view everything through the prism of process. They are also deeply suspicious of anyone or anything not symbolic of hard work and methodical development. If you set out to sell them, as example, an exotic safari or fishing trip, the story of your background and how you made yourself into the reigning expert on such travel and the extent of the research, planning, and preparation invested in designing and delivering the experience is essential and carries more influence than the most persuasive description of the trip and its amenities. This same principle applies to whatever you might sell to the ultra-rich with this startup background.
 There are only 56 women on the 400 list, although there are a record high of 256 women billionaires. Generally speaking, ultra-rich women still tend to amass their wealth through marriage, divorce, and inheritance. The top ten women on the 400 list did so. Diane Hendricks is one of the exceptions: the wealthiest self-made woman entrepreneur in America.

 In many respects, the ultra-rich have the very same concerns and buying motivations as the more ordinary affluent. They are pressed for time and eager for efficiency, competence, and convenience to be provided to them— and they’re very willing to pay for it. Other than those intangibles, they have few if any needs. As a matter of fact, even income is pretty much irrelevant to them; they have risen to the point of concern only with net worth. They worry about loss—of money, power, status, or security. They seek approval, recognition, respect—some only from peers, others from the world at large, all from those they conduct business with.

 What’s Gone Horribly Wrong in Estate Planning?

##### By Ted Oakley


-----

### In the estate planning area, most professionals have spent countless
##### hours in the planning and implementation of various models. With each new set of laws come a different approach and an ongoing dynamic of adjustments to stay current. The professional community has generally done an excellent job of staying abreast of changes—and of implementing and adjusting estate plans. But have many of us overlooked the most important part of the process? In short, it is the transfer of hard-earned wealth to future generations. All the planning in the world is of little value if future generations don’t understand wealth and assets or know how to effectively handle them.

 Over the years in our role as financial advisors, we have witnessed untold numbers of inheritors who had very little knowledge of or appreciation for wealth. In the course of their being in charge of the new wealth, errors in investment and judgment have frequently devastated, if not destroyed, the inheritance. This inevitably brings questions to the forefront. What are we trying to accomplish with all the sophisticated methods of estate planning? Ostensibly the end result is to transfer wealth in an orderly and tax-efficient way. But there is a huge missing component in this process. That missing piece is the education and nurture of future generations on how to first appreciate, then manage, wealth.

 In working with third- and fourth-generation families, we find it is often eye-opening to see how few really understand why and how all of this works. But in many cases it is too late for education as the die has been cast. This process of instilling what future generations need must be started at a young age and carried through with deliberation. It’s not an easy thing to do because wealth itself makes many things easier. But “easier” is seldom the best medicine for future generations.

 1. Start early. It is never too early to map out what you want to teach
 your children. But you have to spend the time. Teach them how the value of their life today came about. Teach them how their mother and father and/or grandparents spent 12-hour days and endless nights of hard work to accomplish their goals. Help them


-----

##### understand the history of what it took to make a business successful and what goes into the success mentality. Show them from an early age that all this hasn’t come without a price, and we as a family are responsible to be good stewards of the wealth. The hardest part is to train the children as if they didn’t have wealth in order for them to eventually appreciate it. There is a natural tendency to want to make life easier for our children, but in many ways that is counterproductive.

 2. Learn to work. Teaching future generations how to work and how to
 appreciate the dignity of work are vitally important to the overall objective of estate planning. Learning to work does a great deal for the character of young people. They first of all understand that everything doesn’t come on a silver platter. They learn responsibility and, most importantly, they gain self-esteem from knowing within themselves that they can have a sense of accomplishment through work. They and their parents spend too much time, effort, and money trying to gain something that, through proper guidance and experience, largely comes from within.

 3. Be consistent. If you want future generations to understand and
 respect your values, you have to be consistent. Telling them one thing and then acting out in a different way (one definition of hypocrisy) is disastrous. If you tell your children about a particular consequence, then stay with it! You are in the process of what normally amounts to a 16- to 18-year training class with each child.

 4. Go slowly with the money. Lavishing everything on a child at an
 early age may be tempting, but it goes a long way toward defeating the estate transfer process. When offspring get pretty much everything they want anytime they want it, they tend to develop a mindset—a mindset that is hard to change 30 or 40 years later when the time has come for them to be responsible for inherited wealth. By going slowly and expecting them to understand that wealth is not to be taken for granted, you give them better tools to deal with what you will be passing on.


-----

##### 5. Teach the legacy. The most important part of your legacy and your
 children’s legacy is spending many hours teaching them how this all came about. This business, this lifestyle, came about because somebody did something. Instill in the future generation a knowledge of and respect for their forebears who did those things; explain how they did them; infuse a reverence for the sacrifices of those who went before. Teach your children about the risks the previous generations took and how that transformed into what the family has today. Wealth didn’t “just happen”—and they need to know the story behind their inheritance, which is a sacred trust.

 No matter how many wills, trusts, and transfers you do, they won’t go very far or last very long if the inheritors don’t appreciate what went into creating them. Instill in your children core values and a sense of responsibility, and you give them a huge advantage. You also greatly enhance the chances of the money being used wisely, even philanthropically.

### The Question Freud Couldn’t Answer

##### “No rich man is ugly.”

—ZSA ZSA GABOR

# It is no secret that, as the old saying goes, “women control the purse
##### strings.” That once meant that the men brought home the paychecks and their wives spent the money. No longer. Many affluent households are wealthy thanks to both spouses’ careers providing excellent incomes. Consequently, women have control over spending and investments based not only on the marriage but on equal—or in some cases, greater—financial contribution to it. This has erased old, traditional divisions and delegation of spending.


-----

##### Surveys from the financial services industry from the 1970s, for example, showed that the married women in more than 80% of affluent households had nominal or no involvement in the investment decisions. Fast forward to 2017, and more than 80% of married affluent women make financial decisions jointly. Of those with one making financial decisions, it’s now split almost evenly: 7.9% of these households have the man in charge of the money and 8.3% have the woman in charge. These facts must be heard by marketers to the affluent. Buying decisions once thought of as gender specific no longer are. The interest in one thing or another may be held only or principally by either the husband or the wife, but the decision releasing the money for the purchase won’t be in 80% of the households.* Make a BIG note.
 In the TV show Mad Men, about the advertising world in the 1950s, we see young women going to work for the express purpose of finding a man and getting married—they the unlucky ones who weren’t able to go directly to marriage without a tour around the game board. That was then. This is now. The institution of marriage itself has fallen on hard times and disrepute. As a career goal, out the window. The year 2007 marked the first time there were as many single women as married women in the United States, with no sign of that trend reversing.
 Beginning in 2005, single women became the second-largest group of home buyers, right behind married couples. They do not stay in apartments until they find husbands and get married. Single women buy nearly twice as many homes as single men. Yet when have you seen any real estate advertising specifically aimed at single women? Comparable examples can be found in numerous other product and service categories, where marketers and marketing have not caught up with and are ignoring opportunities in current reality.
 Some single women are single for the traditional reason—not yet (or ever) finding the right man. But there is a growing population of what demographic analysts call the “willfully unmarried,” who consciously and deliberately choose to stay single. Among the willfully unmarried women are two groups of special interest to us: the particularly affluent single women and the affluent boomer single women. In these two groups, and particularly in a group composed of overlap from the two, we find untold spending power, controlled by women who are buying their own homes,


-----

##### doing their own investing, planning and funding their own retirements, planning their own vacations, and so on—for life. These women are permanent heads of households, and can and should be marketed to as such, and hardly anybody is. In fact, my files are lacking any good examples of advertising or marketing specific to this to show you!

 Late-in-Life Divorce as a Spending Event Among U.S. adults aged 50 and older, the divorce rate has doubled since the 1990s. The majority of the divorces that occur after 20 to 25 years of marriage are instigated by the wives, not the husbands. Far from grieving quietly, many of these women quickly re-enter the dating and next-husband- hunting game, find it highly competitive, populated by an insufficient quantity of men, and full of older men seeking younger women. Consequently, a number of self-improvement investments occur within 6 to 12 months of divorce: cosmetic surgery, cosmetic dentistry, weight loss products, new and younger-looking wardrobe, new and younger-looking car. I have several clients who deliberately market to this timing sweet spot, using information compiled from public records combined with other, commercially available, rented mailing lists (see Chapter 23). In short, affluent women age 45 through 60, divorcing after long marriages, tend to go on personal spending binges and be exceptionally susceptible to certain kinds of product and service offers about four to six months post-divorce. Those identified as affluent or, in a way, newly affluent based on their own income no longer shared, alimony, or having secured the principal residence in the divorce, are the biggest spenders.

 Stigmas Gone Cosmetic surgery—derogatively called plastic surgery for years—was once almost exclusively for affluent women, or actresses and models. And it was not openly discussed. Today, its popularity spans age ranges from shockingly young to surprisingly old, from mass-affluent to ultra-affluent. And not only is it openly discussed, but it is something of a status symbol. And discussed in ways that might make many people blush. For example, according to a study published in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal, 81% of breast surgery patients and 68% of other body surgery patients reported


-----

##### improvements in sexual satisfaction. More than 50% of these patients said they were able to achieve orgasm more easily following their surgery. And 56% also noted increases in their partners’ sexual interest and satisfaction following the surgery. You may rest assured that the profession is using this information in its marketing.
 This change in attitudes toward cosmetic surgery is representative of comparable changes in attitudes about just about everything, including but not limited to sexuality. Men, take a stroll through the Self-Help, Psychology, Health, and Relationship aisles at your nearest major bookstore (where most men never tread) or pick up and read copies of Cosmopolitan as well as the historically more staid Redbook. You’ll probably be very surprised to discover the discussions going on.
 What’s most important about all this, from a marketing standpoint, is the willingness of women to confront every imaginable health, beauty, aging, and lifestyle issue head-on, and the willingness of affluent women to spend almost without limitation on themselves, their physical and emotional well-being. Marti Barletta, billing herself “the world’s foremost expert on today’s mightiest market: women,” refers to women age 50 to 70 as “prime time women,” in the prime time of spending. A quick list from her research appears at the end of this chapter. Her book, Marketing to Prime Time Women: Convert and Keep Boomer Big Spenders, provides considerably more depth, and you can also access her information at www.MartiBarletta.com.

 It Isn’t Simple As an example of the complexity required for success in marketing to affluent women, consider the financial services field.
 In their book Marketing to the Mindset of Boomers and Their Elders, Carol Morgan and Doran Levy accuse financial services and investment firms of “conjuring up differences where none exist” in advertising, marketing, and selling to affluent women (investable assets, $500,000.00+) and mass-affluent women (investable assets, $100,000.00+) making their own investment decisions. Assumptions are made by many investment marketers that echo one enunciated by the head of a Charles Schwab initiative aimed at women that “women feel differently and learn differently


-----

##### about investing” so there’s a need to “speak to women in terms relevant to their lives and in language that’s appealing to them.” But in one of her columns, the popular financial writer Jane Bryant Quinn expressed her distaste for financial advertising treating women as “a breed apart.” Quinn describes this advertising as “condescending”—“Who,” she asks, “besides women are told thy need help because they are emotionally impaired?” Quinn cites market research studies confirming that there is no difference in investment patterns by gender.
 So who’s right? I would suggest they are both right and wrong. First of all, lumping the mass-affluent and affluent women together is a serious mistake. Women with $500,000.00 and up to invest have, for the most part, been more involved with their wealth for a longer period of time. They also have, as a practical matter, access to a different level of financial advisor and choices of investment-related services. They are less likely to be paying attention to Suze Orman and Money magazine and more likely to be reading The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and Worth than their mass- affluent counterparts. In fact, the affluent women should be separated into experience categories, such as Savvy Investors vs. Financial Uninvolveds, and then talked to quite differently. This is a distinct difference of greater significance than the affluent vs. mass-affluent tag.
 Some years back, I did some marketing consulting work for the late Joan Rivers, the sharp-tongued comedienne turned super-successful jewelry, cosmetics, and fashion entrepreneur and on-air pitchperson at QVC. When Joan’s husband, Edgar, died, she had the shocking experience many Financial Uninvolved women have: confronting money management for the first time, under duress. She had left it all in his hands and wasn’t even sure how to balance a checkbook. Financially Uninvolveds who, for one reason or another—often the death or incapacity of their spouse—have significant investable assets to manage lack background knowledge and experience and therefore lack confidence. They are most likely to look for a single source of advice and assistance, be far more interested in safety and security than gain or yield, and be most motivated by trust. They will seek someone they can have confidence in, rather than work to have more confidence in their own judgment in these matters. Savvy Investor Women are more likely to collect and consider information from multiple sources,


-----

##### make at least some investment decisions independently, and have direct relationships with multiple vendors such as an online brokerage account, a stock broker, a financial planner, and one or more banks.
 This means: Savvy Investor Women will respond to information. Financially Uninvolved Women will respond to trust.
 This group is best segmented into four quadrants:

 1. Financially Uninvolved, Mass-Affluent 2. Financially Uninvolved, Affluent 3. Savvy Investor, Mass-Affluent 4. Savvy Investor, Affluent

 Second, Quinn is off-base in denying that gender differences affect perception of and responsiveness to advertising and overt marketing. I’m afraid she’s projecting her own attitudes onto all women. Georgette Geller- Petro, an executive with the financial services giant AXA Financial®, states, “Through feedback from our advisors who work with women, we have found that women’s financial goals, as well as how they articulate them, are different than those of men.”
 Gender difference matters. There are words and phrases—like one I use: women with balls—that instantly set many women’s teeth on edge and make them deaf to everything else said or written. I do a lot of advertising copywriting in weight loss, alternative health, and beauty categories, and I have to exercise extreme caution about “sounding male” or using instant- turn-off language. However, Quinn is right when she recoils at ad approaches or language that feels “condescending” to her. Women, especially career women, are hypersensitive to being talked down to, to not being given credit for their intelligence, knowledge, and experience. While the staunch feminist of the ’60s and ’70s seems to be a marginalized minority, there is still a profound difference in the way women respond to language, and the way different women respond to the same language.


### About Prime Time Women


-----

##### • Women in their 50s and 60s report these two decades are the
 happiest in their lives. “Prime Time” is as much a state of mind as a chronological age.

 • In peak years of household income, wealth and spending, they are
 more involved with or in charge of all spending than in earlier years.

 • They are not retiring young as a rule, and many continuing to work
 or returning to work have greater discretionary spending ability than at younger ages.

 • They add to their net worth substantially by inheritance—from
 parents and from husbands, as women tend to outlive men by 15 to 18 years. Relationships established with them as customers, clients, or patients can yield from their “surge spending” after such windfalls.

 • At 50 to 64, they are out-spending those 25-34:

 – 20% more on new cars

 – 30% more on dining out

 – 38% more on travel

 – 113% more on wine consumed at home

 – 250% more on housekeeping and yard services

 • They are a prime source of money for grandkids’ summer camp,
 activities, travel, college, first-time home buying (and need communicated with about such purchases).

 • They are the most generous group supporting charities.

 • 1 out of 5 adults in the U.S. is a woman over 50. (Census Bureau)

### Boys Will Be Boys, No Matter Their Age

##### “Man will do many things to get himself loved. He will do all things
 to get himself envied.”

—MARK TWAIN

# No man buys a Lamborghini to get to work.

##### There are Lamborghini automobiles priced from $250,000.00 to $5 million. Significantly, it is the “one off” cars like the Centenario, with a limited production of just 40 and a $2 million price tag, that sell out fastest and for which there is the longest waiting list. But the very fact that such a thing as a Lamborghini exists reveals something very, very important about men and selling to them, which is completely contrary to myth.


-----

##### Myth is that women are emotional, men are practical. Women buy with their hearts, men buy with their heads, with intellect and logic.
 The Lamborghini is designed and built to travel at speeds illegal on every road in the United States. How practical is that?
 Truth is, while women mature, men just get older. Arrested development.
 Another myth is that men are confident. It is my experience, from selling to, dealing with, and associating with hundreds and hundreds of millionaires, that successful men are anything but self-secure. Actually, they live with an underlying anxiety that no amount of wealth relieves. As a result, they spend a lot of money on symbolic validation of their success, status, and prosperity. For example, most men aren’t really clotheshorses. Symbolism aside, most I know could care less about Brooks Brothers® vs. Walmart® as the source of their khakis, sweaters, or socks. But affluent men actually train themselves to appreciate fashion quality and design distinctions, and choose certain purveyors, as a means of self-validation as well as a concern about judgments others will make about them based on their apparel.
 It doesn’t begin or end with clothes. This same buying for validation— buying what they are supposed to buy from vendors they are supposed to patronize—extends to almost every product and service category.

 Status
 While status is not male vs. female, men do seek and get it differently than women. For women, status is often a matter of association. For men, it is more a matter of competition and comparison.
 In an article in Psychology Today, Gregory Jantz, Ph.D., stated the obvious: “Most men are competitive.” He went on to observe that since the battlefield is not available to most, metaphorical battlefields are used to exert competitiveness: sports, betting on sports, marrying well, business and career, and purchased things—who has the hottest car, biggest boat, best located house, most interesting investments. He states that men have a “need for dominance” that underlies much or most of their consumer behavior. This means that a toaster is never just a toaster. Any purchase can and most purchases do relate to filling the need for dominance. The more


-----

##### affluence, the more ability there is to make buying choices driven by this, so the more important it is to advertise, market, and sell into it.
 This means the guy buying the 60-foot yacht may be doing so only because the others at his marina have 48-foot yachts. And, as a matter of fact, many yacht buyers freely admit their size choice was based on the sizes of their peers’ or marina neighbors’ yachts. A very expensive My ____________ is bigger than your __________. From the locker room to the boardroom.
 My highest-level Titanium Business Mastermind Group and my Private Client Group have no members earning less than $1 million a year. Most are in the $4 to $10 million neighborhood, and they are all in the same types of businesses. We have other mixed-breed coaching groups at No B.S. Inner Circle, such as the Peak Performers/Implementation Group led by Lee Milteer and Adam Witty (www.NoBSInnerCircle.com). In my groups, every year almost all are men, not by my design. None of these members have anything to prove, nor do they have an economic need for more money. Many find it difficult to motivate themselves. But they all compete fiercely within this group environment. They compete to bring the best business breakthrough or success report to each meeting. They compete to have the highest-grossing seminar or highest-grossing new product launch. They compete based on who has bought the best new toy, who took the best vacation. They compete against each other for status within the group.
 If you can create such an environment, a world unto itself, in which your customers or clients know and see and interact with each other, competition within that group will drive retention, price or fee elasticity, and purchasing, by the men.
 Competition for status is nothing new. But the plethora of choices has created more competition than ever before, as affluent people find themselves in more environments. If they own two homes, they are living— and competing for status—in two communities rather than just one, and status is won at the country club community in North Carolina through different choices from the high-rise condominium community in Boston. If they are in diversified businesses instead of single, narrowly defined businesses, they compete for status in a number of different business and professional associations, professional groups, and industries.


-----

##### Any marketer who finds ways to convey comparative and competitive status to his affluent male customers and clients has advantage.
 This is why visible tiered pricing and attached privilege is such a powerful price strategy in catering to the affluent in general, and affluent men in particular. Many will choose the higher price option, some the highest price option purely because of its conveyed status, whether they actually want the differential goods or services in those higher level options or not.
 This works best when a customer’s “level” is visible and seen by others. As a piece of “inside baseball,” if you explore www.NoBSInnerCircle.com, you’ll discover different Member levels, and you’ll discover two major Member conventions/conferences each year. For the conferences, I created the Diamond Members’ Lounge, a glass-walled, very visible lounge area with comfortable seating and always-present free beverages and snacks. A refuge from the crowds outside. Lower-caste Members see it, but can’t enter it. At these same conferences, there is usually one celebrity speaker, and only Diamond Members get a meet and greet photo opportunity with that celebrity. Because all this is promoted and visible, it drives a significant number of membership upgrades during conference registration and on-site. The upgrade from the level closest to Diamond (Gold) to Diamond is worth about $2,300.00 to the company the first year alone. 100 upgraded by this status-seeking is $230,000.00. 400 is nearly a million dollars. I’d add, Diamond Members tend to take everything provided to them more seriously, and apply themselves to it and apply it in their businesses more assiduously, so the differential value they gain far exceeds their differential cost.

 Men and Their Toys In Chapter 15, I talk at length about spending on personal passions.
 The RoboGolfPro, a 9-foot-tall, 800-pound instructional machine that is programmed to guide amateurs until they are precisely mimicking the swings of PGA champions. The robot holds the club at the shaft while you hold the grip, forcing you into the perfect swing. At different golf courses and academies, an initial session with it runs only about $600.00, but golfers are teeing up as much as $10,000.00 for a full day of assessments


-----

##### and training with this thing. You can also buy one for $150,000.00. Golfers are notorious for trying anything, going to any extreme, or paying any sum to shave a few strokes off their games. But they are not unique. Fishermen, hunters, other sportsmen, as well as collectors, cigar aficionados, wine connoisseurs—if there’s a competitive passion, there’s indulgence. I call these ideal customers “irrational, affluent buyers of The Slight Edge,” meaning they’ll buy into and pay any amount for anything promising a competitive edge over their friends in a shared activity. It’s important to understand that their career or business success providing their spending power is linked to this philosophical approach and ingrained behavior: investing as necessary in obtaining even the slightest of competitive advantages, at every opportunity. To see it carried over into their hobbies and recreational pursuits is no surprise, nor an oddity.
 Personally, I get it. I own and drive Standardbred racehorses, and spend, let’s say, aggressively on it. I also own and drive several classic cars at any given time, collect certain authors’ rare and first edition books, and collect Disney memorabilia. Price rarely enters these buying decisions. In a way, this is a giant toy chest and playroom. Only the racing is obviously competitive. But in reality, it is all in context of competition, with other bidders or buyers, with time itself—to react and get the one-of-a-kind item before anyone else, even with self, by achievement or ownership above and beyond prior benchmarks.
 Everything for the accomplished, affluent man is a competition. It’s never just about having a toy; it’s always about having a toy others don’t or can’t have, and/or about having the newest, hottest, coolest, biggest, and best toy.

#### CHAPTER 6

### Marketing to Affluent LGBTQ Consumers

##### “When it is a question of money, everyone is of the same religion.”

—VOLTAIRE

# If you are going to go where the money is, pursue the greatest spending
##### power, then you will be joining an ever-increasing number of companies (still somewhat quietly) reaching out specifically to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer consumers.
 In many cases, you have a two-person household, each of its members with above-average education earning above-average incomes—many with no children to raise. They have a lot more money left over every month than their heterosexual counterparts across the street, who have a tricycle and


-----

##### two bicycles lying in the driveway, signifying the existence of three eating, clothes-growing-out-of, medical-emergencies-having, college-fund-needing little monsters living inside.
 I’m willing to say here what hardly anybody else is: The vast majority of readers of this book—and of marketers, period—are heterosexuals who may profess having no problems with LGBTQ people but are, in truth, uncomfortable and squeamish about the very idea of designing advertising and marketing programs to attract them as customers, clients, or patients. This chapter may even be making your skin crawl. You may have religious or morality-based beliefs that interfere with tolerance, let alone acceptance. You may simply find “these people” foreign, incomprehensible, and unfamiliar, making you uncomfortable for no other reason than that. Some of those issues are more easily manageable than others. I am certainly not here to tell you what you should or shouldn’t believe or feel. And I happen to be in favor of a business owner managing their business to suit their personal preferences. If, for your own nonbusiness reasons, you have no interest in or willingness to deliberately and specifically market to affluent gays and lesbians, and be of service to them, now would be a good time to skip ahead to the next chapter. Just know it is a bad business decision and, if you’re running a business in which there are shareholders other than yourself, a fiscally irresponsible decision.
 And, whether you like it or not, it is antiquated. In a New Yorker cartoon, two obviously gay men are seen in their apartment, one talking on the phone, responding to a question: “No, we’re not going to the Gay Pride Parade this year. We’re here, we’re queer, and frankly, we’re tired of making a big deal out of it.” Mainstream America includes gays and lesbians. Time to get over it.
 This does not, however, mean that they are a fully absorbed group unresponsive to targeted marketing and specially directed messages. To the contrary, they consistently reward those marketers who make a special point of designing unique advertising to appear in the publications only they read and creating especially gay-friendly sales and business environments. The trick, as it is when appealing to any specific group, is not to be condescending or clumsy.

##### The Facts of This Market

 • Research verifies that 80% of gay people have incomes above the
 national average; 40% earn more than $100,000.00 a year. (Source: Community Marketing)
 • The combined buying power of LGBTQ adults in the U.S. exceeds
 $915 billion and is rising. (Source: Witech, 2016)
 • LGBTQ consumers spend over $64 billion a year on travel. (Source:
 Community Marketing) The travel industry has, for good reason, been one of the earliest and most progressive and aggressive industries to develop product offerings, advertising, and marketing specifically aimed at the LGBTQ consumers. Way back in 2007, The Wall Street Journal carried an article headlined “Las Vegas Goes All Out to Attract Gay Travelers.” It reported on numerous resorts’ and casino companies’ marketing strategies and initiatives directed exclusively at gays as well as products and experiences designed for them. For example, it mentioned that at the trendy Palms Casino, there’s a line of mostly straight men, some couples, and a few women waiting for entry to the Playboy Club’s® party, featuring the iconic Playboy Bunnies® in push-up bras costumes. Only steps away, there’s another line awaiting entry to another club, with a dance floor filled with gyrating, shirtless men dancing with each other. Harrah’s Entertainment started aggressively marketing to gay men 18 months after the extensive research it commissioned revealed that they spend an average of 30% more than straight men when traveling. To put a bit of money math to that statistic, you could have 1,000 straight customers at your resort each spending, say, $2,000.00 or 1,000 gay customers each spending $2,600.00. The net difference is $600,000.00. Multiply that by 52 weekends, and you get $31.2 million. As you can see, who you bring through your doors matters a lot. This applies to you regardless of your business category—travel, restaurants, clothing store, furniture store, financial planning, whatever—both as a general principle and, specifically, regarding gay and lesbian consumers. In many categories, the gays are worth more than the straights. Marketing to the gay and lesbian population is, in


-----

##### its essence, taking a shortcut to a more affluent, more freely spending clientele.


### Dan Kennedy’s #2 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Who you bring through your door matters a lot. Why not deliberately get
 higher value customers?



##### • Gay consumers are twice as likely to buy a vacation home, six times
 more likely to buy and have installed a home theater system, and even eight times more likely to own multiple mobile devices and computers than heterosexuals. (Source: Simmons Market Research Bureau)
 • LGBTQ households make 10% to 20% more shopping trips to malls,
 stores, and other retail locations than the average U.S. household. (Source: Nielsen)
 • In B2B, business spending, 30% of LGBTQ employees and
 executives control budgets or purchasing decisions. 60% of those people surveyed say that the reputation of a vendor company for being LGBTQ-friendly affects purchasing decisions. (Source: Simmons Market Research Bureau) Corporate America is gradually becoming more open to and about having LGBTQ in high places. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, comes to mind, having officially come out in 2014. In 2018, Land O’ Lakes made news as the first Fortune 500 company to appoint an openly gay woman as CEO.

 Marketers ignore or resist all this to their detriment.

 How to Match Media with This Market


-----

##### The top three ways the LGBTQ consumers are likely to learn a business is LGBTQ-inclusive are: advertising specifically in LGBTQ media—49%; articles and news stories—47%; sponsorship of LGBTQ charity events or organizations—41%. (Source: Community Marketing & Insights Survey 2018)
 LGBT and LGBTQ, incidentally, are terms that can be used in these environments, across all generations, without risk of offense.
 The affluent LGBTQ consumers are more engaged online than the general population, so reaching them requires more attention to and use of online and social media. Versus the general population, they are 1.8X more interested in receiving advertising via their mobile phones, 2X more connected by hours in a day, and 1.5X more likely to post and consider online reviews.

 Can Outright Target Marketing Work? Yes.
 The automaker Subaru turned their struggling company around by advertising to a group of consumers other car companies were ignoring: lesbians. Internal research showed that a surprising number of their customers were lesbian, so they doubled down with advertising crafted for those buyers. Subaru ads featured captions like “It’s Not A Choice. It’s The Way We’re Built,” and utilized openly gay celebrities like tennis star Martina Navratilova. Mercedes-Benz quickly followed suit, advertising specific car models to the LGBTQ community. Obviously, neither of these is “an LGBTQ company,” so there is no exclusivity or owner or CEO affinity involved.
 In an experiment I observed closely, by a client in financial services, the same kind of targeted advertising failed, but his is more of a person-to- person service business than is an auto brand. This is definitely not as simple or easy as simply aiming advertising and tweaking messages, but Subaru is proof it can be done, and Mercedes is even more evidence it can be done with aim at particularly affluent LGBTQ.

 Careful Message-to-Market Matching


-----

##### Just as a growing number of companies are careful to reach out to and make welcome LGBTQ clientele without turning their businesses into LGBTQ places and alienating their other, larger customer bases, any marketer must walk the same tightrope and create the same degrees of separation, including use of LGBTQ-targeted media and direct mail that remains invisible to the straight population.
 Any such outreach to a particular group begins with striving for understanding of the target audience and organizing it into manageable subgroups.
 Community Marketing & Insights (CMI) has been conducting LGBTQ research for 29 years. They divide the marketing into three identities and three generations, producing nine sub-markets:

 1. Gay and bisexual men (46% of the market) 2. Lesbian and bisexual women (also 40% of the market) 3. Gender-expansive including everybody else but heterosexual (8% of
 the market)

 The generation divides are:

 A. Millennial (born 1981–1999) B. Gen X (born 1965–1980) C. Boomer (1942–1964)

 A closer look at the identities, in brief:

 •  Gay and bisexual men. Twenty-six percent are legally married,
 another 17% in a relationship and living with a partner. Highest incomes of any LGBTQ group; more than half earn upwards of $100,000.00 a year. Concentrated in urban/big city ZIP codes.
 • Lesbian and bisexual women. Thirty-nine percent are legally married,
 another 18% living with a partner. About 30% with incomes above $100,000.00. Broader geographic distribution, adding in medium- sized cities and suburban areas.
 •  Gender expansive. Thirty-one percent are legally married, another
 15% living with a partner. They rank lower in income, net worth, and

##### home ownership than the other identities.

 Age brackets obviously matter, as they do with the entire population, and in much the same ways as with overall population. Of course, affluence tends to rise with age automatically, as the next chapter illustrates.

### Affluent Boomers’ Spending Boom

##### “He’s living beyond his means, but he can afford it.”

—SAM GOLDWYN, HOLLYWOOD MOGUL

# Seventy-five percent of Boomers have household incomes of
##### $100,000.00 and up. They are the wealthiest generation in history, with a median net worth of $913,000.00, almost twice that of affluent Gen X’ers. From 2007 through 2012, they inherited an enormous transfer of wealth from their parents, with more to come. By 2030, Boomers are expected to inherit $8.4 trillion. For marketers, the good news is: They are spending their money! They are responsible for more than half of all consumer


-----

##### spending in the U.S., outspending their children and grandchildren by two- to-one or more, and in virtually every spending category.
 They have from 8 to 12 years of this level of active spending ahead, so companies from financial firms to cruise lines to Disney have been scurrying to build products and services for these customers, yet, surprisingly, only 5% to 10% of all advertising and marketing is specifically aimed at them. There is a common mistake in much of that: being condescending, a crime committed by Gen X and Millennial ad and marketing people when usually grudgingly addressing this group. There is a decade of great opportunity here for the business owners and marketers who can and will match themselves to this market.

 The Big Wave We can argue about the exact ages or the beginning of the Boomers’ wave of spending and investing, fueled by lifestyle changes. We can’t argue that it’s here. Back in November 2005, Newsweek ran a cover proclaiming “Ready or Not, Boomers Turn 60,” featuring photographs of the famous turning 60, including former President Clinton and President Bush, now President Donald Trump, Sylvester Stallone, Goldie Hawn, Susan Sarandon, Suzanne Somers (who is making an industry out of being 60+ herself), and Cher. In 1946, 3.4 million Americans were born—a million more than in the entire previous decade. This bunch has led the way in social, political, and economic change. And they are the early or leading- edge Boomers, now leading a wave of enormous potential prosperity for savvy entrepreneurs, CEOs, and marketers. Of the entire U.S. population, 35% will hit 60 to 70 over the next two decades. The largest number of births in any one year in U.S. history occurred in 1957: 4.3 million; they turned 50 in 2007. In total, this is a slightly moving target; a leading edge passing 60, a huge population just hitting 50, each evolving from here. Within, all kinds of sub-segments.
 About one-third of Boomers range from financially secure and well prepared for retirement to financially independent. About half of that third qualify as wealthy. But the amount of money they have needs to be put in the context of the very different attitudes they have about it than did the previous retirement generations. Within the boomer population, there is a


-----

##### historically unprecedented percentage of affluent and ultraaffluent consumers coupled with a historically unprecedented willingness on their part to spend their money on themselves. This is a terrific dynamic for us marketers!
 The affluent boomer nearing, at, or sliding past 60 is a very, very different creature than was your father or grandfather at age 60.
 I was 53 when writing the first edition of this book. I’m 63, a couple months from 64, as I’m completing this third edition. My father and his friends at 60 to 65 were:

 • eager for full retirement at age 65
 • considering relocation to one home for the rest of their life (Florida
 and Arizona were the retirement places)
 • set for income shrinkage and fixed incomes
 • shrinking spending
 • accepting of aging
 • moving into the retirement phase as a group in lockstep

 In his book, Boomer Selling: Helping the Wealthiest Generation in History Own Premium Products and Services, Steve Howard writes, “We’ve started realizing that if we don’t spend the money we’ve got locked up in home equity, saving accounts, and investments pretty soon, the government will be glad to spend it for us. Once we face the fact that we have more days behind us than ahead of us, our lives and lifestyles move into a new phase. Old wants are replaced with new wants. We want to take that cruise or build that cabin we’ve always dreamed of. We want to buy products that make our life better.” In other words, when previous 60+ groups were shutting down spending, this group and those now aging into it are spending on themselves, their homes, their lifestyles, as well as their families.
 In his book, UN-Retirement: How Baby Boomers Are Changing The Way We Think About Work, Community and the Good Life, Chris Farrell says that the traditional idea of retirement was actually a “short-lived anomaly.” He notes that, “The boomer generation, poised to live longer in better health than any before, is discovering unretirement—extending their work lives with new careers and entrepreneurial ventures.” CNBC reports


-----

##### that, “Boomers are uniquely focused on having personally and professionally productive retirements. Boomers are even more likely than other generations to take risks by investing some or all of their retirement funds into starting businesses or they are more willing to spend their savings on expensive retirement activities. Boomers are actually twice as likely to launch new businesses as Gen X’ers or Millennials, and marketers of franchises, business opportunities, business training, and coaching and related services should take note.” In my world of trainers, coaches, and support networks for small-business owners in over 150 different niches as well as the membership at large of No B.S. Inner Circle, the trends are for the older owners (50 to 70) to stay in charge longer than they had imagined or intended, and more surprisingly, to be ambitious and aggressive about growth and expansion. Our audiences are dominated by gray hair.
 I recently had a conversation about this with a half dozen clients and coaching group members, all, like me, 60+ and absent any need to earn money. The consensus was: We could all quit tomorrow, but none of us know how. I have twice failed at retirement before. One of the effects of this “staying in the game longer,” after wealth is created and secure, is more people with more discretionary spending power. With zero need to add to their “nest egg,” they can spend all the current income without guilt or anxiety about doing so. Rolls-Royce recently rolled out a $350,000.00 SUV, and it’s not for Millennials or Gen X’ers!
 In the sport/business I’m active in—harness racing—there are young people of Gen X and Millennial ages, but it skews Boomer and Senior, and I am often driving in a race with as many 60- and even 70-year-old drivers as 30- and 40-year-olds. The younger ones do have a physicality advantage, but wisdom of age and treachery can often triumph. There’s a saying in racing: No man contemplates retirement or welcomes death with a promising 2-year-old colt in the barn. The age of successful competition in all pro sports is rising. Tom Brady and Drew Brees are performing as NFL quarterbacks well past the age that “should” precipitate decline. There are more head and assistant coaches age 60+ than there are 40 and below in the NFL, with that percentage rising as more choose to hang around or retire and then unretire.
 Jay Leno and David Letterman both retired from TV, both swearing they were done, both with time-consuming and expensive hobbies to turn all


-----

##### their attention to. But both are back to work. Leno with his own show tied to his hobby on CNBC, a recurring role in Tim Allen’s sitcom on FOX, plus still appearing in Vegas and at corporate events doing stand-up. Letterman less expansively, but putting together and hosting an interview show on Netflix.
 All this represents the new trend-wave of UNretirement. This suggests marketing to 60- and 70-year-olds as if they were 40 to 50.

 Where Are They Going? While Florida and Arizona remain immensely popular with those in their 60s, the trend is toward split-time residences: owning two or even three homes or condos in different places and dividing time between them, not necessarily in strict seasonal rotation. Yesterday’s snowbird migrating south or west for the winter is being replaced by a less migratory, more flexible splitter, who may be at his Michigan home in a university town for much of the winter, for skiing, for holiday activities with family; at his Las Vegas high-rise condo for New Year’s and a number of times during the year; and at his Florida home the majority of the time, making it the primary residence, but barely. Boomers are mobile.
 This has all sorts of marketplace effects. For example, the reverse mortgage began as a product of interest only to seniors typically 70 and up of modest means or even absent assets other than their home, in need of income, but is now welcomed by people at the minimum age allowed, 62, as a different means of extracting money from their primary residence without going into debt in order to buy their new second home, their gigantic RV (recreational vehicle), or their luxury time-share membership. Consequently, many mortgage brokers across the country have begun successfully micro-targeting “young seniors,” that is, Boomers with known interest in second or vacation homes, RVs, and so on, and probably interest in retaining their primary, current homes for life. I foresee a whole new kind of time-share linking a cluster of homes and condos in a Midwest hometown with a cluster of homes and condos in Florida, each resident having x number of weeks in each location, and y number of weeks in


-----

##### neither, when on cruises and other vacations—all paid via one ownership fee and monthly service fee, all provided by one company.
 Boomers are also making up an increasing percentage of the estimated four million and climbing “commuter couples,” who, by choice, for business, career, or family reasons, live apart a significant percentage of time and commute to be together. Interestingly, the higher you go in affluence, the more you find this occurring.

 What Do They Want? What Will They Buy? As you’ll see as we progress, it is dangerous and foolhardy to do what I’m about to do—generalize—yet I do believe there are overriding themes that offer us big keys to success with Boomers. To quote Ken Gronbach, author of Common Census: Counterintuitive Guide to Generational Marketing:

 They know what they want. They’ve been buying the same oil for their cars for years and they wear tan pants … At this point in their lives they want only three things:

 1. Life made easy. 2. Time saved. 3. Not to be ripped off.

 I’m not sure about the undying loyalty to a brand of oil or color of trousers—although, personally, I’ve happily gone from 30 to 40 different kinds, colors, and fabrics of pants to only two constituting 90% of my wardrobe (tan Khakis and blue jeans)—but I definitely buy his list of three chief wants. If you examine most ads aimed at Boomers, though, you won’t find these basic appeals straightforwardly addressed. Here’s how I’ll make your life easy. Here’s how I’ll save you time. Here are solid proof and guarantees. And if you’d like a good copywriting checklist for a 4-by-6 card, there it is.
 It’s also worth noting that affluent Boomers already own a lot of stuff. Their needs are fewer and get increasingly fewer with passing years, thus they are less interested in or seduced by things. Many of us now have the experience of paging through a favorite catalog or visiting a mall, able to buy just about anything we might want without second thought but finding


-----

##### nothing to buy. Consequently, Boomers are service consumers more than product buyers. We want nothing as a thing; we want a thing that gives us time, convenience, freedom, or ease.
 The third item on Gronbach’s list is too often forgotten or misunderstood when selling to Boomers. They have had more than enough life experience to have been disappointed or felt ripped off by a number of purchases and marketers. And they are not eager to repeat the experience. Boomers still think in terms of “classic credibility” while younger consumers do not; for example, brand names matter more, credible and relevant celebrity endorsements matter, years in business, professional affiliations, access to live humans for resolving problems all matter more to Boomers than to younger buyers (and more to seniors than to Boomers). You need to increase the reassurance for each year of your customer’s age.
 Beyond Gronbach’s list, I would make number four that they want what is for them—but not if pandered to or made to feel old by the specialization or customization. Affluent Boomers are, frankly, elitists. To quote somebody I can’t name, “If you can’t have things everybody else can’t, what the hell’s the point of being rich?” Further, affluent Boomers, especially affluent leading-edge and aging Boomers, know (but prefer not to enunciate) that they have special needs and want them accommodated without a lot of fanfare.

 One of the Toughest Challenges for Marketers (The Death of Age Based Advertising) Age used to be a straight line, a continuum from birth to death, with benchmarks that were extremely predictive of behavior and therefore consumer spending. Many marketers still act as if this were true. People used to progress from college or military to office to family life to empty nest, retirement, and the golf course on a predictable schedule. These days, the schedule’s been tossed out the window. Some 50- and 60-year-olds are starting second or third families, so a 55-year-old couple is in the market for a larger home (not a smaller one) close to a good school (not a golf course) and is a prospect for a Disney® Vacation Club time-share (not a condo in a retirement community). Instead of ending careers at 60 or 65, Boomers are extending careers, starting new ones, and buying or starting businesses. We


-----

##### Boomers have made a helluva mess out of age-benchmark-based advertising, marketing, list segmentation, and product and service offers.
 This mess we’re making requires an entirely new way of thinking about demographics, a far greater reliance on psychographics, and a much more serious commitment to such things as lead-generation advertising so Boomers self-select; precise list segmentation and message-to-segment matching; sophisticated database management with the best possible tools; and smart use of response lists rather than compiled lists. It also requires literal reinvention of businesses to meet the desires of the segment(s) they choose—with recognition that hardly any business can be all things to all Boomers. Frankly most businesses—large or small, national or local— WILL FAIL MISERABLY at capitalizing on these opportunities. The fresh and creative thinking, the agility in adapting, the financial and other commitments required will be beyond their owners’ or leaders’ ability or willingness to provide. As a result, I believe a number of big-name companies will be bankrupt and gone ten years from today, literally driven extinct by Boomers’ refusal to patronize them. And most small-business owners will feel it is all beyond them.
 The tiny number of business owners willing to dig in and figure all this out and adapt accordingly may find the next 6 to 12 years of boomer boom to be the greatest wealth-creating time of their lives.
 None of this means FREELY IGNORING the historic patterns of spending tied to passages from 30 to 40, 40 to 50, 50 to 60, etc. My friend, Harry Dent Jr., is uncanny at his ability to predict the booms, stalls, and busts in various product, service, and business categories based on his study of the rising or declining populations within age groupings and the historical precedents for their present and future spending. Every marketer should pay attention to Dent. You can start, free, at www.DentResearch.com. However, you can’t be dogmatic about this, either. You have to be able to spot the disruptive factors that differ so significantly from the past that they will prevent history from repeating itself perfectly or precisely. You have to recognize substantial, artificial interference with the natural order and pace of things—as an example, the Bernanke-to-Yellen years of super-suppression of interest rates, artificial support for the stock market (building a big bubble), and printing of money.


-----

##### This is the sort of thing that causes deviation from otherwise imminently predictable patterns much like a once-in-100-years drought causes deviation from otherwise predictable crop yields, harvests, and commodity prices.
 Above all else, though, it is the attitude and mindset of the affluent consumer that matters most. If, for example, a barely-mass-affluent consumer loses 20% of their $250,000.00 net worth and his household income also drops by 25%, they are not only emotionally traumatized, their actual ability to spend is compromised, more likely crippled. But if the truly affluent consumer and even more so the ultra-affluent consumer suffers the same percentage cuts, they still have a comfortable or beyond-comfortable cash reserve and asset base, and they still have far more income than they need for necessities. For the ordinary consumer, the normal, customary, by- age attitudes can’t govern spending when such reversals occur. For the affluent and ultra-affluent consumer, the normal, customary, by-age attitudes can still rule.

 A Look at the Attitudes Governing Boomers’ Spending
 Boomers’ Attitudes toward Aging The advertising insider term for the earliest Boomers is abbies: aging baby Boomers. But these Boomers would decry the term. To say that these Boomers expect to stay young isn’t just a vague idea—it’s verifiable through hard data from quality statistical research. Yankelovich Partners, one of America’s respected research groups, found early Boomers surveyed placed “old age” as starting three years after average life expectancy (82.3 years). Irrational as it may be, Boomers do not feel bound by facts. They fully expect advances in health care, genomics, and other areas to have them living to or beyond 100. And the big wave of Boomers behind them is even more expectant of long life. This has great significance for marketers. It means, in general, that a large number of those 60-plus are not thinking in terms of slowing down, aging gracefully, or retiring (as retirement has been known in the past) but instead are thinking about new options and changes.
 An extensive survey of women ages 50 to 64 by Dove® beauty products found that they do not see themselves as “older women,” and they resist such description. Age is, of course, a more sensitive issue with women than men, and the gender differences do need to be considered throughout


-----

##### marketing to Boomers, essentially adding a female vs. male division to whatever other segmentation is done.

 Boomers’ Attitudes toward Health Boomers now expect to be cured of all sorts of things our parents or grandparents accepted as incurable—including breast cancer and other cancers, heart disease and heart attacks, and other serious ailments. There is an optimistic faith in medical research producing more and better cures for all manner of disease that is wholly unwarranted by reality; there actually hasn’t been a new, complete cure for anything since polio. However, Boomers still believe the cure for what ails them is just around the corner and will arrive in time to save them. This makes a segment uninterested in self-help, self-disciplines, and so on regarding their diseases. Fortunately, there is a sizeable segment who share similar hope for cures but are also extraordinarily proactive in attempting to influence their own health with alternative means; thus the boomer boom is fueling the dramatic sales growth in nutritional and dietary supplements, herbal supplements, treatments available only at foreign clinics, organic and bio-engineered healthy foods, and so forth. On top of that, and seemingly in contradiction to it, the pharmaceutical industry is having a field day rolling out new prescription drugs for every conceivable (and newly conceived) ailment, welcomed by Boomers. Viagra® may be the most age-attitude altering of all pharmaceuticals of our time—it radically changed Boomers’ specific beliefs about sex lives and aging, but, more broadly, it also changed attitudes about fixing all normal aging issues with drugs. It removed sigma; it created new expectations. In short, real medicine, alternative medicine, fake medicine, all booming with no end in sight.
 The huge wellness industry is one of the world’s fastest growing, encompassing spas, meditation retreats, wellness tourism, organic foods and grocery stores, integrative medicine, cosmetic surgery, chiropractic, massage therapy, as well as corporate wellness and fitness programs. A lot of services once confined to medical-type practice environments, like massage therapy, teeth straightening (www.SmileDirectClub.com), and laser treatments, have gone retail into stores in malls and shopping centers. Of course, the expansion of websites and online stores having to do with


-----

##### wellness is explosive. While the total size estimates of this market are inexact, there is at least $4 trillion a year being spent, and for the next 7 to 12 years Boomers alone are expected to spend upwards of $1 trillion annually.
 Wellness tourism is a fast-growing segment of travel, with a shift from experiential to “transformative” vacations. The Four Seasons in Beverly Hills has Reiki therapists, crystal healers, and wellness rooms. The Ritz- Carlton in Beaver Creek, Colorado, offers Mountain Spa packages, wellness classes, and an oxygen bar. There is even “wellness real estate,” featuring homes built for healthy living. Wellness guru Deepak Chopra partnered with real estate developers in Miami to create oceanfront residences with “advanced body/mind purification systems that meet heightened standards for air and water quality … advanced technologies that continually monitor changes in the interior environment to promote your well-being.” These 3,600-square foot units start at $4.8 million.
 Marriage of tech and wellness is seen as a major future growth opportunity. Currently available apps can go so far as replicating an EKG, devices like FitBit and the Apple Watch lead this product category, and this is seen as a nascent industry in and of itself.
 The drivers for all of this start with Gen X’ers through Boomers and to Seniors.
 It is generally understood and accepted that “healthy” costs more—with food, home goods, living locations, travel, so the match of it with particularly affluent consumers is obvious from a financial standpoint. But “buying healthy” is also an emergent status symbol, and that, too, pairs with the affluent customer.

 Boomers’ Attitudes toward Retirement Classic retirement is no longer the goal or expectation of Boomers. A Gallup Poll in 2018 found that 74% of adults now plan to work past age 65. In contrast, back in 1998, it was 14%. Affluent Boomers who do not need to work or create earned income still expect to keep working. Ken Dychtwald, president of Age Wave, says, “They want the action. They don’t want to be on the sidelines.” My take on this is that they fear being irrelevant, being bored, and being looked on as old or out to pasture to such an extent that


-----

##### even secret yearnings to relax, do nothing, travel, and golf are trumped. This is demonstrated by countless celebrity Boomers and seniors. My friend, the late Joan Rivers, in her 80s, absent any economic need, worked furiously to—in her own words—stay relevant. I believe Cher is, as I’m writing this, about to release a new album and then embarking on another farewell tour. Senior entertainers find ways to step into the spotlight of younger stars. Bob Newhart was robbed of a deserved Emmy, but still captured the attention of the audience of CBS’ show, The Big Bang Theory, with his guest starring role as Professor Proton—made reoccurring by popular response. Senior crooner Tony Bennett, in 2014, released a duet CD with Lady Gaga and, in 2018, a new CD with Diana Krall. What do they all want? Relevance.
 From a marketing perspective, this suggests two points: First, if your products or services have anything to do with retirement, you’re going to need to redefine them. (Even boomer retirees do not like the term retiree.) Second, there’s opportunity in leveraging their desire to be active and relevant.

 Sales Strategies, Tactics, and Tools Basically, we can never know enough. Selling, in person or in media, is about connection. On a primitive level, it can be completely mechanized and some, sometimes satisfactory, money can be made. But on a sophisticated level, the more we understand, the more we are understood, accepted, and trusted.

 Language One way we translate our understanding of a group of people is by the language we use when speaking to them. Far too little effort is made by salespeople or copywriters to get the language right.
 Early-edge Boomers are quite sensitive about language used to describe them, their options, and their aging.
 In the 1950s, they used the term old folks’ home without negative thoughts about it; today if you suggested they move into one, they’d pop you one in the nose! Then came nursing homes. Then retirement homes. Now, assisted-living communities. But that industry is scrambling to again


-----

##### redefine and reposition itself to be acceptable to aging-resistant Boomers, especially affluent ones, who may very well need such housing and service options but are loath to admit it. This industry’s challenge can be seen as the positioning and linguistic challenge for all businesses seeking what dare not be called any longer a senior citizen market. (If anything, that kind of language has moved up on life’s calendar, to be used for and acceptable to people in their 80s and up.)

 Boomers and Nostalgia Everyone even barely conversant with NLP (neurolinguistic programming) understands the use of emotional ANCHORS in persuasion. An anchor may be a song or music, a visual image, a person, place, or thing already embedded in the prospect’s mind that when recalled and linked to you, your product, or your service produces positive thoughts and warm feelings and/or a sense of common bond, thus less resistance and greater, faster trust. Mainstream, mass advertisers most commonly attempt utilizing anchors by buying rights to and using very popular, well-remembered songs of Boomers’ youth. The best anchors, though, aren’t as simple, brief, or one- dimensional. For example, Roy Rogers is an anchor for (mostly male) Boomers of a certain age, but sitting on the floor in front of the TV, still in pajamas, with a bowl of cereal, to watch Roy Rogers, his superhorse, Trigger, and Dale Evans … that’s a better anchor.
 Age-appropriate NOSTALGIA ANCHORS are extremely useful in marketing to Boomers.
 The reasons nostalgia itself is so powerful are many, and they warrant an in-depth discussion of psychology, but to abbreviate: We naturally rewrite history and memory to romance the past (in linking to our desire for lost youth and immortality); we are dissatisfied with the present (because no reality can match imagined memory and because we are critical by nature); and we fear the future (as it links to mortality). Even false nostalgia is more appealing than present realities. As example, almost everybody likes—and buys things from—the little fake general store in Cracker Barrel® restaurants, even if the closest they ever actually got to a small-town general store with stuff in wood barrels was watching the Andy Griffith Show on TV. Celebration, a planned community in Orlando originally


-----

##### developed by Disney® (a MUST-tour), is built out of nostalgia anchors. It is the picture-perfect, quintessential American small town appealing to those with a romanticized memory of such a place, but almost as appealing to people with an imagined nostalgia for such a place.
 When marketing to Boomers, you will benefit greatly from carefully choosing and using age-appropriate, gender-appropriate, geography- appropriate nostalgia anchors. But you can’t overplay your hand either. Boomers are hypersensitive to being conned. They have seen a lot, have a lot of life experience, and quickly detect false, inauthentic, pandering attempts at connecting with them—and they resent them.
 As an interesting example, I’ve encouraged my investment partner Darin Garman to increase the small-town anchors in his marketing of American heartland investment properties to investors throughout the country, including many from the coasts. Why? Because one investor enunciated for us what others have not but must be influenced by: He, a New York resident attending his mother’s funeral in Iowa, saw Garman’s ad, called, and bought several hundred thousands of dollars of small-town Iowa real estate on impulse, based on nostalgia for his youth. We have since seen the power of telling the story of a place where small-town values still rule, where Fourth of July parades and Friday-night games are attended by the whole town, where churches host summer picnics and neighbors meet at the ice-cream stand—even though it has nothing whatsoever to do with a numbers decision for an investor. But this has to be done gently, naturally, authentically—not waved like a big red pennant. Fortunately for Garman, it is authentic. It’s where he lives and how he lives.

 What Sets Boomers’ Teeth on Edge: How to Lose a Boomer in 60
 Seconds If you want to know what will drive Boomers away from your business, here’s your answer. First and foremost, it is (perceived or real) disrespect. Boomers deeply resent and often react with rage to employees who 1) call them Pops, Ma’am, Old Man, and so on, either as deliberate or as an accidental offense; 2) dress in ways that Boomers view as inappropriate for the workplace and a sign of disrespect for the job and the customers; 3) talk down to them or are condescending, such as “I realize at your age you don’t


-----

##### know much about the internet, so …”; 4) use street slang or young slang or references instead of speaking the King’s English; 5) fail to clearly explain things; 6) hurry them (beyond their capability); 7) engage in impolite, disrespectful behavior, such as talking on a cell phone while ringing up their sale at a cash register.
 To do well with Boomers, every person in your employ or representing you who comes in contact with your customers must learn to do well with Boomers and modify his attitude, language, appearance, and behavior to do well with Boomers. Otherwise your people will sabotage your marketing.

 Big Opportunities and How Businesses Will Adapt to Boomers in
 Coming Years Conglomeration of Services As an example of the conglomeration-of-services approach, here’s my thought about the retirement community for affluent Boomers: I think there’ll be a boom in retirement lifestyle clubs that bundle together a primary-residence condo or apartment in something akin to today’s assisted-living center for timeshare exchanges for other such sites all over the country x number of weeks a year, plus cruise ship weeks, car and driver transportation at all home sites, concierge travel services, and concierge medical care, all for one monthly fee or lifetime prepayment.
 This may require insurance companies, doctors, hospitals, HMOs, real estate developers, and community operators to all come together in new joint ventures, or a big company from one of the involved industries—say, Marriott (already very active in assisted living and, obviously, in travel)—to be the organizer, or an entirely new type of corporation to be created. For the customer, this will offer the own-nothing, rent-everything option or the timeshare-your-whole-life-for-one-fee option. It is a quasi-marriage of today’s high-end destination travel clubs utilizing mansions as well as resort properties—with buy-ins in the $200,000.00 to $350,000.00 range plus yearly dues—with retirement communities and assisted-living facilities, with full services, from a driver waiting to take you to the mall to a doctor on call to a refrigerator stocked for you. The consumers may even pay by assigning assets via their wills or transferring assets through irrevocable trusts rather than with present-day dollars, as more and more Boomers feel

##### entitled to spending it all rather than stacking it up for heirs. This requires new and very innovative thinking about product, business models, and financing models. (Charities have gotten very good at securing these post- death payments as well as getting large sums turned over in exchange for income or benefits for life. Why shouldn’t other businesses?)
 The truly innovative leaders—what I’m calling lifestyle service inventors—will make the huge new fortunes in America. Making fortunes from manufacturing is now freakish. Making fortunes from technology alone, on the ebb. Making fortunes in any single category of business being replaced by multichannel, multimedia, multi-category businesses based on high customer value is the coming trend.
 Using this as metaphor, you have to start thinking about just how radically your industry and connected or potentially connected industries may change or could be changed, and how you can be in the lead rather than chasing—or worse, watching.

 Experiences “Boomers aren’t likely to spend their retirement years sitting in a
 rocking chair. Instead, surveys suggest they’ll continue to SEEK OUT REMARKABLE EXPERIENCES—whether on cruise ships,
 in RVs, or at hotels and gambling tables.”

—FROM FORTUNE, 6/2006, A PRESCIENT FORECAST

##### Boomers are RESTLESS. They are easily bored and in need of a lot of external stimulation. The old idea of the 60s being a time to slow down and take it easy is moving forward, to people in their 70s and 80s, and is more common to NON-affluent Boomers and their elders solely because of financial limitations on their options. Today’s affluent Boomers want to be entertained wherever they go, whether to Las Vegas or to a neighborhood restaurant.
 Boomers are unsatisfied with the ordinary. An ordinary store, an ordinary mall, an ordinary hotel or resort, all unappealing. A resort needs to provide the chance to swim with dolphins, not just a nice pool area. Vegas and Disney® set the bar for themed experiences and environments, and retailers and other businesses must follow suit. Even mail-order catalogs


-----

##### and websites need to provide multidimensional experiences, not just a descriptions of goods. You may immediately be tempted to engage in the Uncreative “But my business is different” thinking as an excuse for not creating exciting and memorable experiences for prospects and customers, clients, or patients—but Boomers will not reward you.

 Service Spread Thin: A Crisis and Opportunity in Capitalizing on the
 Affluent Boomer Boom Boomers are far more demanding regarding service than, progressively, members of each younger generation. A 30-year-old is not annoyed by—and may even prefer—self-serve grocery checkouts, or self- serve online banking; a 60-year-old hates it. Affluent Boomers will go out of their way to go where they get exceptional service.
 However, the United States is experiencing a significant and growing shortage of service-sector employees. By 2030, America will have twice as many retirees as in 2005, but only 15% more service workers to support them—and that’s with unchecked illegal immigration. The demand for service is outpacing the workforce required to provide it, now and into the future. Most businesses are reacting to minimum-wage increases, overall increases in costs per employee, and ever-increasing managerial frustrations with quality of employees by reducing the number of service employees per x amount of gross sales or by some other ratio; substituting automation; and substituting self-serve systems, transferring the burden to the customer. This may be mathematically sensible, but letting bean counters create policy is a consistently destructive act. (Bean counters should count beans. Period. Kennedy’s First Law of Investing: Never invest in a company run by the accountants.)
 For success with the boomer boom, and especially with affluent Boomers, a business needs to alter its fundamental economics in order to do the polar opposite: increase the number of service persons … pay above- average wages and offer incentives to attract and keep superior people … invest in continual training (including training on satisfying boomer customers) … and integrate exceptional service promises into its advertising and marketing.


-----

##### My favorite business success tactic is to engineer a business to be able to substantially outspend all its competitors on advertising and marketing, customer acquisition, and customer retention. I would extend this to hiring, training, and motivating people.

 Social Networks and Organizations That Attract Boomers AARP (www.aarp.org) is one of the largest membership organizations in the United States. It began as—and, to a great extent, is still a mask for —a business selling insurance, financial services, and other services to seniors, and selling ad media and other access to its members to companies marketing to seniors. In short, it is a marketing and media business presenting itself to a group of customers as an association working for them, serving them, even representing them politically. It is a terrific example of a tollbooth business. And of an illusion.
 AARP’s media is expensive but pretty much essential if you are going to be a serious national marketer to the 55-plus boomer and senior markets. Many companies err by not integrating to the greatest extent possible with AARP, via advertising in its media, exhibiting at its conventions, providing editorial content for its publications, renting its lists, and offering discounts and benefits to its members. AARP is the big kahuna in this market, with nothing but growth in size and influence ahead.
 AARP is also evidence of a “joiner bias” among Boomers. Boomers are membership oriented, having grown up with many more affinity groups of influence than have younger generations. This is an exploitable bias. There is ample room for niched organizations serving Boomers or only affluent Boomers, largely copying AARP—for example, an association for affluent boomer travelers or affluent boomer real estate investors or affluent boomer golfers.
 The ELKS (www.elks.org) organization has, by comparison, only one million members and is struggling. Very recently, a sign of new life: the average member age has come down from 69 to 61, and for the first time in 35 years, membership is growing. The organization does have 2,100 lodges throughout the United States. It has potential for reinvigoration or reinvention. Unfortunately for the Elks, they do not skew affluent and tend not to attract affluent Boomers … essentially they are trying to pump life


-----

##### with weak blood. They should not, however, be overlooked in developing a complete marketing plan for Boomers (or seniors). They have effective and reasonably priced media and exploitable affinity.
 The Red Hat Society (www.redhatsociety.com) has enjoyed terrific growth since its 1998 launch, largely thanks to generous media attention. Geared to women over 50, the organization has over 40,000 chapters (many very small), national publications, an online community and so on, but it revolves around local tea parties, luncheons, shopping trips, and the like. Over 500,000 members proudly wear the trademark purple outfit with a red hat. While the organization makes no effort to attract affluent women, estimates are that better than half of its members are wealthy. The organization also has a very active licensing department, for fashions, accessories, gifts, merchandise of all kinds, books, and consumer service.
 My take is that integrating a societal or community element into just about any boomer-oriented business is, at very least, in the no-harm, no-foul category, but can be very useful. It’s a way to create added value mostly from thin air, and to involve your customers with you and with each other. Ideally, you’ll find a way to use it to create “pain of disconnect,” discouraging departure or fickleness and encouraging continued or frequent patronage.

 Boomers Buying Businesses (and Selling Businesses) Well over 50% of all sellers of businesses turn around and start, or more often, buy another business within 12 to 24 months. There’s no indication this is less true of people in their 50s, 60s, and beyond. The franchise industry reports that boomer buyers, especially early retirees encouraged to exit their corporate careers, are a prime source of buyers. A growing number of franchisors specifically target this market. There is no reliable research I’ve yet located on the relationship between Boomers, homebased businesses, and in-home offices, but ample anecdotal evidence suggests a major trend there.
 There are three key themes.

 1. One reason Boomers start or buy businesses, franchises, or business
 opportunities is to prepare for and begin their next life. They have


-----

##### no intention of actually retiring in the classic sense, and they look to self-employment or business ownership for their sense of purpose for the years from 50 to 60 or 60 to 70. In many cases, they are pursuing dream businesses—that’s how bed-and-breakfasts, small restaurants, antique stores, and the like come about. 2. The other reason is to make up for lost time. Several of my clients
 have had considerable success aiming prepackaged part-time or second-business opportunities at professionals ages 45 to 55, who, while affluent, still have not amassed enough wealth to comfortably retire. They see the second-income business as a means of pouring additional income into retirement savings and/or quickly creating equity in a saleable asset. An example of this is Dr. David Phelps, who, based on his own experience transitioning from practice to real estate investor, sells coaching programs to dentists based around a “seven years to freedom plan,” designed to create passive investment income equal to practice income. He has affluence-required pricing, with one-to-two-year program fees from $50,000.00 to $200,000.00. 3. A third area of opportunity is in selling lifestyle businesses to
 Boomers, such as info-marketing or internet-marketing businesses, mobile and portable businesses, and absentee-owner businesses. The “have your cake and eat it too” theme is working well for countless promoters of businesses that lend themselves to spare and flexible time operation, outsourcing, and automation. And, claims about large income potential are not as important as lifestyle claims … a common mistake is focusing on the money.

 Boomers Investing and Investing in Boomers In the financial services industry, there is a current and likely to continue explosion of investment products, advertising and marketing programs, prepackaged seminars, sales tools, sales training, info-marketers, and coaches all aimed at reaching the affluent boomer market. There is even a separate trade journal, Boomer Market Advisor (www.thinkadvisor.com). Predictably and sadly, virtually all the ads and the editorial content in this publication is product and platform oriented, not focused on understanding and communicating with the boomer client. As is all too common, all of


-----

##### these fools think it is about their products. But the growing number of such products is illustrative of the size, scope, and potential of this market … and the need to customize for it, even if most financial companies and advisors are relatively clueless about how they ought to actually go about that.
 Fact is, Boomers have a lot of money invested but also a ton of money underinvested. Boomers, especially leading-edge Boomers, have hundreds of millions of dollars parked in bank CDs, money market accounts, regular checking, bonds, and, still, in their mattresses. Those selling businesses or selling large homes and buying smaller ones; those getting paid bulk sums to retire early; executives with golden parachutes; and those inheriting money from their parents all combined have a boatload of investable assets and are uncertain and anxious about where to put it. (Note: Anyone going after it needs to remember the three key wants mentioned on Page 73.)

 Boomers Buying Homes According to the National Association of Realtors, Boomers account for 57% of second-home purchases—a record high for the age group and a reminder that the old rules of age-based marketing are broken. Boomers used to buy second homes for only one reason (preparing for retirement), and only the ultraaffluent bought vacation homes. Today’s affluent Boomers may have a second and a third home … and they have multiple buying motivations: leisure or vacation; preretirement; retirement; gathering places for geographically scattered families; and investment. They account for 58% of investment property purchasing—single family homes, apartment buildings, and commercial properties.
 Affluent Boomers who intend to buy new homes when they retire— 59%; 45% in a different state than their current residence; 36% intend to downsize. One of the most sought-after in-home amenities: “spa-like bathrooms.” To me, this means the way the real estate industry works with boomer clients has to change, or the Boomers will replace Realtors® with other means of meeting their needs. Boomers ready to relocate do not want hassles or uncertainties. This presents growing opportunity for real estate investors rather than agents to immediately relieve the boomer-owner of his current property, but somehow whoever is at that end of the process must also be able to support the boomer in finding and purchasing the new home,


-----

##### and vice versa. The opportunity here is in a seamless outcome for the boomer. Regardless, though, it tells you that this is a viable market for homes and condos—and a market less affected by price and market highs and lows than the general housing market, because when they’re ready, they’re ready, and they can afford the luxury of NOT waiting for better timing.

#### CHAPTER 8

### Those Who’ve Gone from Poor to Rich

##### “I don’t think of myself as a poor deprived ghetto girl who made good. I think of myself as somebody who from an early age knew I
 was responsible for myself, and I had to make good.”

—OPRAH WINFREY

# I’ve gone from rags to riches, so I think I get these rich customers
##### better than any others.
 A very significant percentage of the affluent population did, in fact, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, and they strongly identify with that cliché. Many came from stark or relative poverty or other difficult circumstances and are still very much governed by having been poor or put


-----

##### down. They never disconnect emotionally from this past, no matter how successful and wealthy they become. Some romanticize their past struggles. All keep them as touchstones. I doubt it’s a coincidence that Jay Leno’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located precisely at the street corner where he was twice arrested for vagrancy. Can’t help but think he had something to do with that placement. Or that his massive collection of classic cars may have roots in his having to sleep in his car while homeless, when starting out.
 Walt Disney was once driving home from Disneyland® when he saw and stopped briefly to admire a particular new car in a showroom window. Then driving home, he said aloud to himself, “Gee, I wish I could afford one of those.” It was a half hour later that it occurred to him—“Hey, I can afford that”—and he turned around, drove back to the dealership, and bought himself the car. This reveals a little something about self-made affluents: They may have nearly unrestricted spending power in reality, but not necessarily mentally and emotionally. Most are conflicted about money. They know they need to think, feel, and act rich to remain attractive to money, as I explain in my book No BS. Wealth Attraction in the New Economy. But they also battle guilt, fear, anxiety, and abhorrence of waste. Those who have worked for their wealth, rather than inherited it or gotten it in some amazing windfall, as a movie star or athlete signed to a $50 million contract, can be self-indulgent and profligate, but are not casually so. A yacht salesman told me, “I always show them an outrageously pricey one first, a very expensive but slightly smaller and less luxuriously equipped one second, and a stripped-down bargain model third. They buy the middle one and are able to feel good about not spending as much as they could have. They feel like they acted responsibly.”

 Selling to the Self-Employed Affluent A very valuable sub-segment of these self-made affluents is business owners and entrepreneurs. Here you may very well find your best customers, clients, or patients.
 Self-employment is one of the most reliable paths to firstgeneration wealth, supplemented by real estate investment. The net worth of a U.S. household in which its head is self-employed is nearly 500% greater than


-----

##### one in which the number-one breadwinner works for somebody else. Frankly, we business owners tend to pay ourselves a lot better than we do anybody else! And among the ultra-affluent, just shy of 50% own a business that is their primary source of wealth. The other 50% is fragmented, with wealth amassed from inheritance, marriage and divorce, pedantic investment over time, and a number of other sources.
 The personality of these affluent business owners and entrepreneurs is sharply drawn, with little ambiguity, so they can be the easiest of all affluents to market a wide variety of goods and services to.
 One of my multimillionaire clients owns a large home services company. He grew up in a house with no indoor plumbing. He started in business with a box of tools and hard work. Another multimillionaire client was divorced by his first wife and shunned by his own family for being a wild-eyed dreamer who refused to get a decent job. Only when his brother, a doctor, saw an article about my client did the family make overtures to patch things up. Another multimillionaire client now traveling around in his two private jets and living in what can only be described as a palatial estate in Florida was once working as a car mechanic, and recalls having to explain to his wife that they could not afford to have the clothes dryer repaired and having to borrow the money to go to his first seminar on real estate. These examples are more typical than atypical of the affluent entrepreneur profile. They have never been handed anything. They’ve worked and sacrificed for everything they’ve gotten. They got it by “taking no crap” from anybody and have no intention of doing so now.

 Won’t Take No for an Answer First and foremost, they view themselves as fiercely independent. They chafe at rules and tend to exit, stage left immediately upon hearing rules language from anyone marketing to them. The fastest way to repel this customer or client is to tell him, “No, you/we can’t do that,” and when asked why not, say, “Policy.”
 I have stayed at every imaginable kind and brand of hotel, from the much-lauded bastion of service, Ritz-Carlton, to the orange-roofed Howard Johnsons; top-rated resorts, city business hotels, rural motels. I and my companies have spent millions of dollars putting on meetings, conferences,


-----

##### and conventions for groups of 20 to 20,000 in these same facilities. Since this is self-described as the service and hospitality industry, you might expect service and hospitality. But you’d be wrong. In 30 years of this patronage, I have been in only two of these places where no matter what I asked, I never heard the words “no” or “can’t.” The properties where this occurs consistently are Disney’s® in Florida, notably Animal Kingdom Lodge® and the Grand Floridian.® Everywhere else, you get nos. I’ve stayed in a lot of resorts once. I take a vacation at a Disney property nearly every year. If not already, I’ll certainly generate a million dollars in lifetime customer value for Disney.® Only $10,000.00, give or take, for just about every other resort I’ve every stayed at but will never stay at again. That’s the value of being able to say “yes” to the affluent.

 If They Admire You, They’ll Reward You with Their Business Second, the self-made affluent are great admirers of the qualities that got them where they now are. Every one of them is doing business with somebody who reminds them of themselves when they were starting out. I got my first bank loan from a 70-year-old entrepreneur who owned the smalltown bank outright, and the mill, and the main street restaurant and hardware store, and most of the real estate as far as the eye could see in any direction. I met him for lunch at his diner on a Wednesday, not knowing his bank was closed on Wednesdays. Afterwards, he unlocked the bank, found its checkbook in a drawer, wrote out a check to me for $50,000.00, and told me he’d have somebody draw up the paperwork and mail it to me to sign. He said I reminded him of himself when he was a young buck too dumb to know what couldn’t be done and tough enough to do it. I regretted not having asked for $100,000.00.
 These people reward ingenuity, drive, persistence, and salesmanship. They have a spiritual reverence for these virtues.
 An axiomatic example was given to me by a fellow who was charged with selling a new kind of pizza-making conveyor oven to New York restaurants. In the city of pizza, only fixed ovens with real pizza stones were acceptable. To crack the market, he determined he would need the number-one restaurateur as a reference, the owner of a couple famous, high- end restaurants as well as five different franchise chains. It just so happened


-----

##### this entrepreneur had just secured the area rights to a new pizza franchise and would soon be opening dozens of locations. The salesman sent him a letter requesting an appointment. Then he sent him one of his business cards with a handwritten request, along with some brochure or article about the ovens or the restaurant business in general, every day. Every day for two months. Finally, his phone rang and the famous restaurateur asked—in good humor—“What do I have to do to get you to stop sending me your business cards?” The salesman told him he’d bought the cards by the thousand, so there was a long way to go, but a brief appointment would put an end to it. The ending is happy. More than 100 of those pizza locations have the “odd” ovens.
 On the other side of this coin, the self-employed affluent genuinely detest sloth, weakness, and wimpiness. They are hustlers who not only respect hustle but find those lacking it pathetic and untrustworthy. That does not mean they respond well to desperate hustle; they don’t. But aggressive hustle, they do.

 They Are—More Often than Not—Searching for Value, as They Define It Third, they know the value of a dollar, and tend to pride themselves on being smart about money, getting good deals and bargains, negotiating successfully, and even being seen as frugal.
 One of the richest people in Europe, the founder of IKEA, Ingvar Kamprad, flies economy, eats lunch in the IKEA employee cafeteria, drives a decades-old Volvo, and lives in a modest one-story home. Warren Buffett still lives part of the time in the same home he bought for $31,000.00 in 1958, and has been known to pick up Bill Gates at the airport himself when Gates visits. The late Sam Walton was famously, symbolically frugal: old pickup trucks, off-the-rack suits, even brown paper bag lunches.
 Even President Donald Trump, pre-presidency, liked telling the stunts of buying the bankrupt billionaire’s oceanfront manor as a foreclosure bargain; of recouping his investment in his famous Mar-a-Lago resort by replacing all of the antiques, antique furniture, and art that came with it with reproductions and selling the originals; and of buying his huge 727 airplane rather than a smaller private jet because there was less of a market for 727s so it could be had at a bargain price. As president, early, he made much of


-----

##### getting Boeing to withdraw their contract and lower the price for new Air Force One planes.
 When you step down from these ultra-affluent business leaders to the merely affluent, you find even more serious frugality. While they all have one or two things they will spend wildly on, most abhor waste and have an emotional need to buy smart with most things they buy. I believe this is rooted in two things: 1) a patch of thin skin about others’ perceptions of the rich-as-drunken-sailor spenders who are fools about money, reinforced by the news stories featuring those who are; and 2) a vivid memoir of and residual paranoia about from whence they came, when spare change from the couch cushions was needed to buy dinner. Most affluent entrepreneurs harbor a nagging fear of losing it all or having it all taken away from them and winding up broke. This anxiety is always there, like a low-grade infection. If they feel they are wasting money, that anxiety flares up.
 It’s important to know that the price these people will pay for something has to do with how right and justified or queasy and irrational they feel about it. Not about intrinsic value or their own ability to pay.
 In marketing to the affluent, you will mostly be marketing to these people who have made themselves affluent through ingenuity and initiative —not rich heiresses roaming Rodeo Drive between two-martini lunches and hours at the spa, not rappers and rock stars or superstar athletes draped in bling. The way you present yourself to them must be in sync with their values.

 I want to tell you about four people.

 One drives a $400,000.00 Maybach (a luxury auto I also own) and a $360,000.00 Bentley, wears a diamond-encrusted one-of-a-kind wristwatch, lives in a two-floor penthouse in New York in which he removed walls in order to create a big home theater. He is as new-rich flashy as can be.


-----

##### The second guy splurges on $500-a-box cigars, his custom shoes cost $500.00 a pair, his oddball vehicle stable includes an actual M47 tank, and he has ownership interests in over 100 businesses and is a significant stockholder in companies like Weight Watchers and Walmart.

 The third guy wears only perfectly tailored Armani suits, has a large motorcycle collection, and has several homes each worth upwards of $10 million.

 The fourth calls himself a beer-and-pretzels guy, wears jeans and rugby shirts every day, drives a 5-year-old car, and owns a huge home with only a few rooms in it furnished, but owns and uses a Gulfstream V and famously makes large purchases and investments.

 The first guy was expelled from high school and never finished, and after being rejected by every company in his industry that he submitted his demo product to, he produced it himself and started selling it out of the trunk of his car. He is worth an estimated $300 million.

 The second guy is an immigrant, was rejected by many potential employers, and made some of his first money with a kitchen table info- marketing/mail-order business. He began buying cheap real estate before he owned a home of his own or even had an apartment of his own, while bunking with friends. His estimated net worth exceeds $400 million.

 The third guy grew up in a trailer, with his mother and a series of “stepfathers.” He worked in a rock quarry, as an adding machine salesman B2B door-to-door, and at an ice cream stand, before being hired as an announcer by his biological father—from whom he later bought the small business in 1982, grew it, took it public, and made it a multimillion-dollar enterprise. His estimated net worth exceeds $500 million.

 The fourth guy has benefited from a little luck and fortuitous timing—he sold the second company he built to Yahoo! for $5.7 billion, before the dot.com crash. But he’s from a blue-collar family background, and he started his first business after working, selling, scamming, and paying


-----

##### his own way through college. He became a millionaire from it by age 31. His estimated net worth exceeds $1 billion.

 The first rich guy is Jay-Z. The second, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Third, Vince McMahon. Fourth, Mark Cuban. You see him now on Shark Tank.

 How They Spend Their Money

 Cuban is most transparent in not caring about some things and thus being relatively cheap in spending on those things, while caring a lot about other things and spending on them, ludicrously. Nobody needs a Gulfstream V; not for speed, security, or convenience. But if you could closely examine the other three, you’d uncover the same fact. To Arnold, fine cigars and enjoying them is of earth-shaking, prime importance. You can be certain he reads Cigar Aficionado magazine. As Governor of California, he even challenged the anti-smoking rules at the state capitol. He also cares passionately about ownership of iconic American companies and quality real estate, like shopping malls. I am certain we could find other things he has no interest in at all, and may very well be buying ordinary goods at ordinary prices in those categories. Jay-Z is about “bling” impressive to fellow rappers and entertainers, but he is not an accumulator of large residences around the country.

 Appearances, status, and peers’ opinions seem to matter to them all, although maybe less to Arnold than the others. Cuban bought an NBA basketball team, McMahon took a stab at a new pro foot-ball league, and his wife poured money into a U.S. Senate campaign. Jay-Z wants to be known as something much bigger than a rap music mogul; he has a vodka brand, an apparel company, and minority ownership in a pro basketball team. The rich and super-rich buy things that reinforce or raise their prestige. The self-made rich tend to (try to) buy respect and respectability. They are also intensely, perhaps obsessively, competitive. Visibly, notably winning, leading, having the biggest, the best, is important to them.


-----

##### They all indulge themselves, expensively, and openly. There is none of the (artificial) humility of a Warren Buffett here. Schwarzenegger recently retold his story of buying the tank on the Kimmel show—and clearly relished the telling of it. Cuban is happy to have you know his $41 million Gulfstream is the largest online purchase in history. Jay-Z didn’t just buy a fantastically expensive watch—he had a custom Audemars Piguet made.

 And what do you think they think about their indulgent and lavish and mostly showy spending? They are obviously uninhibited. I would imagine, if challenged about it, they would say—contrary to Obama’s ideas—that they created it, they built it, they earned and earn it, and they’re fully entitled to keep it and spend it any damn way they please. They share hard-scrabble starts, and they appreciate and respond well to “hustle” and hustlers. They have all been underestimated underdogs.

 This gives you valuable insight, as a marketer or sales professional, engaging such people—whether worth a mere million or ten million or hundreds of millions of dollars.

#### CHAPTER 9

### The ¾-Full Glass

##### “In all likelihood, world inflation is over.”

—THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, IN 1959

# As I was finishing this chapter, in November of 2018, the “Trump
##### Economy” was red hot and firing on all cylinders. Breaking positive records with every metric, including lowest unemployment and lowest minority unemployment yet best workforce participation and highest number of open jobs in decades, significant wage growth after a decade of stagnation, stock market highs even with the Fed raising interest rates to point of attractive yield to fixed income investors, and so on and so on. Much of this news was, incredibly, reported in negative terms, with headlines like these:


-----

##### Record Low Unemployment and Wage Growth Raises Fears of
 Inflation

 When Will This Blazing Hot Economy Turn to Recession?

 How Can All The Numbers Be Great? Experts Voice Skepticism No one wants to be guilty of Greenspan’s irrational exuberance, or caught with their pants down celebrating too much good news too cheerfully when bad news rears its head. Remarks like the one on the previous page have bitten experts and pundits and politicians so often there is actually a fear of optimism and of good economic news. This is exacerbated by the morphing of news media into partisan, political propaganda entities acting as two boxers from opposing corners of the ring, so there is always half of the media screaming about a sky soon to fall. This equation has been taking hold for some time, but the unmatched level of anathema toward President Trump has made it far more pronounced and fiery than ever before. For much of the political establishment, mainstream media, and financial media, no success can be acknowledged, no credit given. Any sunny day that might once have been happily acknowledged must now be couched as a dire warning of global warming!
 Of course, no one—me included—can forecast what the economy may be doing six months or so into any future let alone this one, the pregnancy term of this book. So I have omitted reams of statistical data relevant now that may be obsolete, one way or the other, by the time you read this. Instead, I’m going to talk broadly about economic matters, and their psychology, as it affects your successful conduct of business with affluent customers.
 A very important thing to understand about the psychology of affluence and spending or investing by the affluent is optimism. Nothing actually changed (yet) the day Trump was elected or inaugurated except his own address of record, but all sorts of behavior of investors and customers immediately changed purely because their mood changed, from pessimistic or lethargic to optimistic.
 The cynic might think it’s easy for the affluent to be optimistic because they have so much money, but that ignores the fact that the majority of the affluent got to this point through their own initiative as entrepreneurs,


-----

##### business owners, and investors and, themselves, cite optimism as a cause rather than effect. At their core, they are optimists. And they tend to be most responsive to optimistic messages.
 In my own survey of millionaire entrepreneurs, I consistently find that the overwhelming majority rank Ronald Reagan as the best President of our lifetimes and rank John F. Kennedy as second best. The title of worst went to Jimmy Carter. If you carefully examine the speeches, addresses to the nation, interviews, and overriding themes of these three men and their presidencies, you can easily see Reagan and Kennedy as representatives of optimism, Carter as a representative of pessimism.
 I have several clients in the investment real estate field who have been largely unaffected by the troubles that began dominating the news from mid-2007: the mortgage meltdown, tightening of available credit, slow housing market, drops in values. Many of their competitors saw their investor customers freeze new investing. Not my clients. Why? Because they quickly became passionate preachers of a positive message. Citing John D. Rockefeller’s famous “buy when there is blood in the streets” advice, they have beat the drum of now as the best time ever to find bargains and buy, buy, buy.
 Most affluent entrepreneurs are very familiar with Napoleon Hill, author of Think and Grow Rich, and his admonition that “in every adversity lies the seeds of equal or greater opportunity.” This is a belief already in place that any marketer can link himself to when his industry, product, or service category or clientele are actually facing difficult times or are being told they are—or soon may be—by the media.
 Optimists are naturally attracted to other optimists. If you seek to go where the money is, you will find yourself unwelcome if you lack and fail to express an attitude of optimism. I have long told my clients, “Whatever else you are a merchant of, be sure that you are also a merchant of good news.” There is a simple principle I teach about marketing relationships with customers of any and all kinds that applies trebly to affluent customers who nearly always have ample ability to spend, but are subject to mood swings affecting their willingness to spend: After every encounter and communication, leave the customer feeling better about himself and the world around him than he was when you got there. Lift.

### What the Wealthy and Successful Believe That
 the Poor and Unsuccessful Do Not

 If you roam the libraries and bookshelves in any ten affluent or ultra##### affluent individuals’ homes and offices, you will find at least seven well stocked with what I call the literature of the rich. Books like Think and Grow Rich, The Power of Positive Thinking, The Magic of Thinking Big, and other classic perennial bestsellers of similar theme. If you visit the homes of any ten poor people, you will likely find none of these books in any of the homes. It is not coincidence. It is causative. The possession of such books reveals a very particular and specific mindset on the part of the affluent—that there is a profound and direct link between their thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs and their prosperity. Consequently, the affluent of this belief are conscious, even forced, optimists. They deliberately resist their own pessimism or pessimism delivered to them by others. The poor, on the other hand, are extremely pessimistic and welcome delivered pessimism as proof that their lack of success is rooted in circumstances beyond their control. The rich explain the poor as “poor of mind, poor in purse.” The next logical extension of this is that the rich tend away from skepticism, the poor tend to it. Pessimism and skepticism are close cousins. Because the rich strive not to permit themselves to be pessimistic, they automatically tend not to be skeptical.

 So whom would you rather be selling to—a skeptical and pessimistic person or an accepting and optimistic person?

 In the old South, white people didn’t want to drink water from water fountains used by blacks. In the new Richistan, rich people do not want to drink the same water or use the same entrances or, God forbid, sleep on the same sheets as ordinary folk. Richistan is the “place” described by Robert Frank in the fascinating book Richistan: A Journey Through the American Wealth Boom and the Lives of the New Rich, a must-read for every marketer

##### to the affluent. Among other things, it gives insight to the tiered and aspirational elitism of the mass-affluent, affluent, and ultraaffluent, each group emotionally validated by its purchased privileges that those one level lower are denied.
 First of all, segregation has been the NATURAL order of things since cavemen. We form tribes. In elementary school, junior high school, high school, and college. At work, at the office, within our professional and trade associations. In our cities and neighborhoods. We form tribes. We form tribes more to exclude than include. We seek separation, differentiation, and disassociation from unlike as well as association with like.
 In an episode of Mad Men, the outstanding AMC dramedy about the advertising agency business—and life—in the 1950s, a new woman moves into the suburban community, and she is, horror of horrors, a mother of a young child, divorced, without a husband. All the other women are married, of that tribe, and quickly close ranks to protect their husbands and themselves from the dangerous influence of this foreign, exotic creature. In a storyline in Grey’s Anatomy, the long-running medical drama on ABC, a young, progressive doctor is brought into the hospital to revamp the surgical residency program. She immediately begins changing things. Her peers close ranks, conspire against her, shut her out of surgeries, and despite evidence of the superiority of her methods, eventually get her fired. The tribe was threatened. The tribe protected itself.
 These reminded me of an episode of the old Andy Griffith Show, when a stranger comes to Mayberry, and everyone becomes convinced he’s an international spy, just because he is a stranger. This speaks to the fear, paranoia, loathing, dislike, and disdain we have for the different even as we seek to feel different. The tribes we form try to reinforce our differences as superiority by excluding a majority of those we can label as inferior.
 Assimilation has remained a theoretical goal but never realized. Each tribe voluntarily segregates. If this were not the case, there would be no BET or NAACP, there would be no gay pride parades or gay and lesbian magazines and websites, no Italian or German neighborhoods, no Chinatowns, no women’s health clubs like Curves®, and, in economic examples, no private schools or colleges. No one would want such things. Everyone would want only to be fully and completely assimilated with everyone else. But this is not what you want or what I want. Nor is it what


-----

##### liberals want; if it were, their kids wouldn’t be in private schools and there would be affordable public housing in ZIP code 90210. It is certainly not what affluent people want—they have worked very hard to arrive at the financial ability to segregate themselves.
 As a political exercise in America, we keep trying to desegregate society in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, and economic status; we have geographic redistribution schemes engineered into the code. Just about as fast as we democratize something, the people affected resegregate themselves. Hotels were once used only by the rich and by business travelers; they democratized prices, but then added concierge floors, then higher- and higher-priced hotels, even to the point of putting a Four Seasons inside the Mandalay Bay. When I started flying on business in the mid- 1970s, I was the young oddball in first class. With very rare exception, it was all 50-year-old white guys in suits and ties, frequent business travelers —the riffraff could not afford sitting there, and the divider was firmly policed by the flight attendants who brought us drinks, food, and even Playboy magazines and on long flights sat and played cards with us. Today, many flights have no first class, and those that do have seats dispensed at cheaper prices than 30 years ago (inflation adjusted) and often to people getting up there with frequent flier points. Air travel has been price democratized and desegregated, and even the crowd that used to go Greyhound® now flies the unfriendly skies. What happened? A giant boom for private aviation, featuring fractional jet ownership. You can’t stop segregation. And you damn sure can’t stop those with money from segregating themselves from everybody else.


-----

##### What the Gates Really Are A gated community is not really about protection from thundering hoards of criminals, as was a drawbridge and alligator-infested moat for the affluent tribe’s early predecessors. You are, of course, at far more risk of home invasion, burglary, and other crimes living in an inner-city ghetto than in a suburban gated community. Today’s gates are symbolic far more than functional. They are the grown-up version of the boys’ tree house with the rope ladder pulled up after only the chosen few in the club have climbed up. A symbol of exclusion. We are in, you are not, nah, nah, nah. The gates are symbolic of exceptional achievement, accomplishment, and status. Symbolic of the very existence of an elite tribe. Mostly, this is simple economic segregation. But as another example, consider the Florida city


-----

##### envisioned by Domino’s Pizza® founder Tom Monaghan, into which he poured hundreds of millions of dollars, his intent to create a Catholic gated community devoted to Catholic life. As a legal practicality, he couldn’t ban heathens or Baptists or Jehovah’s Witnesses; he could only design every brick, every cultural icon, every tribal activity to make them feel unwelcome. Gate at community’s entrance or cross in its town square, symbols of tribalism.


### Dan Kennedy’s #3 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Create the tribe your desired customers are eager to be a member of.


##### As a marketer to the affluent, it is vital you fully understand tribalism in general, and the affluent’s devotion to membership in smaller and smaller, seemingly more and more elite and therefore profoundly exclusionary tribes.
 The affluent tribalism is simply an extreme variation of all tribalism. The most important thing to understand about it is its emotional driving forces, so that you fully incorporate those same forces into your marketing. Those forces include those common to all tribalism: acceptance, recognition, peer approval, like-mindedness, and elitism. But the overriding driving force of affluent tribalism is validation of superiority. The affluent believe—whether through heritage or achievement—that they are inherently and profoundly superior to all others. The majority have arrived through accomplishment born of ingenuity and innovation, discipline and persistence, work ethic and related behavioral characteristics, as well as a philosophy they see lacking in the masses, so they do not view their affluence as luck or a gift but as a product of and then as proof of their superior character. In short, their affluence is a special form of moral authority and superiority. This is the belief system that gives


-----

##### affluent liberals and socialists their moral authority to dictate to others how they should live: Barbra Streisand telling people to dry their clothes on clotheslines rather than wasting energy on electric dryers, although it’s doubtful she has James Brolin out on the Malibu beach with laundry basket and clothespins. Al Gore preaching energy conservation to save the earth from global warming while flitting about in gas-guzzling private jets between giant, energy inefficient homes. Warren Buffett insisting “the rich” should pay more income tax while virtually all of his income is not subject to it, but instead taxed as capital gains. Nothing new here. Limousine liberals have been with us since first wealth. And, for the most part, they do not perceive themselves as disingenuous hypocrites. In their minds, they possess their special moral authority as superior beings.
 This is the same belief system that gives affluent conservatives their moral authority to dictate to others how they should live: Limbaugh, of whom I’m a fan, but still, Limbaugh railing against drug offenders from his radio pulpit while, for a time, indulging in his own addiction to pain killers not just by doctor shopping, but allegedly by sending his housekeeper out to buy stolen drugs from back-alley dealers. This is the belief system that keeps the rich’s reaction to the homeless fellow in the doorway “Get a job” rather than “There, but for the grace of God, go I.” Affluent conservatives believe their affluence is result of superior initiative and discipline, certainly not luck of the draw.
 If you are an affluent by accomplishment yourself, this may seem an unflattering glimpse in the mirror. Be that as it may, accurate, honest, realistic, and pragmatic assessment of the deep-seated beliefs of those you seek to sell to is valuable beyond price. Even the price of turning one’s self- portrait to face the wall. We are what we are.
 So, what do Superior Beings want? It’s really quite simple. Recognition as Superior Beings. The sort of segregation that kings and queens have always had, that is appropriate for kings and queens. Special privileges. Fawning service. Products, services, and places inaccessible to anyone but kings and queens.

### The Affluent E-Factors

##### “There is perhaps no feeling more acute than being left out.”

—MARK PENN, IN HIS BOOK MICROTRENDS

# A short preface … since publication of the first edition of this book in
##### 2009, I’ve gotten more unsolicited, favorable comments about this chapter than I would have guessed. Marketers and merchants of every stripe have told me of very practical applications—reworking their marketing, rewriting or replacing their advertising, altering the sales presentations and scripts they and their staffs use. A dentist conducting public seminars to get implant patients sent me his “before” script, his “after” script, and reported a 170% improvement in booking of appointments at the end of his


-----

##### seminars—accounting for over $600,000.00 more dentistry performed, year to year. I tell you this so that you don’t miss its importance. An investment firm retooled its lead generation advertising, making sure to embed all seven of the extra, affluent E-Factors below, and more than doubled response. I could go on. I tell you this so that you don’t somehow miss the importance and usefulness of this chapter.

 E-Factors are the emotional drivers of buying behavior. For years I have taught sales professionals and marketers a generic list of E-Factors and done my level best to get them to rely on that list, whether selling to the CEO in the boardroom or mom ‘n’ dad in the kitchen at home. The most common mistake made by marketers is an egotistical belief that their customers are smarter, more rational, and more sophisticated than others, thus not controlled by E-Factors. It’s a costly egotism. Everybody’s buying behavior is driven by emotions, justified as necessary, after the fact, with logic.


### Generic E-Factors that Apply to Everybody

##### Fear Guilt

 Pride Greed

 Love


##### In addition to the E-Factors affecting everybody, the affluent have a particular set of E-Factors to consider, some of which may surprise you:


-----

##### • insecurity
 • fear of being found fakers
 • desperate desire not to commit a faux pas
 • today, not passé
 • feeding emotional emptiness
 • giving selves gold stars
 • after all, what’s the point of being rich

 The affluent are insecure in many ways. They certainly worry about going backward, about losing their money, status, or privileges. If you’ve never been rich, you have no frame of reference, but if you’ve been rich then poor, you know what you’re missing! They are acutely aware of the aggravations, inconveniences, and financial difficulties endured daily by ordinary mortals that they have left behind—and lose a few winks every night worrying about waking up back there again.
 More importantly, they are concerned with being found out. Affluents who have gotten there largely or totally on their own become keenly aware that everybody else thinks of them as profoundly smarter or more talented or privy to special information or otherwise superhuman. Many actually use this in the attainment of career or business success, making themselves into and being accepted as wizards. I’ve been in the wizard business myself for three decades and have wound up hanging out with an entire community of them. We know wizardry is more illusion than reality. I often say if ordinary people realized how ordinary in capability most millionaires are, there’d be a lot more millionaires—what holds most back isn’t lack of opportunity or lack of capability, but the illusory belief that millionaires possess some special abilities they do not. The affluent are also very sensitive to judgment by their own chosen tribe or other affluents and are worried about “using the wrong fork” one way or another, showing up in an out-of-fashion dress, not knowing what the others know and converse about during cocktails at the club. Think of the whole thing as a high school clique, and everyone in it as desperate for acceptance by the others and secretly feeling the others may be superior.
 These anxieties actually spur a lot of productive behaviors and ironically contribute to the successful becoming more successful, the rich becoming richer. They may eat healthier and exercise more to look better as


-----

##### a path to status with peers. They may read more, read more eclectically, and stay more abreast of political and financial news, leading to more successful investing. They may contribute to charitable and civic organizations and activities as a means of self-validation and validation within the tribe. These anxieties can obviously be used in selling to them, and both for-profit and nonprofit marketers should pay heed.
 Then there is the matter of emotional emptiness—the longstanding debate, and joking about, whether or not money can buy happiness. People without money like making themselves feel better about their situation by insisting that the rich are no happier and may be less happy than the non- rich. Having been poor and now relatively rich, I can assure you that money buys a lot of access to opportunities, experiences, comforts, and conveniences that can lead to happiness, but I don’t think it directly and itself buys happiness. Other than Disney’s® Scrooge McDuck®, I don’t know of anybody who gets joy from going into his vault and playing with his money like a child playing with toys. But I know quite a few affluent adults who buy some very expensive toys and enjoy playing with them very much. There is, however, an underlying level of disappointment in most affluents with the fact that their affluence isn’t a true Easy Button™ that works without fail or a crown everyone recognizes and bows to. When I switched from driving old, bad, cheap, beater cars to my first shiny new Lincoln Continental, it was a supreme disappointment to discover that birds crapped on its hood with impunity, just as they had my bad cars. You’d think the birds would show some respect! And it is true that a lot of affluent consumers’ purchasing is done as a means of showing themselves respect and giving themselves recognition for their hard work and accomplishment that they don’t feel they are getting from others. Being told, subtly, that “you deserve this (and most others don’t)” and “owning this signifies accomplishment and status and commands respect” is extremely persuasive to the affluent.


-----

### Dan Kennedy’s #4 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Make owning your product or being your client signify something.


##### Recognition Does Matter Should you, for a moment, think the affluent are not motivated by this seeking of recognition, you should familiarize yourself with the fundraising modus operandi of the Republican and Democratic parties and candidates. Much of it revolves around motivating affluent individuals to be bundlers and bring together groups of maximum donors, thus raising $50,000.00 to $100,000.00, or more in clumps, for which the bundler is rewarded with invitations to special events like cocktail receptions at the Vice President’s home or dinners with a Congressman seated at every table of eight, photos with the politicians, little trinkets like presidential seal cufflinks and suitable-for-framing parchment certificates. I have seen it as a donor myself and used it to help political candidates as an advisor. It is every bit as pin and medal driven as a direct-selling organization like Mary Kay® or Amway®, except money is being raised rather than made, and it is millionaires and multimillionaires vying for the emerald or ruby or diamond pin, rather than cosmetic, vitamin, and soap sales agents.
 The mass-affluent also have their own special E-Factors:

 • the aspirational acquisition
 • I own therefore I am
 • knowing the secret handshake and having those who know it know
 you know it

 This is all about being part of the clique. It once was all about having stepped up. Having visibly arrived. In the post-World War II era, when the suburbs were becoming both a place and a way of life, it was called “keeping up with the Joneses.” Auto, TV, home improvement, and similar industries—as well as credit companies—benefited by this force of nature; if one driveway on the street suddenly provided home to a new station wagon, a fleet of station wagons was sure to follow. But today, there is a more complex collection of emotional drivers behind the purchases of the


-----

##### mass-affluent. There is some of the “Look, we’ve arrived” going on, but a lot of purchases are made as a forward statement of “where we’re going.” I call these aspirational acquisitions. The woman with a full-time career and two kids who is too exhausted to cook anything you can’t microwave in its own dish still buys a $75,000.00 custom kitchen with a cooking island and state-of-the-art equipment, as she aspires to be more Martha than Rachael, and intends to devote more time to the art of cooking very soon. If you carefully tour the typical mass-affluent’s home, you’ll find ownership of all sorts of things bought because his peers have them, other things bought with the strong intention of investing time and energy in them sometime soon—from nearly empty home wine cellars to rarely used home gyms and saunas.
 The affluent seem to mature in their attitudes about owning things, and the longer they are affluent and the more affluent they are, the more they choose and buy luxury goods and services for practical and functional reasons regardless of symbolic statement made. But for the mass-affluent, the things they buy and own and their self-images are tightly linked. “I own, therefore I am” is a powerful driving force. If the most popular and perceived-as-sophisticated mom in the neighborhood wears x, drives x, enrolls her child in x, and I do the same, I am as sophisticated as she. Ownership equals being.
 You can profit significantly by giving serious thought to how you may present your products, services, and business in sync with these E-Factors.

#### Book One Summation

### There has been such a constantly rising tide of good economic news
##### during the first 18 months or so of the Trump presidency that almost unbridled optimism has pushed all caution into exile. But, as I completed this, late in 2018, an alarm-bell fact was that the average consumer debt per U.S. household was at a record high, topping the peak immediately preceding the 2008 crash and tiresomely long, slow recovery. Some would argue that the debt is inflated by mortgage debt and student loan debt (in record delinquency) and that if those are separated from all other consumer debt, there’s less reason for worry. To


-----

##### me this is akin to insisting, if separating Lincoln’s assassination from the evening, it was a nice night at the theater. Debt is debt is debt, and a highly indebted consumer population is fragile, its future spending unreliable. That makes taking it for granted stupid.

 The next recession may be close or far, triggered by unsustainable debt or unleashed inflation or overseas economic troubles washing to our shores or any number of other predicates, alone or combined, but two things are certain: One, there will be one, and two, the epic-sized debt will not be helpful when it occurs.

 Raising your aim to more affluent clientele makes perfect sense in good economic times when there is robust spending from top to bottom of the money pyramid. Even when spending is flowing from the middle class and even lower earners, there’s still more price and profit elasticity with affluent customers. But the case for going there now not later is also founded on sensible, responsible prudence. When an economic “adjustment” comes—not if; when—it is always too late for most to abruptly move up to higher, safer ground. Desperate need may be motivational, but it is rarely helpful in practical terms. Falling off a high cliff is, I imagine, motivational, but it’s a tick late as motivation for erecting a safety fence at cliff’s edge or donning a parachute or putting a safety net at the bottom.

 By all means, profit from and enjoy a boom like the one we’ve been experiencing as I’ve been updating this book. Celebration is fine. But the business owner and leader must be creatively schizophrenic. Simultaneously enjoying dancing in the summer sun and readying for fall and winter. The best time to buy insulation, a new furnace, and firewood is before there is even a chill wind foretelling of winter.

# There was a time when coffee was coffee. Ice cream was ice cream. A
##### phone was a phone. Even a pair of shoes was, well, just a pair of shoes.
 At one level, at the lowest price and profit level, there are still merchants stuck in this time warp, continuing to conduct business as if people still bought products.
 Today, that cup of coffee comes with more options than a Lexus®. Would you care to add … vanilla or caramel syrup? A double shot? Foam?


-----

##### Cinnamon sprinkles? Thus, the $5.00 price for the $.50 cup of coffee. But even that is only half the story. Ordinary products morphing into complex arrays of choices, options, add-ons, brands, and luxury brands is one way prices have been inflated and margins inflated even more. The profit margin of the double shot of extra something or other far exceeds the profit margin of the cup of coffee itself. The designer-name bag selling for $4,000.00 does not cost 100 times more to make than the similar-appearing bag sold at Target® for $40.00. This is a path to profit—and to greater acceptance by affluent consumers. But, as I said, it is only half the story.
 Starbucks® does not define itself as a coffee shop or even more elegantly as a coffeehouse. The company describes itself as being in the “third-place business”—home, office, Starbucks® in between. It is not a merchant just of jazzed-up coffee drinks. It is a merchant of place, of feelings, of status, and maybe most of all, of experience. Its inspirations are more Disney® than Denny’s®. One of the many students of the Starbucks® phenomenon, Ken Herbst, assistant professor of marketing at Wake Forest University’s Babcock Graduate School of Management, makes the obvious point: “If you walked up to someone about to buy a pound of coffee at the grocery store (at about $4.00 a pound) and tried selling them just a cup for $5.00 they would tell you that is too expensive. But if you are at the coffeehouse, you are going to pay for the experience.”


### Dan Kennedy’s #5 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Break the chains that bind in your own mind. More success and

##### This means that price is not tied to product. As soon as you disconnect those two things in your own mind about your own products and services, you’ll be liberated to make a great deal more money and to have


-----

##### much greater success appealing to affluent customers or clients. To be redundant for emphasis, most business owners are severely handicapped by keeping price and product linked in their own minds. What I call the price- product link is as restrictive and antiquated as the Work-Money Link that I take apart in my book No B.S. Wealth Attraction in the New Economy. These links are imaginary. They exist only in your mind, not in the marketplace, yet they are ties that bind as if real, physical, 1,000-pound chains.
 The price-product link becomes ingrained religious belief in most business owners, beginning with textbook formulas for setting price. Retailers are taught the doctrine of keystone pricing meaning double their own cost. If you buy it for $1.00, it should be priced at $2.00, then, at times, discounted from there. In my line of work, direct marketing—what was once called mail order—we’re also taught formulaic markup as doctrine, although ours is eight times rather than two times. In businesses where raw materials are converted to finished products, like printing, there is a plethora of price-calculating software to do the thinking for you, using standardized markup formulas. In every case, the price is chained to the product. There is the fundament that a particular product is worth only a certain multiple of its cost and not a penny more, period, end of story. Unfortunately, this widely and deeply held belief is completely and utterly stupid.
 The two biggest chain cutters that de-link price from product are 1) who is buying the product and 2) the context in which the product is presented, priced, and delivered.
 The who is what this book is all about. The simple act of selling whatever you sell to more affluent consumers may allow its price to rise, with no other modifications.
 Price for the same product also varies by context. This is easy to see with commodity items like food, even though many restaurant owners still never grasp it. When is a third pound of peanuts not a third pound of peanuts? In a jar, on the shelf, that’s all they are, unless dusted with Starbucks® mocha latte powder and packaged in a fancy tin. But when served hot, from a vendor’s cart in the park, scooped into the bag and sprinkled with cinnamon by a handlebar-mustached man in red-and-white striped jacket and straw hat, with calliope music playing from the CD


-----

##### player in the cart, they are not peanuts at all. They are an experience that evokes emotional feelings. Even as you read my words, your mind may have flashed to Mary Poppins in the park or a trip to the circus as a child. While it is not so easy for most to transfer this idea to other businesses, it does, in fact, transfer to any business. Context alters or liberates price. Move the exact same product from one context to another and its price can easily be altered.

 What It Is Needn’t Determine What It Is A visit to the dentist can be just a visit to the dentist. Cleaning and checkup, a routine experience and a routine price. Or it can mean being picked up at your home by the dental office’s gleaming white limousine, brought to the elegantly appointed office with a grand piano playing itself in the lobby, neatly uniformed staff rising to greet you at the door and escort you to a comfortable chair, get you a fresh-brewed latte, offer you a choice of magazines (just like what stewardesses used to do for first-class passengers on airlines a decade ago) … then, only a few minutes later, escort you to the spa room for your complimentary manicure and hand massage … then to the dental hygienist for your regular cleaning, plus a whitening treatment while you relax in a dental chair with a full-body massage pad and gentle heat and listen to your favorite music, not piped-in elevator music or, worse, the radio … then back to the spa for some anti-aging skin treatments … and back to the limo, carrying a complimentary gift basket of little soaps and skin lotions along with your tote bag containing your next three months’ supply of specially formulated toothpaste, whitener, and breath freshener. The charges for the cleaning, whitening treatment, and products are all evened out during the year as a monthly membership fee automatically charged to your credit card, so there is no plebian act of standing at the front desk at the end of your visit, reviewing charges and writing out a check, nor any such bill arriving in the mail.
 We can give just about anything a comparable makeover. A meeting with the financial advisor or tax accountant, a visit to the sporting goods store, a stay at a hotel, even a true business-to-business experience, like buying and receiving printing from the printer or industrial parts from a manufacturer. Somewhere in the process there is opportunity to alter the


-----

##### experience and the way the buyer feels about it. It begins with determining the feelings you want to create for the buyer: security and peace of mind. Being pampered like a queen or king. Nostalgia. Whatever. It is this that unties price from the anchor of product and allows it to float upward like a helium-filled balloon on a slightly breezy day.
 Different buyers want different experiences and the feelings they invoke in different circumstances.
 I choose to fly private rather than commercial, at substantial expense, with practical rationalization tied to the extremely high value of my time and the urgency with which I need to get where I’m going or to get home and get to work. But, as confession, it is at least as much about being and feeling special. For one person using private aviation, that might mean status lorded over others. That’s not it for me. For some, it might be about the pampering. Not for me. For me it is—after 20 years of suffering the ever-worsening indignities, inconveniences, and stresses of ordinary air travel—about escape from the way ordinary folk must travel, to a better experience. The feeling to me is similar to the one I get going downstairs to my basement office and being at my chosen work in minutes, in comfortable clothes, knowing that outside, thousands of ordinary people are slogging through snow, waiting for cars to warm, enduring bumper-to- bumper traffic in hour-long commutes. In short, it is about a feeling of superiority.
 Yet I get my hair cut at a walk-in, no-appointment hair cutting place. There’s nothing about it that makes me feel special. To the contrary, I prize the in-and-out speed and simplicity more than anything else. But someone else my very same age and income might profoundly prefer a trip to a very upscale men’s salon with mahogany paneling, plasma TVs playing sporting events, and relative quiet that takes four times as long and costs ten times the price. Not necessarily because the haircut is any different. Because the feeling he gets from the experience is meaningful and therefore valuable to him.
 Affluent consumers do not simply choose the priciest option of everything in every category. Different affluent consumers value different experiences differently. It’s up to you, the marketer, to find the group of affluent consumers you can match up with an experience you design and can deliver, that disconnects price from product.

 to Syria aboard the Orient Express “to shoot swans with a
 chromium-plated submachine gun.”

# In response to an article of mine in my No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent
##### Letter, a No B.S. Inner Circle Member sent me this note:

I have to confess, we **worry a lot at our company about**

pricing. So I was astonished to find out about Williams

s/h. Or your own personalized Halloween cookies, three

cookies, $24.00. You could combine the apple and cookies

at $43.50. For a discount on shipping, buy $150.00 worth.

Though **I am appalled, it appears that there is a large**

enough set of people for and to whom these things appeal,

as Williams-Sonoma does a very good business. Reaffirms

the adage that “you are not your customer,” or perhaps

more accurately, “you are not necessarily your customer.”

##### That you are not your customer is an astute observation and brings me impetus for a very important discussion.
 First, note that Williams-Sonoma® is a cataloger focusing on the mass-affluent, not ultra- or super-affluent. Its products are routinely purchased by hundreds of thousands of households with an annual income in the $100,000.00 neighborhood. The $19.00 apples are NOT being nibbled on by only a few eccentric multimillionaires who also clean their eyeglasses with hundreddollar bills. It is VITAL that, through this book, from catalogs like Williams-Sonoma’s, and as many other sources as possible, you get, accept, embrace, fully internalize that the mass-affluent class of consumers in America is spending like crazy on premium-priced luxury goods and services, buying all manner of things that will shock you. (I recently reserved a suite at a Disney® hotel—where families go on vacation—at $1,800.00 a night, and it was the last of two remaining rooms in the entire hotel in January.)
 Second, of all possible reactions to discoveries like these, being appalled is least appropriate. Let’s consider the reasons somebody might be appalled (my subscriber didn’t enunciate his). One would be the “children are starving somewhere” idea, that if people didn’t pay $19.00 for caramel apples, somehow starving urchins somewhere would be fed and cared for. Gee, if it really were that simple to solve poverty and world hunger, I’d give up my $19.00 apples and my luxury SUV and my $800.00


-----

##### cowboy boots tomorrow. But that’s just not how money really moves around, how wealth or poverty is caused or affected, and I’d refer anybody wrestling with that idea to my No B.S. Wealth Attraction book. Until you come to grips with the truth about prosperity NEVER being a zero-sum game, where one person’s wealth or, by your judgment, waste deprives someone else, you are hamstrung, handcuffed, hog-tied mentally, emotionally, and practically in your own attraction of wealth. The supply of wealth to which all have ready access based exclusively on their own chosen behaviors is not a debit-credit system at all. This is contrary to what 95% believe to be true about money, but it is not coincidental that 95% have comparatively little while 5% have most of it.
 Or somebody might be appalled at the wretched excess, the foolish spending. I’ve been broke; I have a gut-level, visceral reaction to what I judge as waste. But that imposes your value judgments or mine on others. A devout atheist opposed to all religion might very well view your $20.00 put into the church collection plate en route to the Vatican with just as jaundiced an opinion as your critical view of his purchase and enjoyment of a $20.00 apple. One man’s wretched excess is another’s highest and best value.
 There are better (more profitable) reactions than being appalled. One is to use this information as fodder for your own continuing inner thoughts, dialogue, and (probably, hopefully) reorientation of your understanding of price, value, consumer behavior. Another is to be inspired and motivated, to re-examine your beliefs about your own customers’ or clients’ attitudes, spending, interests, and passions, and to search for opportunities to 1) design and offer premium-priced goods and services (options or levels) to your present clientele and/or 2) seek out a clientele that places price very low in its list of Buying Decision Factors. (As an example of that, imagine how many restaurant owners, grocers, gift shop owners, and so on will read this chapter but will never bother to go to www.SRDS.com, find the Williams-Sonoma mailing lists, contact the list manager, and rent the best Williams-Sonoma buyers they can in their area to promote their businesses to!”
 Back to understanding value: No, a $19.00 apple a day won’t keep doctors at bay any better than a $1.00 apple, at least as a result of its nutritional properties. (It might, based on its effect on the consumer’s


-----

##### positive attitude. But that’s not my principal argument here.) The value that motivates the Williams-Sonoma buyer to pay $19.00 for the apple is not in the apple at all. It may be in the impact of it given as a gift or served at a party. It may be in the feelings of success or prosperity or of rewarding oneself with indulgence that comes with making the purchase (even before ever taking a bite of the apple). It may be a sense of superiority, of buying or serving the best or something unique and unusual. Bragging rights: It’s a trophy apple, because, after all, we can’t really frame and hang our bankbooks on the wall for all visitors to see, so instead we opt for other visual representations of our achievement and success: trophy car, trophy house, trophy watch, trophy wife, trophy apple. It may be the time saved and convenience of ordering from the catalog rather than schlepping off to a gourmet store across town. It may be all those things. It is certainly mostly emotional and psychological, not practical. Thus, the $19.00 apple may very well contribute to the person’s emotional well-being in ways a grocery-store apple cannot.
 When I was young and poor and insecure, just starting in business and routinely asking older, more successful people to give me money, I bought and drove fancy Lincoln Continental Town Cars. And I always flew first class—at the time the only young kid up front, surrounded by 50-year-old executives. I didn’t drive the car or fly first class for its impact on others; I did so for its impact on me, for its programming of my own psyche. Neither the value of the car nor that of the first-class tickets for me had anything to do with getting from place to place. The value to me was purchased confidence and feelings of parity and belonging, of having arrived where I was actually trying to get.
 Personally, I don’t wear a watch at all. Years back, I owned and wore a Rolex® and a TAG Heuer®, but such things no longer interest me. But I pass no judgment on the fellow who wears one or ten and proudly flexes his cuffs at every chance in order to display them. I also understand that the different motivations different people have at different times of their lives for paying $5,000.00 or $50,000.00 for a wristwatch having nothing whatsoever to do with their need to know precisely what time it is. For that, of course, a $50.00 Timex® will do just fine.
 The most successful marketers learn not to question how the public or their customers get value—only to strive to find out about it, recognize

##### it, and capitalize on it. To be of service means offering and delivering what customers value; that’s the role of the businessperson. Should you feel a need instead to impose your value criteria on others, you ought to exit business and enter politics or ministry.

#### CHAPTER 14

### Stop Selling Products and Services

##### “Any fool can make soap. It takes a genius to sell soap.”

—MR. GAMBLE OF PROCTOR & GAMBLE

# A short preface … when I wrote the first version of this chapter for the
##### first edition of this book, published in 2009, even I didn’t foresee the rapidly accelerating, expansive wave of fundamental disinterest in things. In stuff. The most functional, basic products are no longer sold successfully based on functionality—phones are a great example. I have, in very recent years, become acutely aware that it is the poorly compensated, poorly skilled salesman, marketer, or copywriter who defaults to: Product/Service, Features/Benefits, Proposition/Price when selling. People, particularly the


-----

##### affluent, were losing interest in these tried-and-true approaches to selling when I first wrote this chapter. They have lost all tolerance for it now. Today’s luxury automobile is defined by its state-of-the-art technology, and sold by these features—not by its functionality as a car. Even a simple refrigerator is far from that. The highest priced models are digital, with giant iPads on their doors; they play videos. They respond to voice commands. They order whatever they are out of from Amazon. Water cannot be just water. It must be infused. It must have a story. It needs to convey status. The more affluent the consumer, the more capable they are of indulging these “significance impulses,” and the more they should be encouraged in doing so.
 There is an inside joke in the acting profession about the lowliest of walk-on extras, in a crowd in the background of the scene, there to wave and yell excitedly on cue. He disrupts the shoot, leaping from the crowd to confront the director with “But what’s my ‘motivation’?” This is today’s consumer. For even the most mundane of purchases, they are asking, “But what’s my ‘motivation’?”

 A cloth bag is not worth $4,000.00 without the Gucci® logo, or some other designer’s logo.
 You may feel that it is not worth $4,000.00 with the logo,7 either. But that reveals you remain hung up on what a product is, instead of what it symbolizes and represents, what status it confers on its owner, what emotional reactions it evokes, how it feels to purchase and own it, how others important to its owner feel about it.
 Few things are intrinsically worth their price. We have all accepted that a diamond engagement ring priced at least equal to two months’ salary is a requirement. But the diamond may be far, far, far more artificially inflated from its actual cost of materials than that Gucci® cloth bag. Diamonds are, in essence, polished dirt.

 A Great Ad Campaign Can Last Forever


-----

##### While most businesspeople think of De Beers’s dominance in the diamond industry as a result of controlling supply, truth is, it is more the result of creating and manipulating demand, thanks to brilliant advertising delivering a consistent theme for half a century.
 Finding rocks is easy. Selling rocks, tough. In the last 50 years, only two markets have opened up for stones. You wear them on your fingers when in love; you put them over the head of a loved one after death. The second was mastered by the Rock of Ages Corporation. The first by De Beers and its holding company, a near monopoly. The product itself—diamonds—was a loser. If you apply ordinary supply and demand, every diamond dug diminishes the value of those already dug because, in fact, diamonds are forever. Further, they are plentiful. De Beers recognized the problem with its mundane commodity, so it took the radical move of ignoring inherent value altogether. Instead the company made the product ritualistic and metaphoric, its purchase mandatory without practical purpose. This required the use of advertising to create demand where there was none, and no reason for any. This defies, of course, one of the oldest, most tired business axioms: find a need and fill it.
 Before the first ad ever appeared, some of the most extensive market research in advertising history was conducted, including direct questioning of thousands of men and women. The researchers determined that women had to be convinced that the diamond was the ritualized representation of love, commitment, and marriage. For women, the “diamond is forever” positioning began in advertising in 1914 and has continued unchanged to this day. And, to solve the forever problem, De Beers created the 10th anniversary ring, 25th anniversary ring, and similar products.
 The researchers also determined that men had to be helped past confusion about how to buy this polished rock. For men, the industry’s voodoo about carat weight, color, clarity, and so forth was created to provide logic where there was none. Men wanted to know what it was worth. Since it was arguably worth nothing, a logic had to be invented to assign worth to it. But in the cleverest of all gambits, a simpler shortcut for buying decisions was also created, stating the price in the frame of the buyer’s own wages: “How can you make two months’ salary last forever?” Today, the two-months-salary-rule is widely accepted by the public.
 In truth, what De Beers did for diamonds, anyone can do for anything.


-----

##### You’re aware there are wines that sell for hundreds of dollars per bottle. But there is a Samuel Adams beer that sells for $140.00 per bottle. How can beer be worth such a price? You may answer: It can’t. Or answer: Why not?
 To make a giant income marketing to the affluent, you must erase your own deeply ingrained insistence at connecting price to worth and worth to function.
 A business associate told me how her neighbors paid a local architect $67,000.00 to draw up plans for a new house to be built on their beachfront lot. She found an architect to do what she judged to be identical work—if not better—for her new house to be built on her beachfront lot, paying just $7,000.00. And she questioned her neighbors’ sanity at failing to shop around, at paying such an outrageously inflated fee. She was proud of her bargain. But, contrary to protestations of the psychiatric community, there is abundant evidence that, in our society, insanity is subjective. My kudos go to the architect commanding his $67,000.00 fee. In all probability, he secured it for things other than a tube of blueprints. My associate may very well be correct in judging her $7,000.00 blueprints just as good as the ones delivered for $67,000.00. But her $7,000.00 ones didn’t come with the pride, status validation, bragging rights, and other emotional benefits her neighbors derived from searching out and hiring the biggest name, purportedly the most sought-after architect in the tri-state area, an architect, in fact, who had done the plans for a famous celebrity’s new beach house and who had three homes he’d designed featured in Town & Country magazine.


### Dan Kennedy’s #6 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Marketing to values is more powerful than the marketing of products.


-----

##### On closer examination, this little story reveals even more. It shows two people’s very different values, and why what I call marketing to values is so much more important and powerful than is the marketing of products. My business associate is a woman who, her whole life, has competed with men, has made herself successful in a field difficult for women, has fought being taken for granted as a blonde beauty, and prides herself on her mental toughness, shrewdness, and won’t-take-no-for-an-answer-ism. One of her highest and most important personal values is that “nobody pulls the wool over my eyes.” Her neighbor is the second, younger wife of a wealthy doctor from a wealthy family—but she came from a poor family, grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, and, in her first marriage, lived a blue-collar life. Her beauty got her the trophy wife position, but she found herself thought of and gossiped about as a classless bimbo rather than accepted into the rich wives’ sorority. She has been a relentless social climber ever since, by donating to charities, sponsoring charity balls, patronizing the hairstylist, the cosmetic surgeon, the personal trainer, and being seen in the most current designer fashions, in an orchestrated effort to force her husband’s peers’ wives to accept her into their circle. One of her most treasured values is their acceptance or their envy. In reality, neither her payment of $67,000.00 to her architect nor my friend’s payment of her negotiated $7,000.00 to her architect had much to do with the comparative intrinsic or actual value of the work reflected in the two sets of blueprints.
 Another way to look at this, as a marketer, is a choice between selling things with ham-handed, brute force, typically against resistance, or selling aspirations and emotional fulfillments with finesse, typically with little resistance. Which seems like it might be more pleasurable? More profitable?

### Indulgences

##### “Kids in Beverly Hills 90210 put on their own unique Christmas
 pageant, and the first scene, in particular, was fascinating. In it, Mary and Joseph are going to Bethlehem to pay their taxes. One
 little girl was Mary, one little boy was Joseph, a fat kid was the

—BOB ORBEN, TV COMEDY WRITER AND DIRECTOR OF WHITE HOUSE

SPEECHWRITING DURING THE GERALD FORD ADMINISTRATION

# One of the most important facts about the mass-affluent is that they
##### do not trade up across the board. In his research, Michael Silverstein, author of Trading Up: Why Consumers Want New Luxury Goods—and How


-----

##### Companies Create Them, found that the typical mass-affluent person seeks little steps up in a lot of things, makes major steps up in only one to three things, and remains unmoved by luxury, brand, experience, or other factors in many other purchase categories. To put that in a frame of example, Mrs. Mass-Affluent may indulge in little things like going to Starbucks® rather than Denny’s® or to Cold Stone Creamery® instead of Dairy Queen®; may buy luxury-brand drop-downs like the line of Vera Wang® designer duds sold at Kohl’s®; may have one category of purchase where price is literally out the window—perhaps the care and feeding of her poodle—but may also still buy whatever coffee is on sale at the supermarket absent brand loyalty and recoil at the price for a Lexus®, preferring a Toyota®.
 She is a complicated creature. This makes marketing to the mass-affluent a complicated thing. Luxury-goods merchants have caught on and are very much engaging in what I just referred to as luxury drop-down. The makers of old-line luxury goods like Mercedes® automobiles or Coach® bags have created lower- priced products—usually smaller, with fewer features, but of the same quality and bearing the brand name—enabling the mass-affluent consumer to cross the luxury line without qualm. Some luxury merchants have found enormous leverage in leaving a huge chasm between their top-priced items and their new luxury-for-the-masses merchandise. Women who can’t afford one, and even those who can, might blanch at a $10,000.00 Vera Wang® dress but be quite happy to pay $99.00 for a Vera Wang® blouse at Kohl’s®. But without knowledge of the $10,000.00 dresses, they’d balk at such a high price for that blouse. Some marketers, including several of my clients, even go so far as to create and promote red-herring-priced goods or services they hope no one buys, only to set a standard that makes their actual prices seem imminently reasonable by comparison. I talk more about this in Chapter 28, “You Need to Choose Your Prices Carefully.”

 Their Little Indulgences Equal Big Profit Improvements Let’s go back to the Starbucks® and Cold Stone creameries® of the world. In these businesses, almost any marketer can find practical inspiration. While many mass-affluent consumers who are easily able to afford high-fee cosmetic dentistry, luxury cars, first-class travel, or designer fashions may


-----

##### find the price tags too big to swallow, they are easily wooed by little luxuries. For what seems like a small uptick in price—yet is a very big increase in profit margin for the merchant—the consumer can feel affluent yet not like somebody just throwing money around, can feel special without guilt. A $70,000.00 sticker on a car, a $35,000.00 fee quoted by the dentist, a $2,000.00 airline ticket—these are all so in-your-face. On the surface, the difference between the $70,000.00 car vs. the $35,000.00 car isn’t so great; a car may feel like a car. On the plane, all the seats arrive at the same time. But the fact that you can pick up a half gallon of ice cream at the supermarket for about the same price as a tiny cup of ice cream at Cold Stone Creamery® is more disconnected. The experience is dramatically different. At the creamery, you pick out your flavor, your ground-up pie crust and candy bars, and watch your dessert being made for you on a granite slab. “The Ultimate Ice Cream Experience.®” The price is still easily found in pocket or purse. It requires no thought, is done on impulse, feels good, and is easily rationalized if need be—I’ve had a hard day, I deserve it.
 These little indulgences do add up. It is frequently pointed out by Scrooge-like, annoyingly practical financial experts like David Bach, author of the Automatic Millionaire books, Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey, and their ilk that, were someone to forego all the Starbucks® and Cold Stone® and Omaha Steaks® purchases in favor of coffee brewed at home and carried in a thermos, ice cream bars bought at the grocery store and kept in the office freezer, and so on, he would quite easily save $25.00 to $50.00 a week, $1,300.00 to $2,600.00 a year, and, if it were all wisely invested even at modest interest rates, could add well over a quarter of a million dollars to his retirement fund or pay off his home mortgage during his working-life years. It is a wildly unpersuasive argument. As Pamela Danziger, author of Shopping: Why We Love It and How Retailers Can Create the Ultimate Customer Experience, puts it: “We want our little pleasures and we want them now.”


-----

### Dan Kennedy’s #7 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Don’t forget to offer your customer’s little indulgences opportunities for
 self-imposed inflation.


##### Danziger has termed this inching up of price “luxflation.” A form of self-induced inflation, experienced by consumers willing to pay what seems little more for much better experiences—when, in fact, that little more may be a 500% to 5,000% premium. It’s ironic that the government, economists, and the media sweat bullets and display great angst over inflation creeping up by a half of a percent or a percent while consumers cheerfully accept 500% inflation in dozens of purchases every day. This is important to grasp, as it affects every business. Mass-affluent consumers may complain about inflation in general or many items’ prices in particular, yet that can have zero impact on their response to your prices.
 These little indulgences can really add up for you. This is not really new. The story is now legend of how the dime-store soda fountains survived the Great Depression with the point-of-sale strategy, where the counterman responded to the milkshake order by asking, “Do you want yours with one egg or two?” What hasn’t changed is that ATS (average transaction size) is one of the most important numbers to know, manage, and work at improving in many businesses, whether you sell milkshakes to frequent customers or farm tractors to very infrequent repeat customers. To continue the milkshake example, let’s say we own an ice cream stand where the cashier responds to each order by presenting the offer of a double flavor shot and an extra scoop of fresh fruit. If half say yes to the extra $.55, and they serve 50 shakes a day, that’s $.275 added to every transaction. If the shake itself sells for $1.50, we have increased the average transaction size by 18%. But we may have increased the average margin, invisibly, by much more. Of course, if we can alter the whole


-----

##### experience to support a higher price, still add the extra fruit, and add a big chocolate chip cookie, well, we might take our $1.50 average transaction to $3.50. On a grander scale, we may turn our ice cream stand into a much- talked about, much-preferred destination of the mass-affluent rather than just one of a dozen same-as, same-as places in town. Being in the little- indulgence business in a big way can lead to much bigger profits, but even to something more valuable: sustainable unique positioning in your customers’ minds and lives.
 For your own education, pick up copies of The Robb Report and a magazine called Cowboys & Indians at your local bookstore or other newsstand. The latter isn’t really about cowboys and Indians, by the way. Examine every ad. You will see a demonstration of how many indulgences are offered to the affluent and get an idea of how much they spend on them. While you’re at it, pick up copies of magazines about boating and yachting, private aviation, luxury travel. Go to the next big RV Show or Boat Show that comes to your city. It’ll do you good to get out more. Here, I present just a small window into this kind of spending. Some would consider it profligate spending. But, as an early mentor counseled me, denying the existence of cash registers or being a critic of them is guaranteed to be unprofitable. The best thing to do is make sure you are on the right side of them!

 Money Spent on Passions
 I make this point numerous time in this book; few affluent consumers and even fewer mass-affluents buy premium goods and services or spend freely across the board. The greatest dichotomy I personally know of is a person who routinely buys and enjoys expensive, imported caviar but also frequently parks her Mercedes® in the parking lot behind the bread company’s store and there, furtively, buys day-old bread. I know a former Fortune 500 CEO who will pay virtually any price without thought for a round of golf, and fire up the private jet to get there, but buys his khaki slacks at Target®, and has been known to pull out Valpak® coupons at restaurants. Just getting the more affluent customer is not necessarily the golden key to far greater income. Getting the more affluent


-----

##### customer passionately interested in your category of product, service, expertise, or experience is.
 One certain way to connect with affluent consumers is to connect to their passions.
 Read Cigar Aficionado magazine, and you will discover a subculture where people passionate about cigars spend sums shocking to all others on rolled-up weeds you set fire to. As example, consider the elegant yet practical Elie Bleu Coral New Medals Humidor, featuring exotic dyed Sycamore wood, Spanish cedar interior, eight coats of varnish, and a lock and key safeguarding up to 110 cigars. Just $2,799.99.
 In the book Turning Silver into Gold: How to Profit in the New Boomer Marketplace, researcher Dr. Mary Furlong writes in-depth about what she calls “the passion and play market,” where companies and even entire industries are, pardon the pun, booming thanks to Boomers’ and especially affluent Boomers’ willingness to spend without budget and buy without price resistance.
 Consider the wine business. Once, a rather narrow, elite, and quite limited customer base predominantly populated by the affluent and ultra- affluent supported a closeted industry largely invisible or mysterious and intimidating, thus of little interest to the mass public. Today, the major wine aficionado magazines are sold on newsstands, and the huge public food shows attended by tens of thousands in each city have become wine and food shows. AARP has its own wine club, wine events, newsletters, and programs, but the buying of fine wines and expensive wines, the installing of home wine cellars, the joining of wine clubs have moved from affluent to mass-affluent, from 50-plus down to 30-plus. This is luxury democratized. A special interest becoming a widespread interest.
 Passion and play is the surest way to de-link price from pragmatism. The mass-affluent who will grumble about the total charge rung up at the grocery-store checkout counter for a week’s groceries will separately sign up for Gevalia’s® limited edition coffees of the world at $36.95 per month plus shipping and handling, which translates to spending approximately $20.00 a pound (!). And the coffee aficionado will buy pricey coffees everywhere she goes, without second thought.

##### increase in the cost of his advertising, his home’s property tax, even the local deli’s nickel and dime price increases. But, an obsessed Ohio State fan, he had purchased a giant, gas-guzzling motor home painted in Ohio state logos outside, decorated in red and gray furnishings and carpet inside, equipped with satellite dish, big-screen TV, and bar, to travel to and tailgate at every game, home and away, every season. He also purchased season tickets and bought away-game tickets from ticket brokers and scalpers at sky-high prices—all without a peep. Every Friday and Saturday during season, his office was closed, sacrificing whatever income might have been produced, so he could stock the motor home and go to Columbus or wherever the team was playing. Without a thought.
 For tennis fans of a certain generation, it’d be hard to beat a week at John Newcombe’s Fantasy Camp, held on a large ranch near San Antonio. Amateurs play alongside and against some of the game’s most famous living legends. I knew almost nothing about tennis until I wrote and produced a client’s major business video project featuring Chris Evert, and had to study up. But I do understand Fantasy Camps and similar sports star or celebrity experiences. Even on a local level, restaurants/chefs, wineries/vintners, etc., are intriguing enough to some people so that they’ll pay to “be a ______________ for a day.”
 In the September 2018 No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent Letter I reported on a tiny town in Scotland, a two-hour drive from Glasgow, Wigton, known as the nation’s book town. Eleven used bookstores are packed into the seaside burg, population 1,100. The most unusual is The Open Book, which has a store downstairs and a small apartment upstairs, and is rented out to Walter Mittys who pay to be bookstore proprietors for a day or a week. At the time of my report, they were booked solid with guest operators through 2021. If you are taking over, on arrival you are handed the keys and the cashbox and told to do your best. (Source: The New York Times, June 29, 2018)
 I am not above paying for a particular fantasy-camplike experience. In 2012, I indulged my long-held interest in writing a mystery novel with a financial arrangement setting up collaboration with an established author of a mysteries series, with 17 titles in print. The result was two published novels, Win, Place, or Die with Les Roberts in 2013 and Speaking of Murder with Les in 2016. Yes, both are available at all booksellers, and

##### thank you for asking. These were second-chair experiences, with me mostly contributing background information on the two “sets” for the stories, some character development, but mainly getting to see how the sausage is made. Even with a share in the royalties, between fees I paid and the cost of my time taken from business, this was a fairly expensive indulgence. And that is the point: People who can afford to indulge themselves will indulge themselves if offered opportunity of doing so.

 Money Spent Collecting Should you wish to add a life-sized, real, fully drivable antique fire engine to your portfolio of vehicles, you can find bargains in the $10,000.00 to $12,000.00 range. Buying one of the authentic George Barris Batmobiles at a car auction will set you back considerably more. People collect both. And antique motorcycles, lawn mowers, vacuum cleaners, pocket watches, grandfather clocks, medical devices, board games, toys, dolls, jukeboxes, fountain pens, and anything and everything else you have ever seen. They haunt estate sales, flea markets, and auctions, pay brokers, roam the internet, and respond to countless ads in countless magazines and newspapers in search of an elusive item. When they find it, price is pretty much irrelevant.
 I have, in my basement, an antique gambling machine, combining a pinball machine and roulette wheel, with a horseracing motif—horseracing being my passion. It requires old-fashioned picture tubes to function and is frequently on the fritz. I bought it on a whim, for, as I recall, $8,000.00. Some whim. The antique dealer who sold it to me has since kindly alerted me every time any item with a racehorse on it finds its way to his shop.
 Classic car auctions are a great place to see a big population of affluent collectors for yourself. In a magazine promoting one such auction, attended by 200,000 people and selling 5,000 cars in four days, I found an old car I’d want: a 1973 AMC Javelin AMX, a near replica of the 1974 Javelin that was my first ever new car. Inquiring, I was told it had a reserve tag on it of $36,000.00 but would probably sell for more. This is an American Motors, i.e., Rambler sporty car. Good grief. The extremely knowledgeable and helpful lady on the phone with me was quick to point out that bidding live from a distance was possible (they would assign an agent to act on my


-----

##### behalf, with whom I’d speak via cell phone), I could watch via the internet, and 100% financing by a major bank could be arranged in 15 minutes. Or, if coming to the auction, I could buy a Segway® and have it waiting for me or prearrange a golf cart rental to roam the acres of cars comfortably. This is but one of dozens of major auctions and hundreds of lesser auctions for classic cars occurring each year all over the United States.
 Since that phone conversation at the time I wrote the first edition of this book, I have, in fact, acquired a 1972 Javelin AMX, as well as a 1963 Lincoln Town Car convertible with suicide doors, a 1968 Rolls-Royce convertible owned before me by Dean Martin, and my everyday car, a 1986 Jeep Wagoneer. I’ve become an avid reader of car collector magazines, watch the Jackson-Barrett auction on TV, occasionally catch Jay Leno’s car show. And I am now supporting a car mechanic at roughly the same cost as a famous movie star’s alimony.
 Collectors are passionate about this one thing and most willing to spend on it, but often, collectors are collectors so they collect more than one thing. And, of course, are willing to spend liberally on many other things (although not everything).
 Consider the lowly pen. I have a habit of losing good ones as soon as I get them, so I stopped buying even ordinary Cross® pens years ago. My office is littered with Bic® pens bought by the gross and Flair® markers. Nowhere to be found, the designername or antique pen on its own display stand. But visit www.FountainPenHospital.com for a look at some very pricey pens—and repair services.
 It seems that everybody collects something. Affluent people simply have the wherewithal to collect pricier things or to pay more in pursuit of the things they collect. They can and do also spend money on information about what they collect, association with others who collect the same things, travel to places where they can find or show off the things they collect, storage facilities, insurance, and care and maintenance for their collected things.
 Beyond these specific interests, affluent customers are particularly in tune with the very idea of collectible value. So collector’s editions and limited editions of just about anything you can think of—book, artwork, wine, home furnishing, golf club, fishing rod—have added cachet and value.

#### CHAPTER 16

### Spending on People

##### “A family is composed of children, men, women, an occasional
 animal, and the common cold.”

—OGDEN NASH

# Orphans who live as hermits can reduce spending to a bare minimum
##### if they choose. Affluent individuals tend to be the person in their families, in their circles of friends, in their various relationships most often picking up the tab. Certainly picking up the biggest tabs. It seems that the accomplished, affluent person is often standing in the center of a big circle of others, turning slowly in its center, handing money or support or gifts to each one each time he rotates past them. Because most affluent people are


-----

##### generous, many don’t mind. Even those who, from time to time, privately question this arrangement continue with it. This is particularly good news for those marketing to the affluent. Each affluent customer is a conduit to many other consumers. Each affluent consumer spends for a whole bunch of others, not just himself.
 Here are a few such scenarios …

 Money Spent on Kids and Grandkids “You can get very hungry while waiting, if your livelihood depends
 on someone’s disease. Death does not always listen to the promises
 and prayers of those who would inherit.”

—MOLIERE

##### I recommend a visit to www.LilliputPlayHomes.com as instructive. The company advertises in publications read by the affluent, such as the Robb Report. In the issue on my bookshelf, their company’s quarter-page ad appears next to one from a law firm specializing in asset protection featuring a John D. Rockefeller quotation, and above a half-page ad for a mergers and acquisitions and commercial financing broker. On the facing page, ads for waterfront homes priced from $2.6 million to $11.9 million. Here, an ad for incredibly pricey backyard playhouses?
 The perfect place. Don’t leap to the conclusion there’s such a tiny market for such things that there can be only one odd company in the business. Check out www.SweetRetreatKids.com, offering themed backyard playhouses like the Beverly Hills Mansion, Fairytale Cottage, and Treasure Ship, priced from $995.00 all the way up to $53,900.00.
 It is but one demonstration of thousands of demonstrations in my files and among my clients of this valuable fact: Many mass-affluent and affluent parents and grandparents set price entirely aside when buying things for their children and grandchildren. This is true for all sorts of reasons. Status and showing off. The opportunity to delight somebody, when all the adults in their family including their spouse are thoroughly jaded and very undelighted by the luxury lifestyle they enjoy. Guilt, over shorting the little ones on time or attention. Having been deprived as


-----

##### children themselves. The psychology is complex, but the reality is simple. In this case, you can sell a child’s playhouse for more money than a storage shed, garage, or room addition. Maybe more than the grandparents paid for their first real house.
 It is also demonstration of another very important fact: Marketers of products for the lil’ ones are not limited to—and are, in fact, advised not to limit their advertising to—media specifically for parents, about parenting.
 A friend of mine selling a very expensive children’s product who asked not to be named in this book said that his best clients are the guilt-ridden affluent parents, and he’d discovered the best place to find them is in magazines read by those flying private jets. He says the frequent business traveler, executive, or entrepreneur, with young children at home, in his second marriage to a younger woman; the very affluent couple leaving the kids at home with a nanny, baby-sitter, or grandparents while on luxury vacations; and the wealthy grandparent competitively vying for attention with other grandparents are, far and away, his best customers—and that the best time to catch their attention is when they are jetting across the country.

 Money Spent on Women “If women didn’t exist, all the money in the world would have no
 meaning.”

—ARISTOTLE ONASSIS

##### The man issuing the above quote would know. Once the richest man in the world, he “bought” John F. Kennedy’s widow, Jacqueline Kennedy.
 The Brown Card, nicknamed “the ecstasy card,” was sold by Chocolat Michel Cluizel of Paris, actually located in New York, for $50,000.00. Cardholders enjoy limitless access to a private bar with fine wines paired with chocolates, exclusive tasting events, limited edition chocolates, and even a personal introduction to Cluizel himself, be still our beating hearts (www.cluizel.us).
 Is there any sum some men will not spend to attempt impressing, delighting, or seducing women?


-----

##### No, and many marketers grossly underestimate this sexually stimulated price elasticity. I am constantly dismayed at the unimaginativeness of gift certificate or gift card packaging and pricing by spas, hair salons, jewelers, resorts, stores, and others. Pay attention to Michel Cluizel. He’s selling a $50,000.00 gift card, but with a unique exclusive collection of products and privileges attached.
 Shortly before one Christmas, a cosmetic surgeon appeared on ABC’s Good Morning America and explained how happy husbands were to purchase his Million Dollar Makeover gift certificates for their wives, unmarried significant others, mistresses, and girlfriends. Yes, they were paying $1 million for the ultimate gift for their honeys: a tune-up from tip of lip to toes and everything in between. It occurred to me that in some marriages, this gift might not be oohed and aahed over with as much enthusiasm as, say, a new car with diamonds in the glove box. Nevertheless, the enterprising doc said he was responding to men who were coming to him and asking for the ultimate package. His ordinary $100,000.00 Silver Package and $200,000.00 Gold Package just weren’t good enough. The patient on the show with him, an attractive mother of four, a recipient of the Million Dollar Makeover gift, was set to get an eye lift, facelift, neck lift, tummy tuck, butt lift, laser hair removal, enlarged lips, and, of course, breast augmentation. She still missed something; according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, hymenoplasty is the ultimate surgical gift— tightening of the vagina or even restoration of virginity, itself starting at only about $5,000.00. One ob-gyn advertises vaginal makeover packages for international patients that include airfare, limousine travel, and luxury hotel accommodations. Cosmetic surgery of all kinds has long ago emerged from hiding and become popularized by celebrities and more something to brag about than be quiet about. And there is a clientele for the million- dollar gift of it, raising as one question what ultimate package or ultimate gift should you sell in your business?
 I can recall a time not that long ago when TV commercials aimed at men at Christmastime touted buying perfumes and jewelry. It’s a relatively recent phenomenon that, with perfectly straight face, many car companies run commercials suggesting surprising the wife with a new car. Dealers even furnish big red bows. “He went to Jared®” pales in comparison to “He went to Lexus®.” The ante is upped.


-----

##### However, an excellent lesson in selling a gift of any kind comes from the mail-order jeweler Karats & Facets, which target markets to the mass- affluent. A page of outstanding sales copy from the company’s catalog appears on Page 170. It is headlined “Guaranteed Gasp or Your Money Refunded.” This company clearly understands it isn’t in the jewelry business but in the gasp business. Or, as the catalog puts it, assisting you with an “investment in your relationship.” In selling anything to men for women, this understanding should be yours as well.
 Think you’ve seen it all at Victoria’s Secret®? Peruse La Perla® lingerie (www.laperla.com) for items like the Black Label bustier, priced into the hundreds of dollars. It’s salient that La Perla® lingerie is advertised in magazines published and provided only to people flying in private jets. Victoria’s Secret’s® advertising is conspicuously absent in these periodicals. I can give you my most confident personal assurance that few men know the difference between one bustier and another, but affluent men will buy what they perceive to be the prestige lingerie as a gift. And how will they know which is which? By where they see it advertised.


### Guaranteed Gasp or Your Money Refunded

 Here is jewelry to capture her heart.

##### Unique gemworks that make her feel unique. This is jewelry you won’t find in department stores (many are one-of-a-kind estate pieces). Nor will you spend hours shopping for them. Just make your choice(s). Dial 800-260-4987, ext. 500, on your phone, and a gift to make her gasp is on its way.

 You expect only the finest quality when you purchase Karats & Facets jewelry, and you surely get it. We choose our gems for their immaculate cut and clarity. We use only solid, high-karat gold for our gem settings. Bracelet links are pin-hinged for super flex-strength. And we add not one but two locking clasps to make them vault-safe.


-----

##### Karats & Facets jewelry is more than an investment in your relationship. Its intrinsic value is one that sustains with the years.

 Yet we offer these beautiful pieces at amazing values, unmatched elsewhere. How can we? We buy our gems directly from abroad, eliminating agent and middlemen costs. We smith our own gold in our own workshops (you’re welcome to visit anytime). Then we market our jewelry directly to you to avoid distributor, broker, and retail markups.

 Finally, there’s our airtight satisfaction guarantee: If you’re not 100% satisfied, you have 30 days to return it for a full refund.


##### Money Spent on Pets (Pets Are People, Too!) “The Don CeSar hotel is overly pet friendly. Ridiculously pet friendly. They have a pet concierge that comes to your room and
 describes the services they offer your pet … They said they had aromatherapy for dogs. I’m like, ‘Do you have a candle that smells
 like another dog’s ass?’ That’s what he likes.”

—COMEDIAN RON WHITE, CHARTER MEMBER OF THE BLUE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR

[(WWW.TATERSALAD.COM)](http://www.tatersalad.com/)

##### You might want to come back as a dog in an affluent home in your next life. Their future looks bright.
 Designers have discovered pets, so, for example you can bug a Gucci® dog bowl for $900.00. At www.PostModernPets.com, affluent owners can buy an Italian-designed doghouse or a Cabitat cat condo, a leather dog bed ($1,450.00), or a Jonathan Adler designer dog dish. One of the humans behind this website says it is “for people who are serious about incorporating their pets fully into their lifestyle.”
 There is a fast-growing population of such people. In his 2007 book MicroTrends, author and political pollster Mark Penn called them “pet parents.” That term has since become common lexicon. Penn wrote, incidentally, about “little things” that drive big trends, and he was right about this one. The “humanization” of pets caught on in a very big way.


-----

##### My wife and I are admittedly among them. The little dog who lives with us is considered when we choose hotels and resorts to visit—with rare exception, they must be pet friendly. Preferably very friendly. We prefer her with us rather than left behind, so shopping center, store, and similar choices are also made based on whether or not she is welcome. She has her own little couch, her own fur throw, her own blanket. She commutes between our two homes with one or both of us uncaged relaxed in the private plane, which she greatly prefers to traveling with the peon pets on commercial airlines, where she must be stuffed in a small cage that fits under the seat. And yes, she knows the difference between driving toward the regular airline terminal and turning off to the private terminal. She is spoiled. I call her our Million-Dollar Dog. And our Million-Dollar Dog has a bone to pick with you, if you aren’t accommodating her as one of the family.
 In one city you’ll find a Starbucks®-like, upscale coffeehouse for humans under the same roof as the Whole Pet Café, serving healthy meat, vegetable, and whole-grain meals and designer waters to dogs, at $4.00 to $10.00 per item. Next door, a fancy veterinary clinic and a high-end pet fashions and accessories store. In another city, a pet day spa featuring not just grooming and nail clipping, but fur-beautifying blueberry facials, massages, saunas. Classical music is played exclusively in the fur stylist’s salon. Another city boasts a pet hotel with private suites, complete with comfortable beds, heated floors, and plasma TVs. None of these businesses is in Beverly Hills or Manhattan, although businesses just like them are there, as you’d expect. The ones I just described are in Dallas, Texas; Long Beach, California; and Charlotte, North Carolina. In Alexandria, Virginia, near one of my homes, the entire community of Main Street merchants wisely caters to pets and their owners. A local hotel has a happy hour for dogs. The baker features birthday cakes for pets. There is a dog apparel store.
 Pets are the new children and grandchildren. Boomers’ kids are grown and gone. Families once staying in close geographic proximity are now spread out to different and distant locations. Spoiling grandchildren is made more difficult by this separation. So affluents, especially affluent Boomers, dote on their dogs, cats, and other pets. And spend truly astounding sums doing so.


-----

##### No affluent pet owner does the math. The gourmet dog food he purchases in little containers costs more per pound than the steaks he eats himself. The Burberry® dog coat at $200.00 costs more per square inch of plaid than his own Burberry® overcoat. It does not matter.
 Pet products are now one of the top ten U.S. retail segments—a bigger industry than toys or candy or hardware. Currently, more than $69 billion is spent each year on pets, double the amount spent just ten years ago. This staggering number may again double within the next ten years. 68% of American households have pets, up from 50% roughly 30 years ago, and an all-time high. That’s 25% higher than the percentage of households with children. In the past 30 years, the drop in households with kids mirrors the rise in households with pets. As baby Boomers become empty nesters, household spending on children is declining while spending on pets is rising. Over a three-year term, spending on toys, games, tricycles, and children’s clothes fell by more than 20%; spending on pets rose by 23%.
 The fastest growth segment: luxury pet products bought by affluent pet owners. About 40% of all the dollars spent buying things for pets deliver them to only 1% of the pets, the most pampered of the pampered pooches and kitties. Louis Vuitton®, Chanel®, and Burberry® sell designer dog collars, leashes, and toys; Gucci®, Tiffany®, Coach®, L.L. Bean®, and Harley-Davidson® are all in the luxury dog accessories business.
 The love of dogs drove the book A Dog’s Purpose to the top of the New York Times bestseller list—a lofty place this book will never see—and kept it there. If you haven’t read it, and you like dogs, you must.
 Wealthy dog owners can now spoil their furry best friends with designer dog houses modeled on Imperial Roman manors and Colonial American Mansions … with fancy marble columns, beech wood floors, classic porticos, even miniature chandeliers … coupled with all modern conveniences: central heat and air conditioning, motion activated lighting, and automated treat dispensers. Gives “being in the dog house” new meaning. Most are also equipped with internet-based communication systems so owners can see and speak to their dogs anytime. From a British firm, Hecate Verona. Price around $215,000.00. Not a typo. Two hundred and fifteen thousand dollars.

#### CHAPTER 17

### Money Spent on Bling

##### “You asked ‘what time is it’? It’s three diamonds after noon.”

—SAMMY DAVIS, JR.

# An Ipsos Affluent Consumer Survey in 2016 suggested that the
##### majority was moving to “more subtle” and “more experiential” expressions of their affluence, but that was before The Trump Effect. Subtle is also a very subjective idea.
 There is a special population within the affluent and ultra-affluent who buy bling. This group of bright, shiny-object lovers tends to include a lot of people who make a lot of money suddenly or without much effort or through talent and celebrity or mere celebrity. Think Kim Kardashian,


-----

##### Hollywood and music celebrities, sports stars. Quite a few Hollywood celebrities and pro athletes drive themselves to bankruptcy with wild spending and shopping sprees. Leaping to my mind, the late Michael Jackson, M.C. Hammer, and Mike Tyson. More contemporary showy spenders include The Kardashians—for whom it is a career. You might identify these as the affluents with more money than brains. Personally, I like getting such stupid money just as much as I like getting smart money. It seems to spend the same. So affluents with stupid money deserve your consideration.
 Some have, in their jeans pocket, a Swiss Army knife made of gold or silver and bejeweled with 800 diamonds, for which they paid as much as $100,000.00.
 There is a magazine totally devoted to buyers of pimped-out rides. High-priced sports cars, luxury cars, and SUVs given customized makeovers. In one issue, I discovered more than 30 full-page and multipage ads for wheel covers. Wheel covers. Most priced from the bargain of $995.00 to more commonly $1,495.00 to $4,000.00 per hubcap. Per hubcap. The most expensive, a set of four inset with diamonds and rubies, priced at $2 million. Extra costs: $100,000.00 a year for the two guys you hire to guard your wheels—and each other—at all times, $50,000.00 for trips to your therapist after seeing your extremely busty, compliant, and talented girlfriend’s dog lift his little leg and pee on one of your wheel covers. Talk about emotional conflict.
 The more common bling, ultra-expensive wristwatches for men and women and high-fashion jewelry for women, is all quite different for the affluent and ultra-affluent than that on display in the glass cases at your local shopping malls. There is, for example, a Limited Edition Grand Complication Audemars Piguet men’s watch priced at $743,600.00 or the more affordable Master Minute Repeater in Platinum by Jaeger-LeCoultre at just $241,000.00. I recommend an investigative tour of the websites listed on the full-page jewelry and wristwatch advertisements in magazines like Elite Traveler and Town & Country. Some jewelers’ and watch companies websites to visit for an eye-opening education:

 • www.DavidYurman.com
 • www.Vacheron-Constantin.com


-----

##### • www.AaronBasha.com

 Bling means different things to different people. The affluent person who can’t fathom paying $4,000.00 for a hubcap will pay that much or ten times that much for a particular wristwatch that will be recognized by his tribal peers as a symbol of wealth, status, and significance. But even the most conservative individual has something he’s bought as bling. And there may be yet-unseen opportunities to inject some bling into your products.

### This is about the designer of those flashy, paisley, and patterned shirts
##### guys wear with the cuffs rolled back to show a different pattern. The shirts are very popular in the Southwest with the rodeo crowd, rich oil men—one of whom has “collected 130 different designs” and spent so much money, the 2014 “collection” includes a design named after that customer, and quite a few GKIC Members. The shirts go for $225.00 to over $500.00*, and are sold direct, in catalogs, at Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, high-end country western shops, and in several Las Vegas stores. There are two company stores—the original in Venice, California, and a second in Houston. Warm weather climates have been identified by the shirt-maker as better than four season or cold because people can wear the colorful shirts year ‘round, so they buy more of them. The brand’s owner, a Ralph Lauren alumnus, Robert Stock, calls customers “connoisseurs.” He says he is in the business of selling “feeling good”—getting favorably noticed, getting compliments, getting bragging rights. There’s a fraternity: One Robert Graham shirt owner instantly recognizes another. Guys talk with each other about these shirts like the women on Sex and the City talk about shoes. Customers who own more than 100 of the shirts (from $25,000.00 to $50,000.00+) are inducted into a special club. Stock is, incidentally, 65 years old, still having fun as an entrepreneur.


-----

##### *This is at a time when JoS. A. Bank advertises a $199.00 suit, and buy one, get two free. And you can buy dress shirts, as Mitt Romney claimed he did, in packs of three at Costco for $99.00. None of this matters. Not to the Robert Graham shirt connoisseur. Unless and until you grasp that what others are doing does NOT need to matter, you are as handicapped as a one-legged man lugging a 1,000-pound boulder up a mountain.

 To dissect, he has a) a unique look and design (that’s bright and stands out and is fun) for a routine item—shirts, b) premium pricing, c) multiple distribution channels and solid place strategy, d) a good understanding that he is NOT in the apparel business, and—maybe most importantly—e) a company and customer culture featuring recognition and supportive of contagion.

#### CHAPTER 18

### Money Spent at Home

##### When the Seiberlings—he, a tire magnate—built their home, Stan Hywet Hall, an 80-room Tudor mansion in Akron, Ohio, in 1915, at a cost of $3 million (in 1915!), Mrs. Seiberling ordered workmen to cut scuff marks into the hardwood floors so the home wouldn’t look
 “ridiculously new and unlived in.”

# Between 25% and 30% of affluents own multiple homes for personal
##### use, with the majority of these owning two such homes. Ownership of three or more homes for personal use is concentrated among those with the highest net worth and is more common with ultra-affluents.


-----

##### The higher up the wealth ladder you go, the more homes owned. At the ultra-affluent level, with $100 million and higher net worth, an average of ten homes are owned.
 Most of my private clients own two, some three, and several five. One peer in my field owns only one here, but two in Asia, and one in Costa Rica.
 Whatever the number, a myriad of purchases and a lot of spending is required by each one. It should be obvious that securing one of these multi- home owners as a customer or client is potentially much more valuable than the owner of just one home at a time. The interior designer, the art dealer, the insurance agent, and so many others can live off a lot fewer multi-home owners than single-residence owners.
 For those with multiple residences, the average value of the second residence or vacation home is about $900,000.00; the average value of the primary residence is $1.5 million to $1.8 million. About half of the second homes are within a day’s drive of the primary residence and tend to get frequent weekend use. The more distant second residences tend to get seasonal use. What this means to the marketer of products and services for the home is that one-in-four to one-in-three affluent customers have opportunity to buy for more than one residence. This is another reason to think globally rather than locally (see Chapter 21).
 The dual- or multiple-residence owner is an outstanding target customer or client for marketers of a wide variety of goods and services beyond home furnishings, home decorating, home improvements, and home services such as maid service and landscape maintenance. For example, for insurance, financial services professionals, CPAs, and attorneys, these clients have more complicated needs and interests and tend to respond to professionals’ advertising in the national magazines and journals they read more so than local media.
 But, to return to the home itself, as a quick education, you might visit www.cambek.com to see “picture-perfect, hand-crafted architectural accents crafted by skilled artisans for the re-visioning™ of your home.” Or DolceGabbana.com, where you can find Smeg high-tech refrigerators selling for $50,000.00. Should you dare to call them garage doors or refrigerators, they dispatch a tough nanny to wash out your mouth with soap. This is a nice lesson in the fact that no commodity product bought


-----

##### solely as a necessity for its function need remain such a mundane thing when sold to the affluent.
 Kitchens, of course, are big business. A friend of mine recently had hers redone, and commented, “Apparently anything not made out of granite no longer has a place in the kitchen.” You probably know someone—if not yourself—who has recently put from $25,000.00 to $100,000.00 into a complete kitchen makeover. As with all big-ticket purchases made by the mass-affluent and affluent for their homes, whether kitchens, theater rooms, meticulously landscaped and lit backyards with grill areas rivaling the kitchen, and so on, it’s not about utility, but about a variety of emotional issues.


#### And What Might They Buy for Their Homes?

# If your family loves pizza, then you may have considered getting a
##### pizza oven. A double-deck pizza oven from high-end suppliers can set you back as much as $2,500.00

 If you’ve always wanted a tree in your living room—and hey, who hasn’t?—the next best thing is a natural-looking steel art replica tree. Shipped in color-coded sections for easy assembly, so you need not remove your home’s roof to get your tree inside. At www.NatureMaker.com.

### Entertainment Spending and the Experience
 Economy

##### “Is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves?”

—FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

# Spending on entertainment is through the roof, into the stratosphere. It
##### has become a 24-7 obsession. The games closet at home, the TV watched only after dinner, the movie theater visited occasionally, the golf course, virtually every diversion and recreation has migrated to the iPad and smartphone, with everybody everywhere, at all times. Coupled with the


-----

##### incredible narcissistic orgy of social media and constant connectivity, itself entertainment, and you find a population consumed.
 If you are an investor, you can’t possibly afford to ignore the entertainment category—and to pick out of other categories the companies not characterized as entertainment enterprises, yet very much into this game. Apple, for example, is categorized as a tech company, but I consider them a 60%+ entertainment company. Disney®, Lionsgate®, Hasbro®, 100% entertainment. (Note: I’m not dispensing investing guidance, only commentary.)
 As a marketer, you have to look for ways to get your own business above the “50% entertainment” watermark. You want to be where the money is flowing like a river. This is more opiate of the masses than addiction of the affluent, but it is pernicious at all strata of society. The affluent consumer is, by and large, engaged with and embracing it all, if slightly more discriminating than most others.
 Here, a couple out-of-the-devices scenarios …

 Money Spent on Experiences I’ll borrow their ad copy:

 Today, you rescued the plane, prevented a carjacking, and shot your way out of a crowded subway station—and you never left our resort. Save the world by day. Relax with your favorite cocktail, vintage cigar, and fine cuisine at a true five-star mountain resort by night. A lifestyle typically reserved for secret agents and action heroes is now available to those who dare … Valhalla Shooting Club at Elk Mountain Resort. Ultra-realistic, theme-based, live-fire shooting scenarios put you in control of your destiny with pistol in hand. And when the shooting stops, our resort offers a full complement of activities and luxuries designed to satisfy you and your companion.

 Aah, shaken, not stirred. As someone who played with a Man from U.N.C.L.E. attaché case in the backyard and grew up on Napoleon Solo, Ilya Kuryakin, James Bond, and the original Avengers, I find the Valhalla adventure appealing. It may or may not be your cup of tea, but some


-----

##### experience—some packaged grand experience or amazing adventure— would be. And there may very well be some such experience you can create within or as an extension of your business with enormous appeal to some number of affluent individuals.
 One of our long time No B.S. Inner Circle Members running jewelry stores in small, Midwest communities takes a dozen or so of his most affluent clients on an annual trip to the South African diamond mines, where they pick out their own diamonds firsthand to be placed in custom- crafted jewelry. They can also add on an African safari or cruise if they desire. He collects a sizeable “experience fee” for putting this trip together and escorting his group. The fees combined are nearly as much as one- fourth of the net profit from one of his stores for the entire year.
 Even the rather pedestrian cruise industry has grown up and gone affluent. Take the Four Seasons cruise ship. You do not just grab a cabin at a website, hop on board, and line up for the bon voyage buffet. Instead, you buy a time-share in it, for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The shares sold fast. Other condo cruise ships with penthouse cabins priced into the millions are at sea, with more under hurried construction. People purchasing these floating condos and time-shares aren’t doing so purely to take cruises. They are buying into an elite gated community that floats, and they’re purchasing a unique experience. One of these ultra-luxury cruise ship residences, The Magellan, is described this way:

 The facilities and services of the world’s finest resorts are part of everyday life aboard The Magellan. On-call housekeeping staff, a world-class spa, 24-hour concierge staff, indoor and outdoor pools, six restaurants, a 450-seat theater with Broadway quality entertainment, a casino worthy of Monte Carlo, and an 8,000- square-foot greenhouse with onsite horticulturists are just a few of the conveniences that make living aboard The Magellan a unique experience.

 Since when are a greenhouse and in-house horticulturist and six restaurants conveniences? Since now, for the ultra-affluent. Note this ad is not talking about taking a cruise. Living aboard.

##### Incidentally, time-shares on dry land or afloat are historically notoriously bad investments. Developers frequently flirt with fraud in overselling capacity, amenities deteriorate after units sell out, bankruptcies occur with regularity—even with this new type of high-end, luxury time- share. Overall, resale values rarely even match original purchase prices let alone yield gains. So, shouldn’t ultra-affluent individuals know better? Only demonstrates that people are people.
 If you are following what most consider the smart money, you’ve seen it moving to companies, entrepreneurs, and projects creating and providing luxury experiences. As an example, two of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates and Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Alsaud, partnered in taking the Four Seasons hotel chain private—with its luxury time-share and condo properties and newest addition, cruise ships. Apparently they see big profit potential in this crown jewel company.
 Turning to the mass-affluent, the company I admire most in the world, Disney®, continues to diversify, developing and offering new experiences for sale to its customers. Its wedding business, thriving and expanding. Its multigenerational family reunion business, thriving. Its experience resorts like the Animal Kingdom Lodge, booked solid at premium prices. The FastPass® for many, but for some the $395 (and up)-per-hour private VIP guide with whom you bump all the lines, go backstage, and take shortcuts. In the time-share category, the Disney® Vacation Club is rapidly expanding to meet demand. When I took one of my client groups to Disney World® on a research excursion, we had a private lunch with two Imagineers, one of whom developed the group sales presentation used on board Disney® cruise ships to sell the club, who was thoroughly familiar with its growth. He predicted it would increase at least five-fold in less than three years, with new means of marketing and new luxury options. Since then, Disney® has opened the first of a number of planned stores in shopping malls exclusively devoted to selling the Vacation Club time-shares. The company has also gone west, turning 2.5 acres adjacent to the Grand Californian Hotel and Spa® at Disneyland® into 50 Vacation Club villas.
 In total, the Vacation Club time-share program is in its 20th year, has more than 500,000 owners, and simply can’t add facilities fast enough to meet demand. Current expansion includes the new villas at Disneyland® in


-----

##### California, new Animal Kingdom Villas and the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa® Villas in Florida, and Aulani Resort and Spa® Villas in Hawaii.
 Disney also opened up its previously “secret” Club 33 at Disneyland, now openly advertising a version of it at Disney World, with an initiation fee of $33,000.00 and annual dues of $15,000.00.
 Time-shares aren’t limited to something you stay and sleep in anymore either. Affluent customers are time-sharing collections of exotic automobiles and portfolios of expensive jewelry, and ultra-affluent clients are time-sharing a “family office,” typically comprised of a CPA and life concierge on staff, supervising and coordinating all aspects of clients’ lives, from paying bills to planning trips to finding someone to remodel the barn. Instead of owning only one or two exotic cars, you can buy into a timeshare and drive dozens. Instead of owning only a few $50,000.00 to $500,000.00 pieces of stunning, one-of-a-kind jewelry, you can draw from a collection of hundreds and never be seen wearing the same piece twice. Instead of using your own Rolodex® to find pool cleaners, find home remodelers, organize trips, buy gifts, and check up on your money managers and investments yourself, you can share a dedicated management team with two or three other families.
 Today, the affluent customer can get just about anything he can imagine —and will buy many things he didn’t imagine on his own—in the experience category. Oh, if you feel like helicoptering into Valhallas as its next tuxedoed, pistol-wielding, martini-drinking, beautiful-woman- impressing secret agent, you may begin your adventure at www.valhallasecurity.com.

 Money Spent Dining Out We love to eat. We love to eat out.
 The shrinkage of the middle-class consumer and the regressed spending of the mass-affluent consumer groups had hit mid-level restaurants hard between the time I wrote the first edition of this book and the year I did the update prior to this one, in 2014.
 From 2004 to 2008, U.S. restaurant sales climbed in virtually every category, at every level, topping $180 billion. In those years, 85% of Americans dined out at a minimum of once a month, over 20% paid


-----

##### restaurant tabs at least six times a month i.e., 1.5 times a week, and nearly 10% ka-chinged ten or more times a month.
 From about 2009 to 2015, the industry segments experienced very different trajectories.
 A late 2013 report in Nation’s Restaurant News revealed a troublesome, overall trend: People who were dining out multiple times every week and the larger number dining out multiple times every month were not only cutting back to, respectively, once a week or once a month, but also reducing their spending when doing so. Their research forecast a furtherance of the trend. Significantly, while overarching the entire industry, this reduction in frequency and check size was most concentrated in the middle. Darden Restaurants is a poster boy for this difficulty. In 2014, it got its Red Lobster® chain sold at a fire sale price, after many months of trying, and its Olive Garden® chain was wounded, limping, and scaring investors —so much so that one of its biggest investors created their own 300-page memorandum of cost cutting and other recommendations, leaked to the media. It included a demand that the chain’s “endless breadsticks” be ended, or at least tamped down by serving only one breadstick in place of a basket and waiting for a customer to request another. Darden’s value has since crawled back up, but fragility remains. The mid-level restaurants have the highest labor cost-to-sales ratio, tight margins, intense competition, loss of customers who trade down, and are most directly affected by the shrinking middle class I thoroughly described in Chapter 1. The enormous boom for the mid-level, fast casual restaurants came to a screeching halt, revealing overbuilding and saturation, resulting in quite a few in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, many others teetering.
 In the fourth quarter of 2017, on the shareholder conference call, the CEO of Applebee’s and IHOP and other restaurants proclaimed theirs a company in transition, returning to growth. But a few months later, one of the largest Applebee’s franchisees filed for bankruptcy protection. The entire conglomerate posted losses of $324 million for the year.
 The bottom of this food chain, also harmed and hurting. McDonald’s® same store sales year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter were down, leading up to this writing. The category in which McDonalds®, Burger King®, Taco Bell®, KFC®, etc., live has sacrificed price, transaction size, and profit margin just to keep all the doors open and the volume steady. The “$1


-----

##### Menu,” the “$5 Meal,” and very aggressive promotional offers have taken control of this category, to their shared detriment.
 Upscale, fine-dining chains and independents live on their own island. Some bled a little during the 2008 financial apocalypse, but nowhere near the extent of those in the middle and low groups. Many are doing quite well now. This teaches a lot about where you want to position your business, whether a restaurant or not. The least dramatic fluctuations of patronage, price, and profit are toward the top.
 As a restaurant moves up, from anybody and everybody, to mass- affluent, to affluent clientele—targeted by its marketing and served by design of its product—price becomes less and less of a factor in customers’ decisions about repeat and even frequent patronage. I listened during a staff meeting at an upscale restaurant as the manager explained, “We do not have specials. Denny’s® has specials. We have chef’s features.” And that sums it up. While the lure of low price for a lot of bulk or price- or discount-driven specials is significantly important to the Denny’s® customer and is of some importance to the Applebee’s® or Outback Steakhouse® customer, it is of near zero importance to the Fleming’s® steakhouse customer.
 The same applies to foods delivered to the home. If you compare Omaha Steaks® marketing to Allen Brothers® marketing, you’ll see that Omaha, catering to the mass-affluent, relies heavily on sales, special offers, and discounts, while Allen Brothers, selling to the more affluent, relies much less on price-related marketing. Virtually all the newer, quasi dotcom, prepared meal delivery companies priced to the middle-income consumer are burning through venture capital and losing money with abandon.
 While there appears to be fierce competition in the restaurant industry, it is more about each restaurant finding its market. Certainly the higher up the food chain one moves, pardon the pun, the easier it is to carve out and control a unique segment of the market. And the less competition there is.
 Finally, there’s a difference between a convenience restaurant and a destination restaurant. Fast-food, low-priced, and mid-priced restaurants marketing to mass-affluent and down tend to live or die by convenience to their customers. For fast-food outlets, location—even side of the street— traffic patterns, and population density are of enormous importance. This makes them vulnerable to shifts in such things, and, although you don’t think of McDonald’s®, Burger King®, Arby’s®, and so on failing, there are


-----

##### surprisingly large numbers of such stores that do close their doors every year, usually having to incur costs of relocation to follow the customers’ movements. Better restaurants marketing to mass-affluent and up are only about 50% dependent on convenience and can successfully draw from a bigger radius around their location, as customers who like that particular restaurant will drive farther to patronize it. Upscale restaurants and upscale and unique restaurants are destinations, so convenience can be virtually nonexistent, and they can still draw maximum crowds every night. Affluent customers are, according to a Food, Beverage, and Hospitality Survey of the Affluent, four times more likely than non-affluent consumers to drive farther than 40-minute round-trips to patronize a restaurant of choice. This is important to many kinds of businesses: As a big thumb rule, the higher the customer affluence, the larger the radius around the business from which customers can be obtained.

##### Money Spent on Travel Travel was the number-one category for spending in the Ipsos Affluent Survey with a 25% increase in spending on travel in 2016. In 2016, $215 billion was spent in the travel industry, with affluents spending 56% of all travel dollars. Ipsos found that luxury consumers are moving away from spending on things and moving more and more towards experiential. 91% have passports. Almost half took a cruise in the last three years. 92% do research before they travel. 66% say that travel publications and TV programs inspire them to seek out new experiences. They also segmented the affluent travelers as follows:

 Affluent Jetsetters. The wealthiest segment, they have a household income (HI) of $175,000.00, have the highest financial resources, and spend the most. 31% are owners/partners in their own business. Forty-four percent are C-Suiters, with gender split at 65% male and 35% female. Twenty-seven percent hail from the West Coast. Eighty-seven percent are married, while 54% have kids. They are highly engaged, frequent business and vacation travelers, with particular interest in foreign destinations. They stay in upscale accommodations and may have traveled on a private jet in the past year. One hundred percent traveled last year. They took 4.3 vacations in the past year, 5.8 business trips, and 93% belong to a frequent traveler program and have a passport. They prefer to stay in five-star accommodations or luxury boutique hotels. They are willing to pay extra for comfort and service, prefer destinations that are off the beaten track, and love collecting frequent flyer points from business travel to use on personal travel.

 Affluent Taste For First Class. This group breaks down on generational lines, with 32% Millennials, 38% Gen-Xers, 27% Boomers, and 3% seniors. They have a tendency to splurge on upgrades such as flight upgrades, and fine food and wine, and will pay extra for comfort and service. Looks for quality over quantity when traveling. There were 89% who took a trip in the last year. They took 2.9 vacation trips and 2.8


-----

##### business trips. They prefer five-star accommodations, rental villas/homes, luxury boutique hotels. Six percent have traveled on private aircraft.

 Affluent Domestic Deal-Seekers. These are mass-affluent travelers who seek out bargains, mainly to destinations in the U.S. They spend above average on personal travel, but their trips are no frills. They tend to return to the same spot again and again. Median HI $147,000.00. Median Net worth $639,000.00.

 Affluent Homebodies. Tend to be more in the Midwest. Includes more singles and full-time students. They are risk-averse so unlikely to include adventurous escapades. They travel, but not heavily, and prefer to travel domestically. They typically stay in “other” hotels/motels rather than five- star hotels or boutiques.

#### CHAPTER 20

### Money Spent on Liberty

##### “There is only one success—to be able to spend your life in your
 own way.”

—CHRISTOPHER MORLEY, AMERICAN NOVELIST AND JOURNALIST

# There are, I think, three kinds of liberty: day-to-day liberty, lifestyle
##### liberty, and mental or emotional liberty. I’d like you to consider each one as something you may be able to deliver through your products, services, or business.
 We’ll begin with the day-to-day. The affluent are highly stressed. More than 75% of all affluent business owners and self-employed professionals work 60 to 70 hours a week. The average affluent household with children


-----

##### has each child involved in at least three to five separate, organized activities each week, requiring transportation, supervision, and parental involvement. Families are now spread out over the country, requiring more frequent travel and time away from home and business for personal reasons. Add to this the ever-rising intrusiveness and constant connectedness imposed by technology and the ever-increasing complexity of everyday life thanks to burgeoning choice in every product and service category. Also, the more affluent a person is, the more financial responsibilities, decisions, and seemingly endless paperwork flow he confronts. All added together, it equals high stress, low liberty. By “low liberty,” I mean that this person feels as if he has no time for himself, feels as if constantly chasing and never catching, constantly at odds with himself and others, and always disappointing someone. I know these feelings well myself. You might think of us as desperate affluents.
 On the rare occasions desperate affluents find someone of demonstrated, proven, reliable competence to whom they can transfer some responsibility, they will do so eagerly and pay generously for the relief. These desperate affluents often overpay people by normal or traditional standards but consider the liberty being purchased a bargain. I recently had a client tell me he paid his personal assistant $75,000.00 a year, a wage judged by his business partner, CPA, and others as $30,000.00 too much, but because she can be counted on to anticipate his needs, think for herself, and relieve him of having to remember just about everything, he considers it a half-price bargain. Another desperate affluent businesswoman I know has a person who comes to her home twice a week and does the laundry, changes the bedding, goes to the grocer’s and restocks the refrigerator, and takes and picks up clothes at the cleaners—for which she pays $500.00 a week. I imagine that works out to something like $50.00 an hour. Too much? Or bargain? What price the liberty to enjoy an evening out or to be able to come home and relax at end of a high-pressure day instead of having to wash clothes or finding nothing in the fridge suitable for a cobbled-together dinner and having to get back in the car and go out? What price liberty?
 In his book The Art of Selling to the Affluent, Matt Oechsli wrote, “When people are under a lot of stress, they look for relief. They initiate many major purchase decisions to reward themselves for their hard work and as a stress release. The last thing they want is a hassle.” He goes further


-----

##### to give these seven drivers of significant buying decisions by the affluent (boldfacing of key words and phrases, mine):

 1. They want to be respected, even honored, for the level of success
 they have achieved. 2. They are successful because of the professionalism and competence
 they apply to their work, and they expect no less from others. 3. They will react strongly to any attempts to deceive them, and when
 (they feel) that happens, they take their business elsewhere. 4. The define value in their own terms. 5. Instead of striving to keep up with the Joneses, they want to be
 different from the Joneses. 6. They experience enough tension and hassles in their daily work life
 —they want to be free from all that when dealing with people who would like to sell them something (and keep them as customers/clients/patients). 7. They can afford and are willing to pay for the best information, the
 best products, the highest level of competence, and the best professional service available.

 Next, consider the magnification of this, to lifestyle. The affluent are on a search, a life and lifestyle quest.

 They are on a quest for respect. On a quest for competence. A quest for integrity. A quest for status and value meaningful to them. A quest for relief from stress and difficulty and responsibility. Most of all, a quest for competence.

 They often arrange their lives and the locations in it in ways reflective of this quest.
 Many of my clients are impressed by my obsession with “time economics” and time preservation—so much so that one of my most popular books is No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs. Our Ohio home was chosen primarily for its eight-minute proximity to the racetrack


-----

##### where I race most of my horses. It is the best available that is close to the track. There’s an upscale community 20 minutes away I’d prefer living in, but that would mean 40 minutes, sometimes 80 minutes of commuting on race days—unacceptable. This home is also exactly midway between the Cleveland and Akron airports. Only 15 minutes away from a nice hotel that ably hosts my coaching and client group meetings and highest priced, boutique seminars. Our other home in Virginia is minutes from Dulles Airport, but not in flight paths. A penthouse condo with amenities in its building, and shops and fine dining restaurants just outside its doors, a Hyatt hotel a short walk away. I work mostly with a five-minute commute to my spacious basement office. 90% of all clients come to me. I am far from alone in making these kinds of calculations and choices in order to conserve my most precious and perishable asset: time. Watch how NetJets advertises itself to the affluent; the benefit being sold is time, and largely, preservation of personal time—to get home, to be with family, to more easily get away for vacation, not business efficiency.
 They delegate and transfer a lot of responsibility, even though, by nature and experience, they tend to be control freaks. The desperate need for relief from a myriad of overwhelming, stressful responsibilities supersedes their preference for hands-on control of everything. Consequently, many put some or all of their personal wealth under others’ management. They hire personal chefs to choose and prepare the foods and meals they eat. They let a clothier choose their wardrobe. A personal shopper chooses gifts for others. On and on. In all these instances they are not just attempting to buy a little time or convenience—they are seeking to buy lifestyle liberty. Not just a reality of minutes freed up or tasks done, but a sense of liberation from the mundane and time-consuming.
 Which arrives at the third liberty they seek: mental and emotional liberty.
 Napoleon Hill, legendary for his book Think and Grow Rich, wrote a lesser-known book as his last of many, titled Grow Rich with Peace of Mind. That title has a double meaning: that the ultimate aspiration, achievement, and wealth is peace of mind and that you need peace of mind to be truly rich. In that book, Hill told of finally having to disconnect all his phones, as his celebrity had put him under constant assault from all manner of people with requests for his time, money, and assistance. I am at the


-----

##### point Hill found himself, and need a number of barriers to restrict access to me in order to have any peace. You need to know that the affluent have enormous demands assailing them, and look, above all else, for breathing space. A multimillionaire client recently told me of buying a very expensive “cabin” in a relatively remote area near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a popular playground of the rich. He showed me a picture of the area around his place, just miles of snow-covered emptiness. He talked of going dogsledding. Mostly, he talked of enjoying the sense of distance and isolation from people and their demands on him.
 Beyond this, the affluent are seeking liberty from critical judgment and guilt. This nation attacks its affluent relentlessly, in the media, in politics, in public and private discourse. The affluents’ Spidey-sense detects envy, jealousy, resentment, and disapproval emanating from most of the people they interact with and from the public at large. One millionaire told me: “The more successful I get, the more I feel eyes in the dark hungrily watching me.” Another said to me: “To my face, they are deferential. Behind my back, they are angry critics who believe themselves infinitely smarter and harder working and more deserving than I.” Another described feeling as if the target painted on his chest got bigger and brighter with each passing year. In his outstanding book Paranoia and Power, Gene Landrum, the leading authority on the psychology of the rich and powerful, states: “Paranoia is rampant among super achievers.” Further, attempts to influence the affluent with guilt for the admittedly growing gap between them and the have-nots is pervasive and unrelenting. It comes from close family members and distant relatives—as comedian and game show host Louis Anderson so painfully showed off in one of the most memorable Oprah shows ever and wrote about in his autobiography. It comes from the endless charities, causes, and others at their doorstep asking for or, in some cases, nearly demanding handouts. It comes from political demagogues, media, and even rich limousine liberals themselves, acting out of guilt. Behind closed doors, this is frequently discussed, a shared angst of the affluent.

 How to Make Yourself Magnetic to the Affluent If you truly understand this quest of the affluent, it’s not difficult to see what is required of you to make yourself magnetic to them—and to their


-----

##### money.
 Not necessarily in any priority order, there are three big things to do. One, develop, display, and convey a profound position of expertise, good judgment, understanding, professionalism, and competence. Present yourself as the most trustworthy of advisors. The most trusted advisors relied on by the affluent automatically and certainly become very affluent themselves. Almost next to, or only a step behind, every person famous for wealth and power stands an almost equally wealthy—in some cases wealthier—trusted advisor.
 Two, relieve your affluent clients of time, pressure, anxiety, stress, day- to-day hassle, tasks they’d rather not do or even think about or that should be below their own time’s value. Create privilege and luxury-level convenience for them. Make standing in lines, filling out forms, mere mortals’ normal burdens go away.
 Three, give them acceptance, approval, and applause. They are extremely responsive to those who celebrate their success and respect it as earned. Become known as a supporter and advocate of achievement and affluence. Take philosophical positions that counter the constant criticism they receive from most other quarters.
 We will flesh out specific strategies supportive of these three objectives in Book Three.

#### Book Two Summation

### What is most predictive of human behavior is human behavior.
##### Surveys, polls, focus groups, statistics, psychological theories are all useful yet often not predictive. In direct marketing, we try to use all the indicative information we can get, but we also put a lot more importance on the only predictive information there is: how a target group of consumers has historically behaved and currently behaves toward a particular type of product and service category and proposition within that category.

 There are only two certain facts we can always start with. One, that everybody is much more enthusiastic about spending on what they want


-----

##### than on what they need—however, huge numbers of consumers are extremely restricted in this by lack of money for anything but bare necessities. Two, the more affluent the consumer, the more they can, and the more they do, spend on wants.

 When marketing to the affluent, it is essential to understand your target consumers’ desires, not their needs. Sometimes they overlap, sometimes not. In 2018, “sleep” became a big thing. One Wall Street Journal headline proclaimed “Sleep the New Luxury.” This enables a mattress maker and marketer to talk about that product very differently than he has in the past when marketing to the affluent. And he should. The $500.00 special edition, hand-crafted in Sweden, presented in carved wood box woodsman’s axe I bought as a gift for friends leaving a big city and moving to a cabin in the woods does fulfill a utilitarian function, i.e., a need if called upon to do so, but its intent is more as décor. I bought it for symbolic and comedic purposes, and I suspect everybody buying it is doing so by want, not need. If motivated by need for an axe, it need not be special ordered or take $500.00. Nor would anybody pay $500.00 to meet the need.

 The thrust of Book Two was: Know thy customer. Most importantly for purposes of marketing to the affluent, know his wants (not just his needs) and know how he behaves as a consumer fulfilling his wants in the category of goods or services you are in or can most closely align your business with. This is an ongoing project, not something that gets completed by reading a book. Business owners usually define their own jobs poorly. They get lost inside the running of the business. This— constantly verifying, modifying, and deepening understanding of your affluent customer—is a key part of your job. It requires work. It is not good enough to get data from a boat show about the attendees. You must also go to the boat show and observe, listen, eavesdrop, get into conversations, be amongst them.

 In Book Three, we will move onto the more mechanical functions for obtaining and successfully selling to affluent customers. But these

### Connecting with the Affluent Customer You Want

##### “Every individual lives in a world of their own. And the only way
 you’re going to make the sale is to enter the world.”

—HARRY BROWNE

# Here’s the formula:

##### 1. Decide exactly who you want as a customer—notably, deciding on
 the level of income, net worth, overall affluence, lifestyle and ambitions, aspirations, interests, and attitudes about spending you want him to have.


-----

##### 2. Be sure you have crafted products, services, a business, its
 positioning—everything—for that consumer. 3. Go to that consumer wherever he is.

 That third point is succinct, but far beyond most business owners’ comprehension. Most business owners act as if they are trees with deep roots, at the mercy of whatever fertility or infertility, favorable or unfavorable environment exists and evolves around them. Today, consumers, especially affluent consumers, can be found, identified, effectively communicated with, attracted, and sold to at any distance near or far.

 The Power of UN-Obvious Place At the racehorse auctions I go to, there are a number of sellers of horse business goods and supplies—harnesses, sulkies, wheels, drivers’ uniforms and helmets, and veterinary supplies. And one pop-up jewelry store. Because, when the guy goes to the auction, he tells his wife: “NO—I am NOT buying ANOTHER horse. I’m just going along to keep the boys company.” When he returns home with a rope in one hand attached to another $25,000.00 horse, it’s helpful to have a $5,000.00 pair of diamond earrings in the other hand. This is about going to where the right consumer is.
 My wealth advisor client advertises in obvious places, like Investors Business Daily. But also, and often more productively, in the sports sections of affluent, business-vibrant cities’ newspapers and in affluent-aimed magazines like Cowboys & Indians and Private Jet Traveler. My gun manufacturer client advertises in the obvious gun magazines and in NRA media, but also in motorcycle magazines. The dating service, It’s Just Lunch, for whom I’ve done a little work, advertises in airline magazines. This is about going to where the right consumer is.

 Circumvent Search Far more premium-priced goods and services are sold to affluent buyers who were not searching online or by other means for them than are sold to buyers actively engaged in search. Their interest was aroused by direct


-----

##### outreach from the marketer. I say: live by search, die by search. Every marketer relying on Google is at its mercy—and it is not particularly merciful. Online search via Google or Amazon is all about commoditization, price equalization, and profit destruction. For true commodities, being present there is essential. But for many, many categories of goods and services, finding pathways to customers you interest, before they search, is to your immense advantage.

 No Boundaries Anymore “We’re not in Kansas anymore.”

—DOROTHY, IN THE WIZARD OF OZ

##### The U.S. is no longer the leader in wealth creation. The affluent and ultra- affluent in other countries, combined, number roughly eight-to-one those in the United States, and the fastest growth in new affluents is abroad.
 If you have long thought of yourself as a local or U.S. business, it is past time to rethink that, and think global. Many of the great difficulties to marketing and conducting business in faraway places have been erased or minimized. The internet, its media, and e-commerce is a boundaries killer and a major gateway for U.S.-based marketers to the entire globe and to these specific hot spots of rising mass-affluent and affluent consumer populations.
 At the very least, you must replace local with national. The location of prosperous consumer populations is dynamically changing and re-arranging itself as you read this.
 But why would somebody 1,000 miles away from you pay high prices for what you sell in Boise, Idaho, when there’s some of the same stuff within walking distance of their Boston townhouse? Or London townhouse? If you have to ask, you really haven’t been paying attention to the changing world around you. Cosmetic surgeons and dentists advertise nationally, in airline magazines, and affluent, discriminating patients fly to them. My client Ted Oakley, a wealth advisor, has clients in his home cities in Texas, but has more scattered throughout the country, and instead of advertising locally, advertises nationally. There’s certainly a bakery close to everybody, but Fairytale Brownies in Phoenix, Arizona—not celebrated as a gourmet


-----

##### food capital—ships boxes of fudge brownies to people all over the world. Dean & DeLuca® began in 1977 as a little gourmet grocer, in SoHo, in New York.

### Dan Kennedy’s #8 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Redraw your map. Focus more on the ideal customer than on self imposed limitations.


##### The more affluent the customer, client, or patient, the less concerned with convenience and the more he is willing to conduct business at a distance, import from afar, or travel to places in order to get exactly what he wants and what he believes to be the best of a category. Personally, I live mostly in Ohio. One of my three wealth managers is out of state, most of my real estate investments are in Iowa and managed by the aforementioned Mr. Garman there, some of my shirts are tailored in and come from England. The affluent buy a great many things without regard for normal and customary boundaries.

 We Know Where They Live “If your ideal customer is a one-legged midget who bowls in a league on Tuesday nights, has one wife, two kids, three dogs, and a riding lawn mower, we can get you a list of them in your ZIP code.
 It won’t be a very big list, but …”

—DAN KENNEDY, FROM HIS FAMOUS “MAGNETIC MARKETING” SPEECH


-----

##### Finding the affluent consumer ideal for you, in your area, or pinpointed like tacks on a map all over the U.S., is no great mystery.
 Twenty-three percent of U.S. households have more than 64% of all the earned income. Again: More than half of all the income is concentrated in only one of five households. Surely it must be easier to profit by marketing only to the one in five, while completely excluding and ignoring the four in five. Buying behavior supports such a notion. Affluents spend 2.6 times to 3.6 times more than non-affluents across all categories. They are 5 times more likely to buy or lease an automobile in any given year, 3 times more likely to spend over $2,500.00 on jewelry in a year.
 They outspend the four-in-five group in virtually every type of product category, except camping equipment.
 Yet, as obvious as it is that selling to the top 23% while avoiding wasting even a penny or a minute on the remaining 77% has to be the winning strategy, few marketers act this way. Most invest in mass advertising that reaches five in five and hope to be noticed by the one in five. Hope may be a laudatory human emotion, but is a very poor strategy. And an unnecessary one. We can do better.
 A lot of people ask me about finding the affluent, as if they were all residing in secret, undisclosed locations. Actually, privacy in America and many other places in the world is dead. We not only know where they live but also know what they’ve been buying, and whether they’ve been naughty or nice.
 For starters, there are people who have already gone to a great deal of trouble to spy on them, dig up data on them, monitor their buying behavior, and compile lists of them sorted by their interests and passions, by their level of affluence, by the frequency of their spending in a category, as well as by gender, age, ethnicity, marital status, home ownership, income ZIP code, and a myriad of other divisions. In mailing list lingo, these are called selects. The world of mailing lists commercially available for rent is an amazing place, where you can pretty much find any kind of group of desired prospects, then drill down closer and closer to your ideal prospects within the group by these selects.


-----

### Dan Kennedy’s #9 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### More wealth has been created through the use of mailing lists than any
 other media.


##### When you pass through the gateway to the mailing list world, you will discover that tens of thousands of mail order, retail, service, credit card, publishing, and other companies have all their lists of past and present customers, cardholders, and subscribers as well as their prospects or inquiries available for rent. A dirty little secret is that many companies earn substantial sums this way, some eclipsing the net profits from their core businesses and a comparative few are in business solely to build and rent lists. These are called response lists, because people have responded to an ad or direct-mail solicitation or have otherwise asked that company for information or made one or more purchases. Another type of list is a compiled (nonresponse) list. These are even more widely available and generally less costly to rent. The people on these lists did not, in any way, volunteer to be on them. The list owner accesses one or more sources of public records and information and assembles the list for the express purpose of renting it. Both kinds of lists can be very useful. Both offer different kinds of selects.
 For better understanding, we’ll work our way through a few hypothetical examples.
 Let’s assume you own a very upscale French restaurant with a good wine cellar, snooty waiters, and high prices—and you wish to go in search of affluent new customers. This happens to be an easy one, which is why I picked it. There are hundreds of list choices. For example, there is a compiled list of yacht and private plane owners, available by state or county. There are 213,090 prospects on the list. On that list, within a 45- minute driving radius of your restaurant in Beachwood, Ohio, there will be


-----

##### only a small number. Let’s assume there are only 200 of them. Those 200 names may be very valuable. We know to create and send them a mailing with planes and boats on the envelope, and maybe a line of copy like “Free Voucher for the Adventure Trip of a Lifetime Enclosed.” Inside, we can tell them we know they appreciate the finer things in life, appreciate new experiences, and often fly their own plane or sail their own yacht in search of them. But did they know they could take a trip to one of the finest restaurants in all of France, only a short drive from their own home?
 There is also a list available of people in any ZIP codes of your choice, arranged by birthday. As far as we know, everybody has one, once a year. So, in every month, there are quite a few people in reach of your restaurant having a birthday, and most people go out to dinner to celebrate. You can select from that list only married people, or people who own homes in pricey neighborhoods, or people with certain incomes. A colleague of mine operates a company that does these “Happy Birthday” mailings for restaurants and consistently gets tremendous response and very good return on investment.
 But we could get very sophisticated and merge and purge. That means taking only the names appearing on two or more lists. The yacht and plane owners’ list giving us only 200 names in our area might thin out to only 10 to 20 birthday names in any given month. But they are the quadruple- perfect prospects. So instead of sending them a birthday card or letter and a coupon for a free birthday dinner, we might send them a beautifully wrapped gift box, a copy of our menu, and a fancy certificate on parchment paper. Doing this, we would spend a lot more per prospect, but we would be spending all our money on ideal prospects.
 Let’s try another one. You own an upscale, but not ultra pricey, women’s fashion store featuring one-of-a-kind and unusual items. There’s a response list available of Peruvian Connection® catalog buyers. The catalog sells knit and woven sweaters and other clothes made from luxury fibers native to the Andes. The women buyers range in age from 35 to 55. Their average household income tops $100,000.00. They’re perfect for the clothing store but may also be good for a spa, medicalspa, even a cosmetic surgeon or dentist, a gift shop, or even the French restaurant. We won’t know unless we test.


-----

##### Here is the point: if you can describe your ideal affluent customers —whether ultra-affluent, affluent, mass-affluent, young, old, male, female, and so on—you can go into the inventory of available lists and find them, already rounded up for you. In all cases, you can get their physical addresses. In many cases, you can also get their telephone numbers, fax numbers if they are business owners or professionals, and email addresses.
 The obvious question is: Why not skip all this and just mail everybody in rich ZIP codes? In some cases, that will produce satisfactory results. But it deprives you of several key ingredients of optimum direct-marketing success, notably precision matching of prospects with offers. Getting down to a smaller number of carefully chosen high-probability prospects allows you to invest your money more wisely, market more efficiently, and craft and present a story about your business as well as an offer that is seen as specifically relevant to the recipient. If you are seeking appointments with affluent investors, you could just mail the rich ZIP codes. But if mailing the Investors Business Daily subscribers in those same ZIP codes, you know you are hitting active stock market investors, and you can tailor your message to them—“Disappointed with Your Results in the Stock Market? What If …”

 How Much Do We Know? We know just about everything! One way or another, from one or multiple databases, it is possible for all marketers national in scope and for many only local in reach to obtain and develop a hit list of ideal prospects.
 Here are some categories of leading-edge Boomers, born between 1946 and 1955, that have been identified and organized into databases by the research company Mature Data Profiles:

### Recommended Resource

##### Now, I’m going to suggest you do yourself a great favor. The person to learn all about mailing lists, selection of lists, access to lists, and profitable use of lists from is Craig Simpson. Craig’s book, to which I contributed, The Direct-Mail Solution, is a practical crash-course. Beyond that, you can find other helpful resources at www.simpson- direct.com. And if you decide to communicate with Craig directly, you’ll find his contact information on that site as well.


##### I’ve listed only 7 of 34 breakout categories encompassing 130 million names, addresses, and so on, which can also be pulled apart by exact age, gender, geography, mail-order response, marital status, net worth, occupation, even whether they wear corrective lenses! A list compiled from this data could also be over-layered against a specific company’s list of subscribers or buyers. In short, you can drill down with incredible specificity, to identify and reach out only to people perfectly, precisely, and multi data-point matched with your current customer, ideal customer, or product or service offer. And you should.
 Think of the power of combining precision-targeted lists of affluent buyers ideally matched with your business with a marketing system as described in the other chapters here!


### A Sample Affluent List—and What We Know
 About It

# Magellan’s is a leading catalog and mail-order company selling travel##### related products, including luggage, in-flight comfort products, health and safety items, books and DVDs, dual-time wrist-watches, men’s and women’s apparel, and items specifically for globe-trotters, like adaptor


-----

##### plugs and translators. The company’s catalogs can be seen and obtained at www.Magellans.com.

 Their customers are mass-affluent and affluent, with an average household income of $75,000.00. Average age, 55-plus, 59% female. If renting its lists, you can select by age brackets, gender, and geography as well as purchase activity. For example, as of this writing, there were 265,600 customers who had purchased at least once within the past 12 months; broken out, 51,000 of those had purchased apparel.

 Direct-marketing companies that repeatedly rent and mail to segments of this list include obvious ones, like Omaha Steaks®, Orvis®, Grand European Tours®, and Condé Nast Traveler, as well as less obvious ones, like The Wall Street Journal and AARP. These users suggest that any marketer of the obvious—travel, gourmet foods, wine—as well as marketers of financial publications, financial services, investments, and anything related to upscale retirement living could potentially use this list. Had I such a business or a client in such a business, I would definitely investigate further.

##### The Online Equivalents
 Facebook can match your customers with others who “look alike” within their entire database. Facebook can help you retarget people who’ve visited your site and literally stalk them, so that your ad messages show up everywhere they go. Although under intense pressure because of its role in “big data” and privacy invasion, Facebook is the marketing stalkers’ dream ally. Other social media and search engine media offer similar opportunities. It is my belief that all of these should be investigated and used when financial return on investment is proveable. The book in this series, No B.S. Guide to Direct Response Social Media Marketing, is a good start point. Also from Entrepreneur Press, Perry Marshall’s Ultimate Guide to Google AdWords, and Timothy Seward’s Ultimate Guide to Amazon Advertising. But keep in mind, all online media is more connected to where

##### people live online than geographically and physically, and is basically search driven. What you can do with it is almost entirely reactive to their expressed interests and activities. With offline media, you have opportunity to be ahead of their search; to be first, or, better yet, to create their interest and be into a one-to-one sales conversation with them that pre-empts anyone and everyone else.


### Where Should You Drill for Oil?

 Years ago, I got to know a “professional psychic” I met at the bar after
##### his show in the lounge at the Playboy Club in Phoenix, Arizona. He had a home worth more than a million dollars perched high on Camelback Mountain, drove a Rolls-Royce, and seemed wealthier than might be expected for an entertainer working such small venues. He told me he used his performances only to “drill for oil.” By that he meant making himself visible and approachable to a few wealthy patrons who chose to employ him privately for advice on a variety of matters, at substantial fees. He said he named his approach “drilling for oil” in honor of one of his first patrons, a very rich Texas widow who had inherited her late husband’s oil business. She hired the psychic to walk her vast oil fields and choose the next five places to drill new wells and paid him an ongoing royalty on the production of any successful wells. He bore none of the costs of the dry holes. And, as he said, “How psychic must you be to pick one winner out of five—in an oil field?”

### Affluent Consumer Entrapment

##### “Creativity is over-rated. Most business success comes from doing
 boring diligent work. From developing a system that produces
 consistent results and sticking to it.”

—RAY KROC

# You need a direct-marketing system.

##### Here I lack space and time to belabor these points as I do in other works of mine, but here are two vital facts: One, all wealth derived from business is based on systems. Two, most businesses have some sort of operations system but lack the more valuable marketing system. To be successful attracting and marketing to the affluent, you will need to spend more per


-----

##### prospective customer, client, or patient (reasonable in light of their greater value), so you cannot afford to let any of them slip through your fingers. Further, they judge your competence and trustworthiness from the outset, so how organized you are in your marketing influences their willingness to do business with you. For these and other reasons, you need a direct-marketing system.
 What is such a thing? As its name implies, it directly reaches out to, connects with, and brings the desired prospective customer, client, or patient to you.
 All systems use bait to lure the desired creature into the trap. I’ll switch to more elegant language in a few minutes, but for starters, tolerate my being deliberately coarse and simplistic with a basic example. Consider the company Fisher Investments, by my standards and my clients’ standards, it has a primitive and simplistic system, but it will do as the basic example, and if you stop to think about it, you are probably aware of the company. It is a multi-product investment and money-under-management firm aiming at mass-affluent and affluent (but not ultra-affluent) investors. Its advertised floor is investable assets of $500,000.00 or more. You’ve probably seen TV commercials, magazine ads, USA Today ads, or The Wall Street Journal ads, or possibly received direct-mail solicitations. All that advertising does is offer bait to lure you into the trap. The bait is one or more free reports, like The 9 Mistakes Affluent Investors Make, a free audio CD, a free DVD, or a package of all that information. The titles and promises of what you will discover from these things are the real bait. You will discover lies your current broker, banker, financial planners are telling you, taxes you are paying unnecessarily, safe but high-yield investments you don’t know about. You will get this from a highly credible and authoritative source. That’s the bait. Whom is that bait for? Relatively new mass-affluents with little knowledge or confidence about investing. People who are aware they should be investing their money but do not know what to do or whom to trust. Affluent people frustrated with stock market ups and downs or losses.
 My comments mean no judgment, pro or con, about Fisher Investments as an investment firm. I have no firsthand knowledge and no opinion. I am only making observations in my area of expertise—marketing—and using Fisher’s as example. Incidentally, Ken Fisher himself is a featured guest


-----

##### speaker at one of our two member conventions in 2019, speaking not only about money but also about the marketing that has raised his firm to number one. If you happen to be reading this early enough in 2019, you’ll find information about the conference at www.Superconference19.com. If past March 2019, all other, next conferences’ information gets posted at www.NoBSInnerCircle.com in its time. The reason we invited Ken is salient whether the time of his appearance is ahead or behind us: His company is a lead generation monster, and I mean that in a good way. It successfully defies the common but erroneous idea that affluent people won’t respond to straightforward lead generation and direct marketing.
 Fisher’s bait lures those particular creatures into a trap. By design, there are a lot of creatures it does not lure, such as those with less than $500,000.00 to invest, or those cemented in place with existing money advisor relationships.
 The trap is a place where the creature’s name, address, email address, fax number, and phone number are captured and, of utmost importance, permission to use this information is secured.


### Dan Kennedy’s #10 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### The most valuable asset is a list of high-value customers and prospective
 customers who invite and welcome communication from you.


##### Additional information may also be asked for and captured at a trap, such as age or occupation or income, so as to assign the captured creature to a different sub-trap, to be shown and fed slightly different sales messages appropriate to him. From there, a follow-up process begins. In Fisher’s case, it is simplistic; the package sent more of an excuse for immediate and direct follow-up by telephone agents than anything else. We can do better and be more sophisticated, as I’ll show you. Still, what Fisher does is


-----

##### effective and successful for that company. The website is the ideal trap medium, as it allows us to automate this entire process, even to the point of the customer doing his own data entry work for us. But a recorded message and voicemail, a call taken by a live human, or a reply form or card returned by fax or mail can all serve as traps as well.
 Before going further, there is one very important point to be made. Fisher Investments, targeting mass-affluent and affluent investors, in order to then offer professional money management services, does exactly the same things as, for example, TempurPedic® does to cast a much broader net and then sell mattresses, or the lowest of low-end “burial insurance for just 50 cents a day” companies advertising on TV do to target the very non- affluent and then sell a term insurance policy. Regardless of what they are selling or whom they are selling to, virtually all direct marketers do the same thing structurally: They use bait to lure desired creatures into a trap. The only changes are to the bait. You need the right bait for the desired creature. There is no creature that can’t be lured into a trap with the right bait. Let me say it again: There is NO creature that can’t be lured into a trap. With the RIGHT bait.
 Now, we’ll get more sophisticated, and use more elegant language, with which you may feel more comfortable!
 Our direct-marketing system, just like the previous examples, will extend an invitation designed for a specific audience via a variety of means and media. You might use any or all of these to extend your invitation:

 • Print advertising in newspapers, magazines, newsletters, or other
 publications
 • Banner advertising at others’ websites
 • Buying traffic for your website with Google™ Ads® or other means;
 pay per click
 • Using publicity to get articles about you placed in different
 publications and media
 • Direct mail to rented or compiled mailing lists
 • Email to opt-in lists
 • Radio or television advertising

 And I could list a hundred more options.


-----

##### Regardless of means or media, in every place, the same invitation is extended. It is kept simple and clean. It is NOT an attempt to sell your products or services at all. It is an invitation for the recipient to request and be provided something of relevance, interest, and value to him, free of charge. The more appealing and specifically relevant the item offered, the better the response.
 In recent years, I’ve taken to calling this INFO-FIRST MARKETING, meaning that information of interest to desired customers, clients, or patients is put forward first—sometimes completely concealing the product or service to subsequently be presented, sometimes with such disclosure. This supports Step 1, usually called LEAD GENERATION by direct marketers.
 The individuals accepting your invitation arrive at your “place,” and enter your foyer. And only the foyer. They are not permitted to roam the mansion as they please. The foyer is a nice place, be it a website, recorded message, live human on the phone, or something like an exhibit booth at a consumer or business exposition or even your store, showroom, or office. But in many cases, it’s a website or the handling of an incoming call. There, they sign the guest book. That means they provide the information you want, in exchange for receiving the appealing information or gifts you offered them in your invitation. Think of the foyer as nicely appointed, with the guest book on a big, gold podium, with a spotlight shining on it. But nothing else is there. It is premature to display product, describe services, talk price, or do anything else but get the guest book filled out.
 At a website foyer, there may be what’s called in internet lingo a double-squeeze page. It’s actually two guest books. First, the person is asked only for his email address, thus reducing the request to one item. In exchange, he may get an email newsletter, ebook, or something else electronically delivered. When he provides his email address, a door opens and a butler appears with yet a second guest book. In other words, a fresh landing page materializes, now asking for a full physical address, possibly fax, possibly phone, and possibly additional questionnaire-type information. In exchange, the person will then be sent offline a package of information, materials, and gifts, likely including a book and/or an audio CD and/or a DVD. This strategy winds up creating two different lists for follow-up: 1) the timid and likely only curious or mildly interested people willing to


-----

##### provide only an email address and 2) the more compliant, likely more interested, and likely better prospects willing to provide all their information. And depending on what information they provided, they may be further divided. We’ll get there.
 Now that they have signed the guest book or guest books, one of two things may occur immediately. One, they may be thanked, promised that the information they asked for will arrive in a few days, and politely ushered out. Or, two, they may be given the option of entering a very short corridor that provides access to only one or two rooms. Again, not free run of the whole mansion. There might be a nice little reading room, where they can read their ebook. Or a little theater where they can watch a short film, possibly of happy customers giving their testimonials. There is usually no direct, instant path into a showroom or salesman’s office where selling them is immediately attempted, although there are exceptions to this, including on the internet.
 Step 2, then, is CAPTURE IN THE TRAP. What I have described so far has many virtues. It alters your advertising from being product- or service-directed to being customer-directed. It automates everything, so you or staff members are not engaged in unproductive, repetitive manual labor. It gives the prospect a nonthreatening, satisfying experience devoid of sales pressure. It provides you with a very valuable asset, a database of people who’ve stepped forward, raised their hands, and identified themselves as interested prospects. Finally, if you wish, it allows you to run smaller, simpler ads, keeping the front-end costs low and investing most of your resources only in interested prospects.
 If this is new and unfamiliar to you, I can only urge you to stop and carefully reread it, as there are ways it can go awry. And I encourage you to go to traps offered by sophisticated direct marketers and experience their entire systems for yourself. The best—and cheapest—way to learn this methodology is by playing prospect with companies doing lead-generation advertising.
 Next, a series of proactive follow-up steps occur, from you, the marketer, to the prospective customer, client, patient, or investor.
 We have prospects who have signed the guest book. We may treat them all the same and assign them all to the same follow-up communications


-----

##### program. Or we may divide them in some way, assigning different ones to different Follow-Up Communications Programs. Regardless, they will all get a series or sequence of multi-media follow-up communications, all designed to persuade them to take one next step. In rare cases, that step might be making a purchase. In many, it will be scheduling some sort of appointment; coming to your place of business or inviting you or your sales representative to their office or home; attending a seminar, webinar, or teleseminar; completing and returning an application. Whatever. Everything moves the prospects toward this one next step. Typically, there will be a deadline for taking that step, with rewards for doing so and penalties for not doing so. A sample series of follow-up contacts might look like this:

|Day 1 after<br>having signed<br>guest book|Send requested book, brochure, and DVD. Send email<br>acknowledging request and telling them package is on its<br>way.|
|---|---|
|Days 2–10|Daily email, a lesson in a course on wise<br>buying/investing/using the sort of thing being sold … tips<br>plus reminder of offer.|
|Day 4|A letter with a booklet of customer testimonials …<br>encouraging them to review everything sent.|
|Days 5, 7, 9|Three jumbo postcards, each focusing on a different<br>benefit.|
|Day 10|“Only five days left” letter with encouragement to go to a<br>website and view ten-minute special presentations.|
|Days 12, 13,<br>14|“Countdown to deadline” emails.|
|Day 15|Representative places outbound call.|
|Day 16|Email extending deadline and inviting them to 30-minute<br>webinar and group question-and-answer session.|
|Day 19|“Last chance” letter with CD or DVD of the webinar.|
|Day 21|Representative calls again.|


-----

|Day 25|“Offer withdrawn notice” letter.|
|---|---|
|Months 2–5|General email newsletter, once a week.|
|Month 6|New series of letters or postcards extending original<br>invitation and inviting them to reraise hand and start<br>process over with free information.|


##### Step 3, then, is follow-up. What I’ve just laid out is still somewhat simplistic, compared with the systems my businesses and many of my clients’ businesses use. These systems may divide up the prospects to begin with and send different communications to 2, 4, or 20 groups. Those not responding to the entire system may be moved at its end to the start of another one, leading to the sale of a lower-priced or higher-priced or otherwise altered version of the product or service or an entirely different product or service.
 The follow-up is where the giant opportunity is, because most businesses do little or no follow-up whatsoever. Response develops through follow-up. Whatever the response from a single attempt, it tends to as much as double with the second and third follow-up attempts, and double again with the fourth through whatever follow-up steps. So, if you got a 1% response from mailing out a package of information to a group of prospects, you would likely get another 1% or better from the second and third follow- up steps combined, and yet another 1% or better from the subsequent follow-up steps combined. If you begin with 1,000 prospects, that’s 10 sales if you contact them only once or 30 or more with comprehensive follow-up. If you sell a $1,000.00 item, you’re choosing between obtaining $10,000.00 or $30,000.00 or more from the same group of prospects.
 When marketing to the affluent, this math changes, favoring follow-up even more. While many prospect groups’ yield might be flat: 1%+1%+1%, an especially affluent prospects groups’ yield might be tiered: .25%+2%+5%. It takes more communication and more time to directly create trust with affluent customers. Because their value is greater, the added investment of more steps in follow-up is easily justifiable and usually a bigger economic win.

##### Once somebody understands the virtues of this kind of system, does he hurry to develop his and get it working for his business? Candidly, no.

 Problems and Solutions There are three chief reasons that, frankly, the vast majority of marketers shown this systematic-approach fail to develop it for their own businesses. My book No B.S. Direct Marketing: The Ultimate No Holds Barred Kick Butt Take No Prisoners Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses includes many inspiring and amazing case histories from people in a variety of non-direct-marketing businesses who have done the work necessary to transform their businesses this way, and I urge you to read it. And they are representative of experiences and results typical among all the No B.S. Inner Circle Members who follow this path. But I’ll be the first to tell you they are rare birds. Here’s why.

 Problem 1. It’s work, to get it built, tested, and working for you successfully. Sadly and stupidly, most people would rather spend every day of their entire lives chopping wood manually with a dull axe, complaining all the while, than turn off the TV and put in a few extra hours a night for a few months building an axe-sharpening device or, better yet, an electric, power wood- cutting machine.

 Problem 2. It’s complicated. Most people desperately want a magic pill, not a diet regimen incorporating food choices, portion control, nutritional supplementation, and exercise. That, incidentally, is why 99% of the fat folk stay fat. In business, it’s the same thing. There’s rarely a single, simple magic pill-like solution to any problem or exploitation of any opportunity. There’s even virtue in possessing a complicated process, as most competitors will be too lazy and simple-minded to copy it, even if it is successful and shown to them.

 Problem 3. Specific to marketing to the affluent—the higher up in affluence you go, the more protected are the prospects. Gatekeepers screen the communications you try to send to them. There are obstacles in your way. It is not necessarily easy to reach out to them and attract them. Also specific to the affluent—the higher up in affluence you go, the less responsive to


-----

##### advertising and more responsive to peer recommendations ad referrals people are.
 Now, for what it’s worth, the solutions … For Problem 1, work. What we are talking about here is nothing less than the transformation of your business from random acts of marketing that produce erratic and unpredictable results to a machine that runs dependably and efficiently, day in and day out, much of it automatically. Ownership of such a machine is a wonderful thing. But you can’t expect to build such an enormously valuable thing for yourself with nominal effort or investment. You will need to, first, thoroughly understand it, and then experiment with specific application to your business.
 For Problem 2, embrace the complexity! It’s a source of power. But, to be fair, the actual mechanics of managing the prospects (databases) and the multi-step, multi-media follow-up with color-coded file folders and Post- It® notes or ordinary contact management software can be messy. There is one software system that has been built from the ground up to manage, automate, implement, and track exactly these kinds of marketing systems, specifically my designed systems—and only one. It is called Infusionsoft, and I urge you to investigate it. Free demonstrations are available (see Resource Box). In the interest of full disclosure, I am a stockholder in and advisor to the company.

##### Problem 3 requires two things. One, appearing in the places where your affluent prospects pay the most attention. This will lead to different media choices than, say, your regular daily newspaper, mass-circulation magazines, or run-of-day TV or radio advertising. Two, direct mail to carefully selected lists using more elaborate pieces and delivery means than ordinary mail. In business-to-business environments, you may need specific strategies for the professional gatekeepers. The good news is, there tends to be less clutter in their mailboxes because the majority of marketers give up. You should not be deterred by this difficulty; it is in proportion to the value of the customer or client to be obtained. And make no mistake: the affluent customer or client can be drawn to the trap with clever direct marketing. The investment advisor currently managing my retirement funds started the process of securing me as a client with a direct-mail piece including a large roll of duct tape inside a plastic bag, delivered via FedEx.
 A maid service solicits homeowners in an exceptionally affluent neighborhood by delivering DVD players preloaded with a 20-minute DVD of its clients’ testimonials, filmed in the clients’ luxury homes. It reported to me a 30% response rate from this campaign. This approach not only delivered media that could not easily be ignored or casually tossed in the trash but also addressed the fact that affluent customers rely more on referrals than on advertising, by delivering simulated referrals—clients like them, possibly known to them, speaking to them on the DVD from their own homes. Such social proof from true peers can successfully bridge the gap between advertising and the affluent client’s preference for peer recommendations. This company has now moved this into a marketing system like I’ve described in this chapter, driving affluent homeowners into its website trap to request the DVD, or view it instantly there, and download free reports about care of antique furniture, stain removal from custom- made rugs, and similar topics.
 If you are one of the rare birds who commit to development and implementation of this kind of direct-marketing system, you’ll soon be sending me similar success reports.

### Using Direct Mail to Reach the Affluent

##### By Craig Simpson

# Specificity is one of the most important elements for making direct##### mail campaigns to the affluent profitable. You need specificity in your lists to pinpoint those who are most likely to want what you’re selling. And you need specificity in designing sales copy and an offer they will find appealing.
 I have worked with clients in a number of industries, helping them create profitable direct-mail campaigns for affluent prospects. This is a brief summary of my methods with examples in three different fields: medical,


-----

##### financial investment, and land investment. As you’ll see, the same methods work in all areas, but it’s the specificity of how they are applied in each area that leads to success.

 Example #1: The Medical Field First we’ll look at how I gear my direct-mail methods in the medical field. I work with a number of chiropractors and medical doctors who treat a variety of ailments such as back pain, knee pain, joint pain, migraines, neuropathy, and obesity. These treatment programs involve a major time investment by the doctor, so treatments usually range in price from $5,000.00 to $12,000.00. Most insurance carriers will not cover these treatments, so our goal is to only market to those who can afford to pay cash.
 I’ve used a specific system for years to convert affluent prospects into high-paying patients. It requires targeting my message, the type of list we use, and the offer. With thousands of marketing messages hitting your prospects every day, you need to make sure the message you send stands out and hits home.
 One of the best ways I’ve found to get the highest response for my medical doctors is to identify a specific, targeted, narrowed-down group of prospects to whom I can speak directly about their specific type of pain. The key is to address what’s keeping them up at night and offer relief.
 When we reach out to these prospects, we often find that many of them are resistant to coming into the office to learn about their treatment options. Even though they have a pain that keeps them up at night and makes it so they can’t do the things they enjoy most, they’re reluctant to take action. They have an internal barrier between them and the medical office. I’m not sure why this is. Maybe they saw a doctor in the past and they didn’t receive the treatment they were hoping for. Maybe they have a preconceived idea that all doctors are going to provide the same treatment program so it’s not worth going into the office for the consultation. Maybe it’s fear. I’m not sure why they will not come into the doctor’s office. But they won’t. So we are forced to come up with another option that will generate a higher response.


-----

##### In my experience we have the best success with increasing prospects’ response by getting them to attend a free lunch or dinner event instead of having to go to the office. We accomplish this by sending out a direct-mail letter inviting the prospect to a special lunch or dinner where the doctor will give a presentation on their specific ailment. For example, if we are targeting those with migraines, then the invitation will talk about migraine pain and stress that there is a solution for that they may not be aware of, but that will be fully explained by the doctor at the free lunch or dinner event.
 With my doctor clients, once the prospect arrives at the lunch or dinner event, the doctor will proceed to give a presentation on migraines and share all the pain points the prospects are most likely dealing with. Then the doctor presents the solution and explains how treatment can reduce the pain and possibly take it away completely.
 The presentation offers an inexpensive consultation. The goal is to book consultations in the office within the next day or two. Once the prospect comes into the office and receives the full evaluation, the doctor can then present the treatment plan.
 Up to this point, there is nothing special about getting targeted prospects to attend a free lunch or dinner and then sign up for a low-priced evaluation. As long as the list is targeting migraines, you should be able to get people to attend.
 The hard part comes with getting someone to spend $5,000.00 to $12,000.00 on a treatment program. How can we increase the likelihood that these prospects convert into patients?
 The key is to start off on the right foot by being very specific in selecting our mailing list. Not only do we want a mailing list that targets people who suffer from migraines, but we also want to include a selection of a Value Score or Credit Score that is high enough to show that these prospects can afford the treatment or are qualified to receive funding for the treatment.
 In most cases, we are targeting seniors, so a Value Score, or Credit Score, will work better than selecting for a high income. In many cases, seniors will have a lower fixed income, but have hundreds of thousands in the bank—a very nice nest egg. So if you select based on income, you could end up missing a large portion of your qualified, affluent buyers.


-----

##### A few other selects (criteria) that I’ve found help increase response rate are home ownership and being married. But the key to marketing to the affluent in this niche is to select by Value Score or Credit Score.

 Example #2: Financial Investing Now let’s look at another example in a different industry. This is for one of my clients, OptionSellers.com, an investment firm offering individually managed option-selling portfolios to highnet-worth investors.
 Selling options is appealing to many investors because it’s an alternative investment that can make money regardless of whether the market is moving up or down. Many investors use the services of OptionSellers because they are specialized experts in option selling.
 What’s unique about OptionSellers is that they traditionally only want to work with clients who have at least $2 million in net worth. Plus, these individuals need to be open to an alternative investment (not stocks and not real estate). This can be a very tough group of affluent prospects to get to respond. So, how do we find these individuals?
 First we need to create sales copy that speaks specifically to this group. We intentionally use wording like, “If you are an investor with a net worth of $2 million or more …”
 By calling them out like this in the sales copy, we will get their attention if they have a high net worth. It also discourages those who should not respond. Prospects who do not meet the net worth requirement are less likely to respond because we are telling them in the sales letter that they are not a fit.
 We also write sales copy that grabs the attention of those seeking alterative investments. We say, “Are you sick and tired of the lack of diversification and lackluster returns offered by your traditional investments?” The goal is to grab the attention of those who are unhappy with the results of traditional investments and want to try something different.
 The sales letter leads to an offer for a free book and DVD. This is a low barrier to entry. Prospects do not feel they are being sold something. Instead, we are educating them on how to sell options. Once they learn how


-----

##### the technique works, they may feel more comfortable taking the next step and setting up a consultation.
 In addition to having the right sales copy to attract the appropriate prospects, we also need to use lists that are going to generate a good response.
 On the list side, I select lists of prospects who have purchased other products and services that relate to alternative investments, such as a subscription to a newsletter on making international investments. Or it might be a group of prospects who have purchased a course on trading commodities. Or it might be investors who are purchasing Gold and Silver. The best list sources are made up of those who have responded to a prior marketing campaign related to alternative investments.
 The second criterion is to find those with investable assets of $500,000.00 or more, indicating that they have a large sum of money available to invest. An investable asset is money not currently tied up in another investment. This is important because it means prospects have money immediately available to invest.
 Once again, it’s the combination of list, copy, and offer all working together that gets these affluent investors to respond.

 Example #3: Real Estate Investing The last example I’ll give is for another of my clients, Teton Land & Development Group. They are looking for affluent real estate investors who want to invest in one of their many resort communities.
 They have a few challenges they must address. They need affluent prospects who are not only interested in real estate investing, but who are okay with investing in a specific location: Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
 We are able to deal with these challenges the same way we addressed the challenges in finding affluent patients for doctors and affluent alternative investors for OptionSellers. We succeed by specifying a targeted list, the right sales copy, and an appealing offer.
 Teton’s first issue is addressed by looking for affluent prospects on the list side. I find mailing lists made up of prospects who have a high net worth or have investable assets of $500,000.00 or more (similar to


-----

##### OptionSellers). I also find prospects who are interested in real estate investing.
 But even though we may find many prospects who are interested in real estate investing, the fact is that most want to invest in an area located near them. They want the option to easily visit the property they are investing in. Unfortunately, if we limited the mailing universe to a 200-mile radius around Jackson Hole, there would not be enough investors to keep growing this business. And this is where the sales copy must carry the load.
 In order to get prospects to respond to a real estate investment that’s not in their area, we need sales copy that promotes how extremely unusual it is to own property in a resort/national landmark area. We need to stress that this opportunity is limited and may not be around forever.
 The sales piece describes the location as being in one of the “most beautiful areas in the western hemisphere, Jackson Hole, Wyoming.” We make it clear to the prospect how limited and rare it is to find property in Jackson Hole and what an exclusive opportunity this is. Once all the property is sold, you can’t simply produce more. When the supply is gone, assuming the demand continues, the only option is for the real estate price to go up.
 We also invite prospects to come to Jackson Hole to visit the property. We say, “I’d love to personally host your trip here to Jackson Hole so you can see up close and in person what we have going on. I know you’ll love it here …”
 Of course, the offer is not to come visit Jackson Hole; that’s just an option we make available so they know they are welcome to visit if they want to. The offer is simply to get prospects to request more information. This makes affluent prospects feel as though they can educate themselves on this possible investment without having to commit to a sales call or a trip to Wyoming. With a high-priced product like this, or the other examples we looked at here, we have to ease the prospect to the final commitment in easy stages.

 Summary To summarize what we’ve learned from our three examples, first, you must do everything you can to find the affluent prospect on targeted mailing lists.


-----

##### The more specific you can be in pinpointing your prospect, the better. Second, you also need to make sure you use sales copy that will draw in the truly interested prospects and repel the tire kickers. And third, you need to make an offer that is an easy, non-threatening entry point. We don’t want to scare off prospects by making them feel as if they are going to be hit with a lengthy sales presentation to pressure them into something. Rather, we want to help educate them and then, if they choose, they can take the next steps.
 One final word: if you’ve gotten prospects this far, be prepared to take them the rest of the way. Once they’ve raised their hand and showed interest by attending an event or requesting more information, you must do everything you can to keep them engaged and get them to take the next step of scheduling an assessment or consultation.

#### CHAPTER 24

### Using Social Media to Reach the Affluent

##### By Cindy Cyr

# One in four purchases is influenced by social media in every category.
##### Sometimes this happens in ways you wouldn’t expect. The Gucci open- backed, coyote-fur lined Princetown slipper, which sells for $995.00, would normally just have stayed a runway oddity. However, thanks to social media influencers such as BryanBoy (659,000 followers on Instagram) and Leandra M. Cohen (697,000 followers on Instagram) posting them on their Instagram pages, the slipper became a Gucci staple produced every season.


-----

##### The Drive reported that in 2017 Lamborghini had their seventh consecutive record-breaking year, increasing 10% over the previous year. In the article, Lamborghini’s CEO Stefano Domenicali said he believed their presence on social media played a key role. “We also significantly increased brand awareness, especially with the young generation, proved by the success of our social media channels,” Domenicali said.
 Reaching affluent customers on social media can build your authority, build trust and affinity, give you a bigger presence, circumvent search, and reach affluents directly and more. But to do this, you must arm yourself with a plan.

 Who Should You Be Targeting? Of course, Gucci and Lamborghini are well-established brands, so how can a lesser known brand target the affluent audience on social media? Start by understanding who you should be targeting.
 Affluencers, defined as affluents who are also influencers, is the top category of people you’ll want to target. They influence behavior and shopping habits in their network. They are early adopters of innovative new products and services, tech-driven, and prefer to go off the beaten track when they travel. People come to them for advice. Plus, they don’t just influence others, they spend more in nearly every category than other affluents, spending on average 1.4 times more than the general affluent population.
 On average, affluencers spend 7.5 hours a week on social media and ultra-affluencers spend 9.1 hours, and while affluencers tend to be younger, you’ll find affluencers across every age group. Affluencers differ in age and income depending on what category your product or service falls in. For example, if you’re selling watches or jewelry, affluencers tend to be in their mid-thirties. Home-remodeling and décor lean towards age 39. Planning and retirement, age 45. This doesn’t mean you won’t find affluencers at a different age, though.
 Affluencers like brands on social media, comment on products or brands, share content, look for something to read, and more, including making purchases. In fact, 10% make purchases on social networks. What is important to understand is that when affluencers like your brand on social


-----

##### media, they do so for one of three reasons: 1) They own or use the product or service (for some this is their way of bragging). 2) They are interested in purchasing your product or service soon. 3) They want updates/information on your products or services.

 Know Which Social Media Networks Your Audience Uses and How
 They Use Them Social media is a moving target, so you’ll constantly need to stay on top of which social networks your audience is using to see if they are migrating to a new platform. That said, different social networks are preferred within different categories and at times, even across different age groups. Affluencers across the board use Facebook the most. However, if you look at how much time is spent across a dozen or so other social media sites, it varies depending on the category they have the most influence in. For example, if you are in the travel industry, affluencers’ top four social media sites are Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram. But when comparing that to the general population, LinkedIn comes in last place on the list of 11 social media sites.
 If you are in a food and drink category, fashion, or home decorating category, you may find that Instagram and Pinterest are among your top social media networks. The point is to determine what networks are the best for your practice or business and spend more time creating a fleshed-out presence there. Keep an eye out for changes in the social media landscape and reduce time on platforms that are not delivering lead generation and awareness.

 Setting Up Social Media for Success No doubt you can find information on how to set up any social media network out there. But here are a few things you’ll want to do no matter what platform(s) you choose.

  1.  Fill out ALL your information across all of your social media
 accounts. Affluents search for businesses on social media. Make it convenient for them to get all the information they need without having to go dig for it or click a bunch of times. Your contact info,


-----

##### hours, website, ALL of your locations, popular times to visit, and so on should be listed. (Some profiles have limited space so be concise.)  2.  Make sure your information is consistent across all platforms.
 Affluents are keen on detail. Keep an eye out and make sure your business name, address, phone number, website, hours, payment options, parking info, and so on are the same on every social site you join. If your hours or some other piece of information differs from one social media site to the next, you’ll not just lose trust, you could lose them altogether.  3.  Optimize for search and filters. For every profile you create (or
 listing on a review site), use the categories provided. For some sites, you can add multiple categories and attributes such as payment options. This will help you get your business included in searches and filters.  4.  Invest in quality photos, content, and video. It pays to create
 attractive, well-composed photos. Pay attention to your videos too. I’m often surprised when a business that characterizes themselves as high quality posts something with a junky background or one inconsistent with their message or brand. Recently, I saw a high-end, high-priced publicist post a live video of an event she had been hired to promote. Not only was the video poor quality, but it looked like no one was there. Post good, quality content consistent with your message and what your audience wants to see.  5.  Use personality. There are a number of things affluent consumers
 find annoying on social media, and not having any personality is one of them. Other things you’ll want to stay away from is posting too many promotions, using slang or jargon, and trying to be funny when you’re not.  6. Reply to comments and messages. This should be obvious; however,
 it is surprising how many business people don’t answer people on social networks. You have an opportunity to start or build a relationship with people. Don’t just “like” a comment, reply to it. Check your messages and answer them. Pay attention to who is sharing your posts. If they share it, go make a comment on the shared post on their page. Unless you are getting hundreds of shares,


-----

##### this should be manageable. Part of your time allocated for social media should include engaging in conversation with people. Realize affluents do not like to be ignored. If you don’t reply to people, you are not just missing an opportunity to build a relationship, you risk losing them altogether.  7. Claim and manage your listings. People are changing the way they
 search for things. It’s no longer just looking up your business on Google. They are using their mobile phone to do searches on social media and review sites such as Yelp, Trip Advisor, and FourSquare. For many review sites, customers can create a listing for you. The problem with this is that when a consumer creates the listing, you do not have control over it. In order to update and control the information on your listing, you need to claim your listing.  8.  Research the best time to post each day of the week. Rather than
 choosing one set time to post or looking at your analytics alone, do your research to determine how your affluent customers interact with your product and service as well as looking at industry research for your category and the social network you are using. Sprout Social has done research on this subject and found, for instance, that with the introduction of Instagram shopping, the best time for consumer goods to post was on Saturdays between 11:00 A.M. and 1:00 P.M. and the safest times every day of the week were between 10:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M. But on Facebook it was different. The best time to post for consumer goods on Facebook is Thursday at 2:00 P.M. and Friday at 11:00 A.M. The safest times of the week are between 10:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M.  9. Find out what your audience wants to see. One of the best ways to
 get people to engage with your page is to ask your best customers, clients, or patients—that fit your target audience—what they want to see on your social media pages. 10. Develop a plan. Don’t post on a whim or try to figure out daily what
 you’ll post. A well-thought-out plan with objectives for each post will help you tell your story, which will create an engaged audience. Plus, it’ll be much easier to post consistently good content.


-----

##### What Should You Post on Social Media There are several different strategies you can use when interacting with affluents on social media. And it somewhat depends on what your product or service is to determine which strategies will be most effective.
 For example, the financial services industry found that the wealthiest households surveyed are most likely to consume more specialized financial content, such as stock tips, while general financial information is more popular with less wealthy households.
 They also found that increasingly investors are using social media for information but not interacting with their advisors on these platforms. Plus, 70% of wealthy clients watch videos for financial advice.
 In this case, the advisor’s strategy would be wise to include regularly posting videos on specialized information and to concentrate on leveraging their social media to establish reputations for themselves as experts in specific topics rather than trying to engage or keep in contact with current clients.
 However, in another industry, engaging with current and prospective clients works well. Celebrity designer Wendy Bellissimo’s social media is brimming with personality where she tastefully shows affinity through references demonstrating she is “one of them.” Living in the gated, upscale, equestrian community of Hidden Hills, California, with her husband, four young daughters, and a collection of pets including dogs, chickens, and horses, she masterfully weaves her daily life, home décor products, and design service into her story. Showing stunning pictures and fun, often awe- inspiring videos in her stylishly decorated home, with her pups and chickens, adventures with her family, and design jobs she’s done for wealthy and celebrity clients, she satisfies in the minds of the affluent that she is authentic; believable; a knowledgeable, legitimate expert trusted by others; and more. She mixes it up by telling stories about her life one day, subtly inserting her products another day, and giving a more obvious, but tastefully done promotion another.
 A couple of examples from her page demonstrate:

 Example 1. “What a man, traveling with five girls all these years. Joe and I have never had a vacation without the girls … been 18 years! By choice of


-----

##### course, but I think we’re about ready now. I know they’re for sure ready to get rid of us for a bit. This is a throwback from our Kaaboo experience last fall …”

 Example 2. “Window treatments installed this weekend and the auto vacs came. I’m in love with the Soft White Linen Drapes and Motorized Roman Shades in @graciebellissimo’s bedroom. And so far I really like my #roomba. I actually purchased two of them so we could have one upstairs and one downstairs going at the same time. After I get to use them for a full week I’ll give you the lowdown.

Free swatches online smithandnoble.com and some areas also offer free in-home design service.) #homedecor #hiddenhills #calabasas #socal #interiordesign #windowtreatments.

 Build and Leverage Your Reputation as an Expert Social media can be used by any industry to build and leverage your reputation as an expert. Posting specific content you’ve created that demonstrates your expertise is one way to do this. In addition, you can interact with the media and other key influencers, using strategic tagging and connecting with them on a peer-to-peer level to establish and build a relationship with them. Share their post with your own commentary. Do an interview series where you invite and speak with top leaders in your field. This raises your reputation in the eyes of your audience. Plus, when the time comes for you to release a book or some other item, the people from these fostered relationships are more likely to reciprocate and promote you, endorse you, or even write a foreword for your book.
 In the book Authority Marketing, authors Adam Witty and Rusty Shelton give the example of their client Carol Sanford using Twitter to start a conversation with popular blogger Sam Ford at Fast Company. The connection led to Sam’s endorsement, which was featured on the front of Carol’s book.

 Design a Photograph-Worthy Space


-----

##### People capture every moment of their lives in photos these days. Designing your physical space or even an area in your business that is “photo-worthy” can encourage your current clients to take photos and share on their social media pages—thus introducing you to potential customers who might not otherwise hear of you. You see this with restaurants all the time. Designing not only foods and drinks to inspire photographs, owners are now designing their entire restaurant in hopes of inspiring the most photos possible. However, this strategy need not be limited to restaurants. Orthodontists could have a colorful and irresistible backdrop designed for when patients get their braces on … and off. You could hire an artist to paint an incredible photo-worthy mural on the side of your business. Or design a room in your business, like Hebron Family Chiropractic, who has an animal-themed mural painted on the wall and an adjusting table designed to look like a zebra in their kids’ adjusting room.

 Product Placement by Affluencers Teaming up with affluencers who have a large following that intersects with your target audience can be an effective strategy for getting your product or service in front of their audience. These influencers are social media “stars” who have monetized their subscriber base on Instagram by posting pictures and endorsing brands. You can reach out to affluencers individually or find them through companies that connect you to influencers. Influencers are offered products or services free (and/or paid placement) in exchange for displaying on their page. Having them also post on their “stories” allows you to provide a link to provide lead generation bait or instant access to purchase the recommended product or service. If you use this strategy, don’t just look for a big number of followers. It’s better to have an affluence with a smaller number of followers who closely fit your ideal target audience.

 The Wealthiest Customers Want Service on Social Media Research by McKinsey and Company found that the wealthiest consumers prefer customer service on social media (dubbed social care) by phone, as well as in-person customer service. Forty-eight percent of the $200k+ audience and 29% of the $150k-$200 audience prefer social care.


-----

##### You should not only be looking for consumers to reach out to you via social media for support, you should be prepared with a plan for how you will respond. Affluent consumers are not just looking to see if you are listening, they are looking at how you respond. While failure to respond can lead to an increase in churn, a study by Bain & Company found that when you engage and respond to customer service requests, consumers spend, on average, 20% to 40% more with you.
 To help you monitor customer requests, use one of the many tools available that alert you when you’ve been mentioned. It’s also important to look for mentions that might not be obvious–such as mentions where your business name is misspelled or tagged incorrectly.
 To reduce the risk of alienating wealthy clients:

 1. Assign specific people to this task—people who have the expertise
 and are adept and fully capable of quickly responding to and solving customer, client, or patient issues. 2. Respond quickly. Speed matters, and while some consumers find it
 acceptable to respond within 24 hours to a few days, approximately one-third of consumers expect a response within 30 to 60 minutes. 3. Develop processes for the people responsible for responding to
 customers. Processes should include: how to quickly contact you or other experts in your company to resolve issues rapidly should the need arise; the right way to take things off-line when necessary, and a reporting system so you can identify ongoing issues that need to be resolved. 4. Regularly schedule time to review customer service questions and
 issues that arise. Incentivize front-line staff to spot issues that occur. Use this to not only identify issues but to help solve the root causes of affluent-customer service issues.

 When you create a social media strategy designed to reach and connect with your affluent prospects, you can increase the awareness of your brand, improve loyalty, build your authority, create better customer satisfaction, and influence purchasing decisions (and more) in a cost-effective way.

### Using Authority to Attract the Affluent: The
 Seven Pillars of Authority Marketing

##### By Adam Witty

# There is a huge secret I learned from Mr. Dan Kennedy, the author of
##### this book: The higher up in income you go, the more you’re paid for who you are, rather than what you do.
 This is true in almost any category—from fitness experts and restaurant owners, to doctors, lawyers, real estate professionals, financial advisors, and beyond. It is a common thread you’ll see among the highest-earning business experts in every field.


-----

##### Think about the purchasing decisions you make in your own life. Let’s say you want to get your yard landscaped. You have two choices. The first is an unknown landscape architect that owns the local garden shop down the street. Perhaps you are aware of him because of the ads you’ve seen in a weekly discount magazine. The second is a landscape architect you recently saw on TV, discussing his new book on the best plant choices for yards in your area. This architect was just awarded the landscaping contract for the most prestigious hotel in your city; he regularly appears on a local cable TV show doing yard makeovers. Who would you be willing to pay more for, and who would you rather hire, given the choice? Both architects may choose the same plants and have equal years of landscaping experience— but you’ll be willing to pay more to the man who “wrote the book on it,” and who has landed TV spots, because you instinctively view him as the expert, the authority in his field.
 This is a critical point to grasp. If you are trying to attract the business of affluent individuals, they will not be drawn in by what you do, but by who you are. Your background, story, and authority credentials will drive the conversation far more than simply saying, “I put plants in people’s yards.”
 The next thing you need to understand is where affluent people go to get information, because it is a bit different from where non-affluent people go to get information.

 Affluent People Have Big Libraries. Poor People Have Big TVs Affluent people are readers, much more so than non-affluent people. You may have heard the saying, “Readers are leaders.” If you casually observe any company, any organization, in most cases, you will find the leaders of those organizations have a habit of reading. Ipsos Affluent Survey found that the more money a household makes, the more publications they read. Best-selling author Tom Corley also found during his five-year Rich Habits study that 85% of the wealthy read two or more educational books every month.
 Affluent people place more value on the collective wisdom gleaned from books than other socioeconomic classes. Because of this, if you want to attract affluent people, you need to reach them through a medium they


-----

##### avidly consume. In other words, to get on their radar you need to author a book. If you take that truth and combine it with the fact that people often pay more for who you are rather than what you do, you will better understand the rationale behind authority.
 I’ll turn to Dan Kennedy as an example. He has written over 30 books and has made publication a major part of his marketing strategy. Among them, a book titled The Ultimate Sales Letter has been on bookstore shelves without interruption since 1981. This book not only brings Dan clients, it established him as an expert and elevated his status above other copywriters. By deliberately positioning himself as the expert on sales letter writing, he attracts higher quality clients and is able to command large fees. To demonstrate, I’ll share a story in his words:

 Back when I flew commercial—I now travel by private jet—and when I was still on the hunt for clients and business, I always had copies of my books in my carry-on. In 1985, I was in first-class, on a flight from Phoenix to Houston, and the fellow next to me struck up the usual conversation. He identified himself as the owner of a Houston-based advertising agency and asked what I did. Instead of an answer or “elevator speech,” I stood up, got a copy of The Ultimate Sales Letter book, handed it to him, and excused myself for a trip to the bathroom. Two weeks later, I was conducting a nicely compensated training session for his staff copywriters, where he proudly told them, “Today, I have brought you the man who wrote the book on sales letter writing.”

 Writing a book aimed at your target audience is a powerful way to establish authority with the affluent, and should be added to your marketing strategy without hesitation. However, there are additional ways to establish it in the eyes of affluent, potential clientele. Authority itself can be manufactured, and a book is just one tool available to build it. The greater discipline of intentionally, strategically cultivating authority around yourself is known as “Authority Marketing,” and it can move mountains. Authority Marketing, in many ways, is about being comfortable having the spotlight shine on you. Not by accident or happenstance, but in a strategic


-----

##### and systematic way, creating the right perception to your target audience that you are the “goto perosn” in whatever it is you do.
 If you are like many, you may be hesitant to have the spotlight shine upon you. However, if you want to sell to the affluent, there is no way around it—you have to be seen as the indisputable Authority. For that to happen, you must take the reins and deliberately create your Authority position, because no one else is going to do it for you.
 Figuratively speaking, when you spot a beautiful crown sitting on the sidewalk, you need to have the tenacity to pick that crown up, dust it off, and squarely place it on top of your head. If you wait for someone else to crown you king or queen, you’ll be waiting forever!
 Unfortunately for many, the way we were raised as children left us timid about claiming our own Authority position. When you were a child, your mother might have urged you to be humble. Don’t be a know-it-all. Don’t showboat. Don’t brag. Drawing attention to yourself was implicitly discouraged—which is why most people think it’s unbecoming to want the spotlight shined on them. We’ve been programmed against self-promotion. Also, many people fear promoting themselves as an expert, then hearing people shout, “Imposter!”
 This stems from a lack of self-confidence. A doctor may have a medical degree and ten years of experience in his own practice, but still think to himself, “What do I really know anyway?” Many think, “If I shine this Authority spotlight on myself, then someone, whether it’s my competitor or a stranger down the street, may find out I don’t know all the things I purport to know. I could be found to be an imposter.” This is the destructive narrative that many people tell themselves. This is why some people are reluctant to pursue the path of Authority Marketing. I’ve found that those who do intently pursue it are the most ambitious in their industry. In most cases, they’re the ones who are already successful. The reason they’re already successful is because they’ve shelved any doubts they had about being the center of attention. Their motivation for being the center of attention is not to feed their ego, but to grow their business.

 Accelerate Trust in the Affluent Market Using the ACE Formula What do we mean by “Authority?”


-----

##### Authority occurs when you combine standout, trustworthy expertise in his or her field with the high visibility you might associate with a celebrity. When this happens, the expert’s name becomes synonymous with their field, which naturally provides an incalculable advantage over the competition.
 This advantage is critical in your effort to win over the affluent audience, and the blueprint for building it is straightforward:


##### Authority = Expertise × Celebrity


##### People Buy from People, Not Corporations To begin, we’ll discuss the “A” in the ACE formula, which stands for “Authority.” Everyone understands the value of having a visible, respected, corporate brand, but few understand the power of a personal brand.
 Most entrepreneurs launch a business, then channel their focus on building visibility and equity for their corporate logo and name, whether it be through high-end graphic design, expensive advertising campaigns, a dominant social media presence, or public relations. When you do that, you’re playing against some of the biggest brands in the world. Competing brands may have a multi-decade head start in terms of awareness and a marketing budget that dwarfs yours.
 Authority levels the playing field. By focusing your attention on your Authority, you essentially become your own individual brand. In an era of increasing skepticism toward large corporate brands, the more accessible “personal brand” serves to accelerate the speed of trust with your target customer.
 This is true even in big business. The third largest company in the world is Berkshire Hathaway, but people aren’t buying from Berkshire Hathaway. They are buying Warren Buffett. Apple became a technology giant, in part, because people felt a connection with Steve Jobs. People buy Richard Branson of Virgin all the time.
 The company is far bigger than the person, but people buy from people, regardless of the industry or size of the business. So, one of the best things a


-----

##### company can do, no matter their size, is to invest in building the individual Authority of its figurehead.
 The C in ACE stands for “celebrity.” Across socioeconomic classes, there is a shared sense of wonder toward celebrities. People will often define professional accomplishments through their connections with famous individuals. Given the choice, everyone would choose to work with one. For example, if you’re looking for a dentist, would you rather have the locally well-known celebrity dentist, who has written a book and makes regular TV appearances giving advice on how to keep your smile healthy? Or would you choose the ho-hum, nondescript dentist? Even for a question as simple as “Which dental provider should I choose,” the affluent will put their family under the care of the celebrity because they consider him or her to be the Authority.
 The E in ACE stands for “expert.” Chances are you are already an expert in your field. However, since you’re reading this book, the affluent audience you are trying to attract doesn’t necessarily know it yet.
 Every facet of a company’s marketing should work to build Authority, celebrity, and expertise. That is who the affluent want to work with; that is who they trust. If the prospect doesn’t trust you, they will not buy from you. Every company trying to sell a product or service has to overcome the hurdle that is the trust barrier. The prospect must have enough trust in the company that they will deliver as promised. The level of trust you need to convey to overcome the trust barrier will fluctuate depending on what you are selling. For example, buying an apple from a grocery store is very different from buying a new home, a new car, or deciding who will perform your heart surgery. Authority accelerates trust. When you have Authority, people give you the benefit of the doubt. People tend to say, “Well, he wrote the book on it. Of course, he knows what he’s talking about.” Or, “She’s on TV every week. She must be good.” It’s about creating the right perception so that people will buy. By building your Authority through third-party affirmation of your skills, you create the right perception. The more Authority you have, the less of a trust barrier there is to overcome.

 What Should Your Book Be About?


-----

##### It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in. There have been books published for just about every industry—doctors, dentists, chiropractors, financial advisors, real estate professionals, developers, restaurant owners, business owners. It all goes back to the same thing. Everyone wants to work with the go-to person. Everyone has to overcome a threshold of trust. And the more Authority you have, the quicker you accelerate trust and the quicker you make the sale. Keeping in mind that affluent people value books, a book is an objectively powerful medium that will elevate your credibility and get you noticed by that audience. Not to mention, affluent people tend to stay more informed than non-affluent people. Again, given a choice between a guy nobody’s ever heard of and a professional who has written five books and been on TV, a reasonable person will choose the professional who wrote five books.
 Your job here is not to become a celebrity the likes of Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian. Rather, it is to become the Authority, celebrity, and expert exclusively in the eyes of the people who can and will give you money. Cultivating the image of Authority to someone who can’t do business with you is a waste of resources and effort.
 Therefore, when it comes to building your Authority, you must narrow your focus specifically to those you can do business with and profit from. The more you sharpen your target demographic, the more you can tailor your brand image to appeal to that audience, becoming the exact professional they’re looking to work with. As the saying goes, your riches are in your niches, which is why I advise you to write a book that your ideal customer will see and immediately think, “This book was written just for me.”
 Too often, authors think their book can appeal to absolutely everyone, that there isn’t a single person who wouldn’t benefit from reading it. Thinking this way and writing a book this way will NOT help you reach an affluent target audience. First of all, it’s impossible to appeal to everyone. On top of that, such a book would be just plain vanilla—because in reality, a book that appeals to everyone, appeals to no one in particular. When writing your book, you can’t be the equivalent of store-bought, generic vanilla ice cream. You’ve got to be the hand-scooped, artisan-crafted, award-winning gelato that customers queue around the block for. For


-----

##### affluent people who are very in tune with the quality of service they’re after, they’re looking for the solution that screams, “This was made for me.”

 How to Leverage the Seven Pillars of Authority Marketing to Reach
 the Affluent Market If you want your message to reach the affluent, there has never been a more pressing time to get your Authority position established. In this day and age of online discoverability, the longer you postpone Authority-building, the further you fall behind your competitors. In our current environment, the first impression most people will have of you and your brand won’t happen in person or even over the phone—it will happen online, via page one of Google, your website, and social media channels. Think about it. Even if you are meeting someone for coffee or have a phone consultation scheduled, what do you do before meeting them? If you are like me, and many people I know, you’re scrolling through Google results for that person’s name. So, when you meet with people, expect that a first impression has already been established. As such, your degrees on the wall and years of hard-earned experience are no longer enough with the affluent audience. The good news is you can intentionally and strategically create an Authority Marketing blueprint and implement it to build your Authority, for both your digital footprint and tangible presence.
 There are seven components and practices used to build Authority before your target audience—these are known as the Seven Pillars of Authority Marketing, and they are the bedrock of your Authority Marketing blueprint.

 1. Branding and Omnipresence As discussed earlier, people are more drawn to individuals than impersonal corporate brands. Therefore, you need to create a distinct personal brand, every bit as recognizable and consistent as a corporate brand—but centered around you, rather than a business entity.
 Omnipresence means being everywhere. So, when your affluent prospect sees you, the kind of responses you want to hear are: “I feel like I’ve heard your name before. I feel like everywhere I go, I read something about you or I hear somebody talking about you.” Love him or hate him,


-----

##### President Donald Trump is a suitable example of omnipresence. Plenty of other billionaires ran for president before him, but none of them succeeded. Because of Trump’s book, speaking engagements, the fact that he was always on TV, the radio, and hosting The Apprentice—everywhere you went, you would see him. In the business sphere, you don’t need to go to that extreme. You don’t need to be “everywhere” in the truest sense of the word. However, you do want to be everywhere your target audience is looking. For example, if you are trying to build the most profitable orthodontist practice in Cleveland, Ohio, you might look at how you can be omnipresent to mothers between the age of 30 and 50, with school-age children, who live in Cleveland, Ohio.

 2. Content Marketing Content marketing involves the prodigious publication of valuable content that your target audience would want to consume. The ultimate form of content marketing is writing a book. However, content marketing also entails white papers, special reports, newsletters, teleseminars, webinars, blogs, podcasts, and so on. This works well because instead of explicitly saying “Buy from me” over and over, you provide valuable information to your target customer. Your first touch point with a potential lead is delivering value in the form of thoughtfully produced content. You educate them on the topic they were inquiring about, so that they think to themselves, “Wow, she sure seems to know what she is talking about.”

 3. PR and Media PR and media involve appearances on TV and radio, in newspapers, magazines, and on blogs—among many others. It’s about raising your overall visibility with media, podcast, or print interviews. PR and media accomplish two things. They reinforce your Authority in the mind of the viewer, listener, or reader. When someone appears on a TV show or on the radio, the likely reason they’re a guest on that show is because they’ve been deemed an expert. If they weren’t an expert why would they have been invited on the show?
 PR and media also serve to perpetuate branding and omnipresence. One of the most common mistakes people make is believing that the media will


-----

##### come to them. They believe the media has an agenda to promote their business for them. This couldn’t be further from the truth. The media’s agenda is to create compelling stories that their viewers, listeners, or readers want to consume. You must become part and parcel to the compelling stories that media outlets want to tell, then they will want to feature you. When you offer to talk about your newly published book or give your expert opinion on a hot current event, this is a far easier way to get on TV or the radio than announcing that your company just hired 10 new people or is expanding into a new market.

 4. Speaking It’s one thing to be a subject matter expert who “wows” anyone they have a conversation with. It is something else altogether when you take those stories, passion, and knowledge, and broadcast them on stage to a large group of intent listeners. Speaking engagements lend a literal and figurative microphone to your stories and knowledge, allowing you to reach and impact a wider audience than you’d normally be able to. This is incredibly empowering—for both you and your audience members. When you share your thought leadership on stage (whether it be at a conference, event, or seminar), you are perceived as an Authority by your listeners. Going beyond perception, this conveys your Authority objectively; if you didn’t know what you were talking about, why in the world would the meeting planner have scheduled you to speak?
 More importantly, speaking to your target audience is among the best ways to generate new customers. It’s imperative to make the distinction here that speaking isn’t just about trying to land a big paycheck. You don’t speak for the sake of speaker fees. You speak for the sake of putting yourself in front of the right people, who have the capacity to do business with you. That is the value of speaking engagements. For example, if a meeting planner calls and asks me to speak to a group of elementary teachers, that would be a hard sell on their part, because elementary teachers are not my audience. However, if I were asked to speak to a group of CEOs about Authority Marketing, that is my audience and that speaking engagement would have much higher value to me. The point here is that no


-----

##### matter what business you’re in, if you are asked to speak to an audience of your target customers, then the paycheck is largely immaterial.
 When you speak, if you’re resonating with your audience, you’ll have a line of people in the back of the room who want to do business with you as soon as you step off the stage. If you’ve written a book, and someone sees you autographing books and taking pictures with people in the back of the room, it establishes your Authority and credibility in their eyes.

 5. Events Events can be anything from putting on conferences, seminars, and boot camps to customer appreciation events. Using Dan Kennedy as an example, he holds two events per year through No B.S. Inner Circle (www.nobsinnercircle.com), with Dan as the keynote speaker. Hundreds of people travel thousands of miles, from countries all around the world, to come to hear him speak. The event alone creates a feeling of Authority, but when someone gets on a plane and travels to come to see you, that is powerful demonstration of your Authority position.
 Customer appreciation events, where you invite customers to bring their friends, relatives, and neighbors to come engage with and spend time with you, can be leveraged to build Authority. Subliminally, they build Authority in the minds of those who made the trip.
 This can be any event. For a restaurant owner or chef, it could be a cooking class. People will come to learn from you because your skill and reputation precede you. Or, if they come to your dinner seminar to learn about planning for retirement, it’s because you know more about the topic than they do, which conveys Authority. If you pull people’s attention away from their day-to-day to come to you and give you their undivided attention, whether it’s for days or just hours and minutes, you succeed in building your Authority.
 The first five pillars drive and enhance the last two pillars.

 6. Referral Marketing A good barometer to gauge the level of Authority you’ve attained is whether customers tell their friends and family about you. If you’re good, your customers will tell their friends about you. If you’re horrible, your


-----

##### customers won’t say a peep. The number of referrals you get indicates your Authority to some extent. Even more important to note: When you are the Authority, your customers want to refer you because it enhances their status for making the referral. A concept most people fail to grasp with referral marketing is that your customers, especially affluent ones, never want to feel like salespeople. When they pass out your business card, it makes them feel like a salesperson. A book, on the other hand, is not traditionally seen as a marketing tool. So, if your affluent customer is able to hand their friend a copy of your book, brag about how they “know the author,” and help their friend secure a “celebrity dentist,” it serves to enhance their status level in the eyes of the person they’re referring to you.
 In other words, if you want more referrals from your affluent customers, ask them, “What can I do to increase my level of Authority?” The more Authority you have, the more your clients will want to talk about you to their friends.
 A rhetorical question I often ask my clients is: When your clients go out to dinner with their friends, do they brag about you? If the answer is no, then you’ve got work to do.

 7. Lead Generation The more Authority you can demonstrate, the higher the volume of leads you will generate. You’ll also attract a higher quality of leads, who will want to talk to you. However, the reality of today’s skeptical landscape is that most people aren’t ready to buy immediately upon discovering you. The first step is simply getting someone to raise their hand and say they’re interested. Be ready to capture the people who show interest by offering a free report or your book (and so on). Most people miss this opportunity because the only things they offer on their website are purchase options or a free consultation, which most people aren’t ready to do. The more Authority you hold, the more likely they are to raise their hand. The other thing that increased Authority can accomplish is accelerating the sales process, taking prospects from simply being aware of and interested in you to wanting to do business with you, and promptly.

 How to Build Your Own Authority Marketing Blueprint


-----

##### Now that you know the Seven Pillars of Authority Marketing, you can begin building your Authority Marketing Blueprint. Here are the steps:

 Step one. When we are helping an entrepreneur or business owner build Authority, we start with an assessment to gauge where their current level of Authority is and locate areas of improvement. (You can identify your current Authority status and where you could improve by taking our FREE Authority Assessment at https://advantagefamily.com/authority- assessment/.)

 Step two. The next thing we do is diagnose the issues in your current marketing framework. We then draft a clearly defined Authority Marketing Blueprint, beginning with the end results in mind. We take each of the Seven Pillars of Authority Marketing and craft an actionable plan to deploy them in your business. Authority is not an accident, it is built in a strategic and systematic fashion. For example, if you want to gain lots of media exposure, you need to carefully strategize where you will pitch your news stories. You’ll want to focus your efforts in the prime radius of your practice, then work to ensure you become visible in every corner of media for that specific area.

 Step three. Get everyone on your team aligned and on board with the plan. Be sure that your team understands the blueprint and that everyone is on the same page.

 Step four. Once you have your Authority Marketing blueprint and the cooperation of your team, go forward and implement it. It is only through deliberate intention and disciplined action that true Authority can be gained.
 Armed with the knowledge of how to attract the affluent customer through book authorship and Authority Marketing, you can get started. When you do, you’ll increase the quantity and quality of affluent clients who come knocking on your door, eager to work with you. If properly leveraged, Authority Marketing is an objectively powerful tool to have in your arsenal. With sound strategy and determination, you can become the outright Authority in the eyes of the affluent and reap the rewards that follow.

#### CHAPTER 26

### Using Client Hero Stories

##### By Cindy Cyr

# One of the biggest mistakes business owners make is being company##### centric instead of client-centric. The affluent client doesn’t care about your story, they care about their own.
 Which is why it only makes sense that to win over customers and close more sales the proof is overwhelmingly in favor of including your customers’ stories, often referred to as customer “reviews.”
 Cited as one of the most influential pieces of content in affecting purchase decisions, what a customer says about you matters. A lot.


-----

##### Ninety-seven percent of consumers say reviews influence their buying decisions.
 Consumers say reading what a customer has to say about your company, product, or service increases trust and their likelihood of buying.
 And if you have at least five written customer experiences you multiply the purchase likelihood by almost four.
 This becomes even more important for higher-priced products, where reviews can increase conversion rates by 380%.
 An important note to make here is that these written reviews must be from an affluent consumer, because consumers not only consider the review but the reviewer. If the affluent reader perceives the customer reviewing the product to be unlike him, the affluent reader will discount it.
 The problem is affluents generally aren’t too excited about sharing their experience publicly. Most won’t. Nearly three-quarters of affluents say they need to be motivated to do so. Which means if you fall under the umbrella of a luxury brand or a brand targeting affluent consumers, it’s more necessary to provide rewards and recognition in order to get consumers to share their story about the experience they had with your business.
 One of the most effective ways to accomplish both objectives (reward your client and secure a review) is to invite your best customers to be featured as the hero in your company’s story.
 What I call “Client Hero Stories” are stories that feature your best customers and their experience with your products and services. Similar to case studies, client hero stories help clarify the burning questions your prospects have in their mind.
 Case studies and client hero stories are more than a testimonial. They both speak to the specific customer pain. They both are designed to sway purchase decisions and make a case for why the buyer should choose your company. The main difference between a case study and a client hero story is that in a case study, the emphasis is on the COMPANY being the hero of the story while, in a client hero story, the CLIENT is the hero.
 It’s a subtle difference, but a critical point you must get if you want your affluent consumers to eagerly participate in giving your product or service a glowing review. The client hero story shows the client identifying a problem and choosing your product or service as the solution and shows what life looks like after they use your products and services.


-----

##### But the client is positioned as the hero. The client is the smart one … the creative one … the one with good taste … the brave one … and so on.
 Like a knight choosing his sword as he heads into battle, they make the decision and choose your solution to solve their problem.
 These stories captivate readers and listeners because they focus on human elements such as ambition, battling a challenge, and perseverance.
 This can be done with virtually any product or service … from the man surprising his wife with the perfect piece of jewelry to the mom who raises her teen’s confidence when she finds an orthodontist to fix her teen’s smile without the teen ever having to miss her favorite school activities to the business owner who is able to reduce his taxes.
 While you can identify your best affluent customers, you may not always know their whole story. That’s OK though. When you take time to ask, you’ll not only build a better relationship with them and make them feel you care, you’ll discover the hero in them.
 Once you feature clients as the hero of your brand, you’ll find that when you recognize wealthy clients in this way, they are eager to help you with these stories. That’s because being featured as the hero raises their status among their friends. It makes them feel special and recognized.
 I write client hero stories for No B.S. Inner Circle® (www.nobsinnercircle.com). Featured in their monthly No B.S. Marketing Letter, one column, called “Member Spotlight,” features members who have been guided by Dan Kennedy and implemented marketing strategies they received through their membership in No B.S. Inner Circle®. In many of these stories, the hero client has built their business from scratch to a million-dollar or multimillion-dollar business. In another column, called the “No B.S. Legends,” the story features a longtime member as the hero. These are entrepreneurs who have been members often in the neighborhood of 15 or 20 years, and are tremendously successful. It’s not uncommon for them to have spent $100,000.00 or more during the lifetime of their membership.
 When I reach out to these clients to inquire if I can interview them and feature them, I am met with replies along the lines of, “I’m honored to be featured” and “I’m excited to be featured.”
 After the story comes out, it’s not uncommon for the featured client to send thank you notes. They also frame these stories and hang them in their


-----

##### offices. They share them on their social media pages and tell their friends, families, and even customers about being featured.
 One member recently wrote to me, “Holy cow, the interview is amazing! Thank you for making me sound smart. You’re very talented, and I appreciate you using your skill to help tell my story.”
 Another member told me it was on his bucket list to be featured. He excitedly called me immediately upon receiving the newsletter with his client hero story, shared it on his social media when the story came out, and shared it again at the end of the year listing it as one of his top memories from the year.
 Mind you, both of these members are accomplished and own highly successful businesses. The point is these clients were recognized for what they did and rewarded for being the ideal client. When others read their story, they can see themselves in the story. They are inspired to emulate the member in the story and want to, in some cases, outdo the member they’ve just read about. They aspire to be the one featured in the story.
 Of course, client hero stories aren’t just about recognizing a valued customer. They can accomplish a number of things for your business.
 Prospects identify with the heroes in your story, and because they can see themselves, it increases their trust in you.
 These stories can be used in a variety of ways too. You can use them as indoctrination for your principles or to overcome common objections your prospects have, for example. And because these stories are interesting to read and have the power to transport the reader emotionally, prospects don’t feel like they are being sold.
 Let me show you what I mean. Let’s say you are looking for a new doctor for your family. As you scan a list of doctors, you find a doctor who has a list of top credentials, talks about how his office gives great service, and include a couple of testimonials from people saying he is a great doctor. Then you come across another doctor who has the same list of top credentials, but you read a story on his site in which the parents of a young patient tell a heart-wrenching story of their search for a doctor who could help their son, how they finally found said doctor who went above and beyond, gave out his cell phone number to them so they could contact him directly, and healed their child when no one else could. Which doctor would you choose?


-----

##### Stories make sense to people and help clarify how you can help them. And by positioning your customer as the hero instead of your product, service or brand, you are seen as a trusted resource that can help overcome whatever challenge your target customer is facing.

 Start with the End in Mind Before you can identify your hero, you’ll want to determine how and where you will use these stories and who will read them. Will you feature these stories on your website? In your newsletter to current customers? In your newsletter to prospects? In a package you send out to a prospect? In a book you are writing? In a video or podcast?
 While you can use these stories in multiple marketing pieces, it is helpful to determine where you plan to start. Because how you will use your stories and who will read them will help you identify who to feature, what questions to ask, and how to position the story.
 Start with the end in mind. What is your objective for this story? Is it indoctrination of your principles? Is it to help current customers consume your product so they will become raving fans, refer you, and buy more? Is it to help prospective clients overcome an objection? Is it to help people see that your product or service worked for someone just like them?
 The No B.S. Inner Circle newsletter, No B.S. Marketing Letter, is mailed to current clients as part of their paid membership benefits. Each month there is a theme assigned to it. One month might feature strategies for retention, ascension, and referrals. The next month might be about using information to market your business. The client hero story is going to be read by clients who’ve already bought into the company. They may own one or more products and will be of varying levels of success as well as levels of how “sold” they are that the principles will work for them. Client hero stories in this publication help readers consume the product, reinforce principles, and help them see that the principles will work because they see them working for people just like them.
 Another client is using client hero stories in a book that will be used for lead generation to sell an opportunity business. A designer is using client hero stories on her social media to showcase how her affluent clients use her home décor products to decorate their home. A periodontist client uses


-----

##### hero client stories in videos on his website to help overcome objections his prospective patients have.
 Most times, you’ll be able to accomplish more than one of these objectives. However, in each case, you want to identify one main objective to focus on so you don’t confuse your reader or lose their interest.

 Identify Your Hero Once you know where the client hero story will appear, how it will be used, and the objective as well as who the target reader is, you can now identify who you should invite to be the client hero featured.
 You’ll appeal to your ideal prospects by choosing hero clients who are like them. In other words, they should be affluent and fit certain criteria that match your ideal customer.
 For example, many heroes featured in the No B.S. Marketing Letter are made-from-scratch millionaires who invest in themselves and their success. They’re successful because they’ve implemented the strategies from the featured theme of the month.
 The book client is looking for people who have completed the program they are selling, implemented the strategies, and as a result, are living their dream lifestyle.
 The designer is looking for clients with upscale homes who have used her products to create rooms themselves that look like they should be featured in a magazine.
 The periodontist is looking for patients who had a major fear about having work done, did it anyway, and are overjoyed by the results he was able to provide them.

 Getting Affluent Clients to Agree to an Interview Before you approach a client about being featured in your client hero story, decide exactly what you’ll need from them so you can quickly and easily convey that information. For example, how much time will you need for an interview? Do you need a photo from them?
 When you reach out to an affluent client and present the idea to them, show them what’s in it for them by highlighting the advantages of participating. You’ll also want to approach it as a compliment to them


-----

##### instead of as a favor to you. Yes, you want to thank them for agreeing to be featured and be gracious about the time they spend doing it. However, a big deal should be made upfront about their accomplishment. Even though it is helping you, this is about THEM and shining the spotlight on them. For example, “Mary, you did such an incredible job converting your loft into a princess playroom for your daughters, I was wondering if you’d be willing to be featured in my catalog?” Or “Tom, I know our readers will love hearing how you were able to retire at the age of 45. Would you be willing to be featured in my newsletter and give our readers some tips?”
 Once they’ve agreed, it is important to be well prepared for your interview. Details matter and affluents value their time. Don’t be late. Prepare well-thought-out questions ahead of time. (I recommend sending the questions in advance for the client to review.) Do your research. Be organized so you don’t waste their time. Ask the client hero you are featuring to use examples and anecdotes to tell their story. This helps the reader to visualize and can even fire up imagination and emotion. During the interview, guide the conversation to meet your objective, but if you uncover something really good, keep going down that path, even if it wasn’t the original story you had in mind.
 Last year I interviewed a business owner for No B.S. Marketing Letter. Originally the story was going to be focused on copywriting strategies he’d used. However, when we got into the interview, I uncovered that he had overcome some huge fears and had never dreamed he’d even start a business. He attributed this to Dan Kennedy’s guidance. His life had been so totally transformed on every level. It was inspiring and so the focus of the story became about his overcoming his fears to build a successful business with the copywriting tips being the secondary objective.
 I also recommend recording the call (always ask first) so you can accurately quote the client in your client hero story.

 Writing Your Client Hero Story If you think about your favorite books and movies, the ones that you can’t pull yourself away from, they start with a problem. This is especially compelling when there is some question as to whether your hero can overcome the problem.


-----

##### Your Hero’s Struggle This is where you’ll start your story, by introducing your hero and their problem. When introducing your hero, your affluent readers need to see themselves and say, “That is me!” Including descriptive words after your hero’s name will help readers identify with them. For example, John Smith, a retiree; Tom Johnson, an art collector; Judy Walsh, an entrepreneur, and so on.
 The best stories have conflict. Describing the struggle the hero had is a vital part of the story. This is what will hook people in and make them want to continue reading to see how the hero solves the problem. This is worth spending extra time to get it right.

 Your Hero’s Solution The next part of the story gets into how your hero found a solution (your product or service) and how this guided them to success. As you tell the story you want to keep a few things in mind:

 1. Keep your objective and your target reader in mind as you write. 2. Include elements that make your hero likable and relatable. 3. Transparency is important. It demonstrates credibility that gives
 consumers confidence in purchasing from you. Don’t be afraid to include details that show your hero as human. Tony confesses he didn’t open the program for six months after he bought it … After losing 25 pounds and keeping it off for 6 months, Mary gained back 10 pounds at the holidays. However, she re-engaged with the program and has since lost the 10 pounds plus 5 more! 4. This part of the story should paint you, your product, and/or your
 service as the guide and give a plan or ideas for the reader to follow.

 Your Hero’s Transformation Ultimately you want to wrap up the story with the transformation of your hero. This will show how he or she was successful because of purchasing from you. Rather than making it a boring, facts-only conclusion (i.e., John’s


-----

##### business doubled), paint a picture of what the reader can experience when they follow in your hero’s footsteps.
 For example, “John’s business doubled the first year and is now growing 25% per year. He and his wife were able to move into their dream home overlooking a lake and surrounded by mountains. Working just six hours a week, they now go snowboarding three times a week instead of three times per season and never worry about having enough time or money to do the things they enjoy most. Last year, they took off two months to travel to Africa where they sponsored and helped build a school in a small town.”
 Storytelling is perhaps the best way to hit an emotional chord with your customers and won’t make them bored. Stories are easier to remember with greater accuracy too. And when you make your best affluent customers, clients, or patients the hero of your story, you’ll make them feel valued, recognized, and rewarded, which will make them more loyal, and more likely to share their experience with others, referring you more often to their friends. Not to mention, they’ll spend more money with you. Plus, by leveraging their stories, you’ll increase trust in your brand and create a tipping point for affluent prospects to make a purchase from you. Attracting more affluent clients, customers, or patients to your business can mean higher income from a smaller number of customers, which gives you more time to spend doing things you love.

### Happily Ever After …

##### How Brad & Morgan Robinson Are Replacing Their Marriage Counseling Practice Income and Making Up to 733% Higher Fees in
 One of the Poorest States in the Country

### Eighteen clients a week was the most clients Brad Robinson could see
##### when he opened his marriage counseling practice, www.mymarriagecheckup.com, in 2011. Working long hours and


-----

##### charging $75.00 per hour, Brad was depressed trying to make a go of his new practice. To help Brad focus more time on money-generating activities, his wife, Morgan, quit her job in career counseling to concentrate on marketing the business.

 Now in two locations with six staff, in one of the poorest states in the country, where the average marriage therapist charges around $60.00 per hour, Brad is charging (and receiving) $235.00 to $500.00 per hour. When someone comes in for a retreat, Brad makes more in one day than he used to in a month. And while most therapists have to work in the evenings, Brad works 9:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M., takes an hour for lunch, and only sees three couples per day.

 Here’s how they did it.

 Figure Out Who Your Best Customers Are

 Marriage counseling isn’t covered by insurance, it’s covered by cash. After hearing Dan Kennedy talk about the importance of figuring out who your top customers are, the Robinsons observed that small-business owners were their best clients because of their schedule flexibility, ability to pay large sums, and willingness to travel to see them. The Robinsons did surveys and figured out how long their best clients had been married, how many kids they had, if they’d been in counseling before, and so on. Brad says, “We’ve really nailed down and figured out who they are so that we can give them more of what they want. And figuring out who they are has also allowed us to charge more.”

 They also experimented with price and the length of sessions. Focusing on fewer clients, they extended the sessions and raised the price from $175.00 per session to $350.00 per session. Brad is as busy as ever. “We’ve gone after this market more unabashedly … and there’s more price elasticity there because we know who that person is.”

 Add Info-Marketing to Your Brick and Mortar Business

 Brad says a “light bulb moment” for him was hearing Dan Kennedy say that to be successful as a coach or consultant, you must have an info


-----

##### business on the front end.

 The Robinsons say adding the information business in front (first through a blog and now through their podcast) has made them celebrities in their ideal prospects’ eyes and preconditioned people to want to work with them by creating trust and making them the go-to counseling service. Brad says, “Sometimes they just want to meet me because I’ve helped them so much. They may come in for a day or two, but they’re really just wanting to meet the guy that helped them through such a difficult time. They don’t know you and then all of a sudden they’re going to give you $5,000.00? That’s really tough. That information business was really key.”

 The Robinsons also sell a program called “The Smart Couple’s Academy” for $997.00 that helps couples to heal their relationship from home after big issues like infidelity, communication, trust, and intimacy.

 Through testing, they discovered they needed to do more indoctrination to sell their program. Their current sequence is to attract people to the podcast. From the podcast, they send them free downloads, which bring prospects to paid downloads that invite them to a webinar that sells their Academy.

 Establish Yourself as the Expert

 In the therapy community, they don’t niche. “They’ll say they do one thing, but they don’t. They still do 50 things. So that’s where we are really, really different. We do one thing and we do that one thing very well … and I think that’s a big difference in what sets us apart,” says Morgan.

 Brad specifically focuses on helping couples with communication, trust, intimacy, or infidelity. He says, “I am a true-blue expert in what I do, and that’s because I’ve niched down and really thought deeply about the issues that I deal with on a day-to-day basis, and I teach the public.”


-----

##### They’ve found by focusing on a narrow niche, adding value through the information they put out to prospects before someone even meets them, and positioning Brad as a celebrity, anyone who can afford Brad’s services will choose him above anyone else, even traveling to see him.

 Brad established expertise through blogging, his podcast, writing articles, creating online classes, master classes, and webinars. Their podcast, which teaches their program, “Here’s How to Heal Broken Trust A to Z” (found on https://.healingbrokentrust.com), has helped tens of thousands of people in 144 different countries.

 They do email marketing and use social media too, primarily Facebook that pushes to Twitter, and are starting to do more with Linkedln. This year they will also release their first book and are doing more nationally by getting in front of more media to do interviews with magazines, TV, and radio. Plus, because they niched so tightly, the Robinsons know their audience intimately, allowing them to craft a highly targeted message that resonates extremely well with their audience.

 Brad says by the time people meet him, “they’re already gushing and they’re already happy. They already have the hope that they can turn their marriage around. And that’s a big part of the battle, just convincing people that they can do it. If you get to work with the expert, they’re already pre-disposed to having that hope and that confidence and anticipation that they’re going to see things turn around.”

 Build Your Social Proof

 The Robinsons built in an opportunity for people to share the results of their counseling experience on their podcast. Also, because they can’t ask clients to write a review, they do public speaking and ask people to write a review about their talk. “We’re the best-reviewed marriage counseling practice in the whole Midwest,” says Brad.

 Following the principles of marketing to the affluent has changed the Robinsons life on many levels. Brad no longer worries about having enough clients or income. After working three jobs all through high

##### school and college just to make ends meet, Morgan for the first time in her life doesn’t need to work; however, she enjoys the marketing so much that she spends time in the evening working when her son is asleep. Growing up poor where there were days when Morgan didn’t get to eat, the young couple is enjoying the freedom and ability to do things such as take their two-year-old to Disney World (three times already). An unexpected bonus has been the ability to choose and afford experts to help them with issues they face, such as when an expert in women’s reproductive cancer treatment removed a tumor on Morgan’s uterus, saving her chances of having a family. “I’ve found you really do need to continue focusing on being an expert, continue doing the one thing that you’re really good at because it does change people’s lives,” Morgan says.

#### CHAPTER 27

### You Need to Choose Your Words Carefully

##### “Some things a king never has to say: ‘Can I play too?’. ‘Hey guys,
 wait for me.’ … ‘I never seem to get laid.’”

—GEORGE CARLIN

# On marketing or selling to the affluent, language matters more than in
##### most other selling situations.
 By far, one of the most interesting uses and values of precisely chosen language is what I call romancing the stone, giving rather ordinary products the kind of elite cachet that creates differentiation, competitive edge, and support for premium pricing out of thin air.


-----

##### I would like you to read three different product descriptions from a J. Peterman catalog and see what common strategies—and odd strategies— are in play. We’ll discuss them after you read them.

 Sample 1 Gatsby was amazing. He even managed to see to it that the book about him was regarded as a novel, fiction, as though he didn’t exist. Even Fitzgerald, by the time he was through writing it, believed he’d made the whole thing up. There were those who knew the truth all along, of course; knew everything except where all that money came from. (Even by today’s standards, when millions mean nothing, only billions matter, Gatsby was incomprehensibly rich.) Gatsby walked into rooms wearing a shirt with no collar. Even a little thing like that made people talk. And probably will still make them talk. The Gatsby shirt, of course, has no collar. Only a simple collar band. The placket is simpler also: narrower. (Gatsby had them made in France, originally.) The cotton we have used in our uncompromising replica of Gatsby’s shirt is so luminous, in and of itself, that even a person who notices nothing will notice something. Gatsby, of course, could afford stacks of these shirts; rooms of them. Never mind. All that matters is that you have one, just one. A piece of how things were.

 Sample 2 Fame isn’t gradual; one moment you’re comfortably obscure; the next you can’t buy a cantaloupe without navigating through a thicket of fans and well-wishers. Without consulting you, people will choose a photograph; it will appear in all the documentaries, all the newspaper articles, all the books written by or about you. It will become more than you. Forever. Churchill understood. He decided what he wanted that image to portray ten years before that famous “spontaneous” photo was snapped. What image do you want to leave for posterity? The Irish Tweed Vest …

 Sample 3 New York Subway strike of the late ’70s. Bank presidents start wearing sneakers to work. JFK goes hatless at his inauguration. Good-bye hats.


-----

##### Steve McQueen, Sean Connery, Bill Holden discard ties in favor of turtlenecks. Some of it is progress. Now, marooned for a week in Paris or Osaka, this turtleneck sweater will keep you or me well dressed. Relaxed, but just a little dressy. (Both at the same time.) 55% silk, 45% cashmere. Pretty seductive stuff. Warm, but not heavy, not bulky. Beautifully detailed and finished. Sleek 7” high ribbed turtleneck. Set in sleeves. Good with blazers, old tweedy jackets, slacks, jeans. People expect to see a Walther PPK strapped over it, so you don’t even need to bother.

 The Gatsby shirt sells for $89.00. There are 104 words before the product is referred to! This violates every known rule of mail-order catalog or direct-response copywriting. One of the reasons for such a violation— nearly universal throughout every Peterman catalog—is the who he is selling to: affluent consumers with above-average educations, who wish to perceive themselves as sophisticates, as well as, of course, to a great degree, his own “Peterman cultists.” What is even more important to see here is what he is actually selling—and it is not a shirt. Here is that same block of copy again, with boldfaced type to make what is really being sold leap out at you, rather than gently permeate the subconscious, as was intended by delivering it wrapped in the story.

 Gatsby was amazing. He even managed to see to it that the book about him was regarded as a novel, fiction, as though he didn’t exist. Even Fitzgerald, by the time he was through writing it, believed he’d made the whole thing up. There were those who knew the truth all along, of course; knew everything except where all that money came from. (Even by today’s standards, when millions mean nothing, only billions matter, Gatsby was incomprehensibly rich.) Gatsby walked into rooms wearing a shirt with no collar. Even a little thing like that made people talk. And probably will still make them talk. The Gatsby shirt, of course, has no collar. Only a simple collar band. The placket is simpler also: narrower. (Gatsby had them made in France, originally.) The cotton we have used in our uncompromising replica of Gatsby’s shirt is so luminous, in and of itself, that even a person who notices nothing will notice something. Gatsby, of course, could afford stacks of these shirts;


-----

##### rooms of them. Never mind. All that matters is that you have one, just one. A piece of how things were.

 An aspiration is being sold here, not a product. The overall aspiration is to be like Gatsby. To be different, iconic, and interesting, even a bit mysterious. The more specific aspiration is to be noticed and talked about. And in case you hadn’t noticed, affluent people like being noticed, and most go about that deliberately, whether very consciously or unconsciously.
 This copy also uses language that would usually be dumbed down for advertising purposes. These high-brow words are strategically chosen and used to convey a sense of superiority to the buyer. By involvement in dialogue at this level, the reader is being recognized as a more sophisticated, intellectual individual. To say it in a very unclassy way, its meaning is: You’re a classy fellow and we know it and this is for the classes, not the masses. They won’t even appreciate its description. With that in mind, I’ve boldfaced some more key words:

 Gatsby was amazing. He even managed to see to it that the book about him was regarded as a novel, fiction, as though he didn’t exist. Even Fitzgerald, by the time he was through writing it, believed he’d made the whole thing up. There were those who knew the truth all along, of course; knew everything except where all that money came from. (Even by today’s standards, when millions mean nothing, only billions matter, Gatsby was incomprehensibly rich.) Gatsby walked into rooms wearing a shirt with no collar. Even a little thing like that made people talk. And probably will still make them talk. The Gatsby shirt, of course, has no collar. Only a simple collar band. The placket is simpler also: narrower.

Gatsby, of course, could afford stacks of these shirts; rooms of them. Never mind. All that matters is that you have one, just one. A piece of how things were.


-----

##### Finally, the end—all that matters is that you have one, just one— defies selling logic. The first impulse of most marketers is to encourage buying one of each of the four available colors, probably with a buy three, get one free offer. I confess it instantly occurred to me when I read the catalog page. Instead, this line dares to discourage buying more than one. In doing so, an air of exclusivity is conferred on the product, as might ordinarily be attached to a unique piece of jewelry, a classic car, or some collectible.
 Sample 2 sells a rather odd tweed vest for $199.00. Or does it? The entire scenario described here speaks to two aspirations of the affluent: importance and legacy. The thought of having fans and well-wishers and photos snapped of you is a very appealing fantasy for a great many people. I know it for fact; I have that experience, and I am constantly asked what it is like. Further, the idea of being the author of a book has strong importance and legacy appeal. My Members Bill and Steve Harrison, who conduct the Publicity Summit, publish Book Marketing Up-Date, and provide a range of services to authors very effectively use a story about people coming in large numbers from far away to a person’s funeral because they were influenced by his book. Again, as a much-published author, I can assure you, every successful person believes he has a profoundly interesting and important story to tell, a book within. All this to sell a vest! This is how your thinking about whatever you sell and do must change if you are to be effective with affluent clientele and rise to the top price or fee levels in your business category.
 As an aside, this copy reveals something about the age of the Peterman customers. The references to documentaries and to Churchill will be meaningful to those 50 and over, most meaningful to those 60 and over, and pretty much a disconnect for anyone under 40. For those in the last category, documentaries or news reels were shown in the movie theaters before every movie throughout the World War II era, and were very popular in early TV. Winston Churchill is, of course, famous, but you probably don’t know about the photo referred to unless you are of a certain age.
 Sample 3 sells a turtleneck sweater for $250.00, or $185.00 on sale. We can certainly find nice turtleneck sweaters for half that price in many stores and catalogs, But we can’t find copy like this anywhere else!


-----

##### First, there is aspirational identification. Here I’ve boldfaced the key references:

 New York Subway strike of the late ’70s. Bank presidents start wearing sneakers to work. JFK goes hatless at his inauguration. Good-bye hats. Steve McQueen, Sean Connery, Bill Holden discard ties in favor of turtlenecks. Some of it is progress. Now, marooned for a week in Paris or Osaka, this turtleneck sweater will keep you or me well dressed. Relaxed, but just a little dressy. (Both at the same time.) 55% silk, 45% cashmere. Pretty seductive stuff. Warm, but not heavy, not bulky. Beautifully detailed and finished. Sleek 7" high ribbed turtleneck. Set in sleeves. Good with blazers, old tweedy jackets, slacks, jeans. People expect to see a Walther PPK strapped over it, so you don’t even need to bother.

 As noted earlier, you need to be of a certain age. If you are, not only are the five iconic figures (the fifth is James Bond—not named, but we know his gun of choice) familiar to you, but they instantly conjure mental pictures, maybe even mental movies. They are the men women swooned over but men admired, not resented. Countless products and services are bought by consumers because of the “I Want to Be Like ________” factor, and even the most affluent consumers respond to such appeals.
 This copy also puts us into mental movies:

 New York Subway strike of the late ‘70s. Bank presidents start wearing sneakers to work. JFK goes hatless at his inauguration. Good-bye hats. Steve McQueen, Sean Connery, Bill Holden discard ties in favor of turtlenecks. Some of it is progress.

Pretty seductive stuff. Warm, but not heavy, not bulky. Beautifully detailed and finished. Sleek 7" high ribbed turtleneck. Set in sleeves. Good with blazers, old tweedy jackets, slacks, jeans. People expect to see a Walther PPK strapped over it, so you don’t even need to bother.


-----

##### The reader can visualize himself in his turtleneck, at a Paris café … then catching the attention of a beautiful and mysterious woman. As a stand-in for James Bond, a dashing, romantic, fascinating figure. And who doesn’t want that?
 The temptation will be to presume none of this applies to you, because you do not sell shirts and sweaters; you are a dentist or financial planner or you own a landscaping company or even manufacture safety devices sold to and installed in food-processing plants. Resist this temptation! Commitment to talking about what you do or sell in factual, logical, straightforward, and thus dull and uninteresting language leaves you vulnerable to commoditization and price-based competition and bars you from ever becoming a subject of fascination among a target audience of affluent clients. Being boring and ordinary is a choice, not something forced on you by your particular business.
 This also goes far beyond your advertising. As a professional direct- response copywriter routinely commanding project fees for ads, direct-mail campaigns, websites, and the like upwards of $100,000.00 plus royalties, I have enormous appreciation and admiration for copy like the Peterman catalog examples dissected here. I spend many hours of every week surrounded by thesauri, swipe files, even novels, agonizing in search of precisely the perfect word or phrase or story to get a persuasive point across in print. But to confine this to print misses a greater opportunity and a more critical need.

 Out of the Mouths of … This approach does NOT apply just to words put into print. It applies equally to what you and your salespeople say verbally. Here, frankly, a toxic waste dump of sloppiness has occurred in most businesses. What comes out of the mouths of most people about their products and services is, bluntly, trash and slop. It is thoughtless. Uncrafted. Inconsistent. When captured via recording and transcribed and reviewed in print, it is humiliating. The affluent consumer is as repulsed by this as if the sales professional reeked of garlic, alcohol, sweat, and uncontrolled gas.
 I am consistently appalled at what I hear professionals, business owners, and sales professionals saying.


-----

##### This gets to a view of selling as performance art. As such it is to be planned, scripted, physically choreographed, rehearsed, and ultimately performed. Most sales professionals unfortunately view the presentation as something that they should just be able to do.
 This also gets to the sales management and management decisions, if you employ salespeople or nonsalespeople who still have sales job functions, such as front-desk staff in a professional office. The question is whether you are going to tolerate sloppy, inconsistent, ineffective communication or you are going to design the most effective language and choreography possible and insist on its implementation. To help you make this important decision correctly, and act on it successfully, I suggest reading my book No B.S. Guide to Ruthless Management of People and Profits.

#### CHAPTER 28

### You Need to Choose Your Prices Carefully

##### “If you can actually count your money, you are not really a rich
 man.”

—J. PAUL GETTY

# One of the most interesting lines of copy I’ve seen aimed at the affluent
##### is: “Reassuringly Expensive.”
 Price Strategy is critical in successfully marketing to the affluent. In the first edition of this book, I devoted three chapters just to the subject of price, but even that was woefully inadequate, given the many opportunities to be had with thorough understanding of Price Strategy. Subsequently, I wrote an entire book on the subject, No B.S. Price Strategy, with a terrific


-----

##### co-author, Jason Marrs, a super-hero of sorts: The Man Who Competes at Premium Prices with Free! I strongly recommend you get a copy and study it. It is a perfect companion to this one.
 Before leaving the subject, I will make six important points: First, most marketers, service providers, merchants, and professionals horribly underestimate the amount of Price Elasticity that exists in their category of goods or services. That misunderstanding inflicts a myriad of evils. For one thing, it leaves a lot of money on the table unnecessarily, to no good end. Second, it sometimes raises skepticism or doubt in the minds of affluent customers who are not so eager for “a steal” that they don’t worry over a seemingly too-low price. Third, it creates timidity and weakness without cause.
 Second, when selling to customers more affluent than themselves, many marketers erroneously impose their own value judgments and price sensitivity on others who think very differently than they do. I frequently hear, “Well, I would never pay so much for that!” from clients objecting to the price strategies I recommend for them—and from skeptical clients stunned when they see how easily I raised their prices and profits without losing or repelling customers.
 Third, price is a complex matter containing many opportunities. Sometimes an income boost is as simple as just raising prices. All that was needed was courage. More often, though, there are less bald and overt ways to boost income by increasing average transaction size and average, overall customer value. This is why you need a complete course in Price Strategy, in the No B.S. Price Strategy book.
 Fourth, with affluent consumers, who you are selling to and who you are (perceived to be) to them has more to do with acceptance of prices than does what you are selling. This is a very difficult reality to grasp, then profit from, because most marketers are product-centric, and stuck there by deeply ingrained habit of thought. Adam Witty’s chapter on authority addresses this, as does, in depth, the book No B.S. Guide to Trust- Based Marketing.
 Fifth, how you sell—process—has as much or more to do with price acceptance as does what you are selling.
 These fourth and fifth points can both be seen in the case history included in the final section of this book, about Jones And Co. Styling


-----

##### Opticians.
 Finally, sixth, where you sell—place—has as much or more to do with price acceptance than does what you are selling. There is a different expectation of price and different sensitivity to price if standing in the meat section looking at steaks in Walmart, in an upscale supermarket, in a butcher shop, or in a catalog requested from a company like La Cense Beef.
 In short, price does not exist in a vacuum. It exists in context. You can control that context. Price Strategy does not operate separately either. It comingles with the context you create and control.

 Price, Profit, Power Survival of the fittest in exceptionally competitive market conditions or in difficult economic environments as well as maximum prosperity and greatest growth in good conditions reflects power—or weakness.
 There are many important kinds of business power. For example, the power to outspend competitors in acquiring new customers, even to the point of killing competitors off entirely, without going broke yourself. The power to use virtually every media, not just a few, with such frequency and perseverance that you are omnipresent and known to one and all as the leader. The power to so favorably impress, inspire, and richly satisfy a customer he wouldn’t leave you for love nor money, and can’t help but spread your legend to the world. All such power is directly related to and dependent on one thing …

 Profit The lower your profit margins, profit per transaction, and profit per customer factors are, the less power you have. And maximum profitability comes from one thing …

 Price Poor price strategies yield poor profits, which produces weakness and fragility.
 Fortunately, marketing to the affluent is a great empowerment for premium prices and excellent profits—but not automatically.

#### Book Three Summation

### There is a certain way to approach each different audience,
##### constituency, and market. There is no such thing as one-size-fits-all in effective marketing. You’ll see big, dumb companies pushing out big, broad, generic messages, but you should not emulate it. Even if it works —which, mostly, it doesn’t—it is entirely based on who will spend oceans of money to be known, a competition you can’t possibly win. You have to be much cleverer. In the just-concluded Book Three, a certain approach to making headway specifically with affluent consumers was laid out. It includes advantages you can make your own, that giant corporations can’t or won’t use.

 Six times a year, I continue this discussion of the certain approach in a newsletter, The No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent Letter, and the No B.S. Inner Circle team does so the alternating months with extension of Adam Witty’s chapter in The No B.S. Authority Marketing Letter, both included in Diamond-level Membership, at NoBSInnerCircle.com.

### How a Dentist Transformed His Office Into a Hot
 Spot for Affluent Patients

# In the early 1990s, Len Anglis D.D.S added implant dentistry to help
##### grow his practice in Indiana. He didn’t have time for vacations. He relied on other dentists to drive referrals to his business. And he had to customize treatment plans for each dentist, since the dentist wanted to do some but not all of the work, making it less profitable for Dr. Anglis.
 So he changed his approach, targeting affluent customers with a much more specialized service. That was 15 years ago. Today, over half his business is All-On-Four Dental Implant Treatment, a complicated procedure in which Dr. Anglis replaces entire arches of missing or failing teeth for patients all in one day. It’s a procedure no one else is doing.


-----

##### Treatments can range from $30,000.00 up to $75,000.00. Most of his patients write a check for it, paying for it before or at the time of treatment. “Because insurance doesn’t cover this kind of treatment, we needed people who could afford it,” Dr. Anglis said.
 Changing his approach has transformed his business and his life. By becoming very specialized in the All-On-Four Implant Treatment, dentists in the area refer people to him, telling their patients they can no longer help them and that Dr. Anglis is the only one who can do it. Patients arrive presold because they trust their family dentist. This also means Dr. Anglis rarely, if ever, does customized treatment plans for dentists anymore.
 Creating marketing systems that target their ideal patient, they’ve been able to gain control over the flow of patients coming into their business instead of having to rely on referrals only.
 By charging a higher fee, they can do more for their patients to make them feel comfortable. “Over the years, we really own the fact that patients would rather be anyplace else,” Nancy Anglis, a dental hygienist and Len’s wife, said. “We get it, we embrace it. So, we made our office like no place else.”
 The Anglises completely remodeled their office as a “tropical dental resort,” putting a lot of thought into what patients would want, not only to get people talking about it but to intentionally create a more comfortable and relaxing space that would lower anxiety. “Nancy and I looked at every single component from colors to pictures and intentionally picked things that were relaxing rather than stimulating,” Dr. Anglis said. Special components were added that naturally lower blood pressure. They offer cappuccinos, lattes, and cocoa. Neck warmers, blankets, and aloe socks are provided. This has created somewhat of a phenomenon. “We have people come a half hour early because they know we run on time and they want to take advantage of our amenities before they go back,” Nancy said. “People show up just to have coffee. They think of it as a social gathering place. They’ll bring friends and families to meet us, which is how we’ve gotten some patients, too. It’s become a hotspot that people can’t believe.”
 Their marketing approach is different, too. “We were marketing to people in a new way in which they know how much we value them,” Dr. Anglis said, “and it’s been very reciprocal. It seems like they value us more now as well.”


-----

##### Marketing includes things such as a free book, Why You Might Not Need Dental Implants, that Dr. Anglis wrote; a newsletter; a series of notes and gifts; direct mail; and more. A free-standing insert in the newspaper advertises a seminar they host complete with refreshments. The seminar is orchestrated with subtle reminders that attendees really do need to have this treatment done because they can’t even enjoy the simple things in their life without a lot of grief and discomfort. They mail a package with very unique, specific items to prospects so they know who the Anglis are before they ever meet Dr. Anglises.
 Follow-up systems are in place for those who don’t go ahead with treatment to keep Dr. Anglis top of mind. Sensitive to the fact that patients are afraid, worried about the time it will take to have the procedure done, and used to people telling them they are “too old and don’t need this done,” the Anglis choose very specific language for their materials that appeals to their affluent clients. “We have to convince them that there’s a better way to live the rest of their life with a higher quality and higher health level,” Dr. Anglis said.
 Details matter, and the Anglises think of everything that might be an irritant to their wealthy clients and put processes in place to avoid them. For example, nobody waits. “We stay on time in our office and people really appreciate that because there aren’t many dental or medical offices that you go to where they respect your time at the level we do,” Nancy said. “And if we mess up, if we’re 10 or 15 minutes behind, they get a present.”
 All this has added up to the Anglises operating at higher profitability than other offices, needing fewer patients, giving them more time to do things they enjoy … and they even get to take vacations now, usually several per year.

#### CHAPTER 30

### How an Orthodontist Rose Above All Competition

# In Kansas City, Missouri, where 72 orthodontists are competing for a
##### population of just two million, Dr. Dustin Burleson changed his marketing strategy to focus on the affluent. His average fee has gone from $4,600.00 to $6,500.00. His practice has grown from one location with one employee to five locations and 38 employees. He’s been on the Inc. 500 list twice. He’s increased his business by more than tenfold. Before using affluent marketing, he’d add a couple hundred patients a year. Last year he started 1,904 new patients.
 In transitioning to intentionally marketing to the affluent, he hired a third-party research firm to survey 10,000 people in Kansas City. He discovered the number-one concern was finding a provider they could trust. Number two was convenience. To his surprise, price came in third place.


-----

##### Display Profound Expertise Focusing on creating trust, Dr. Burleson went to work to build his authority. He taught at the universities. He wrote a book and articles. (He’s written three books so far.) He got on the news and built his celebrity.

 Relieve Your Affluent Clients of Hassles Wanting to find out what conveniences affluent patients were looking for, he created a “patient board of directors” made up of 20 of his patients who were centers of influence. For example, they might own a business, be on the school board, or be a board member at the hospital—anyone he believed had huge referral potential. Four times a year, he invites these patients to a nice steakhouse, feeds them dinner, describes his vision for the practice, and asks them to give him input about what they like and don’t like about his practice. “At first they were really quiet,” Burleson said. “They’d never seen this before. But they all came and were good sports about it. And what a lot of them told us were then those things we implemented.” For example, he found that affluent customers want zero hassle. Burleson responded by expanding their hours to be open early in the morning, late at night, and on weekends. He added pediatric dentistry to the mix and dental hygienists so parents don’t have to go somewhere else to have their kids’ teeth cleaned and so forth. Burleson also created membership plans with different tiers where patients get VIP treatment. Family memberships run $24,000.00. For an additional $8,000.00, you can get the platinum plus plan. This includes things such as personal contact with treatment coordinators and guaranteed support no matter when you need it. They answer their phones 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They offer after-hours support, including the promise to drive to the office at 10:00 P.M. if that is what is needed. Somewhat shocking and controversial in his industry, he added a guarantee that patients will be happy, or they get their money back. Even if they don’t wear their retainer and their teeth go crooked, they’ll put the braces back on for free. “They pretty much want a guarantee that if a kid loses their retainer, breaks their retainer, or doesn’t wear their retainer, that we have their back,” Burleson said.

 Be Discriminatory on Who You Will Spend Money Marketing To


-----

##### To find affluent patients, Burleson looked at his existing patient list. We said, “Who has spent the most money with us? Who has referred friends and family to us? Who was either paid in full or has come to us, not because we were on their insurance list, but because of some other reason?” Burleson explained. Using this list, he created a “look-a-like” audience to match to the national database and began using direct mail to reach these patients. “We used a company called Accudata (www.accudata.com) to help us create the look-a-like list,” Burleson said. Examining the list to find out more about his ideal patient, he identified his perfect patient as someone who is really busy, a soccer mom who works outside of the home. Now messages sent out are customized to fit this audience.
 Targeting this specific niche and catering to super busy people who don’t want to take off work or school to bring their kids to the orthodontist has made a huge impact. Burleson’s lifetime customer value has almost doubled. “Obviously our price elasticity has gone up, but they easily bring the next kid and the family too,” Burleson said. “Our referrals have gone up 400 percent. We used to get about 15 percent of our patients from word-of- mouth or other patients and now it’s above 60 percent. The majority of our patients come from a mom who will find out and tell a friend, even if they had to drive past other orthodontists to get to us.” Referrals tell their friends, “He’s just open all the time, and they stand behind their work.”
 Increased referrals aren’t all he’s received. Dr. Burleson has also seen increased loyalty. “Before marketing to the affluent, we took a lot of discount insurance,” Burleson said. He found with discount insurance patients, not only is he being paid less and referred less, but even if there is a strong relationship with the patient, if his practice is dropped from their insurance plan, the parents will take their next kid to someone else who is on their insurance plan.
 Narrowing his niche even further, in 2017, he stopped treating adult patients altogether, choosing instead to only treat kids and teenagers. For most orthodontists, adults are about 25% of their business.
 Applying the affluent marketing principles has allowed Dr. Burleson to increase his margin, allowing him to do more for his patients, which has resulted in tremendous feedback. “Patients looking at spending $6,000.00 versus $4,500.00 say, ‘It’s not that much more considering everything that you have to offer,’” Burleson said. “We hear things like, ‘Man, I wish other


-----

##### doctors’ offices would run like this.’” Burleson is relentless about running on time and he hires the best people he can find and pays them well. “I think everything good comes from margin and we have a significant amount of it because of this principle,” Burleson said.

#### CHAPTER 31

### How an Asset Management Company Increased
 Revenue 300% Using Information to Attract,
 Convert, and Retain Affluent Clients

# Longtime client Jim Lange of Lange Financial Group, LLC, provides
##### asset management through his registered investment advisory firm, tax preparation through his CPA firm, and estate planning and will and trust preparation through his law firm.
 Before intentionally marketing to the affluent, Lange grossed between $250,000.00 to $500,000.00 for asset management alone, not including the accounting and legal side of his business. Today he is grossing $2 million a year just on the assets under management. Before marketing to the affluent, he accepted clients with assets of $250,000.00 and up. He’s since created a


-----

##### threshold of $750,000.00 and is moving to $1 million by the end of the year. The difference has meant being able to charge roughly four times what he could for the $250,000.00 client. “The big picture is it really takes just as much time to work on a small account as a big account,” Lange said. “And since we have a 98% retainage rate, the lifetime value of a million-dollar client might range from $50,000.00 to $100,000.00.”
 Information and trust is the currency for his affluent clients. Applying marketing to the affluent principles, he can spend more to market and serve what his affluent clients want. Lange stresses that it’s not just about charging premium prices. It’s about being able to afford to provide more value to attract, convert (and keep) a client. “I can afford to be generous,” Lange explained, “When people come into the office I can afford to give them a shock and awe box that costs me $100.00. It might be worth thousands to them, but I don’t even have to think about spending one hundred bucks on a prospect because the prospect is so valuable to me. Affluent marketing changes your math—meaning you can spend a lot more money on marketing to get a client and to maintain the account.”
 He provides his clients with a plethora of extra resources. He’s written six bestselling books, including his latest, The $214,000 Mistake: How to Double Your Social Security & Maximize Your IRA’s, Proven Strategies for Couples Ages 62-70. He now writes two new books per year. He sends copies to all his clients and to many prospects. (He prefers to ask prospects if they want a copy and then sends them a copy whether they ask for it or not, a technique he learned from Dan.) He does offer the books on www.Amazon.com and donates all royalties to charity. Clients also receive a monthly printed newsletter, invitations to multiple workshops, articles, tax cards, and emails. Plus, he hosts parties for them.
 To attract new clients, he holds workshops, and markets with his books. He segments information so consumers can quickly and easily find the answer to what they are looking for when visiting his website. He does utilize Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social media, but does much better in terms of attracting clients through direct mail.
 If someone is referred to him, he sends a personalized package with information specific to their situation.
 Lange’s found that taking his time in other ways attracts the affluent too. His experience has been to not just pump content out but to take the


-----

##### time to create content that the affluent client will value. Taking his time to write a relevant and informative book, for instance, has paid off, earning him testimonials from Charles Schwab, Larry King, and top IRA experts around the country plus a best-seller ranking. This helps build trust in the affluent community and has built his authority in his market.

### Money Spent on Education

# Affluents tend to spend more on education. Households in the
##### $200,000.00+ annual income bracket, on average, spend more than double the amount per year on educational expenses than the $150,000.00 to $199,999.00 group and more than triple that of the $100,000.00 to $149,999.00 bracket. (Source: e-Marketer.)
 Many colleges are competing for tuition money by creating “country club” environments with water parks, rock climbing walls, and other luxury amenities. However, one university that truly understands luxury and getting a degree aren’t enough anymore is High Point University (HPU) in North Carolina.
 My friend of many years, Nido Qubein, as its president has done a phenomenal, awe-inspiring, widely reported on job of transforming a small


-----

##### downscale college into an explosively growing, vibrant, robust, somewhat Disney®-fied showplace of academic excellence, creativity, and luxury.
 Amid one of the worst economic disruptions in 50 years, HPU has experienced tremendous growth. Philanthropic investors are generously and eagerly resourcing HPU. Armed with over $300 million in gifts and pledges since Dr. Qubein took over in 2005, including 10 gifts of $10 million and more, the university built new facilities to accommodate residential students, new athletic buildings and fields to support 16 NCAA Division 1 sports, and expanded its campus from 92 to 430 acres. It has quadrupled its student population, tripled its faculty, attracting educators with accomplished credentials in large numbers, and attracted students from all 50 states and more than 55 countries.
 One of the many things that distinguishes HPU from other universities is their emphasis on being the “premier life skills university.” Character development coupled with a highly visible mission that every student graduate with a growth and entrepreneurial mindset and confidence to overcome any obstacle that comes their way in the ever-changing, highly competitive world we live in is a message parents and students aren’t hearing anywhere else. HPU lives their tagline, “An extraordinary education in an inspiring environment with caring people,” asking themselves the question for every aspect of how they can be more extraordinary, more inspiring, or more caring. They heavily promote that every student has a success coach and a four-year Development of Life Skills, which includes teaching the art of persuasion, effective communication, and other skills that help students stand out (96% of students are working or in graduate school within six months of graduating).
 Another pillar is their emphasis on modeling values that resonate with the parents. From a recent issue of their magazine, Dr. Qubein’s words:

 It’s true—HPU is a God, family, and country institution. Values are important to us. Generosity, gratitude, service, and patriotism, among others, are cherished here. But more importantly, they are modeled here. You can’t teach values. So, I remind faculty and staff that we live, students watch, and students learn.


-----

##### Parents don’t want to pay a lot for a diploma, but they will spend a lot to transform their child into an independent adult who isn’t intimidated by life’s obstacles.
 To demonstrate they can pull it off, Dr. Qubein’s accomplishments are highlighted front and center: an Ellis Island Medal of Honor winner, a nationally recognized speaker inducted into the National Speakers Hall of Fame, an author, an entrepreneur, a consultant to top corporations, and so on. Stories, testimonials, and interviews featuring faculty, students, parents, and community members are abundantly present.
 Even if a student doesn’t want to be an entrepreneur, many of the parents are entrepreneurs, so the message resonates with them. Every student has a success coach. Students are guided by global leaders and innovators such as Marc Randolph, Netflix cofounder, and Steve Wozniak, Apple cofounder, in HPU’s Entrepreneur-in-Residence mentorship program.
 The extraordinary environment is innovative, inspiring, and pristine. Statues of historical giants from Gandhi to Rosa Parks to Albert Einstein, inspirational quotes, and immaculate study areas are present throughout the campus. Extraordinary living extends to luxury residence halls with incredible amenities such as pools, basketball and volleyball courts, and even pet-friendly dorms. While the norm at most college campuses is that students desire to quickly move off campus, HPU students don’t want to leave, not even seniors. Ninety-three percent of students live on campus as compared to 40 percent that most colleges experience. There are upgraded housing options available, with tiered pricing too.
 Of course, Dr. Qubein’s professional and personal growth books are used in direct-marketing efforts. They’ve found that parents read and share these books. They are seen in the places where affluent, entrepreneurial parents hang out. For example, their magazine is in the terminal of every private airport—a place where they are isolated from other college materials. The magazine is really a catalog about growth mindset, life skills, entrepreneurial mindsets—the things influencers are attracted to, so even if they don’t have teens ready for college, they will talk about HPU with their friends who might be sending a kid off to college. They also polybag the magazine in the Business Journal occasionally in cities with business influencers, and consistently in North Carolina. The strategy is to be readily


-----

##### known and recognized by affluents in the community. That way when a wealthy friend from Boston has a kid interested in going to HPU and calls up their wealthy friend in North Carolina to find out about HPU, the North Carolinian knows and readily endorses it.

Checking out a copy of the _HPU magazine is a worthwhile exercise. See it online at_

#### CHAPTER 33

### How an Optician Repositioned His Business to
 Attract the Affluent

##### By Conor Heaney

# It was 2010. I was 30 years old, and I’d just bought my second optical
##### practice. The first one was ticking along nicely, and I felt ready for a challenge. So I bought a fixer upper, an established practice that was dangerously close to closing its doors.
 This was a business that went bankrupt in the late ’90s, had four different owners in ten years, and was notoriously difficult to make profitable. But unlike the previous owners, I have been able to make it a


-----

##### success. I had something they did not. A guide. And it now sits proudly on my bookshelf, dog-eared and tattered but used.
 There I was, at the beginning of a huge project to transform a failing business that I thought had potential as a high-end optical boutique, and then a copy of Dan Kennedy’s No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent lands on my desk. I couldn’t have asked for a better guide and manual to re-invent this business. It was the perfect opportunity for “testing” on a grand scale. And that’s the story I’d like to share with you here.
 I’m Conor Heaney. I’m an optometrist, and I own an optical practice in Manchester in the UK. Let me give you a quick rundown of how we turned a business around from the brink of bankruptcy to dizzy heights of success and achievement.
 But first, let me show you a few results that came from taking a business and repositioning it to appeal to the affluent:

 • The practice had 50% growth in the first two years. And it has grown
 every year since. We’re achieving an additional 17% growth this year again.
 • Our average sale value is over five times the industry average. Here in
 the UK the average amount spent on a pair of glasses is about £150. Our average is over £750 and clients routinely spend £2,000 to £3,000+ on their “eyewear.”
 • Over 80% of prospects that have an “Eyewear Style Consultation”
 purchase eyewear from us on the same day.

 The Reason Why Most Opticians Struggle Most optical practices are having an identity crisis. They simply don’t know what they are anymore. They create a confused and mixed-up identity of a medical-professional-fashion business. A Frankenstein monster. A business fashioned out of various different parts that don’t go very well together. They fail to differentiate themselves in the eyes of the modern customer. They lack a clear USP (Unique Selling Proposition). They try to appeal to everyone and as a result they don’t strongly appeal to anyone.
 Most opticians see themselves as a clinical or medical professional. But they exist in a retail environment. Most practices take a loss on the eye


-----

##### examination in the hope that the person will buy glasses. That has always been the case. Now there is online competition selling glasses at cheap prices. Many customers go to an optician for an eye examination and take their prescription information and go elsewhere to buy glasses. They shop around for more stylish glasses (which is a big trend), or they go online to buy cheap glasses at a fraction of the price. So it’s a difficult time to be an optician.
 I believe that we are actually a retail business. We no longer have the luxury of assuming customers will come to us, have an eye examination, and buy glasses from us just because we’re their opticians. Customers don’t behave that way anymore. They now have far more choices when it comes to buying glasses. It is no longer seen as a purely functional purchase. People now see their eyewear as statement. For many it is something they enjoy wearing. We have many eyewear aficionados as clients.
 I once read about a shoe designer who said every morning she dressed from her shoes up. She’d pick the shoes and work the rest of her outfit around them. Well, we have clients that get dressed from their eyewear down. And they want the same feelings when purchasing new eyewear that they get when they make any other luxury purchase in any other category.

 A New Sales Process That Eliminates the Headaches of Retail We are a retail business that has developed a successful process that eliminates what all retailers hate: haphazard browsing, price comparison, time wasters, and being used as a “showroom” before buying online.
 If you’re in retail you’ll know what I’m talking about. The internet has trained some customers to behave badly and expect something for nothing. It has trained them to devalue everything that you do. You become a commodity in their eyes.
 And yes, they’re happy to waste your time, use your store as a showroom for trying things on, and take your product specifications to search online.
 I noticed an increasing trend in this kind of customer behavior in my first business. And it was one of the reasons I set out to design a business that cut out all of that.


-----

##### One low point sticks in my memory from around 2008. I was helping a prospect one day who walked in. He was looking for some new glasses for his wedding day and he had never been happy with how he looked in glasses. So he was searching for something different. Something special. And I pulled out all the stops. I introduced him to a new world of eyewear. And an hour later he had found a frame that he had fallen in love with. All he needed to do was to come back with his fiancée to make his final decision. And out he went feeling on top of the world, excited he had found something he would feel great wearing. He was full of praise for what I did and for how amazing the products were that I introduced him to.
 The very next day I got a text message from a friend who owned an opticians store in another part of the country. He wanted to know if we had the exact frame in stock that I had shown the prospect the day before. He said he had a guy who called and wanted to buy it. And the day after that I received another call from a different optician who I knew and he was asking about the same frame. This was a rare frame so it didn’t take much detective work to discover that the guy, who was singing my praises for guiding him to the perfect frame, was now taking the information and shopping around. But to rub salt in the wound, I was being hassled by other opticians to see if they could get the frame from me at wholesale prices so they could undercut me and make an easy sale to this guy. All this wasted time and hassle because we had no process to stop it. It was madness. That was one of the turning points for me to re-engineer my sales process.
 In the new practice we decided to tackle the problem head on. I decided to eliminate “browsing.” So we took the bold move of removing stock from display. No longer could anyone just walk in and try frames on and browse around and use us as a showroom. And I don’t mean that we put the frames in locked displays or behind glass. No. We removed the frames from display. We made the practice look more like an upscale hotel than an opticians. There were no frames in sight apart from a feature display, a display that wouldn’t look out of place in a modern art gallery.
 The environment looked great. But it kind of confused customers. The mantra we heard from anyone who walked in was “um, where are all the glasses?” But at least it became easy to engage in conversation with customers. Suddenly they couldn’t say, “I’m just looking!” We replaced “just looking” and “browsing” with a unique Eyewear Style Consultation.


-----

##### A Unique Eyewear Style Consultation I had two things I wanted to achieve with the Eyewear Style Consultation. I wanted to eliminate all the hassles of retail and regain control of the sales process. And I wanted to position this consultation in a way that differentiated us and gave us the position of “expert.” Something that is very attractive to affluent clients.
 We made it an appointment-based service. “By appointment” emphasized the professional expertise positioning and allowed us to control the sales process. It appeals to affluent clientele who are used to making appointments because their time is important. They like that they can schedule a time, come in, and see the expert. And it also means we can give a higher level of service by being better prepared, knowing who is coming in and when. It adds real value to what we do. And the perception it creates is useful if you want to sell a high-ticket item.
 We went a step further, too, and made the eyewear style consultation a core part of our business and one of our USPs. It is the perfect solution to a significant problem in our target market.
 From experience we know that the main problems our target customer has are:

 • They don’t know what glasses suit them and their face shape. That is,
 they don’t really know what they’re doing when it comes to choosing eyewear.
 • They’re bored of the same mainstream products they find in most
 opticians and they are looking for something different and stylish. They see themselves as an individual.
 • They have had a bad experience elsewhere so they are looking for an
 expert. They may have a complex prescription, or significant vision problems that weren’t handled well by the last optician. Or they may just have high standards and want the best.

 We position our eyewear style consultation as the solution to each of these problems. We didn’t just make this up. We strategically created a positioning as the solution to their problem. Our solution is perfect for affluent clients because:


-----

##### 1. Their time is important so they don’t want to spend one weekend—
 nevermind two or three weekends—shopping around on a grueling search for eyewear. 2. They value expertise. They want to see an expert. That is how they
 operate. 3. They expect the highest level of service. We are the perfect fit for
 them.

 Almost any business could do this. Figure out the biggest and most common problems your customers experience when it comes to your “thing.” Then offer some form of consultation where you address all those issues. Talk about the problems in your marketing. Show the client that you understand them. And position yourself as the expert. Position your consultation as the solution to their problems. Remember, often the biggest pain customers complain about is that the shopping process for your “thing” is confusing, unpleasant, inconvenient, time consuming, and frustrating. If you can transform their experience you’re on to a winner.

 There Must Be Sales Choreography In retail there has been a recent trend for uniquely designed, stylish interiors. Shops and boutiques that truly have created an amazing environment. And here in the UK we have our fair share of “trendy” opticians. But environment alone is not enough.
 The shopping environment is only the stage. It’s extremely important. It sets the scene, it creates a certain atmosphere, and it projects a message. It sets the customer’s expectations. But what matters a whole lot more is the performance that takes place on that stage. It is useful to think of your customer experience as a performance. Or a piece of theatre. Are the actors skilled and practiced at their performance? How well do they use their stage and their props? Do they know lines? Do they deliver them confidently? Is the script actually engaging? Do they know how to win over their audience?
 It’s not just about the building and environment that you create. It’s also about the people and the processes. This is stagecraft. This is sales choreography. Without it, all you have is a building. Yes, it might be a very nice building, an impressive environment. But it is just a building. It is the


-----

##### people inside the building that bring it alive and use it to create an experience. And the way people create a memorable experience is through choreography and practice.

 Crafting Effective Sales Scripts We crafted effective sales scripts for every key stage of our sales process. But let me walk you through an early stage of our process: the initial conversation we have with “browsers” who walk in “cold” expecting to just look at glasses. After we removed the stock from display these early minutes in the sale process became critical.
 First, everyone thought I was crazy to remove the stock from display. When a customer walks into a store they expect to be able to browse. When you take away that option, it puts the salesperson under a bit of pressure.
 When there is product on display it buys a little time to build rapport and to engage the customer. And a shop full of products is a more comfortable environment because the customer’s attention is usually focused on the product rather than on the salesperson. But when we took away the products, suddenly the salesperson was the “main event” from the moment the prospect walked in. They were 100% in the limelight. They had nowhere to hide. They would either sink or swim in a matter of minutes.
 So we tested and developed effective scripts to engage the client, put them at ease, start a discovery process, and lead them down the route to an eyewear style consultation.
 We started with basic scripts. A few questions that we wanted to ask. A few helpful statements we wanted to make about what we do. A few short stories we could tell. And we role-played all that regularly. We’d take the most common things browsers would say and we’d practice responding to their statements and questions in an effective way.
 But we discovered that scripts need to go hand-in-hand with sales choreography. And sales choreography became a huge part of this early stage in our sales process. How the prospect physically moved through the practice. How we directed their attention and kept them engaged. How we put them at ease and helped them open up.
 We’d position our frame drawers in a location that would draw people all the way into the practice. We’d open a secret drawer while we were


-----

##### speaking with them to reveal a large collection of exquisite and different eyewear. That would entice them. We’d select one or two frames and ask if they’d like to try it on. We’d position mirrors on tables as a way of getting people to sit down. We’d get people to go from standing to sitting at a table by casually saying, “Let me get a few frames together for you while you have a look at that one. Try it on. There is a mirror there. Just have a seat.” We’d keep them seated and engaged by another member of staff bringing them a tea or coffee. We’d build their anticipation by presenting frames on leather-padded trays much like a jeweler might present an expensive piece of jewelry. And before we’d present the frame to them to try on we’d describe the quality, the individuality, the exclusivity of these types of products and why what we’re showing them is different from the mass- produced products they’ll find in most opticians.
 By this stage the browser is caught up in “an experience.” An unexpected experience. And then while they’re “ooh-ing” and “ahh-ing” over a few stylish frames, we’re more interested in gathering information about them. At this stage they’re warmed up and much more open with us. So we’re casually having a conversation about them, their requirements, their problems, what they’d ideally like, what they’ve done in the past, their budget, timescale, how and when they’ll make a decision, whether they’ll want to come back with their partner, etc. We’re exploring needs and qualifying them in a comfortable, relaxed, helpful way. We are not in any way giving a sales presentation. Really, we’re just giving them an overview of the styles and letting them try on a few frames as a way of keeping them engaged while we “interview” them. We’re the ones asking the questions. And then once we have some information and if they are a good fit for us, we’ll “sell” a free eyewear styling consultation. We explain how we work, why we do things this way, and how it might be a good solution to the problems they just shared with us. Then we schedule an appointment for their consultation later that day or for another day depending on time and what we feel is most effective based on their buying criteria that we identified.
 And that is how we go from a cold browsing experience where we have little control, to a consultation, by appointment where we have control, expert positioning, information we can use to influence and persuade, pre- established rapport, and a pre-qualified prospect.


-----

##### And it results in a sale over 80% of the time. It also saves time by weeding out time wasters, and anyone who isn’t a good fit for what we do, within a few minutes.
 In addition to this kind of sales choreography we also use many “props” that help us create the desired kind of experience. The great thing about props is that even if it is something small it can be “focused in on,” pointed out, or talked about so it becomes a memorable part of the experience.
 Here’s a taste of some of our props: fresh flowers in every room, real tea served in a stylish china cup and saucer, a selection of 19 flavors of teas, a Nespresso coffee machine that serves a proper cappuccino or latte, freshly served Pimm’s with fruit in the summer, mulled wine in the winter, a selection of handmade Belgian chocolates, coffee table books with inspiring photography of a lifestyle clients aspire to (e.g., The Condé Naste Travel Book, The Sartorialist), jazz music, and on and on.

 Everything Matters! Everything in the practice has been thought out in advance. We have considered the message it sends out and whether it fits in with the perception we are trying to create for our clients. We look at everything through our client’s eyes. Everything has an appealing design and style; from the pens we use, to how we dress, to the chairs, and furniture. Everything matters.

 More Money with Less Work Now, it takes a bit of effort and investment to put on a show like this and to create this kind of customer experience. So if you go to all this trouble you kind of want to get paid! We “get paid” by focusing on premium pricing. Premium pricing allows you to work less and make more. In fact, if I had to pick just one strategy, premium pricing would be it.
 Without this piece of the puzzle I would probably have failed like the previous owners of this business. When I took on the project of buying this practice we changed a lot of things at once, the effect of which was the bottom third of existing customers magically disappeared. All of a sudden we were seeing fewer clients but a much higher quality of client who would spend a lot more money with us. And then a constant stream of these ideal


-----

##### clients started showing up at our door. And the lower-end clients simply stopped coming in.
 We had fewer clients, but the clients we had were much more profitable than the ones we got rid of. We were able to devote our full attention to doing the best job we could for our ideal clients because we weren’t busy running around serving a mass of low-quality clients who aren’t profitable for us. And it was a lot more enjoyable and fulfilling work.

 How Much Is an “Expensive” Frame? In my first practice the average frame price was £250. The majority of our frames were between £200 and £300. And a small percentage of frames were above £300. As a result, my staff and myself thought that anything over £300 was an expensive frame. £300 was the point as which we’d get a little nervous because it was “expensive.”
 I remember the first day I started in my second practice. The very first thing we did was completely change the stock. And we purposely bought stock to position us as high-end. Well, overnight my perception of what an expensive frame was changed. Why? Because most of the frames on the shelves were between £300 to £400. And there were frames over the £400 mark as well. Suddenly a £300 frame felt like a bargain.
 But here’s the thing: The customer’s perception of what was expensive changed, too. Suddenly they felt that up to £400 was normal because most of the frames were that price.

 The Law of Contrast There is a principle in human perception, the contrast principle, that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented one after another. The contrast principle is well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts of perceptions.
 If a customer looks at a £400 product and then a £300 product, the £400 product seems expensive to them. And the £300 product seems “not expensive.” But if instead, they look at the £300 product first, followed by a £200 product, the exact same £300 product that would have seemed “not expensive” in the first scenario now seems “expensive.” This is the law of contrast at work.


-----

##### You can control what your customers, and your staff, perceive as expensive by the stock that you carry and the pricing that you use. If you want to sell more £400 products but the majority of your products are less than £300, then customers and staff will struggle because the £400 will be perceived as expensive by most customers and most staff.
 The way to do it is to have the majority of products at the price point you want to be selling at. £400 for example. Then get rid of your lower end products. Or at least get them off display. Hide them away and get them out only if you really need to. And also start selling £600 and £800 products as well. These make your £400 products seem “not expensive.” This is the contrast principle. You’ll be amazed how it works.

 How an £895 Frame Was Perceived as “Not Expensive” Mike is a great client. A successful businessman, in his late 40s, with a large head so he finds it difficult to find glasses that fit him. But he likes his eyewear. We give him a call whenever we get something in that we think would be up his street. And he came in recently to look at a few frames from a new range. And as expected he liked them. The frames were at the more expensive end of the spectrum, ranging from £700 to £1500. And he ended up buying a frame that was £895. He said was happy that he liked the £895 frame and not the expensive ones! The law of contrast and how the products were presented meant that the £895 frame was seen as not expensive.

 Avoid Price Comparison When we raised prices we also took steps to avoid price comparison. We work with niche eyewear brands that are exclusive, individual, not worn by the masses and not so easy to find (hence avoiding price shopping). But more important than this, we attract clients who are not concerned with price shopping. And we have created a process (the eyewear style consultation) that practically makes it impossible to price compare.

 How We Attract Properly Prepared Prospects


-----

##### Prospects apply online for a free Eyewear Style Consultation. They submit their information and fill in a form with their motivations for applying. They tell us what problems they are having and what they want help with. Our “Client Experience Coordinator” calls them to qualify them and book them in for an Eyewear Style Consultation if we’re a good fit.
 When we first launched the free consultation offer we had a very low conversion rate from these people who were coming in for the free consultation. They were price sensitive, shopping around, planning to buy online, etc. All the same old problems we were trying to avoid. Staff would get frustrated about feeling obliged to give these people the free consultation they were promised even though they knew it was a waste of time.
 That was our initial feedback from trying this. At that stage all the prospect had to do was complete the application form and book their appointment. So we quickly added the extra step of the phone call to qualify or disqualify them. We framed it like this: “A short phone call is required before we can schedule your eyewear styling consultation. Once we receive your application we will call you to explain how the eyewear styling process works, what information to bring, and what to expect. This call will take five to ten minutes.” And that extra step totally transformed the results so that we now convert over 80% of eyewear style consultations.
 The phone call is done in a relaxed, friendly, conversational manner. Even when we disqualify a prospect (because of budget or some other reason) it is done in a helpful way and the prospect generally seems happy that we have been open and honest with them and explained why we are not a good fit for what they want. We have saved them the time and hassle and potential embarrassment from coming in for an hourlong consultation only to find out the price is out of reach for them at the last minute. It’s also extremely useful on the phone call to have the information that they gave us on their application form about their “problem.” That is where these calls begin. We follow the problem—agitate—solution formula.
 And the latest thing that we are testing is changing our offer from “free consultation” to “free book.” I’ve written a book for consumers called The Definitive Guide to Choosing Glasses That Make You Look Good (see Figure 33.1 on Page 336). The plan is to delay the sale by offering the book


-----

##### as the first step to educate and prepare the prospect and then drive them to a free consultation after a series of follow-ups by email and real mail.
 The other reasons I had for writing this book were many. We are already using it as a tool for referrals by giving clients copies when they collect their new glasses. It obviously adds to our expert positioning and will make it easier to get PR coverage for the practice. And I’m also going to use it as the offer we promote to attract new clients from direct mail as well as advertisements.
 A book is a great way to build a relationship with a customer before they ever step foot in your business. And when they do come in, they are pre-determined to buy from you. The book does a lot of the work and makes everyone else’s job easier.

##### Showing Up Differently


-----

##### The building I am sitting in as I write this used to be home to The Bank of England. It’s an old and impressive building. And a prestigious address. It was the focal point for the city’s financial and professional community and the commercial heart of the whole region. The banking hall itself is an architectural masterpiece and a Grade 1 listed building. It is a luxurious and grand environment.
 Dan Kennedy talks about “showing up differently” and that is really what this building does for us (see Figures 33.2 and 33.3 on Page 338). We don’t look like an opticians is supposed to look. And it works very well for us. Rather than relying on location and passing footfall we have created a “destination practice.” We incorporate the uniqueness and character of the building into the experience we create for clients. It becomes a part of the story we tell.
 The building is a really obvious example but the principle of showing up differently is at work in everything we do. Even down to the language we use. We sell “eyewear” not glasses. We have an eyewear “gallery,” not a glasses store. People don’t look at glasses, they have an “eyewear style consultation.”

 Make Your Business about Something Make your business about something. Make it stand for something. Design it in a way that taps into people’s emotions and values. At Jones and Co. Styling Opticians I made the business about something more than the core deliverables. I made it about style, individuality, exclusivity, expertise, personal service, and relationships.
 For example, we create exclusive events where we fly in the world’s finest eyewear designers to showcase their collections for our clients (including eyewear in the £10,000 plus range crafted from precious metals and personalized with diamonds).

**FIGURE 33.2**


-----

**FIGURE 33.3**


-----

##### And our clients tell stories about us. Stories about the events. About the building. About the drinks we serve. About the Eyewear Style Consultation. About the way we source our exclusive frames. About our expertise.
 What I’m most proud of is creating an exclusive and aspirational business that is expertly balanced with “real” relationships. In my experience most affluent consumers enjoy dealing with real people and being treated as real people themselves. They don’t want to be seen as a walking wallet. We talk colloquially with clients. Just because they desire the finer things in life doesn’t mean they want a stiff, posh, snooty, impersonal service. Yes the service standards are world class—but they are delivered in a “real” way.

 Make Your Business for Someone We designed the practice to be for successful people who see themselves as individuals. For people who value style, service, and expertise. We are for people who want to look good and feel good in eyewear.


-----

##### Inherent in your USP must be a deep understanding of your ideal customer and how you make their life better. So my business is 100% focused on a very particular type of customer. We understand them and know them better than most people know their closest friend. We have a deep understanding of them and that allows us to create a business that appeals to them. We build real relationships with them. We know who they really are. And they know who we are, and what we stand for. We believe in the same things. We fit. We know their values, hopes, dreams, fears, pains, and desires.
 We produce a successful monthly print newsletter for our clients called “Jones and Co. LIFE.” Not a day goes by in the practice without clients mentioning the newsletter, commenting on a particular story and sharing their own version of that story, or just saying that they enjoy receiving it.
 The newsletter is one of the ways we show our clients that we understand them and that we are like them. I put a lot of personality into the newsletter, I share stories from my life that are relevant, and I try to strike a chord with the client who is reading it. I want them nodding their head in agreement. I want them thinking, “That’s so true. I feel the same way. These Jones and Co. people are just like me.” It has to be an entertaining read, but what I’m really doing is showing them that my belief system is the same as their belief system in certain, important areas. And that builds trust and stronger relationships.
 (An unintended bonus from this print monthly newsletter has been that I have a stronger relationship with many more clients than before, even though I now work less and less in the practice and I see very few clients. But when I am in the practice I am bombarded with praise and personal conversations from clients who feel they know me even if I have never actually met them. It’s a great strategy for getting free from working “in” the business while still keeping a strong relationship with your clients. They still feel that connection with you even if you are not there, and it also gives them a route to give feedback directly to you, if you choose.)

 Constant Testing If I said we got here in one fell swoop I’d be lying. This wasn’t easy. There were a few bumps in the road. Obstacles we didn’t foresee until they were


-----

##### upon us. But it was all part of the learning and testing process. It also meant when we found a solution, we understood why it worked and also knew five other ways NOT to do it.

 Expect a Few Bumps in the Road The first eyewear style consultation didn’t work. The first funnel attracted mainly time wasters and people that were not a good fit for us.
 Removing stock from display met with lots of resistance from would-be browsers until we figured out effective scripts to lead them along with our sales process. This motivated us to create effective scripts and fast!
 In our attempt to be exclusive the language we used early on in our marketing was a bit too pretentious. I know there are subtle differences in the UK market compared to the U.S. market and it took us a little while to find our sweet spot.
 Generally, every step of the way involved initial resistance, poor results, tweaking it until it was effective, followed by success. But without those first few clumsy, awkward attempts at each new thing, we would never have discovered the successful way to do it.
 The lesson here is that nothing happens with any idea until you try it. Then you get feedback. And by then you’re already moving so it’s easier to adjust and tweak and change direction until you make it work.

#### CHAPTER 1


### The Big Switch

 Why Direct Marketing for NON-Direct Marketing
 Businesses?


# It is an odd sort of title, isn’t it?

##### If you picked it up hoping for huge breakthroughs in your business, you bought the right book. But first, I have to get these definitions out of the way.
 By non-direct marketing business, I mean anything but a mail-order, catalog, or online marketer who directly solicits orders for merchandise. It could be a local dental practice, carpet cleaning business, brick and mortar retailer, B2B—IT consultant, CPA firm, or industrial equipment manufacturer. The owners of such businesses do not think of themselves as direct marketers engaged in direct-response advertising, until I get ahold of them!
 Examples of pure direct marketing businesses just about everybody knows are the TV home shopping channels, QVC and HSN; catalogers like J. Peterman or Hammacher-Schlemmer; contemporary catalog and online catalog/ecommerce companies like Amazon and Zappos; businesses like the Fruit of the Month Club; and mass users of direct mail to sell things, like Publishers Clearinghouse.


-----

##### There are thousands of true direct marketing businesses. Some are familiar to the general public; many, many more are familiar only to the niche or special interest they serve. For example, at any given moment, I have over 50 direct marketers as clients, each selling books, audio CDs, home study courses, and seminars and services by mail, internet and print media, teleseminars, and webinars, which market only to a specific industry or profession—one to carpet cleaners, another to restaurant owners, another to chiropractors, etc. If you are not a chiropractor, you don’t know the name Dr. Chris Tomshack and his company Health Source. If you are a chiropractor, it would be hard not to know of him, thanks to his full-page ads in the industry trade journals, massive amounts of direct mail, and other direct marketing. There are also direct marketers unknown by name but known by their products or brands, like a long-time client of mine, Guthy- Renker Corporation, the billion-dollar business behind TV infomercials for Pro-Activ® acne creams and many other products made into brands. What all these have in common is their fundamental process of selling direct via media to consumers, with no brick-and-mortar locations or face-to-face contact required.
 These are not the folks this book is for, even if they are the kinds of entrepreneurs I work personally with a lot. They already know everything in this book, and live and prosper by it.
 This book is for the owner of a brick-and-mortar business, a business with a store, showroom or office; a restaurant; a dental practice; an accounting practice; or a funeral home that is some kind of ordinary business, one most likely local and serving a local market. These are the entrepreneurs who have populated my audiences for four decades, subscribe to my newsletters, and use my systems to transform those “ordinary” businesses into extraordinary money machines that far, far outperform their industry norms, peers, competitors, and their own wildest imaginations. How do they do it? The big switch is a simple one to state (if more complex to do): they switch from traditional advertising to direct-response advertising. They stop emulating ordinary and traditional marketing and instead emulate direct marketing.
 Most “ordinary” businesses advertise and market like much bigger brand-name companies, so they spend (waste) a lot of money on image, brand, and presence. But copycatting these big brand-name companies is


-----

##### like a rabbit behaving like the lion. It makes no sense. The big companies have all sorts of reasons for the way they advertise and market that have nothing to do with getting a customer or making sales! Because your agenda is much simpler, you should find successful businesses with similar agendas to copycat. Those are direct marketers. You and they share the same basic ideas:

 1. Spend $1.00 on marketing, get back $2.00 or $20.00, fast, that can
 be accurately tracked to the $1.00 spent. 2. Do NOT spend $1.00 that does not directly and quickly bring back
 $2.00 or $20.00.

 Please stop and be sure you get this life-changing principle. Be careful who you copy. Be careful who you act like. Be careful who you study. If their purpose, objectives, agenda, reasons for doing what they do the way they do it don’t match up with your purpose, objectives, agenda, then you should NOT study or emulate or copy them!


### Big Company’s Agenda for Advertising and
 Marketing

##### 1. Please/appease its board of directors (most of whom know zip
 about advertising and marketing but have lots of opinions)

 2. Please/appease its stockholders

 3. Look good and appropriate to Wall Street

 4. Look good and appropriate to the media

 5. Build brand identity

 6. Win awards for advertising


-----

##### 7. Sell something

 1. Sell something. Now.


### Your Agenda


##### Please stop and be sure you get this life-changing corollary principle. Find somebody who is successful, who shares your purpose, objectives, agenda, and pay great attention to what he does and how he does it.
 I believe some call this sort of thing “a blinding flash of the obvious.” Well, you can call it obvious if you like—but then how do you explain the fact that 99% of all businesspeople are operating as if ignorant of this obvious logic?
 I might add this principle has power in places other than marketing. You can eventually get south by going due north, but life’s easier and less stressful, and business more profitable, if you actually get headed in the direction that leads directly to your destination of choice. Emulating inappropriate examples is the equivalent of trudging south to get to the North Pole. Odds are, you’ll get lost, tired, or eaten by a giant iguana long before seeing snow.

 Why Is There so Much Lousy, Unproductive, Unprofitable Advertising
 and Marketing Out There, Anyway?
 No B.S. truth. Most business owners are just about clueless when it comes to advertising and marketing. They are, therefore, often Advertising Victims, preyed on by media salespeople, ad agencies, website developers, social media wizards, and others who don’t know any more about how to actually produce a customer or make a sale than they do. Anytime you are being guided to decisions and investments that are not fact based, and instead driven by popular fads, trends, opinions, and monkey-see-monkey- do pressure, you are being victimized. Direct marketers insist on facts and live by data.
 If you try to get a business owner to accurately tell you where his customers and sales come from, what it costs to get a customer from source


-----

##### A or source B, what results specifically come from this ad or that one, he can’t. He’s guessing. Consequently, he’s often grumpy and unhappy about things he shouldn’t be, but also wasting money he needn’t be.
 The reasons for the cluelessness and vulnerability to victimization are many. Here’s a big one: Marketing Incest. When you got into whatever business you’re in, you probably looked around at what everybody else in the business was doing and copied it. Gradually, you’ve tried to do it better, but not radically different, just better. So you have everybody in an industry standing in a circle looking inward at each other, ignoring anyone or anything outside the circle. It’s incestuous, and it works just like real generational incest: Everybody slowly gets dumber and dumber and dumber.
 This book dares you to turn back on the circle and deliberately go far afield from your peers in search of different—not just incrementally better —different ways of marketing.

 Yes, Salvation Is within Reach

 Now, here’s the good news: most business owners, clueless as they may be about profitable advertising or effective marketing, do know a lot about how to sell their products or services. That’s very good news because DIRECT marketing for non-direct marketing businesses is really not about traditional advertising or marketing at all. It is simply “salesmanship multiplied in media.” So you actually already do have a firm grip on one- third of the KENNEDY RESULTS TRIANGLE that you’ll master with this book. You know the Message. It’ll get tweaked, as I’ll explain. But you do have this component part.

##### The Ten No B.S. Rules of Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing
 Businesses (My Ten Commandments)
 I’ll lay our foundation first. (A radical idea itself!) Please copy these and post them somewhere you’ll see them often until you get them memorized. Doing so will keep you on track, save you a lot of money, and dramatically improve your marketing.
 From now on, every ad you run, every flier you distribute, every postcard or letter you mail, every website you put up, every/anything you do to advertise or market your business MUST adhere to these rules. To be fair, they are simplistic and dogmatic, and there are reasons to violate them in certain situations. But for now, sticking to them as a rigid diet will work. You can experiment later, after you’ve first cleansed your business of toxins.


##### Rule #1.
 Rule #2.
 Rule #3.
 Rule #4.
 Rule #5.
 Rule #6.
 Rule #7.
 Rule #8.
 Rule #9.


##### There Will Always Be an Offer or Offer(s)

 There Will Be a Reason to Respond Right Now

 You Will Give Clear Instructions

 There Will Be Tracking, Measurement, and Accountability

 Only No-Cost Brand-Building

 There Will Be Follow-Up

 There Will Be Strong Copy

 It Will Look Like Mail-Order Advertising

 Results Rule. Period.


-----

##### Rule #10.


##### You Will Be a Tough-Minded Disciplinarian and Put Your Business on a Strict Direct Marketing Diet


##### We’ll tackle each Rule in-depth, in the next eight chapters. I once wrote an entire book about breaking rules, and generally speaking, I think rules are for other, ordinary mortals—certainly not for me, and not for you either if you are a true entrepreneur. So you’ll chafe at rules here just as I would. However, when you are attempting to undo bad habits and replace them with new ones, some hard and fast rules are necessary, temporarily. Once you fully understand these and have lived with them for a reasonable length of time, then feel free to experiment if you wish. But get good at coloring inside the lines before ignoring them altogether.
 Finally, a word about these aged rules and the newest of the new media and its promoters of new metrics. Try putting views or likes on a bank deposit slip. You will be told that no old rules—the time-tested, time-proven ones—apply to new media like Facebook or Snapchat or etc., etc., but be certain to take into account who makes that argument. It will come from young people on your staff or in agencies spending your money, not theirs, unable if pressed to prove profitable return on investment from their chosen media and made-up metrics. When pressed on this point, they won’t argue facts, because they can’t; they will only stigmatize and label you as a dummy and a primitive stuck in the past’s old ways. It will come from people caught up in a dumb cattle stampede. You have to do it and throw harsh reality accountability aside because everybody else is doing it and ignoring financial accountability. It will come from peddlers of it for profit. Of course, the bald man should never ask the hungry barber if he needs a haircut. When all you have to sell are haircuts, everyone needs them.
 If a media can’t be used with these ten rules applied to it, my advice is: skip it.

#### CHAPTER 2


### An OFFER They Can’t Refuse


# There is a certain mindset in direct marketing folks. We are result
##### oriented. We find it difficult to just go out for a drive for the sake of going for a drive. We want a definite destination, an estimated time of arrival, and a purpose for the trip. Most direct marketers have trouble watching a sports telecast unless they’ve wagered on the game. We want to KNOW if we have won or lost, succeeded or failed, achieved something definitive or just wandered around. While this tendency gets in the way of a friendly family game night, it is extremely useful in avoiding the vagueness and lack of accountability that permeates most business owners’ marketing activities.
 It is this habit of thought that informs.

 Rule #1 There Will ALWAYS Be an Offer or Offers A key distinguishing characteristic of direct marketing and Direct-Response Advertising from all other marketing and advertising is the presentation of a very specific offer or offers. Ideally, yours is a Godfather’s Offer—an offer that the appropriate prospect or customer for you can’t refuse! We’ll get to the architecture of offers in a few minutes, but first the overarching ideas: one, to make your every communication actually ask somebody to do something, and two, to inject new disciplines of selling and accountability


-----

##### into all your communication with prospects, customers, and the marketplace at large.
 If you begin paying attention to advertising and marketing, you’ll see that most of it merely shows up and talks about the marketers and advertisers, but does not directly offer something specific to be had by immediately and directly responding. A lot of print ads and TV commercials and brochures now include websites or Facebook sites where you can go like ‘em, etc., but present no Offer as a compelling reason to go there. All this is undisciplined. It is sending money out to play a backyard game with no rules, and worse, no score-keeping, no clear means of judging victory or defeat. A chaotic mess. When you take this undisciplined approach and simply spend and hope and guess, you’re at the mercy of opinion about your marketing—do you like it? Does your mother-in-law like it? Do your customers say nice things about it? Try paying any of your bills with that sort of feedback.
 This all changes with direct marketing. Direct marketing imposes discipline. That discipline may be as important and valuable as the benefit of direct response itself. For some mysterious reason, business owners are willing to let advertising and marketing off the hook, but tend to hold everything else accountable for results and return on investment. If they tie up money in certain product inventory, they expect it to sell—or they refuse to restock it. If they employ a sales representative, they expect him to make sales. If they buy a delivery van, they expect it to start and run so it can make deliveries. If they pay a laborer by the hour, they expect him to clock in, be there, and work for the hour. Yet investments made for marketing are permitted to skate. Only direct marketing imposes discipline, by always making an offer or offers, so response to those offers can be tracked and measured, injecting factual accountability.
 My old speaking colleague, one of the all-time greats, Zig Ziglar, always described salespeople who wimped out at closing sales and directly demanding orders as “professional visitors,” not professional salespeople. Since you will be doing selling in print, online, with media, you rarely want to let it be a professional visitor on your behalf. Fire all the wimps. Demand real performance. So your task is to incorporate a direct offer each and every time you put out a message, of any kind, by any means.


-----

##### I mean of any kind. By any means. We teach most business owners to use Thanksgiving greeting cards and/or New Year’s greeting cards, with past and lost as well as active customers, clients or patients, and, often, with unconverted leads too. We also teach no greeting card should arrive without being accompanied by an offer. Typically, the offer will be a gift with visit to showroom or store, gift with purchase, gift for referral, etc., placed in a printed piece inside a separate envelope, inside the greeting card itself, to preserve some separation between the thank you or new year sentiment and selling. But we are not shy about our purpose in life either, and it is not merely being professional visitors.
 In short, you have a fundamental governance decision to make. Will you let yourself be persuaded or bullied into wasting money on marketing that cannot be directly held accountable for results and return on investment? Or will you insist on accountability?

 “Shined Shoes Save Lives” My speaking colleague of some 40 events or so, the late General Norman Schwarzkopf, famous for Desert Storm, said, “Shined shoes save lives.” He meant that establishing and adhering absolutely to minor disciplines ensured soldiers could and would adhere to vital battlefield disciplines. Norm believed that a person can’t be undisciplined about some things but disciplined about others any more than an alcoholic person committed to sobriety can occasionally have a few drinks. You either are or you aren’t. Your business is either run in a disciplined way, or it isn’t.
 Discipline is a central theme of all business success. Last year, 2017, was the 80th anniversary of widespread embrace by successful entrepreneurs of Napoleon Hill’s works Laws of Success and Think and Grow Rich, the summary of findings from his 30-year investigation into key commonalities of over 500 of the industrialists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and financiers who built America. In Laws, he detailed 17 such principles; in Think and Grow Rich, 13. Two of these are: accurate thinking and organized effort. Of a more contemporary nature, you might be familiar with Michael Gerber and his E-Myth, which is all about organized systems in business. One of the most successful of all buyers of and investors in businesses, Warren Buffett, has an absolute discipline for evaluating


-----

##### companies, and he has stuck to it with religious conviction. Top-performing athletes in every sport always exhibit a far greater level of discipline for everything from study to practice to actual playing of their game than the mediocre majority. The most successful authors past and present do not write whenever they’re in the mood—they have a self-imposed discipline mandating a set number of hours or completed pages every day. Anywhere you find significant success, you will find imposed absolute discipline. Undisciplined, unorganized advertising and marketing “effort” is not going to defy this fact of success.


### Resource Alert!

##### THE book entirely devoted to comprehensive imposition of success disciplines to a business is No B.S. Guide to RUTHLESS Management of
 People & Profits, 2nd Edition. The book entirely devoted to comprehensive imposition of success disciplines to an individual is No
 B.S. Guide to Time Management for Entrepreneurs, 3rd Edition.


##### Two Types of Offers There are basically two types of offers. There is an offer requesting purchase. There is also the lead-generation offer, asking only for a person to, in effect, raise their hand, to identify and register themselves as having interest in certain subject matter and information or goods or services, and to invite further communication from you. Often, although not always, the lead-generation offer is free. There are times and places for both kinds of offers, but no communication should be devoid of some offer.

 The Direct Purchase Offer


-----

##### Online media like Groupon or hybrid offline+online media like Val Pak coupons deliver some of the simplest, most straightforward direct purchase offers, like “Buy One, Get The 2nd One Free”—used by everybody from pizza shops to window replacement companies. I am not a champion of discounting as strategy, and a co-author, Jason Marrs, and I provide much more sophisticated approaches in our book No B.S. Price Strategy. But for illustration purposes, this is a direct purchase offer you’re very familiar with and may be using now in your business. Another common direct purchase offer, in place of or combined with discounting, is gift with purchase. These were birthed by direct marketers but have migrated to retail, service, professionals, and B2B, so they are commonplace. They should be and usually are married to a hard deadline. They certainly provide easy opportunity to accurately measure their effectiveness and production, although out of ignorance or sloth, many business owners fail to measure.
 Direct Purchase Offers have several significant disadvantages. One is that they tend to sacrifice price integrity and profitability, and if relied on too frequently, train customers to only respond when a “great deal” is offered. Two, they can only be responded to by people ready and able to buy right this minute—they fail to identify people likely to buy in your category in the near future. Third, they can be easily and quickly comparison shopped, especially if you are conveying the offer online. Still, business does revolve around Direct Purchase Offers.

 The Lead-Generation Offer This is a more interesting kind of offer, because it can substantially reduce the waste factor in advertising, convert a sales culture to a marketing culture, and provide opportunity to build trust and create a relationship.
 You see lead generation done by direct marketers routinely and regularly. You may not have given them much thought, but now you will. They are commonly used by national direct marketers, but rarely used by local, small businesses—even though the national and local firms may be in the same product or service categories. For example, a company like Premier Bathtubs, which sells walk-in bathtubs that are safer for elderly people, advertises just about everywhere, offering a free information kit with brochures and a DVD. Once somebody raises their hand and registers


-----

##### themselves as interested in making a home’s bathroom safe for themselves or an elderly parent, the company has a marketing opportunity. Oddly, you will almost never catch a local remodeling company duplicating this strategy. Instead, they tend to leap to offering an in-home estimate for work to be done. This is often A Bridge Too Far.

 The Important Concept of Threshold Resistance Arnold Taubman, one of America’s most successful mall developers, spoke and wrote at length about the concept of Threshold Resistance as it applies to entrances to retail stores and window displays of retail stores. I find it applies even more broadly to direct marketing (see Figure 2.1 on Page 18). All offers fall somewhere on a continuum between Low-Threshold Offer and High-Threshold Offer.

**FIGURE 2.1: Threshold Resistance**

##### Here are examples of offers that would fall to the right of the middle, toward High Threshold:

 Chiropractor Free Exam


##### Financial Advisor


##### Free Seminar


-----

##### Remodeler Free Estimate

 Restaurant Out for a Meal and Experience That May Not Prove Pleasurable

 These score toward High Threshold because they can be scary and intimidating to the consumer. They require people to put themselves in uncomfortable positions. They require a decision nearly made, to get care, to find an advisor, to get remodeling done. A great many people with evolving interest or interest that can be stimulated will still not be prepared to take this big of a step forward.
 Examples of offers that fall at the High Threshold are:

 Chiropractor $29 Exam

 Financial Advisor Free Private Appointment

 Examples of Low-Threshold Offers The lowest threshold offer is for free information, to be sent by mail or FedEx, or accessed online. This is the staple item of direct-response advertising, in virtually every category of business. The largest wealth management firm, Fischer Investments, on TV and radio, in Forbes and other magazines; one of the most successful home improvement product manufacturers, SunSetter Awnings, by direct-mail and blow-in inserts in magazines and newspapers; one of the biggest health insurers, Humana, in TV commercials; virtually all of the retirement communities advertising in the Where to Retire magazine; my client, High Point University; my client, ExcellenceInOrthodontics.org all offer low-threshold, information items like books, free reports, DVDs. If this is their number-one strategy, why shouldn’t it be yours? Keep in mind, these are big, national direct-response advertisers who have plenty of opportunity to run split tests often, and do, and keep returning to the tried-and-true, low-threshold, free information offer.


-----

##### I have coined the term “Information First Marketing” for this. Really savvy local business operators are embracing it, modeling the national advertisers. This is a wave of change, not just in the way businesses advertise to attract new customers, but in what they advertise. The karate school doesn’t advertise itself, its lessons, or a free lesson. Instead, it advertises a free report by its owner: The Parents’ Guide to Cyber-Bullying and Bullying: Raising Emotionally Strong Kids. The mattress store doesn’t advertise itself, its mattresses, or some sale of the century. It advertises its free guidebook: Why You Can’t Seem to Get a Good Night’s Sleep. The IT consultant doesn’t advertise his services. He advertises a free book: You Are the Target: Cybersecurity Before It’s Too Late.
 Consider a very ordinary business—a funeral home. Most funeral home advertising is very basic: name, location, years in the community, list of services. The only offer is implied: when you need us, we’ll bury you. But even a funeral home can create and put forward a low-threshold, informationbased, lead-generation offer that begins a relationship, builds trust, and establishes preference in advance of need, like this:

 Estate Planning Tips for Responsible Family Leaders,” call our free recorded message any time at 000-000-0000. It will be sent by mail, no

 The Hybrid Approach There is no law that says you must choose just one of these approaches.
 Most advertising dramatically suppresses possible response by presenting only a single reason for a response. Typically, this is a High Threshold Offer that requires somebody to be 99.9% ready to buy now. Nobody’s coming in for a $59.00 exam unless they are 99% ready to put a chiropractic physician to work on their back pain today. But a lot of people suffering with nagging or episodically reoccurring back pain, who are having evolving thoughts about doing something about it, would respond to a Low Threshold Offer of information about “True Causes and Best Ways to Relieve Nagging Back Pain—Without Surgery or Drugs.” You don’t have to be dead or have a dead family member in the parlor to respond to a

 To be clear, here’s what I’ve introduced you to here:

 1. The use of offers

 2. The difference between Low and High-Threshold Offers 3. The use of Lead-Generation Offers 4. Single Reason to Respond vs. Multiple Reasons to Respond

 Once a business owner understands these things, his objection is often about a possible trade-down of response. The fear is that somebody who might call or come in or otherwise respond to a High-Threshold Offer and make an immediate purchase will trade down to a Low-Threshold Offer and delay his purchase or be scooped up by a competitor. While this does happen, it usually affects far fewer people than a business owner fears, and the improved total response and value of leads captured for development more than makes up for what little trade-down occurs. After all, the person who fell off a ladder and has to crawl to the phone isn’t gong to trade down from making an appointment with the doctor to requesting a free report or DVD delivered days later by mail. The person with a dead body is unlikely to trade down from immediate assistance at the funeral parlor to booking a


-----

##### tour next Thursday. In most cases, you can safely add Low-Threshold Offers without significantly compromising response to a High-Threshold Offer designed for the person ready to buy right this minute.
 Ultimately, your decisions about the nature of your offer(s), where they fall on the Low- to High-Threshold continuum, whether or not they feature information, whether they are for lead generation or immediate purchase activity or a hybrid of the two are situational. Different media, different markets, different timing will color those decisions. You should realize you have choices and you can make your marketing dollars work harder for you by offering people more than one reason and more than one means of responding to you. But no matter what you make of these choices each time you must make them in putting forward marketing, your pledge of honor to Rule #1 must be: there will always be an offer or offers.

 Rule #2 There Will Be a Reason to Respond Right Now Hesitation and procrastination are amongst the most common of all human behaviors.
 If you are a mail-order catalog shopper, you have—more than once— browsed, folded down corners of pages from which you intended to buy items, set the catalogs aside, and never placed the orders. This happens with every marketing media. People watching a TV infomercial almost buy, but put it off, to do the next time they see it, or jot down the 800-number, to do it later, but later never comes. A shopper enters the mall, sees an outfit she likes, but tells herself she’ll stop and look at it and probably get it on her way out. By the time she has walked the mall, had lunch, bought other items, and is headed back to the end of the mall she entered at, she is focused on getting to her car and getting home. The dress spotted on arrival is left behind.
 We must be sharply, painfully aware of all the potential response lost to such hesitation. The hidden cost and failure in all advertising and marketing is with the Almost-Persuaded. They were tempted to respond. They nearly responded. They got right up to the edge of response, but then set it aside to take care of later or to mull over or to Google the next time they were at their computer. When they get to that edge, we must reach across and pull


-----

##### them past it. There must be good reason for them not to stop short or delay or ponder. There must be urgency.
 At Disney World, at the parks’ closing times, they need to get everybody out quickly, for they have much work to do during the night, to be clean, fresh, restocked, and ready to re-open on time the next morning. If they offered transportation from the parks to the hotels, resorts, and parking lots until everyone was accommodated, people would stroll, loiter, find a bench to sit on until the crowd thinned. But there are posted and announced times for the last bus and the last boat. Thus there is urgency. (Further, they switch from gentle to up-tempo music, dim lights first in the back sections of the park, and have cast members with flashlights waving people along toward the exits.) They undoubtedly empty a park faster by at least an hour than if they created no urgency and let everybody meander out at their own chosen pace. Southwest Airlines figured out how to get their planes boarded much faster than other airlines by issuing colored boarding cards but not assigning seats, so each group is in a hurry—sometimes a stampede—to board, to get the best remaining seat. They create urgency. No, these are not marketing examples, but they are excellent demonstrations of the role that success or failure at creating urgency has in every kind of business.
 Direct marketing can often contextually provide opportunity to create urgency of immediate response. This can be done with limited supply, limit per household or buyer, the countdown clock you see on a direct response TV commercial or a webinar. If the product itself cannot be limited in supply, some bonus or premium attached to it certainly can be. In the seminar business, a place I live and work, we use the obvious devices like “early bird discounts” and extend-a-pay monthly installments tied to a deadline to motivate early registrations. But we also use bonuses, entries into prize drawings, backstage-pass opportunities, preferred seating, closed- door, limited-number luncheon tickets available only to the first 50 or first 100 to beat the deadline in order to create even more urgency. Retail mimics this with the “door buster sales” starting at 5 A.M., 6 A.M., or 7 A.M., and can increase that urgency with a gift for the first x-number to be there with noses pressed against the glass. Disney creates false limited supply by bringing a product like a movie DVD, in their language, “out of the Disney vault just until Halloween—then it goes back in the vault and can’t be had.” They periodically bring the same product out of the vault, run the same


-----

##### short promotion, return it to the vault, wait until consumers have forgotten about the promotion, and then trot it out again. All these examples are about creating a context for urgency of response.
 Direct marketing can also structurally provide opportunity for urgency of response. Anytime a group dynamic can be applied, a stampede effect seen, an “act now or lose out forever” reality displayed, a higher percentage of people presented with an offer will act than will under any other circumstances. People are motivated to buy what they will not be able to get if they don’t buy now, even when they would not buy now if relieved of that threat of loss. An auction is a prime example of this, and it has successfully been moved to online media—with live auctions and with timed auctions on sites like eBay. Putting people “live” into a seminar room where a persuasive speaker makes an offer from the stage, citing limited supply or discount or gift only for the first x-number, and having people see the stampede of earliest responders rushing to the product table at the back of the room is hard to trump by any other means and impossible to perfectly replicate by any other means; however, we’ve learned to come close with live online webinars, where viewers can see the earliest buyers’ comments, the “ticker” recording the purchase, the countdown clock for the closing of the shopping cart ticking away, and in live webinars, we can recognize by name the fast buyers. A direct mail, fax, and/or email sequence that begins by announcing that only 47 of the whatever-product will be sold (at this price, in this color, with this bonus, etc.) can, in its second piece, list the names of the first 18 buyers and show that only 29 remain, and in its third piece list the names of the 34 buyers and show that only 13 remain available.
 The most powerful urgency by exclusivity is having only one available. Neiman-Marcus does this every year, in the pages of its big Christmas catalog, with unique gift items and experiences that there is only one of. For example, in one year’s Christmas book, they offered a backstage experience and actual walk-on part one night in the Broadway musical Annie, for just $30,000.00; a Woody Trailer reconfigured as an elaborate portable bar, as the ultimate tailgate party vehicle, for $150,000.00; a private dinner for a party of ten with a gaggle of great celebrity chefs, for $250,000.00; and a trip for two to Paris and Geneva, including a visit to the Van Cleef & Arpels boutique and watch-making shop, and unique his and her watches, for


-----

##### $1,090,000.00. Will someone buy each of these one-of-a-kind gifts? Based on historical precedent with NM’s annual one-of-a-kind gifts, that answer is almost certainly yes. But, really, anybody can create one-of-a-kind gifts and experiences, or very limited availability equivalents. NM also garners an enormous amount of media attention and free publicity each year because of these extraordinary gift offers—something a local business could do at a local level just as easily.
 In B2B, in the advertising, consulting, and coaching fields, this is often done with geographic area exclusivity. A collection of licensed print ads and radio and TV commercials, a seat in a mastermind group, access to various resources becomes more desirable (and can be sold for a much higher price) when only one CPA in Pittsburgh can have it, thus the race is on and any delay may put it in the hands of your arch-competitor with you forever locked out than when it is available to any and all comers. A very successful program like this I helped a client, Burleson Seminars, develop is ExcellenceInOrthodontics.org. Only one orthodontist per geoarea gets the certification, use of the identity and logo, use of exclusive patient education books and videos, and holds a position in an online directory promoted to consumers by online and magazine advertising. They went from zero to a multimillion-dollar licensing business almost overnight.
 Certain businesses have actual scarcity. The people I acquire rare and first edition books from for my collection, Bauman Rare Books in New York, have actual scarcity and therefore real urgency. If they have a single copy of a first edition of a book I want, signed by its author, I know they are simultaneously notifying multiple clients of its availability and even a minute’s hesitation may let someone beat me to the purchase—so I must decide quickly and impulsively; I have no time to consider cost. Most businesses lacking such actual scarcity can, with creative thought, manufacture it, offer by offer by offer.
 So, how could an ordinary local restaurant and sports bar create an exclusive offer with enormous inherent urgency, publicity appeal to local media, and excitment to its customers? My prescription would be to rent a football celebrity, perhaps a local hero, and craft an afternoon and evening of activities around his presence. One offer, fairly standard: he’s there for a meet ‘n’ greet and photo opportunity during the Sunday afternoon games for any customer with autographed footballs and jerseys auctioned off


-----

##### during an hour within that time frame, with proceeds to a local charity—a limited number permitted in, pre-registration made possible, with or without ticket fee. Then, the exclusive offer: just 12 patrons can buy a ticket to go into the private dining room or roped-off section, have dinner with, watch the Sunday night game with, and hang out with the star, and get an autographed ball, jersey, and photo—at, say, $2,000.00 per ticket. With that, there’s massive urgency because there are only 12. A financial advisor, lawyer, auto dealer, etc., could use the same premise, renting the facility or joint-venturing with a restaurant owner, and still incorporating the local charity. The event itself would be directly profitable, reward good clients, and create new clients. The “halo effect” of the promotion to the business’ entire email, social media, and mailing lists is significant, while the opportunity for free—but valuable—publicity is profound. What’s most important to understand is that I took a business that is about “come on in” and eat, drink, and be merry, and converted it into a direct marketing business, with two different, specific offers, both with created and legitimate urgency.
 My friend, top direct-response copywriter John Carlton, always advises imagining your prospective customer or client as a gigantic somnambulant sloth, spread out on the couch, loathe to move his sleeping bulk, phone just out of reach. Your offer must force and compel him to move now. Your goal is immediate response. A plain vanilla, dull, mundane offer won’t do it.
