  What REALLY Leads To Success
        In America In The
        21st Century
  Relax! This is NOT going to be some gray-haired guy in a
  sweater lecturing you about how tough he had it growing
  up and telling you to "keep your nose to the grindstone."
 Who needs to hear any more of that?
  For starters, lets agree that we can disagree about what
  "success" is. It certainly means different things to different
  people. For one person, "success" may pop up pictures of
 a Corvette, a boat, a fancy house, maybe a business of
  your own, or a white collar, management career with a
  solid company, or all those things. For somebody else,
  just the thought of having to put on a shirt and tie and go
  to an office everyday is as frightening as a Stephen King
  novel. For somebody else, the emphasis may be on
  family, not money. So there's no point in trying to force fit
 any one idea of success onto you.
  However, we may be able to agree more easily on the
  opposites of success, on what we do NOT want our lives
  to become. For example, consider these checklist items:
    Not having enough money to pay bills
     Living paycheck to paycheck
   No money to save, invest, make a down-payment
    on a house

      Stuck in a dead-end job
      Passed over for raises or promotions
      Lack of job security
      Embarrassment when visiting your relatives
       or your spouse's relatives or in other social
       gatherings. . .embarrassment about your job
      Worry about the future in general
       Desire to do better but not sure what to do,
      what steps to take
      Lack of education or know-how about
      computers or other "technology" coming
       into your workplace
   Do ANY of these apply to you? Chances are, at least
    several do, just as they do to hundreds of thousands of
    other Americans, especially men and women in the 1 9 to
   30 age group. In fact, most people wind up going through
     their entire adult lives never solving any of these issues.
   They get stuck just "going with the flow."
   What we'd like to do here, in the beginning of this book,
      is to challenge you to take a completely fresh look at
   where you are, where you COULD go in life, where you'd
   LIKE to go in life, and how you can take control of that
    process.

  Change IS constant. Your physical body changes on a
  minute by minute, day by day, month by month, year by
  year basis. You know that you CAN exert considerable
  control over that, by, say, smoking or not smoking,
  exercising or not exercising, the foods you eat, and so on.
  Some people choose to do certain things deliberately, to
  control their weight, get and stay fit, and stay healthy.
  Others do not. But everybody changes physically.
  Change happens in every other aspect of living too, for
  everybody. Marriage. Divorce. Kids. Get a job. Lose a
  job. Buy a home. Move. Get older. Learn something
  new. Education. The list of changes is endless. You just
  cannot escape constant change. But you can make it
  work for you or let it work against you.
  You see, the biggest difference between farm animals
  and human beings is that we have the power of choice .
  The ability to make choices and decisions. Of all the
  creatures on earth, only human beings have been given
  this power. Will you use your power or ignore it? It may
  be time to STOP "going with the flow."
 "WHO — ME? CONTROL MY FUTURE! HOW?"
  Maybe you feel that you do not have the ability or
  opportunity to control your life and your future. These
  days, it seems everybody is a 'Victim." And in some
   circles, it's even popular to be "anti-achievement." You
   will undoubtedly hear people insisting that the deck is
  stacked against them to such a degree there's no point
   in trying to do anything. Or that "society" owes them a job

```

-----

```
    remember, though, that every aspect of life operates on
   Cause And Effect — for every Effect or result or outcome,
    there is a Cause. 'Victim" thinking or "it's no use" thinking
   becomes a Cause in and of itself. What kind of Effect do
    you think it has to have?
   You may very well have some disadvantages to
    overcome. Maybe you grew up in a broken home or a
     terrible neighborhood. Maybe you were abused. Maybe
    you don't even have a high school education. Or maybe
    you don't read very well, can't do math, you're shy
    whatever. Each person's obstacles appear very large to
    them. But here are two absolutely inarguable truths :
      First, regardless of what your particular obstacles may be,
    there are many people who have had those exact same
    obstacles — or worse ones — who have overcome those
    obstacles to become successful in life. The fact that
    others have overcome your obstacles is proof positive
     that you can too.
    Second, if you continue to DO the things you've always
    done, you can only expect to get what you've always got.
    Whatever change happens, will work against you.
    Opportunities will pass you by. Only by first changing your
   own actions and behavior can you create other desirable
    changes in your life.
    So, lets talk about some of the very basic, fundamental
     things you can DO to get a grip on what kind of success
      in life you want and how you can go about getting it. We
      call these: THE FIVE ESSENTIAL FOUNDATIONS OF
   SUCCESS IN LIFE.

    'The Cheshire Cat in 'Alice In Wonderland'
  Foundation #1 is: Positive Directions . What does that
  mean? Well, first "direction" means where you are
  headed, where you are going, where you want to go.
  Here's a shocker: Most people spend more time planning
  a weekend activity with friends or a vacation than they do
  planning their futures! In fact, most people never really
  THINK about "directions" at all. One writer in the field of
  self-improvement once spent a whole morning on a busy
   city sidewalk, stopping people on their way to work, and
  asking them why they were going to wori<. Why are you
  going to wori< today? The answers he heard most were:
                * To put food on the table
                * To pay my bills
               * Because I have to
               * Everybody else does
  These are all terrible reasons for getting up every
  morning and going to work! Yes, terrible. Why terrible?
  Well, if one of the above is your only reason, how are you
  going to feel about your job and yourself after ten years
  of that? Twenty years? Thirty years? Probably pretty
  awful. You'll feel trapped. Bored. Wasted. Stuck in a rut
 — and the only difference between a rut and grave is the
   rut is open at both ends!
  Actually, going to wori< should be a means of accomplishing
  many other appealing, rewarding goals. Buying your

                                         limitation
  — re-building classic cars, fishing in all the great rivers and
     lakes throughout America, whatever. Developing a career.
   And so on. These are all "directions."
     "Positive directions" means choosing directions that are
    most likely to lead you to the kind of life and lifestyle you
     want.
    Just for example, one direction you could take is spending
       all your free time hanging out at the local pub, watching
     sports, playing pool, drinking beer, and spending all your
   money that way That is a "direction." It is going to take
    you toward a destination. It is a "cause" that will have a
     predictable "effect."
   OR, taking two nights a week of your free time' and using
    those to go to classes or seminars or the library to learn
   some new skill and setting aside even a small amount of
   money each paycheck, this too is a "direction." Which is
     "positive" and which is "negative"? Which is most likely to
    lead "somewhere," which most likely to lead "nowhere"?
     Weil, you certainly know that without being told! But what
    you may not have given a lot of thought to is the idea of
     sitting down and CHOOSING certain "destinations,"
     things you want to accomplish, things you want to have,
    and then DECIDING on certain positive directions most
      likely to lead there.
    You can do that.
    Regardless of where you are right now, you can start
    doing this.

  these onto bigger pieces of paper, on a pad or a
  notebook, or use these as is and write in the book. Either
  way, try something: lock out the world, get into a quiet,
   private place for an hour or so, no distractions, no TV, no
  CD player, just you and these pages. Put your pencil or
  pen in hand. Let your mind slip into gear. And, without
  being critical. . .without worrying about the "how to's". . .jot
  down the answers to the questions. Make the lists. You
  may find this to be a very exciting, if challenging
  experience.
   THERE IS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN
  EDUCATION AND INCOME, EDUCATION AND
     OPPORTUNITY IN AMERICA.
   YOU CANNOT "BEAT THIS SYSTEM."
  Foundation #2 is: Education . Certain things are "facts of
    life." The Law of Gravity, for example, is a fact of life. Any
  object you drop out of your hand will fall to the ground.
  What goes up must come down. You are actually a tiny
   bit shorter at the end of the day than you are each
  morning, after lying flat all night, as an effect of the Law
   of Gravity. And there is absolutely nothing you can do to
  change or "beat" this fact of life: gravity. Join a gang, get
  a gun, beat up somebody, the people who do these
  things canNOT escape this fact of life we call gravity. The
   richest men and women in the world canNOT escape this
   fact of life. The most talented athletes canNOT (Sure,
  Michael Jordan pushed the limits of gravity. But he could
   not escape it. His most spectacular leaps always ended
   with his feet coming back down to the floor.) A fact of life
    is a fact of life, period.

```

-----

```
    these facts of life, but you are affected by them
    nonetheless. You can ignore them and you WILL suffer as
   a result. Or you can accept them and then change
    directions and do things to make these facts of life benefit
    you.
    Here are the facts:
    Fact#1 : Government studies and statistics clearly
    demonstrate that people with high school diplomas earn
    as much as $8.000.00 MORE per year than do people
    without high school diplomas. In a 40 year working career,
    $8,000.00 MORE per year equals $320.000.00[ .] .
   enough to pay off a home mortgage and buy a second
   home, too. . .enough to put into an investment and retire.
    Also, the number of good jobs that you just cannot get
    without a high school diploma keep increasing.
    Fact#2: Above a high school education, Career Training
   and a Career Diploma are known to make an income
    difference of ANOTHER $25.000.00 to $100.000.00 OR
   MORE over a person's working career.
    Fact#3: Above that, an Associate Degree is known to
    equate to about $10,000.00 a year more in income. . .as
   much as $400.000.00 over a working lifetime.
    To make this simple: more education equals more income
   and more varied career options and opportunities.
    Now, knowing these facts, if you do not have a high
    school diploma, what "direction" seems obvious to you as
    the most "positive direction" you could choose for
     yourself, as soon as possible?

```

-----

```
  most "positive direction" you could choose for yourself, as
  soon as possible?
   Or, knowing these facts, if you have both a high school
  diploma and some specialized career training, what
   "direction" seems obvious to you as the most "positive
   direction" you could choose for yourself, as soon as
   possible?
  You can clearly see that
   getting a high school "If a man empties his
   diploma, then getting wallet into his head,
   career training, then no one can take it
   getting an associate from him."
  degree are all very, - Benjamin Franklin
   very positive directions.
   For more information
  on this, see Chapter 7.
       IT IS DIFFICULT TO SOAR LIKE
    AN EAGLE IF YOU HANG OUT WITH
    THE BUZZARDS AND CHICKENS
         ALL THE TIME.
   Foundation #3 is: Association . There is a 'principle of
   success' called 'The Power Of Positive ASSOCIATION."
      It basically means that you either hold yourself back or
   improve yourself based on the people you hang out with
   the most, because their values, ideas and directions are
   always influencing your own.

```

-----

```
   good relationship with your parents or parent, brothers
   and sisters, and your family life has included helpful
    values, then you DO have an advantage, there's no doubt
   about that — and you should value it and continue it. If
   you do not have this advantage, you will have to work
    harder on your own thinking, your own values and your
   own decisions.
   As we become adults, though, "peers" become just as
    important or more important than 'family" in this area of
    association. Surely you've heard about "peer pressure." It
   can be 'positive' or 'negative' — helpful in going in the
    directions you want to go or distracting from going in
   those directions. Here are very tough questions to ask
    yourself about the friends and other people you hang
   around with most and listen to most: Are these people
    going in the directions I want to go? Do they have ideas,
    experience and encouragement to share that can help
   me move in the directions I want to go?
        If you can't honestly answer "yes" to those questions, then
   you probably need to make some changes in your friends
  — who you spend time with, who you listen to. You may
   need to get involved in yery different activities, where you
     will get to meet new and different people.
   Everybody needs a "support group." Your "support group"
   can include family members, friends, neighbors, co-
    workers, a mentor on the job, teachers and coaches. It
   must feature people who share your directions or who
   have already traveled successfully in the directions you
   want to go.

     BASE SITTING ON THE BENCH.
    YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE GAME!
   Foundation #4 is: Beginning[ .] There is a certain process to
   success, an order of steps you have to go through, bases
  you have to run in order. And to begin, you have to get into
   the game. How do you get into the "game of success"?
     It all seems to start with Gainful Employment. A job. Even
      if it is not the job you want. Not the job you've prepared
    for. Not a job that seems like it naturally points toward the
   kind of job you want. Any job is better than no job.
  Employment is better than unemployment. The way you
   get into the game is with a job.
             When you go and apply for a
                     "better job," what will you be
    "Begin somewhere. asked about? Well, one set
   You cannot build a of questions will center
    reputation on what around your education. The
   you intend to do." next set of questions will

    (Famous syndicated experience. And many smart
    newspaper gossip employers will be as
     columnist) interested in how you did
                 whatever job you had than
                what the job itself was.
  Comedian and movie-maker Woody Allen once said,
  "50% of success is showing up." He may not have been
   far off. One study of business managers, executives and

    every job applicant:
                      1. He shows up.
                 2. He shows up on time.
            3. He shows up ready and able to work.
    Well, ANY job gives you the opportunity to demonstrate
    these three things, and establish a reputation for these
    three things. If you ARE cun-ently gainfully employed,
    don't make the mistake of drifting into negative thinking
    about that job. . .of just going through the motions or
    worse, failing to show up, show up on time, show up
    ready and able to wori<. The best way to get a better job
      is to out-perfomn the one you have! If you are not now
    employed, re-think your position on this. Maybe it would
    be better to get in the game with ANY job than to sit on the
    sidelines waiting for the right job.
   "SCHOOL IS NEVER OUT FOR THE PRO."
                      - Cavett Robert
    Foundation #5 is: Lifelong Learning[ .] Many people have
    the idea that once they graduate from high school, they
    can "stop learning." No more school books. No more
     study. This is reflected in the fact that the majority of adults
    get ALL their news and information from television (not
     reading), that the majority of adults NEVER visit the public
      library, and about half of all adults NEVER go into a
    bookstore. Unfortunately, many people have learned how
     to be taught, but have not learned to enjoy learning on
     their own.

   about it, then pick another one and do the same, one after
   another. They tend to continually read and improve in
    their own career area.
      If you haven't visited a public library in a while, and you do
   so with an open, curious mind, you may be very
   pleasantly surprised at everything that is available for you
   there — all free of charge! You will find every imaginable
   magazine, both current and back issues. Books on every
   conceivable topic. There are easy-to-use computers you
   can "ask" for help in assembling information about any
    topic. There are books to help you in choosing careers,
   preparing resumes, getting ready for job interviews,
   learning certain skills, even managing your money. And
   the library staff members are usually very eager to help
   and very patient with newcomers. This is a great
   environment for you to get comfortable with and use
   frequently as an adult.

     What Holds You Back?
    What Moves You Forward?
  We often think about "external forces" holding us back or
   moving us fonA^ard. Things outside ourselves and, to
    varying degrees, outside our control. Some of these
    "external forces" include:
              - "I grew up in a bad neighborhood"
               - "I don't have a car to get to w^ork"
                   - "My boss doesn't like me"
           - 'The economy's very bad here in my town"
   What we'd like to explore a bit in this Chapter are Internal
    forces" that hold us back or move us forward. Often, the
    external forces are not as influential and powerful in reality
   as they are in our own minds. After all, ifs comfortable to
   blame other people or circumstances beyond our control for
    things we're not happy or proud about. Unfortunately,
    people learn 'The Blanrie Game" early in life — as kids, 'tie
    started it!". . ."Bobby made me do it." etc. — and then carry
    that into adult life, even though it is nriore of a handicap than
   a help. Only by honestly examining the internal forces can
   you begin to really control your present and your future.
   One such internal force is a thing psychologists call "Self-
    Image." This literally means the image or picture you hold
     in your mind about yourself. Lots of things contribute to
    the self-image. Things your parents or other family
   members said repeatedly about you and to you as you
   were growing up. Things your friends or co-workers now
                          make

```

```
      It is said that you cannot out-perform your self-image.
   Your self-image serves sort of like a thermostat in your
  house — the thennostat limits how hot it gets in the
  summer or how cold it gets in the winter; the self-image
    limits what you might attempt and what you might
   accomplish, even what you might earn. Consider the
   person who sees herself as "shy". . ."not good at
   persuading people". . ."can't sell". . ."the quiet type." She
  may never even attempt speaking out and presenting her
   ideas at work or leading a committee or task force at work
   or in her church. But is she really so limited?
   Probably only by her self-image. You see, there really is no
   such thing as a 'tK)m" leader or 'lDom" salesperson or 't)om"
   communicator There really is no such thing as a genetically shy
   person. These are all acquired beliefs and learned behaviors.
    In her childhood, she may have had strict and protective
   parents, and constantly heard such things as "speak only
  when spoken to" and "don't talk to strangers." Maybe one
   of her close childhood playmates was very outgoing and
   aggressive, so that friend always "led" and she always
   'lollowed." Through this "programming," she built a self-
  image early, as a "shy person." Then she begins choosing
  what she will do and won't do based on this idea, so her
   experience reinforces her self-image. Before long, she
  has drawn a line in the sand across which she tries never
   to cross. If no one or no thing ever shoves her across that
    line, she may never discover what is often true: As an
   adult, she has abilities and talents unknown to her.

    HOW TO DISCOVER YOUR HIDDEN
     TALENTS AND NEW INTERESTS
  When a person says "I'm not much of a reader" or "I don't
     like to read," often the truth is that he never learned to
   read well and, since school, has let what reading skills he
    did have get rusty. Further, he was always forced to read,
   so he naturally resists it.
   Most adults share this experience: There is some food,
   maybe a vegetable, you hated as a kid, haven't eaten in
   a long time, and absolutely believe you don't like. For one
   reason or another, you taste it for the first time in years
   and discover that, now, it tastes good to you!
   This same kind of experience can happen with anything,
    including this example: reading. j
   When a person says something like "I'm no good with J
   computers. Its just too complicated for me," often the truth ^
     is that they simply lack information, knowledge, training
   and assistance about that particular subject or skill.

  he was verbalizing part of his self-image, describing the
  picture he canied in his mind about himself.)
  One day, somebody pointed out to him how much playing
  pool has to do with — geometry! This caused him to look
  at the game of pool in an entirely new way. Then he got
  interested in it. He tried playing, with this new knowledge.
  And, to his surprise, he discovered that his understanding
  of the angles made up for less-than-terrific physical
  dexterity. He could play well and he enjoyed it. Then, by
  playing regularly, his physical skills naturally improved
  too. After a year, he was routinely beating his friends and
  started entering tournaments.
  The way to uncover your own hidden talents and interests
   is simply to experiment. Instead of saying 'Thafs just the
  way I am," say "I'll try that."
 HOW TO STRENGTHEN SKILLS OR ABILITIES
 When you decide to develop some skill or ability,
  especially one that may be new and relatively unfamiliar
  or uncomfortable, you may benefit from some or all of the
  five ways top athletes and businesspeople alike
  strengthen their skills:
                 1. Visualization
                2. Affirmation
                3. Education
                4. Association
                5. Action
  VISUALIZATION means forming and holding pictures in

```

```
     practice. And, in mental practice, athletes practice perfectly.
    Basketball players, for example, have proven they can
    improve their success at shooting baskets from the foul line
     just by sitting in a quiet room for an hour, "imagining"
    themselves standing on the foul line and shooting one perfect
    basket after another. The imagination IS a powerful thing.
     Ironically, as a kid, you may have been accused of being
    a "day-dreamer." Yet the truth is that "day-dreaming" has
   a place and serves a constructive purpose.
     Let's say that you feel weak in communication skills and
    dread going on job interviews. You might build a "mental
    movie" of you going on a job interview, getting along very
    well with the interviewer, being calm and relaxed,
    answering the questions brilliantly, and getting hired
     instantly. Dr. Maxwell Maltz, an early pioneer in self-image
    psychology*, called this using 'The Theater In Your Mind."
    To make this "mental movie" realistic, you would consult a
    couple books on interviewing skills, to learn techniques,
    and you would make up or get a list of questions most
    interviewers would ask, and use those questions in your
    "mental movie." Once built and run, your "mental movie"
      is stored in memory and can be recalled at will.
     Visualization, then, is simply the re-running of this "mental
    movie" over and over and over again.
    Another term for all this is "synthetic experience."
    Synthetic means imitation or substitute — for example,
    cotton is "real" fabric, a polyester-cotton blend is called a
     "synthetic" fabric because it perfectly imitates the real
     thing. Now here's a very interesting thing about how your

```

```
   real experience. For example, your blood pressure might
  go up and you might get a severe headache from
  worrying about taking a big test, just as your blood
  pressure would go up and you would get a headache
  whenever you actually had to take the test. That's
  because the subconscious mind can't tell the difference
  between the synthetic experience (worry) or the real one
  (taking the test), so it tells the body to react the same way
  both times. Once you understand all that, you can make
     it wori< to your benefit.
  Go back to the job interview. If you've had that interview
  as synthetic experience enough times, over and over, and
  remained perfectly calm, relaxed, confident and had
  success each time, when the real thing starts — the
  actual job interview — your subconscious mind says to
   itself: "Hey, I remember this. Been here. Done this. I know
  exactly what I'm supposed to do and how this guy's body
   is supposed to react." Then the subconscious mind sends
  out its directives to the rest of you: "Relax," it tells the
  nervous system. It triggers the memory for the best
  responses to the questions. It re-creates the already
  rehearsed event.
  AFFIRMATION is another means of "programming" the
  subconscious mind. Sometimes this is called "self-talk."
  Most people talk to themselves all the time, constantly,
  though usually silently. And most such self-talk
  unfortunately reinforces negative self-image beliefs. Here's
  an example: John locks his keys in the car. To himself, he
  says: "You idiot!" Then: "I can't seem to remember
  anything. I'm such a screw-up." John has translated the
  incident into an indictment, a criticism of himself. Its

```

-----

```
    things everyday, yet, in self-talk, you probably do not praise
    yourself for doing those things. But make a mistake, and
    you're all over yourself, like your worst enemy!
   The reason that is so harmful is that your subconscious
   mind accepts cumulative affirmations (the same
    affirmation heard and said repeatedly) as a "command,"
    then it does everything in its power to fulfill the command.
        If you tell it that you are clumsy over and over again, it will
    exert its control over your physical body to literally make
   you even clumsier.
   The good news is that you can tell it something you want
    to be over and over again, and it will work on making that
   command a reality. Now this is not "magic." It won't do
   much by itself. But as a reinforcement tool, it can be very
    powerful. Let's say you're always late and have decided
    to change that about yourself. You have chosen a new
    direction; you are going to be a punctual person. Your
    affirmations might be:
             1. I am the kind of person who
         always shows up on time.
            2. Being on time and reliable is
          very important tome.
            3. I value and respect my own
          time and others' time, so
                 I honor my commitments.
   You might want to write these down on a 3x5 [card] until
   you memorize them. Then you should say them[ out][ loud]
    at least several times a day. Repeat them[ out][ loud][ or]

```

-----

```
   But, just saying these affirmations and doing nothing else
   will have a very limited effect. But saying these affirmations
  while also DOING certain things to improve your on time
   behavior; setting all your clocks and watch 15 minutes
  ahead, starting to use an appointment calendar, picking
  out the day's clothes the night before; the combination of
   Affirmations and Actions can be very dramatic.
   Incidentally, today's "sports psychologists," relied on by
   virtually every pro team, individual pro athletes, and Olympic
   athletes all use "affirmations" as one of their tools. Athletes
  who get in a slump — the baseball player who stops hitting,
   the football player who starts fumbling the ball, the golfer
  who starts slicing — all tend to "get down on themselves"
   with negative, critical self-talk. And the more of that they do,
   the worse the problem gets. The kind of constructive
   affirmations we just discussed have been proven helpful in
   turning such situations around and getting these athletes out
   of their slumps. If ifs good enough for multi-million dollar a
  year pro athletes, maybe its something you should learn
  more about and experiment with too.
    (*lf visualization, affirmation and similar techniques interest you,
  a good place to begin leaming more is with Dr. Maxwell Maltz'
   original book, Psycho-Cybemetics,' which you can easily obtain
   at the public library or almost any bookstore.
  EDUCATION or INFORMATION is the next important
   tool. Simply put, the more you know about something, the
   less intimidating or difficult it is to deal with.
  Think about skydiving, for example. To someone who
  has never done it, and knows nothing about it except

```

-----

```
                         let's say you to do it, for
   one reason or another — maybe you lost a bet! — and
   you had time to prepare. How could you reduce the
    fear and improve your chances, not only of survival,
    but of doing it well and enjoying it?
   One thing that would help would be seeing how the
    parachutes themselves are "rigged" or assembled.
    This is a painstaking process with many checks and
    double-checks. Then you could read a book, maybe
   watch a video about skydiving. Then you could go to a
    "skydiving school" — required in almost every place
    before you are allowed to jump. At the "school," you
    learn how to properly exit the plane, position your body,
    count, pull the cord, navigate and land. You practice
   each of these things over and over, with the help of a
    very experienced instructor. Finally, on your first jump,
    there's a safety cord from your chute to the instructor,
     in the plane, so even if you should 'freeze up' and not
     pull your cord on time, he'll pull it for you. As you went
    through all of this, chances are excellent that your
    fears and worries were diminished and your interests
    increased. That's the way the human mind works.
    Of course, you may have NO interest whatsoever in
    skydiving. But you can benefit from this same "process"
    with any skill you want to learn, improve or master. By
    exposing yourself to as much information about it as
    possible, your confidence and your competence will
    automatically get stronger.

    in two ways, one skill. We talked about
   by reading, and association in the previous
    the other by Chapter, too. If you want to

                     or better than you are at
                     that thing. If you bowl, for
  example, you'll never get better if the only people you
  bowl with are less skilled than you are. To get better as a
  bowler, you'd bowl with people slightly better than you are,
  who would challenge you, from whom you could learn by
  observing.
  ACTION is the fifth tool. None of the above tools are of
  much value unless and until you take action on your
  thoughts and ideas. And, incidentally, most people drop
  the ball right here, over and over again, throughout their
   entire lives. The world is full of people who will tell you
  about the "great idea" they had, did nothing about, then
  saw someone else turn it into a successful product or
  business. Procrastination — the putting off of doing
  something — is the universal language of the POOR!
     If you study successful people in any field, but especially
   in the business world, in terms of careers, you'll quickly
  notice that they have a tendency to quickly follow
  decisions with actions. You become what you DO, not
  what you think or say, and not what others think or say
  about you.

    How To Manage Your Time,
      To Get Ahead In Life
    At age 20, age 40 seems as far away as a distant planet,
    and age 60 seems inconceivable. At age 40, people
    wonder what the heck happened to all that time between
    age 20 and 40! And at age 60, most adults, sadly, look
    back and see how they wasted and squandered time [—]
    and wish they could do it all over again. Which they can1.
   The "breakthrough idea" to living your life differently and
     getting much more out of your life is "goal-setting."
        If you've never set and systematically achieved goals, the
    idea may be frightening and intimidating. Or you may think
         it is too "pin-stripe suit-y"
     for you. Something other "Ask, and it shall be
    people do, but why should given you; seek and
    you? Or it may strike you ye shall find; knock
    as dull and boring. These and it shall be op>ened
    reactions are natural and unto you."

   to the nearest batting cage, pay our money, get a bucket
   of balls, and let's play "Blind Baseball." The hitter can try
   to hit the balls only while blindfolded.
   He's probably not going to get very many hits.
  Going through life without goals is like playing "Blind Life."
  You are a wandering, meandering soul, bumping into
   things, reacting to things, at the mercy of every little
  breeze or bump in the road. Setting up goals for yourself
    is much like taking the blindfold off.
   Here's another explanation for why goal-setting works.
   Engineers have determined that the weight, per square
   inch, is actually greater from the average woman's single
   spike heel than from an elephant's foot. This is because
    all the woman's weight and power is focused in that tiny
   spike; the elephant's is spread out (diffused) over a much
   broader surface. This is like the power of focus. Or
  perhaps you remember the little experiment you probably
  had to do in junior high science. Focus the sun's rays
   through a magnifying glass and start a fire. The sun's rays
  do not start fires normally, because the heat is diffused
  over a large area. But focus those rays, and you will start
  a fire. When you direct all your **weighf ; energy, creativity,
  power and effort on achieving a very specific goal, you
   benefit from the power of focus.

   Forms are provided at the end of this Chapter to engage
   you in the goal-setting process. You'll see that we start
    with LONG-RANGE GOAL IDEAS, for 3 to 5 years away,
    with the process divided into 8 categories of living:
        1. Careers
       2. Money
        3. Social — Friendships
       4. Love Relationships — Family
       5. Physical — Health
       6. Mental — Intellectual
        7. Spiritual — Philosophical
        8. Recreation — Fun
    Next, we move to MEDIUM-RANGE GOALS, for 1 to 3
    years. Next, SHORT-RANGE: 3 to 12 months. Finally
   'THIS MONTH" — what can be done '1his month" to
   move toward the goals you set.
    HOW TO GOVERN THE WAY YOU
     INVEST YOUR TIME WITH GOALS
    For many, the idea of "investing" time is a new way of
    looking at things.

  maybe you have to be on the job a certain number of
  hours a day It takes a certain number of minutes to drive
   to and from work each day. Time to eat. To sleep. When
  you take all that out, you may have only about 5 or 6
  hours a day of time you truly control. Still, that's a lot. Five
  hours a day is 1 ,825 hours a year. Call that *YOUR TIME."
  Most people let all of this 'YOUR TIME" slip away. Sort of
  evaporate, like a glass of water evaporates into the air as
  the day goes on. At the end of a month or a year, people
   can't really point to many desired changes in any category
   of living resulting from the use of this 'YOUR TIME." In a
  very real sense, they just "spent" that time.
  And, often, they let others detemriine how it would be
   spent. A buddy drops by, says 'Let's shoot hoops," you
  say yes, and go shoot hoops for three hours. There's
  nothing wrong with that, of course. In fact, you might set
  a goal to shoot hoops or othen/vise get at least 5 hours a
  week of physical exercise. So there's nothing wrong with
   that act itself. But over time, if you casually let others
  spend all YOUR TIME for you, on impulse, haphazardly,
  you will probably find yourself disappointed with your
  progress in life.
   'Time is the coin of your life. It is the only
    coin you have and only you can determine how
      it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other
   people spend it for you."

   When you look at your goals, you'll see there are ways
   you could deliberately "invest" certain amounts of your
    time to move toward achieving them. The difference
   between "spending" and "investing" is that when you
    "spend," you have little to show for it after the fact; when
   you "invest," you have something of tangible value to
   show for it after the fact. There's nothing wrong with
    "spending" a lot of YOUR TIME, but don't you think it'd be
    smart to "invest" some of it?
       THE MAGIC POWER OF
       JUST ONE HOUR A DAY
    Earl Nightingale, one of the most respected authorities of
      all in the field of human potential and self-improvement,
   became convinced that if a person dedicated just one
    hour a day to study one particular subject or skill, he
   would be a world class expert in that subject in less than
    three years.
    Imagine doing nothing but watching videos of great
    players shooting foul shots, studying the mechanics of
    shooting from the line in slow motion, and practicing
    shooting from the line for one hour everyday, every single
    day, for three years. You'd probably get pretty darned
   good at it, even if, in the beginning, you had never
   touched a basketball, watched a basketball game or

      To Having A Productive Day
            Every Day
  Back during America's Industrial Revolution, the top
   executive running Andrew Carnegie's steel mills was a
  man named Charles Schwab. Mr. Schwab was always
   looking for ways to improve "productivity" — in the mills,
  as well as his own. A consultant named Ivy Lee offered
  Schwab an idea to improve his productivity, and told
  Schwab he could pay him whatever he thought it was
   worth, after trying it for a month. The idea he provided was
   incredibly simple: Each night, write down a list of the ten
  most important things you want to get done the next day,
    in order of their importance, 1,2,3. Then force yourself to
   get Number One done before moving on to Number Two.
  Check off each item as you finish it.
   After trying this simple idea for a month, Schwab
   reportedly sent Lee a check for $25,000.00. Why not try it
   yourself for 30 days and see how valuable you think it is?

   How To Manage Your Money,
      To Get Ahead In Life
  MONEY gives most people a whole lot of trouble! There
     is a lot of unhappiness that comes from not having
   enough of it. Misuse or excessive use of credit, for many,
     is like the use of drugs; it temporarily feels good and
   masks some pain, but that's only temporary; 'Ihe morning
    after," there's more pain.
   Government statistics indicate that the majority of adults
   go through their entire lives without ever figuring out how
    to master money.
   During the average working person's life, well over a
    million to several million dollars will run through his
    fingers. You'd think: Hey, some of that has to stick! But
    at retirement age, after forty plus years of work, fewer
   than 5% of the people have enough money saved,
    invested and in assets to produce a decent retirement
   income. 95% are dependent on their measly Social
    Security check for part or all of their basic needs. And if
   you gathered a random sampling of those 95%'ers
    together, you'd find they had one thing in common:
    surprise at reaching that age with so little to show for it
    financially.
                       i
   Of course, ifs very hard to think that far ahead now. But
   you cannot wait until you are 50 either! There are certain
   "Money Habits" that make you a master over money,
    instead of a slave to it. The sooner you put those habits to
   work for you, the better.

  People who work for low wages and have very little
  money tend to "blow" what little they have left after paying
                       for necessities, like rent and

   his behavior keeps applying the habit to the bigger
   paycheck. And the bigger paycheck after that. As hard as
      it may be for you to imagine, there are people earning

   STILL saying to themselves: "I've got so little left here
   after paying my essential bills, I might as well just blow it!"
       The Only Law About Money
      You Ever Really Need To Know
     To Escape From Financial Prison!
   Going through life paycheck to paycheck, using up all
   your money even before the next paycheck, is like locking
   yourself up in financial prison and throwing away the key.
   This negative cycle MUST be broken before you can ever
   hope to get ahead. You break it by obeying 'The Only Law
   About Money You Ever Really Need To Know." This "Law"
   requires a habit that, over time, changes the lives of all
  who use it for the better. At first, the results may seem
    insignificant. But it is the habit itself that leads to big
   differences. The Law is: Pay Yourself First.
   Out of every dollar that comes to you, in your paycheck or
   from any and every other source, expected or
   unexpected, you take a pre-determined percentage off
   the top and put that aside as an "untouchable," as
   savings, BEFORE you pay any other bill. You might
   choose just 1%: from a dollar, a penny. You might choose
  5%; from each dollar, a nickel. But "lock in" on that
   percentage and keep this promise to yourself no matter
   what.

  don't blame you for being doubtful. Fortunately you don't
  have to believe this law makes any sense for it to pay
  dividends. All you have to do is obey it. If you will try this
   idea, and stick with it absolutely, for just three months, you
   will see for yourself how your attitudes about money AND
  your actual financial situation almost miraculously
  changes for the better.
  Here is a 'bottom line': You must change the way you
  THINK about money before the actual money situations
   of your life will change.
       Poverty-Inducing Habit #2:
          Slavery To Debt
  Our parents and, certainly our grandparents lived very,
  very differently than we do with regard to credit versus
  cash. If our grandparents decided to buy a new washing
  machine, they didn't pop it on a credit card, get it the same
  day they decided they wanted it, and pay for it month after
  month for years. Instead, they saved up money until they
  had enough to go buy it.
  Today we are very much into "instant gratification." We
  want it — and we want it NOW.
  Well, for certain purposes, modern credit is a wonderful
   thing. But misused and overused, it can literally make you
  a SLAVE to it.
  Most people do not understand the true cost of credit.
  Take shows

    in just two years, it costs you $180.00 for the $500.00. In
    five years, your cost doubles. This means, if you finance,
   say a $500.00 stereo system on a credit card or plan, that
   stereo may cost you $680.00, $770.00, even $950.00
   before you get it paid for. If you do that a lot, say with
   $5,000.00 worth of credit instead of $500.00, if II cost you
   at least $900.00 a year just to keep the interest current. If
   you go through life paying double what you should for
   everything you buy, it stands to reason you're not going to
   win the money game! A sure sign that you're losing badly,
   by the way, is making only the "minimum monthly
  paymenf on your credit cards.

   Nowhere! (An ordinary savings account may pay only 3%

   debt. The chart below shows how paying just $50 a month

   possible. If you are deeply in debt and unable to make
   even the minimum payments due on all your bills every
   month, you should probably get some professional
   assistance. Legitimate credit counselors can help you
   work with your creditors and devise a plan you can live
    with, to get your debts under control. Look in your city's
   Yellow Pages under "Credif and find "Credit Counselors"
   or another reputable credit counseling and assistance
   organization. If in doubt of which organization to call,
   check with your local Better Business Bureau, your bank
  manager or your family accountant for a referral. If you're
   just mildly in debt, you will be able to reverse the process
   without help. One way or another, escape from high
   interest debt is a very smart financial move.
    In fact, here are the three steps to end slavery to debt:
   Step#1 : STOP doing whatever has gotten you into debt in
   the first place . If it is buying things on impulse, stop doing
       it. Lock your credit cards in a drawer and only take them
   out for a carefully thought-out purchase if you must, but
   don't carry them with you all the time. If ifs living way
   beyond your means, stop that. Pull back. Do without if you
   must for a while. Delay major purchases. If there's a more
   serious problem, like drinking or gambling, get help. There
    is no shame in getting help for a problem. The shame is
    in refusing to honestly face your problems.
   Step#2: Devise a plan to systematically reduce your
   burden of debt . After you pay yourself first, then take a
   pre-determined percentage of your paycheck and any
   and all other monies that come to you and use that to
   reduce debt. If you happen to own your own home or

```
   may be able to use the equity in your home to get a debt
    consolidation loan, pay off a bundle of the high interest
    debts, and have a lower interest (ie. lower cost) loan in its
    place. If you do this, though, you MUST avoid running up
    the credit cards all over again — even if you have to cut
   them in half and close the accounts to do it.
   Step#3: Avoid taking on new debt unless it definitely
   IMPROVES your financial situation , such as incurring
   debt to buy a home and stop renting, or further your
    education, or move to a new city to take a better job, or to
   take advantage of a carefully chosen business
    opportunity.
        Poverty-Inducing Habit #3:
       Not Increasing Your Value In
          The Marketplace
    Just about everybody WANTS a bigger paycheck. And
   most people WANT better career opportunities. There's
    certainly nothing wrong with that, and a whole lot right with
        it, but 'SA/ants" alone won't get much accomplished.
    Actually, the size of most paychecks, and the
    opportunities that become available to different people,
    are largely determined by a concept called "value."
   Think about the pro athlete, for example. A player has a
   phenomenal season, he plays a very important role in
    getting his team to the championship, and his popularity
    increases, which means more ticket sales, higher ticket
    prices and more television exposure for the team. That
    athlete has increased his value through PERFORMANCE.

```

```
   paycheck. He may not get it instantly, though. His contract
    with his team may limit his raises. But one thing is certain:
        If he continues to improve his value through improved
   performance, in another year or two or three at the most,
   when he negotiates his next contract with that team (his
    current employer) or moves to a new team (next
    employer), he WILL get a much bigger paycheck that
    reflects his increased value. But this is very, very
    important: Note that the increase in his value comes
  BEFORE the increase in his paycheck. 4
   Here are the four main ways people can increase their
   value in the marketplace, to cun-ent or next employers:
           1. Performance
           2. Experience
           3. Education
          4. Combinations of 1, 2 and 3
    Obviously, we all have room
    to improve our on-the-job

```
   only repeat the same one year of experience twenty
   times. That does not appreciably increase their value. But
       if, with each passing month, you are learning a new skill,
   getting better at the job, even finding ways to do things
   more efficiently and effectively, then experience counts.
  One great mistake, by the way, is to presume that you are
    entitled to more money just because of the number of
   years on the job. The idea that an employee keeps getting
   raise after raise only because of the number of years of
   employment is as out-dated as the Model-T automobile
   great grandpa started with a hand crank; that worthed
  when we had a "closed economy." Today, just about every
   industry and business is part of a "global economy," and
   companies cannot compete in that environment if they
   pay people a lot more than a particular job itself is worth.
      If they can get the job done right for $1 0.00 an hour, they
   cannot justify paying you $20.00 to do that same job,
   even if you've been there for twenty years. You may not
    like that, but that's the way things really are.
   Education is the great income MULTIPLIER! Education
   absolutely, definitely, inarguably increases your
   mari<etplace value.
   These days, you need a PLAN for increasing your value.
  Odds are excellent that someone starting out, say 1 8 to
   25 years of age, will not only change employers but will
   change careers at least three to five times during his
   working lifetime. Computers will play an ever-increasing
    role in everyone's lives. And roughly one-third of all
   adults will, at some time, choose to start and operate a
   part-time, home-based business of one kind or another.

    The Three Prosperity Building Habits
   Just as there are habits that induce and perpetuate
   poverty or "lack of money," there are habits proven to build
    prosperity; "having more money than you need." If you
   apply these habits in your life, you are CERTAIN to
    gradually but significantly improve your overall financial
    "health."
    Prosperity Habit #1 : Saving . Back to Lincoln's "a penny
   saved is a penny earned" axiom; yes, even pennies
    matter! A penny saved helps build the habit of saving.
   Every time you "save," you create a feeling, an inner
   sense of "building," and you strengthen a habit. If you
   SYSTEMATICALLY save, that feeling becomes pretty
    powerful. It has an impact on your self-image, self-esteem
   and self-confidence. If you SYSTEMATICALLY save, that
    habit becomes automatic behavior.
     In the beginning, your saving activity may not mean much
     in pure dollars and sense. You may start just by putting
   "spare change" into a coffee can at the end of every day,
   and by putting a tiny 1 % of every paycheck into a savings
   account. That WILL take a long time to build up. But
    getting this habit working for you is whafs important,
    regardless of the dollar amount.
    Later, as your savings build, you can begin using more
   sophisticated investment methods, like Individual
   Retirement Accounts (IRA's), mutual funds, and so on.
     In the beginning, very ordinary savings vehicles are fine.
   And even small but CONSISTENT savings, in ordinary

    rate during each time period. Any increase in the amount
   saved and/or a better average rate of return via
    investments would produce a substantially larger total
   amount. It is quite possible, at today's interest rates,
    and, at some point switching to mutual funds, using an
    IRA, and other investment opportunities, for this small
   savings habit to accumulate over $150,000.00 by
    retirement. Although this is no fortune, it would yield a
   monthly interest income of $500, $600, possibly more,
    to supplement Social Security, company pensions, etc.
  — and most retirees will tell you that can make all the
    difference in the world!

   even call it mystical. We are not even going to attempt to
   explain it. But we will INSIST that it works. Every individual
  who tries this idea reports remarkable results.
      If you have three apples and give one away to a hungry
   person, your 'Svealth" has DECREASED from three to
   two, right? On paper, yes. But in real life, the act of giving
  seems to increase wealth rather than to decrease it. The
   act of giving actually violates the math we learn in school.
  When people combine The Habit Of SAVING with The
   Habit Of GIVING, they seem to "attracf new job
   opportunities, promotions, raises, even money coming to
   them from unusual and unexpected sources.
   You may want to pick a favorite charity, your church, a
    local civic project, a food bank, a homeless shelter,
   whatever, and regularly and consistently give a small
   donation. Just like "paying yourself first," you might set a
   percentage, even 1% or 2% or 3% of all the money that
  comes to you. Each time you get paid, give even just
   $5.00. The amounts are less important than consistency
   and frequency.
   Giving of time counts, too. Your community is overrun with
   worthy, charitable organizations and projects in need of
   volunteers. Volunteerism is an American tradition that
   enriches everybody's lives.
    'The only certain way to multiply wealth
       is to divide it^'. . /'for just as you feel you are!"

  We are 'the TV generation." No previous age group has
   spent as much time watching television as we do. Now,
   we're not going to "bash" television. We enjoy TV just as
  much as anybody. We use TV for news, for entertainment,
   for watching sports, for information, even for shopping.
   But the person who uses the TV as an "escape" from real
     life...who flops in front of it as soon as they arrive home
   from work and stays there until they fall asleep.... this
   person does himself a terrible disservice. Instead, some
   portion of your time should be deliberately and wisely
   invested in self-improvement.
  When you stop to think about it, "YOU" are the only thing

   You drive your car by habit. And most of these habits get
   formed mostly by accident.
   Think about the foods we like, for example. Why do we
    prefer cake, cookies, ice cream and other sweets as
   desserts? Why don't we prefer fresh fruits and cheeses
   instead? Because of habit. As children, we got sweets as
    treats. Thinking of those foods as treats became a habit.
   Had your parents started out and stayed consistent with
    giving you fresh fruits as treats and never giving you
   cookies or cakes, by the time you toddled off to
    kindergarten, you would have fomned a habit of preferring
   and desiring those fruits. Of course, peer pressure from
     all the other kids would have undoubtedly interfered with
    that in pretty short order. But if we ALL were raised with
   the fresh fruit habit instead of the candy habit, we'd
    certainly be a healthier society!
   The good news is that, as an independent thinking adult,
   you can CHOOSE to break certain habits, and to create
    other habits. You can choose habits that work for you.

      as habits."

   How To Manage Your Career,
      To Get Ahead In Life
   A huge, positive step in life is switching from '^/vorking for
   a living" to "developing a career."
   There has been a fairly recent societal trend of young
   people choosing just to take "jobs," claiming to have little
    interest in the income or the nature of the work, and
    focusing entirely on their after-work pastimes and
    interests. This is sort of dropping out halfway. The truth is:
        It wears thin pretty quickly.
   And an interesting truth about human psychology is that
   we derive a great deal of our personal satisfaction and
    self-esteem from our work. It turns out you can't just stick
   your job in a pigeon hole, go through the motions, and still
    feel good about yourself. Our work and our self-esteem
    are closely linked. If our work is unsatisfactory to us, we
     will be unhappy. People stuck in unsatisfactory jobs carry
    that unhappiness over into other areas of their lives and
    find that nothing else makes them happy either.
     How To Escape A Dead-End Job
          (Before It's Too Late)
   A trend of recent years in the American economy,
    unfortunate in many ways, has been that a big chunk of
    the new jobs being created are low-end, low-wage
    service-oriented jobs, like fast food restaurants, delivery
   and store clerk jobs. This is not to say you cannot start out
     in such a job and work your way up to better and better
    positions. You can. And many companies in these types

   severely limited. A high school diploma is, today, virtually
  a NECESSIPr". Beyond that. Career Training (such as
   that described in Chapter 7) is the big breakthrough for
   tens of thousands of people each year.
    "People are afraid of the future, the unknown. If a
   man faces up to it, and takes the dare of the future,
   he can have some control over his destiny. Thaf s
   an exciting idea to me. Better than waiting with
   everybody else to see what's going to happen."
          - John Glenn, Jr.
      Astronaut, U.S. Senator
   Actually, Career THINKING even precedes Career
   Training. Career THINKING is the change, in your own
   mind, from "jobs" and "paychecks" to a "career" and a
   "career path." The word "path" is important; it says you
   are involved in a career you can develop, move fonA/ard
   with, progress from one level to the next. It says there is
   opportunity for growth, now and in the foreseeable future.
  To stimulate your Career Thinking, a list of such careers
  appears at the end of this Chapter.
   Incidentally, as you look through this list and think about
   career choices and options, it's helpful to remember that
  your own intuition or "gut instinct about which career path
   to follow will probably be right.

    taught that "no problem ever comes to you for which the
   answer is not already within you" and "man is deaf until he
   hears the inner voice of his own being."
   You can and should place quite a bit of trust in what your
   own "inner voice" has to say about your career.

    of the mid-1 990's is? It may be the misconception that no
   one is hiring! The United States Bureau of Labor's officials
    claim that over 1 million unemployed individuals believe
    that there just aren't any good jobs. The government has
   invented a term for these people. It calls them
   "discouraged workers." These people have, for one
   reason or another, taken themselves out of the job
    market. They aren't even trying to get a job. And this
    doesn't count the even larger number of "discouraged
   employed workers" who may be in jobs they don't like or
   may be overdue for raises, promotions or advancement,
    but are so fearful of the 'lough" job market, they aren't
    looking for better positions either.
    Actual statistics and business surveys do not support
   these fears and feelings.

  read in the newspaper or hear on the news about some
  huge company laying off wori<ers or eliminating jobs — but
  what they don't tell you about in the news are the hundreds
   of smaller, growing companies in that same field hiring and
   eageriy looking for new employees!
   Yes, there is a shift going on in our economy called "Down-
   sizing," and that fuels these news reports at)out the giant
  companies axing 500 jobs here, 1 ,000 jobs there. But this
   trend is offset by growth elsewhere in the economy.
  The plain truth is that there are (and always will be) plenty
   of opportunities for a person who steps fonA^ard with
   sufficient education and preparation, positive references
  from past employers and others, a positive attitude, and
  an honest desire to develop a career.
    4 Proven Keys To Getting A Better Job
  Key#1: An Optimistic. Determined Attitude . Take the
  above facts to heart. Ignore the negative news about the
   'lough" economy or 'lough" job market. Instead, focus on
  the fact that there are always opportunities for top-quality
  people — and thats you!
  Key#2: Organize Your "Sales Story" . Few people think of
     it this way, but you are actually "selling" yourself and your
   sen/ices to an employer. Before even attempting to
  arrange job interviews or going in to fill out any
   applications, make notes of your best qualities, past
  accomplishments, reasons why a company should hire
   you, and references. Carry these notes with you, if you
  are filling out job applications, or use them in preparing a

```

-----

```
   Key#3: Don't Limit Yourself To Advertised Openings .
    Sure, you should check the "Help Wanteds" in your city
   newspaper, maybe nearby city and town newspapers,
   maybe even publications like the National Employment
   Weekly or trade magazines in your particular field,
   depending on how far along you are in your career. But
    don't stop there! Most people further their careers through
    the "hidden job market," not through advertised openings.
    The Secret Of The "Hidden" Job Market
   Based on research done by some of the largest
   employment agencies and outplacement firms in the
    country, we estimate that less than 25% of all the jobs
   paying more than $1,500.00 a month are filled by
   employment agencies or applicants responding to help
   wanted ads. In fact, many of these jobs are never
    advertised at all! About 75% of these jobs are filled by
   recommendation and referral; someone already working
    at that company refers a friend. . .by 'lips" — "I hear XYZ
     is hiring. . ." — or by prospective employees presenting
   themselves to companies without regard to whether they
    are known to be hiring or filling a position at that moment.
    This ["75%] Factor" tells you that you need to DIVERSIFY
   your job search. For example, you'll want to let everybody
   you know who is employed anywhere, as well as "center
    of influence" type people like your, or your family's,
    accountant, lawyer, banker, know that you are interested
     in finding a particular type of position. Put the word out!
    Build a 'target lisf of companies you think you'd like to
   work for and contact them, even if they are not advertising
   any openings or known to be hiring.

   education like Education Direct Career Training, and
   informal self-study with books, other publications, classes
  and seminars, you will benefit greatly by being in the "getting
   ready for my next, better position" mode all the time.
     Three Proven Keys To Job Security,
        Raises And Promotions
   Key#1 : Out-Perform Your Job . It may take a bit longer than
  you would like, but no one doing truly excellent, outstanding
   wori< can go unnoticed or unrewarded very long. Excellence
   at "snnall things" inevitably leads to big opportunities.
    "In effect, the quality of a person's life is
     in direct proportion to commitment to
     excellence, regardless of the field of
    endeavor/'
        - Coach \^ce Lombard!
  Key #2: Create Opportunity In Or On Your Job . There's an
   interesting word: Intrapreneurship." Sort of "an inside
   entrepreneur." [*] A fancy way of talking about creating new
   opportunities within the corporate structure and
   environment. Expanding the scope and value of a job.
  The Intrapreneur*' not only does his assigned, described
   job well, but is alert for opportunities to expand that job,
  and is prone to bring new, carefully thought out kleas for
   improving some aspect of his job or his employer's
   business fon/vard.

     qualified." But a sure way to move up from one job to a
    better one is to develop the education, thinking, habits,
    behavior and image of someone who has that better job.
   Should You Consider ''Entrepreneurship " * ^
   There is a home-based business and entrepreneurial
    explosion going on all around you! By starting your own
    business, from home, in your spare time, you not only have
   an opportunity to earn extra income but also to develop new
   and varied skills, greater self-confidence and useful contacts.
   You may later find a way to grow your spare time business
     into a full-time business, and become your own boss for life.
   Of course, not everybody is cut out to be an entrepreneur,*
    especially on a full-time basis. But you may want to at least
    explore this option. Information about Harcourt programs
     for people interested in having their own businesses
    appears in Chapter 7.
    *"Entrepreneur" refers to someone who takes on a certain
   amount of risk to start his own business enterprise, is his
   own boss.
        "What I want to tell you today is...
         throw yourself into the convulsions
           of the world. . .live in it.
         Take chances. Make your own work,
          take pride in it, seize the moment."
                  - Joan Didion

  How To Gain Favorable Attention
   For Your Ideas And Your Abilities
   Progress in just about any career requires the development
    of certain "people skills." Communication, persuasion,
    influence, and leadership all play a role. Thafs probably
   why, after not just years, but decades, the famous book
    written by Dale Carnegie — "How To Win Friends And
    Influence People" — continues to sell tens of thousands of
   copies every year, year after year.
     In most companies and business environments, there is
   competition for the attention of upper management, for
    recognition, raises, promotions and other opportunities.
   Sometimes that competition among peers and co-
   workers is very obvious and open, other times it is less
   open and a bit more subtle. Still, from time to time, you will
   be thrust into a situation where you have an opportunity to
    "shine." And at all times, you'll have the opportunity to
   "stand out." So, how do you gain favorable attention for
    yourself, your abilities and your ideas?
     First: the ability to communicate effectively . You will
   always be judged by what comes out of your mouth. . .
   your choice of words, the level and diversity of your
   vocabulary, and how well organized the thoughts you
   express are. For starters, the kind of 'street slang' and
   Verbal shorthand' we commonly use with friends is not
   going to gain points for you in the business world. Beyond
    that, any number of surveys and studies have confirmed
    that people do judge your intelligence and ability based on
   the words you use. Fortunately, there are many things you

```

```
  read, very inexpensive community college classes,
  Learning Annex classes (if there's an Annex in your area),
  even audio and video tapes you can listen to and watch.
  Second: your personal image . Here is the best advice you
  can get about dress and personal appearance as it
  relates to a career: look and dress one "step" better than
  your current job requires. If you're a mechanic, for
  example, and could get away with oil-stained, dirty
  coveralls or work clothes, wear clean, neatly pressed
  work clothes. If you can get away with a sport coat and
  open-collared shirt, wear a shirt and tie. Instead of doing
  what you can "get away with," go just one step better. And
  always look your best, under whatever conditions you find
  yourself in. Haircuts, clean nails, neat clothes, ifs all
  important.
 We had a conversation with a young woman who had
  applied for a job in a yogurt/fast food chain store and been
   told that she would have to dress differently and better
  than she had on the interview, to be able to work there.
  She had gone to the interview in a T-shirt with a rock
  group's name and images on it and washed out jeans with
  strategically placed holes. She was outraged over this.
  Angry. Mad. 'What right do they have to tell me how to
  dress?"
  Well, they DON'T have that right — unless you want to get
  money from them, as a result of taking care of their
  customers. Then they certainly do have that right. And
  they're not just imposing their personal ideas and
  preferences. They have a certain image they want their
  business to put out, they believe their customers respond

```

-----

```
       It may NOT be fair, but America DOES judge a book by
      its cover! People make judgments about your status and
    importance, your seriousness about your job, even your
     ability based on how you dress. As a kid, you may have
   heard the adage: 'You never get a second chance to
   make a good first impression." It turns out there is plenty
    of scientific evidence to support this idea! Most people
   form an impression of you in their subconscious minds
    within the first 30 seconds of meeting you, and they are
    very reluctant to change that impression later. Obviously
    that impression cannot be based on what you say or what
   you know — how could they tell much about that in just
   30 seconds? So it IS based on your appearance. (If you
     try to think in temris of "marketing" yourself, then ifs your
    "packaging." And think how important packaging is to
    products you choose and pick off of shelves.)
    Third: be well-informed . In whatever work "specialty" you
    find yourself in as well as the one in which you want to
   develop your career, you should be an up-to-date, well-
    read, well-informed expert. This means having or getting
      all the related formal education you can. It also means
    reading the current literature in the field: any books
    published by people in that field or about that field, the
    trade magazines and journals published for that field, plus
   some general business information won't hurt.
   Lefs say you're an electrician. There are trade magazines
    published just for electricians, others for electrical
    contractors and owners and managers of such
   companies. You should certainly be reading the trade

```

-----

```
  you should be reading their trade magazines too.
   In addition, people again judge your intelligence and
   ability by how well informed you are in general. You can't
   afford to just ignore the news of the day.
   Fourth: personality and attitude . There are very, very few
   occupations where personality is unimportant. When
   Fortune 500 company executives are asked how they
  choose people to promote and what they look for in
   people, they invariably talk about "attitude" and
   "personality" before anything else. But how do you define
   "a good attitude" or "a good personality"? Most people
   react to that like they do to pornography: / can't define it,
   but I know it when I see it! But here are a few hints or clues:
  People judged by others to
  have a good personality
  seem to be patient, active "Everything can be
   listeners. . .encouraging and taken from a man but
  complimentary to others. . . one thing: the last of
   generally cheerful and human fr-eedoms — to
   optimistic. . .and curious, in- choose one's attitude
   terested in learning and in any given set of
  knowing about new things. If circumstances — to
  a person leaves a conversa- choose one's own
   tion, meeting or other en- way."
   counter with you feeling that - Dr. Victor Frankl,
  you really listened to his Author and
   opinions and what he had to psychiatrist.
   say, and feeling "better" than Author, "Man's
  he did to start with, he is Search For Meaning"
   very likely to categorize you

```

-----

```
   People judged by others to have a good attitude seem
    to be generally optimistic and upbeat. . .calm under
   pressure. . . very solution-oriented (as opposed to, for
   example, blame-oriented) when faced with problems. .
   And genuinely interested in ideas, new and better ways
    of doing things.
        '^t is your attitude more so than your
      aptitude that determines your altitude!'
            - Zig Ziglar
      One of America's most famous
        public speakers.
       Author, "See You At The Top"
      When Should You Put Your
          Best Foot Forward?
  One day, an elderly woman came in to a small furniture
    store, apparently to escape the rainstorm outside. Several
    of the salesmen on the showroom floor ignored her, telling
   each other that she was not there to shop — just to get in
   out of the rain while waiting for the bus to come along.
   Talking to her would be a waste of time. So she was left
    to the newest, "greenesf salesman, a kid really, to take
   care of. He spent time with her, showed her around the
   store and answered her questions patiently and
    courteously. When she left without purchasing, the other
   salesmen made fun of the kid.
       It turned out that the little old woman stepping into the

   Carnegie, a Scottish immigrant, was America's first
    billionaire. As a major player in our Industrial Revolution,
   Carnegie made his fortune in steel and railroads.
  When it came time later that year to redecorate and re-
   furnish the Camegie family castle back in Scotland, Mr.
   Carnegie's mother insisted that everything be purchased
   from the young salesman at the small furniture store.
  The point of the story, of course, is that you just never
  know when you are going to bump right into Opportunity.
  Some little job you do extremely well may bring you to the
   attention of a company president. A person you talk with,
   on or off the job, may surprise you and be someone
   important in your company or community. And on and on.
   So, when should you put your best foot fonA/ard? When
   should you present yourself in a way most likely to gain
   favorable attention? Every Wme. All the time.

     (THE GUY IN THE MIRROR)
   When you get what you want in your struggle for self
     And the world makes you king for a day.
      Then go to the mirror and look at yourself
       And see what the guy has to say.
      For it isn't your mother, your father or wife
      Whose judgment on you must pass.
   The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life
         Is the guy staring back from the glass.
     He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest.
         For he's with you clean to the end;
     And you've passed your most dangerous
            and difficult test
            If the guy in the glass is your friend.
     You may be like Jack Homer and chisel a plum
      And think you are a wonderful guy.
      But the guy in the glass says you are a bum
           If you can't look him straight in the eye.
       You may fool the whole world [—]
        down the pathway of years
      And get pats on the back as you pass;
    But the final reward will be heartaches and tears
    IF YOU'VE CHEATED THE GUY IN THE GLASS.
