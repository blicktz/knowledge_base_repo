###### There is a huge need for copywriting, particularly directresponse copywriting, and for skilled copywriters. There’s a shortage. The top tier of expert freelance copywriters, which includes Dan Kennedy, is over-busy and quite expensive. A project placed with any of them needs to be of substantial opportunity and size. Many business owners need to function as their own copywriters, at least for much of their day-to-day needs. With all this in mind, I wondered if AI could speed up their learning curve to copywriting competency and confidence. Could it be good enough on its own for many purposes?
 Dipti Kala, a retired squadron leader from the Indian Air Force, chose a path less traveled after her military service. While many of her peers transitioned to the corporate sector, Dipti decided to leverage her leadership skills in a different arena—business coaching. With a decade of experience

###### leading a team of officers and technicians, Dipti found her passion in helping working mothers excel in entrepreneurship and corporate sectors. Her journey took a unique turn when she delved into the world of AI, particularly ChatGPT. Dipti recognized the potential of AI to enhance productivity. She studied. Did her research. She quickly realized why many users struggle when it comes to ChatGPT. She also came to grips with a fact about business coaching: You have to have clients to coach! Where do they come from? Selfmarketing. What does that require? Prolific content writing and copywriting.

#### A Meeting of Minds

###### I first met Dipti in an online ClickFunnel Facebook group—our common background as soldiers in the Indian Air Force made for easy conversation. When Dipti learned that I had won the prestigious Two Comma Club award from ClickFunnels twice, and I learned about her vision in professional digital marketing, a fast friendship began.
 When I learned about her pursuits with AI, I offered a challenge…

 The Ultimate AI-Powered Copywriting Challenge

 Can ChatGPT be tasked with writing sales copy and creating nurture
 content using proven techniques, strategies, and copy frameworks?

 To complete this challenge, we had some questions to answer…

What skills are necessary to use ChatGPT for copywriting? Can anyone with a decent
understanding of language take this tool and create dynamic copy that has prospects lined up
with credit cards in hand?
Where will Dipti and her AI tools encounter challenges? We recognized the opportunity.
Now we needed to experiment in order to see where this tool might fall short.
How much time will Dipti need to spend, and how much time can AI save? At the end of the
day, after prompts, edits, and rewrites, how many man-hours are saved?
Will the copy and content be “market ready”? What tasks will Dipti and other humans need
to perform after AI generates the copy? Will the copy be so good that it needs a single readover, and then it’s ready to go to a client?
Ultimately, can AI make Dipti and I money? Can it save us enough time, free up enough
resources, and produce a good enough result to be worth the effort?

-----

Can a trained ChatGPT user in India successfully create direct response copy for a law firm
in Maryland? Will the writing be personalized enough not to sound like a thousand other
pieces of marketing tripe that can be found on just as many bargain-basement websites?

###### We had high hopes. Dipti and I saw ChatGPT’s potential to grow her coaching practice and make her money. If the end product turned out to be good enough to be market-ready, she could save business owners a significant amount of money.
 Copywriting done by a competent writer is not cheap. A single sales letter written by a copywriter capable of swaying hearts and minds and turning tire kickers into paying customers, then to raving fans, can cost tens of thousands of dollars and be worth every penny, and then some. Dipti knew that if she could train her coaching clients to use ChatGTP to create compelling, engaging, and market-ready content, she could grow rich while helping thousands of working moms earn a living.
 I recognized that if this worked for Dipti, I could help other professionals use AI to write copy and create content so “anyone” could use eLauncher’s proprietary systems. There would be another, additional answer to: “How do I get all the marketing copy and content copy I need written?” If our experiment worked, eLaunchers and its systems would no longer be reserved for high-end marketers with significant marketing budgets. We could monetize a “Jr.” eLauncher’s A.B.C.D. (Any Business Can Do It) in a dozen different ways.
 Time was also a factor. When I commission my writers to create copy for ALL eLaunchers’ assets we produce for a client, an experienced writer typically needs 90–180 days to deliver. These assets include website development, Shock & Awe packages, sales letters, long-term nurture sequences, and more. It’s a mountain of work. I gave Dipti 45 days to finish the project. I wanted to know if ChatGPT could make the impossible possible. Can this technology, in the hands of an experienced user, allow me to deliver quality work to my clients in half the time it takes my best writer to create the same? Could small business owners use this approach on their own?

-----

###### If this worked, Dipti would have an entire suite of copy for her consulting company—assets that would require a significant investment if implemented by eLaunchers. Creating these assets would not have been possible without AI, because learning the core concepts of Magnetic Marketing[®] and adopting eLaunchers’ implementation protocol was not practical for Dipti. She is busy. She’s a successful entrepreneur. A coach. A MOM with two toddlers. And a wife who supports the busy life of a working husband who is active in the corporate world. There are simply not enough Dipti hours to overcome this learning curve and complete this work in a reasonable time. We needed to see if AI and ChatGPT could accomplish this for her.
 So, I gave her access to my Toolbox. I equipped Dipti with a treasure trove of assets to study and to model. These included:

A masterpiece sales letter, Shock & Awe package, and other assets created by Dan Kennedy
for my company, Dental Growth Machine.
An expertly crafted Pixel Estate Website written by Everte Farnell, using Dan Kennedy’s
copy as a foundation.
My million-dollar funnels—the same ones that won me two of the prestigious ClickFunnel’s
Two Comma Club awards.
My entire Business Kamasutra campaign for marketing automation written by Everte
Farnell, including…
1. Lead Magnet Delivery Sequence.
2. New Lead Sequence—used to persuade a prospect to book a call.
3. Pre-Appointment Sequence—setting expectations.
4. Post-appointment sequences designed to “react” to the prospect’s next move.

 - Appointment no-show—aimed to persuade a prospect to reschedule.

 - Appointment no-sale—offers compelling reasons why they should reconsider.

 - SOLD—a welcome sequence that sets the stage for what they can expect next.
5. Long-Term Nurture—52 emails used to “stay in touch” with prospects. Great for

promoting top-of-the-mind awareness and establishing a business owner as a trusted
authority.

 Despite the rich resources, Dipti encountered challenges in defining her “WHO” (Ideal Customer Avatar), articulating her “OFFER,” and establishing her “USP” and “VALUE PROPOSITION.” In an effort to bridge the gap, I provided one-on-one consultations and study materials, including books like Breakthrough Advertising, Magnetic Marketing, and Ultimate Sales Letter.

#### The Unraveling Experiment

###### As the experiment unfolded, Dipti faced difficulties. The dream of a plug- and-play solution faded away. We were left with a wish list rather than a finished product. It quickly became evident that SIGNIFICANT human intervention was necessary. This led to a decision to quit the initial approach entirely.

#### Lessons Learned

###### In reflection, we recognized that AI is a powerful tool for speeding up the writing process, but acknowledged its limitations. AI can’t replace the unique skills of a seasoned copywriter like Dan Kennedy. However, it can be a valuable ally, enabling efficient market research and content articulation.
 Dipti and I will continue to work together. I’ll teach her how to write, and she will teach me how to be more efficient with ChatGPT and

-----

###### Command Prompts. We will make each other more productive. Have a lot of fun. Become better friends. And add value to each other’s business. What these two soldiers will never do is build a robot that can replace Dan Kennedy or another copywriter of his experience, skill, and intuitive capability. The conclusion is clear—AI is everyone’s business, and learning how to use it is crucial. Still, it has its limits.
 My new glasses can help me read, but won’t help me understand French or Italian. AI is a marvelous tool that aids human abilities. But it won’t revolutionize every aspect of human life. AI can’t make Dipti an excellent copywriter. But it can help with market research and help her articulate what she wants to say to her audience. This way, a trained and competent copywriter can step in and write for Dipti’s brand.

##### How NOT to Speak to the Machines

###### Below is some good advice on how to make the most out of the powerful asset that is ChatGPT. Dipti learned these by experience, through struggle. I understand them by having watched her work and hit bumps in the road.

 AVOID vague and ambiguous prompts, such as, “Write something about the need for estate planning.” Prompts like this result in overly broad or irrelevant content. You need to get more granular.

 AVOID leading prompts like, “Explain why our law firm is the best!” This will generate content that seems pedantic and that is product-centered rather than client-centered. AVOID overly complex instructions like telling Chat GTP: “Create a comprehensive technical report on understanding restorative dentistry.” This will lead to confusion, a lack of focus, and a report filled with vague generalities. Divide your desired report into sections, chapters, and individual topics within the big umbrella subject, and assign them one at a time.

 AVOID too many requests in a single prompt. You can’t tell ChatGPT to write a blog post, create a video script, and design an infographic about a

-----

###### new product all at the same time. Think in terms of to-do items, not to-do lists.

 BE PREPARED to refine and fine-tune what you get from ChatGPT or other AI, and to go back to it with additional work provoked by what was completed. If you’ll review Preston Bates’ Black Friday Promotion experience described in his chapter, you’ll see this is exactly what he and his partner did.

 At least for now, at the time I’m writing this, I view ChatGPT as a new, additional member of a copywriters’ room; a new, additional member of a marketing team. I have in-house teams in the U.S. and in India, and, for content and copy, I work with a number of freelancers including Dan Kennedy, Everte Farnell, and Russell Martino, so I am accustomed to drawing on multiple contributors per project. We use “the mastermind concept,” derived from Napoleon Hill’s writings in Think and Grow Rich and in Laws of Success. Now, a ChatGPT marketing strategist and a ChatGPT writer can join the mastermind. Specific to copywriting by committee, a book Dan Kennedy recommends is COPY LOGIC! The New Science of Producing Breakthrough Copy by Michael Masterson and Mike Palmer.

#### Dan Kennedy Says

###### Clint Eastwood says, “A man’s got to know his limitations.” With the experiment Parthiv describes here, he discovered the importance of knowing a technology’s limitations and, in this case, AI’s limitations. Like Edison with his 10,000 tries at the light bulb, I can assure you Parthiv is back in the laboratory conducting more experiments with this.

 I think, broadly, this comes down to a piece of advice I first heard from Jay Van Andel, co-founder of Amway. Jay said, “Delegate or stagnate.” I have modified it to live it and to teach it as: Delegate

-----

###### or stagnate—but don’t abdicate. Trying to totally escape work, particularly important work, or escape responsibility, is, itself, a lot of work!—and rarely proves successful. The terrific auto industry CEO Lee Iacocca said he had to frequently get down out of the office tower and onto the factory floor, observe, talk with the men, and get out to the dealers’ showrooms where cars meet customers. Walt Disney often disguised himself to walk the parks as a customer. Tom Peters coined the term MBWA for this— Management By Walking Around. I don’t believe in totally removing yourself from any functions of your company as long as it’s yours. I think you stick your nose in everywhere. There’s a formula: Responsibility = Control, Control = Responsibility. The more responsibility you abdicate, the less control you have. It’s proportional.

 I know a number of top copywriters (and prolific, successful novelists) who use “subwriters.” A few have writing factories. More just have small teams. The “name” copywriter tweaks, fixes, polishes the drafts completed by their “subs.” Personally, I’ve tried this once, didn’t like it, and have never done it since. I have occasionally delegated research, interviewing testimonials, and other time-consuming work required before writing. But even that I prefer doing because it can yield surprises. Useful answers to questions I didn’t know to ask. For the copywriters who do use “subs” or the team approach, I can certainly see how ChatGPT can be added. Maybe even, soon, replace some of those human workers. But no top copywriter will ever fully abdicate these jobs. They may delegate the scientific and mechanical parts, but they’ll have to control the organization at the beginning, add the artistry along the way, and polish then approve the final work.

# Above All Else

##### by Dan Kennedy

###### There is one thing more important than any other thing that can be said about Marketing Automation. It is an ancient management axiom: Don’t expect what you don’t inspect—constantly.
 As I was working on this chapter, all Boeing 737s were grounded for inspection or, more accurately, re-inspection after the entire door blew off one of them at 16,000 feet. No passengers injured. But there could have been. It turns out not only were there loose bolts on that plane. Inspectors found loose bolts all over all the planes. Unfortunately, you can’t personally inspect the innards of the Boeing-made plane you get on, expecting its bolts to be tight, its door to stay on for the entire flight. But you can personally inspect your own Marketing Automation. You or a highly, highly trusted person put in charge of doing so. Plus, maybe, “mystery shoppers.” Every day. Maybe every hour. President Reagan had it right: “Trust, but verify.” Verify, a lot.
 A simple piece of Marketing Automation, the equivalent of a door bolt on a Boeing, the “link” is infamous for failing. In one check of the top 100 e-commerce web sites by a client of mine, The Internet Marketing Center,
