Crafting Effective Sales Scripts We crafted effective sales scripts for every key stage of our sales process. But let me walk you through an early stage of our process: the initial conversation we have with “browsers” who walk in “cold” expecting to just look at glasses. After we removed the stock from display these early minutes in the sale process became critical.
 First, everyone thought I was crazy to remove the stock from display. When a customer walks into a store they expect to be able to browse. When you take away that option, it puts the salesperson under a bit of pressure.
 When there is product on display it buys a little time to build rapport and to engage the customer. And a shop full of products is a more comfortable environment because the customer’s attention is usually focused on the product rather than on the salesperson. But when we took away the products, suddenly the salesperson was the “main event” from the moment the prospect walked in. They were 100% in the limelight. They had nowhere to hide. They would either sink or swim in a matter of minutes.
 So we tested and developed effective scripts to engage the client, put them at ease, start a discovery process, and lead them down the route to an eyewear style consultation.
 We started with basic scripts. A few questions that we wanted to ask. A few helpful statements we wanted to make about what we do. A few short stories we could tell. And we role-played all that regularly. We’d take the most common things browsers would say and we’d practice responding to their statements and questions in an effective way.
 But we discovered that scripts need to go hand-in-hand with sales choreography. And sales choreography became a huge part of this early stage in our sales process. How the prospect physically moved through the practice. How we directed their attention and kept them engaged. How we put them at ease and helped them open up.
 We’d position our frame drawers in a location that would draw people all the way into the practice. We’d open a secret drawer while we were


-----

##### speaking with them to reveal a large collection of exquisite and different eyewear. That would entice them. We’d select one or two frames and ask if they’d like to try it on. We’d position mirrors on tables as a way of getting people to sit down. We’d get people to go from standing to sitting at a table by casually saying, “Let me get a few frames together for you while you have a look at that one. Try it on. There is a mirror there. Just have a seat.” We’d keep them seated and engaged by another member of staff bringing them a tea or coffee. We’d build their anticipation by presenting frames on leather-padded trays much like a jeweler might present an expensive piece of jewelry. And before we’d present the frame to them to try on we’d describe the quality, the individuality, the exclusivity of these types of products and why what we’re showing them is different from the mass- produced products they’ll find in most opticians.
 By this stage the browser is caught up in “an experience.” An unexpected experience. And then while they’re “ooh-ing” and “ahh-ing” over a few stylish frames, we’re more interested in gathering information about them. At this stage they’re warmed up and much more open with us. So we’re casually having a conversation about them, their requirements, their problems, what they’d ideally like, what they’ve done in the past, their budget, timescale, how and when they’ll make a decision, whether they’ll want to come back with their partner, etc. We’re exploring needs and qualifying them in a comfortable, relaxed, helpful way. We are not in any way giving a sales presentation. Really, we’re just giving them an overview of the styles and letting them try on a few frames as a way of keeping them engaged while we “interview” them. We’re the ones asking the questions. And then once we have some information and if they are a good fit for us, we’ll “sell” a free eyewear styling consultation. We explain how we work, why we do things this way, and how it might be a good solution to the problems they just shared with us. Then we schedule an appointment for their consultation later that day or for another day depending on time and what we feel is most effective based on their buying criteria that we identified.
 And that is how we go from a cold browsing experience where we have little control, to a consultation, by appointment where we have control, expert positioning, information we can use to influence and persuade, pre- established rapport, and a pre-qualified prospect.

##### And it results in a sale over 80% of the time. It also saves time by weeding out time wasters, and anyone who isn’t a good fit for what we do, within a few minutes.
 In addition to this kind of sales choreography we also use many “props” that help us create the desired kind of experience. The great thing about props is that even if it is something small it can be “focused in on,” pointed out, or talked about so it becomes a memorable part of the experience.
 Here’s a taste of some of our props: fresh flowers in every room, real tea served in a stylish china cup and saucer, a selection of 19 flavors of teas, a Nespresso coffee machine that serves a proper cappuccino or latte, freshly served Pimm’s with fruit in the summer, mulled wine in the winter, a selection of handmade Belgian chocolates, coffee table books with inspiring photography of a lifestyle clients aspire to (e.g., The Condé Naste Travel Book, The Sartorialist), jazz music, and on and on.

 Everything Matters! Everything in the practice has been thought out in advance. We have considered the message it sends out and whether it fits in with the perception we are trying to create for our clients. We look at everything through our client’s eyes. Everything has an appealing design and style; from the pens we use, to how we dress, to the chairs, and furniture. Everything matters.

 More Money with Less Work Now, it takes a bit of effort and investment to put on a show like this and to create this kind of customer experience. So if you go to all this trouble you kind of want to get paid! We “get paid” by focusing on premium pricing. Premium pricing allows you to work less and make more. In fact, if I had to pick just one strategy, premium pricing would be it.
 Without this piece of the puzzle I would probably have failed like the previous owners of this business. When I took on the project of buying this practice we changed a lot of things at once, the effect of which was the bottom third of existing customers magically disappeared. All of a sudden we were seeing fewer clients but a much higher quality of client who would spend a lot more money with us. And then a constant stream of these ideal


-----

##### clients started showing up at our door. And the lower-end clients simply stopped coming in.
 We had fewer clients, but the clients we had were much more profitable than the ones we got rid of. We were able to devote our full attention to doing the best job we could for our ideal clients because we weren’t busy running around serving a mass of low-quality clients who aren’t profitable for us. And it was a lot more enjoyable and fulfilling work.

 How Much Is an “Expensive” Frame? In my first practice the average frame price was £250. The majority of our frames were between £200 and £300. And a small percentage of frames were above £300. As a result, my staff and myself thought that anything over £300 was an expensive frame. £300 was the point as which we’d get a little nervous because it was “expensive.”
 I remember the first day I started in my second practice. The very first thing we did was completely change the stock. And we purposely bought stock to position us as high-end. Well, overnight my perception of what an expensive frame was changed. Why? Because most of the frames on the shelves were between £300 to £400. And there were frames over the £400 mark as well. Suddenly a £300 frame felt like a bargain.
 But here’s the thing: The customer’s perception of what was expensive changed, too. Suddenly they felt that up to £400 was normal because most of the frames were that price.

 The Law of Contrast There is a principle in human perception, the contrast principle, that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented one after another. The contrast principle is well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts of perceptions.
 If a customer looks at a £400 product and then a £300 product, the £400 product seems expensive to them. And the £300 product seems “not expensive.” But if instead, they look at the £300 product first, followed by a £200 product, the exact same £300 product that would have seemed “not expensive” in the first scenario now seems “expensive.” This is the law of contrast at work.

##### You can control what your customers, and your staff, perceive as expensive by the stock that you carry and the pricing that you use. If you want to sell more £400 products but the majority of your products are less than £300, then customers and staff will struggle because the £400 will be perceived as expensive by most customers and most staff.
 The way to do it is to have the majority of products at the price point you want to be selling at. £400 for example. Then get rid of your lower end products. Or at least get them off display. Hide them away and get them out only if you really need to. And also start selling £600 and £800 products as well. These make your £400 products seem “not expensive.” This is the contrast principle. You’ll be amazed how it works.

 How an £895 Frame Was Perceived as “Not Expensive” Mike is a great client. A successful businessman, in his late 40s, with a large head so he finds it difficult to find glasses that fit him. But he likes his eyewear. We give him a call whenever we get something in that we think would be up his street. And he came in recently to look at a few frames from a new range. And as expected he liked them. The frames were at the more expensive end of the spectrum, ranging from £700 to £1500. And he ended up buying a frame that was £895. He said was happy that he liked the £895 frame and not the expensive ones! The law of contrast and how the products were presented meant that the £895 frame was seen as not expensive.

 Avoid Price Comparison When we raised prices we also took steps to avoid price comparison. We work with niche eyewear brands that are exclusive, individual, not worn by the masses and not so easy to find (hence avoiding price shopping). But more important than this, we attract clients who are not concerned with price shopping. And we have created a process (the eyewear style consultation) that practically makes it impossible to price compare.

 How We Attract Properly Prepared Prospects


-----

##### Prospects apply online for a free Eyewear Style Consultation. They submit their information and fill in a form with their motivations for applying. They tell us what problems they are having and what they want help with. Our “Client Experience Coordinator” calls them to qualify them and book them in for an Eyewear Style Consultation if we’re a good fit.
 When we first launched the free consultation offer we had a very low conversion rate from these people who were coming in for the free consultation. They were price sensitive, shopping around, planning to buy online, etc. All the same old problems we were trying to avoid. Staff would get frustrated about feeling obliged to give these people the free consultation they were promised even though they knew it was a waste of time.
 That was our initial feedback from trying this. At that stage all the prospect had to do was complete the application form and book their appointment. So we quickly added the extra step of the phone call to qualify or disqualify them. We framed it like this: “A short phone call is required before we can schedule your eyewear styling consultation. Once we receive your application we will call you to explain how the eyewear styling process works, what information to bring, and what to expect. This call will take five to ten minutes.” And that extra step totally transformed the results so that we now convert over 80% of eyewear style consultations.
 The phone call is done in a relaxed, friendly, conversational manner. Even when we disqualify a prospect (because of budget or some other reason) it is done in a helpful way and the prospect generally seems happy that we have been open and honest with them and explained why we are not a good fit for what they want. We have saved them the time and hassle and potential embarrassment from coming in for an hourlong consultation only to find out the price is out of reach for them at the last minute. It’s also extremely useful on the phone call to have the information that they gave us on their application form about their “problem.” That is where these calls begin. We follow the problem—agitate—solution formula.
 And the latest thing that we are testing is changing our offer from “free consultation” to “free book.” I’ve written a book for consumers called The Definitive Guide to Choosing Glasses That Make You Look Good (see Figure 33.1 on Page 336). The plan is to delay the sale by offering the book


-----

##### as the first step to educate and prepare the prospect and then drive them to a free consultation after a series of follow-ups by email and real mail.
 The other reasons I had for writing this book were many. We are already using it as a tool for referrals by giving clients copies when they collect their new glasses. It obviously adds to our expert positioning and will make it easier to get PR coverage for the practice. And I’m also going to use it as the offer we promote to attract new clients from direct mail as well as advertisements.
 A book is a great way to build a relationship with a customer before they ever step foot in your business. And when they do come in, they are pre-determined to buy from you. The book does a lot of the work and makes everyone else’s job easier.

##### Showing Up Differently


-----

##### The building I am sitting in as I write this used to be home to The Bank of England. It’s an old and impressive building. And a prestigious address. It was the focal point for the city’s financial and professional community and the commercial heart of the whole region. The banking hall itself is an architectural masterpiece and a Grade 1 listed building. It is a luxurious and grand environment.
 Dan Kennedy talks about “showing up differently” and that is really what this building does for us (see Figures 33.2 and 33.3 on Page 338). We don’t look like an opticians is supposed to look. And it works very well for us. Rather than relying on location and passing footfall we have created a “destination practice.” We incorporate the uniqueness and character of the building into the experience we create for clients. It becomes a part of the story we tell.
 The building is a really obvious example but the principle of showing up differently is at work in everything we do. Even down to the language we use. We sell “eyewear” not glasses. We have an eyewear “gallery,” not a glasses store. People don’t look at glasses, they have an “eyewear style consultation.”

 Make Your Business about Something Make your business about something. Make it stand for something. Design it in a way that taps into people’s emotions and values. At Jones and Co. Styling Opticians I made the business about something more than the core deliverables. I made it about style, individuality, exclusivity, expertise, personal service, and relationships.
 For example, we create exclusive events where we fly in the world’s finest eyewear designers to showcase their collections for our clients (including eyewear in the £10,000 plus range crafted from precious metals and personalized with diamonds).

##### And our clients tell stories about us. Stories about the events. About the building. About the drinks we serve. About the Eyewear Style Consultation. About the way we source our exclusive frames. About our expertise.
 What I’m most proud of is creating an exclusive and aspirational business that is expertly balanced with “real” relationships. In my experience most affluent consumers enjoy dealing with real people and being treated as real people themselves. They don’t want to be seen as a walking wallet. We talk colloquially with clients. Just because they desire the finer things in life doesn’t mean they want a stiff, posh, snooty, impersonal service. Yes the service standards are world class—but they are delivered in a “real” way.

 Make Your Business for Someone We designed the practice to be for successful people who see themselves as individuals. For people who value style, service, and expertise. We are for people who want to look good and feel good in eyewear.
