##### CHAPTER 1

### In Search of

## Something Better

#### How to Find Profit in an Unprofitable World

###### by Dan Kennedy Regardless of the media, be profit focused.
 Some media readily lends itself to direct-response advertising and marketing. Some doesn’t. Social media, for the most part, doesn’t. It is like trying to use Jell-O as cement.
 Marrying social media (which has its own profound culture, cultural norms, and participant expectations) with direct response (which has clear and, by definition, direct purpose) is like an arranged or forced marriage between strangers distrustful of each other and from different ethnic, religious, or socio-economic backgrounds. To reach back, it is reminiscent of Lonesome George Goebel’s line about feeling like a pair of scuffed brown shoes worn with a formal tuxedo. It is, frankly, a poor match.
 Still, it is also now necessary. If I bowed to my own preferences, I’d advise you to ignore all of it. But even if I did, you won’t, and I’d be a tree falling in a distant, deserted forest.
 If you are going to be drawn into the ever-expanding morass of social media (and it is extremely unlikely you won’t be), then you need to insist it repay all the attention, time, and money you invest in it. I doubt you’ll stay a stubborn opt-out as I am personally. You obviously bought this book because you’re already in and getting deeper.

###### With two exceptions, all my private clients (as of this writing) are in. Most are managing—with some difficulty—to make it pay. That’s the thing. You cannot afford to just let it play. It must
 You can’t afford to buy into nonsensical “new metrics” promulgated by the promoters of social media or by users ignorant of—or by virtue of employment by big, dumb companies—divorced from real economics. If you feel you must have presence, if you must participate, you must make it pay. In real dollars, not imaginary, hopeful metrics. Money.
 We are all in the money business. Not the likes, friends, views, tweets, retweets, and viral videos business. The Money Business.
 Most fail miserably at The Money Business. Only 1% get rich, and only another 4% achieve significant financial independence from owning and operating businesses of their own. The other 95% come up way, way short. One reason for all this failure is naïve, fantastical, delusional thinking and false optimism vs. accurate thinking. Weak-minded, thus overly influenced by peers, staff, a vocal minority of customers, popular fads, and each new, bright, shiny object vs. tough-minded thinking focused on direct profit from every investment. To that end, incidentally, I urge getting and reading my scariest, toughest, bluntest book, No B.S. Guide to Ruthless Management of People and Profits (Second Edition). You don’t want to fail at The Money Business.
 Social media as a direct-response marketing tool has another problem: a growing hazard. Its chief owners at Google, Facebook, and others don’t like it. They dislike harsh, factual measurement of return on investment. They are openly, busily striving to attract more and more big, dumb corporate advertisers with big buckets of Wall Street money and a love of brand and image and bragging rights through numbers divorced from direct sales. They are in hot pursuit of advertisers who do not insist on direct return on investment. They have outright said as much, and I have been reporting on this evolution in my newsletters, notably The No B.S. Marketing Letter (GKIC.com).
 The trouble for you is, these big brand advertisers are kings, queens, princes, and princesses moving into the social media castle. They view you as part of a rat infestation, and the castle landlord is very sympathetic to their wishes.


-----

###### Trying to do marketing that actually works in this environment grows more difficult by the day. In fact, Facebook is regularly throwing advertisers right out the back door of the castle. To get back in, companies are required to redo their sites and behavior in ways that neuter effectiveness. Do not underestimate this problem.
 Still, it now seems necessary to engage in this struggle—as sanely and smartly as possible. It is for that reason that I agreed to act as “chairman” of this book and that I chose Kim Walsh Phillips to be its “CEO.” In a field rife with fools and charlatans, I and my clients have found her to be a rare truth-teller—someone who views this media collection accurately and not through rosetinted glasses under the influence of Ecstasy, and someone who does understand direct response. She is a trustworthy sherpa through a dangerous jungle.

 My Two Instructions My message about all social media and about this book is a simple one: Be careful and be demanding. Brook no bullshit.
 Consider Twitter’s former CFO, Anthony Noto, who infamously erred in sending a private message out into the public arena. As he painfully discovered, once such an error—of mechanics or of impulse—is made, it can be forwarded to the universe—fast—and it can’t be stopped.
 The news is chock-full of executives, celebrities, and athletes being wounded and, in a few cases, ruined by an ill-advised tweet or Facebook post. Or, for that matter, hacked email. Even the private is no longer reliably private. Sony Pictures execs found this out. These same mistakes made even more commonly by small-business owners and entrepreneurs never make the TV news or get reported in The Wall Street Journal, but they foster mayhem just the same. This is also an environment where every complainant and every looney bird has a megaphone. The more you are present and active, the more you expose yourself to their type of social media terrorism: negative reviews, outright attacks, and bothersome complaints to the Facebooks of the world. This must be closely monitored and managed. It’s a price of playing in this sandbox. It carries an actual price tag.
 Be careful, too, not to treat any or all of this as a replacement for any other media or for a sensible multimedia business strategy. The worst


-----

###### number in business is one. Don’t count Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., as three, five, or 50. Social media is One. If you are overly dependent on any One, you are overly vulnerable—at enormous risk.
 My client Chris Cardell in the UK is extremely clever about using Facebook profitably. At the time I wrote this, he was merrily minting money with it. But you couldn’t take direct mail away from him at gunpoint. He also uses pay-per-click and email, online video sales letters, radio, TV, and newspapers. He won’t be caught being lazy about this. And if Facebook boots him from the castle, he’ll survive quite well. More than enough will still be coming for tea ‘n’ crumpets.
 A different client, after months of tussling with Facebook, getting booted and then getting back in, finally walked away. This client has upped advertising in newspapers nationwide and is happy about the results.
 I can’t tell you what your decisions should be. However, this book can certainly help you make the best possible choice. What I can tell you with ironclad certainty is that over-dependence puts you in peril. The only secure strategy is a multimedia marketing strategy and a multichannel sales strategy.
 If you are a success with social media, fine. This book can be a huge help. But if more than 20% of your leads, customers, or revenue comes from social media or more than 20% of your relationship with customers relies on it, you are a fool who is cruisin’ for a bruisin’.
 Next, be demanding. In a poll reported in USA Today, 61% of small- business owners could not document or prove any direct return on their investments in social media activity, yet 50% said they were increasing time and money commitments—and only 7% said they were cutting back on it. Incredible. The CEO of a social media agency insisted those latter business owners were wrong. He claimed they do get returns from social media activity—they just don’t know what they are when they see them. If you like being told you are an idiot, you’d love this guy. I sleep pretty soundly, but I know whether I’ve had sex during the night. Nobody’s going to tell me I am having a lot of sex but just not smart enough to know it.
 After one of retail’s big days, Black Friday, another USA Today article reported a 40% increase in social media campaigns by retailers like Walmart, Sears, and Amazon, yet IBM Smarter Commerce (which tracks sales of the top 500 retail sites) reported a decrease in online sales that day.

###### Then an expert said, “While it may be hard to track how all this drives sales, most retailers agree that having people talking about their brand or store is better than not.”
 Advertising software automation company Nanigans revealed current research in October 2018 detailing retailers’ ever-evolving Black Friday strategies. According to their data, “Marketers revealed that a quarter of their annual ad budgets are used to target shoppers during Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend. With total U.S. digital ad spend by retailers expected to exceed $23 billion in 2018, retailers plan to allocate almost $6 billion in media toward this four-day period.
 In terms of where advertisers are putting their dollars, the Facebook- Google duopoly is the clear winner. Retailers indicated that Google Search and Display (35%) and Facebook (18%) dominate their planned channels, but Amazon is a close third (15%). This underscores the appeal of Amazon’s evolving online ecosystem to retailers and reinforces the company’s growing momentum in digital advertising.
 “Nearly half of U.S. consumers now start their product search on Amazon, meaning the retail giant offers an attractive model for brands hoping to capture the attention of active buyers during the 2018 holiday shopping season,” said Ric Calvillo, CEO and co-founder of Nanigans. “However, retailers’ decision to pump ad spend into Amazon may be shortsighted. The company has built an ecosystem that makes it both an attractive ecommerce ad platform and a retailer’s top competitor.”
 Additional key findings from the study include:

 • More than half (51%) of retailers plan to keep 2018 holiday season ad
 budgets about the same as last year, while 48% plan to increase the amount they spend on holiday ads.
 • Retailers don’t focus much of their holiday ad spend on last-minute
 shoppers, which could be a missed opportunity as it’s a pivotal time to generate brand exposure. Almost half (47%) prioritize early-season campaigns, 48% focus on prime-season buyers, and just 5% target late-season shoppers.
 • Retail marketers plan to dedicate 14% of their campaign budgets to
 video ads during the 2018 holiday shopping season.


-----

###### • 30% of retailers want to see higher ROI from their holiday ad spend,
 and 87% would reallocate some of this budget to other areas if they could. Specifically, 49% of respondents would reinvest their holiday ad spend in martech and adtech technology, if possible.
 • 29% of marketers surveyed agree they can’t change holiday ad spend
 strategy due to organizational leaders holding them back.
 • For a majority of retailers, the holidays positively impact acquiring
 more customers with significant value, but the trade-off is the fact that 25% of marketers report dramatically higher cost of customer acquisition during this time.
 • The holiday advertising season starts early for the majority of
 retailers, with 64% of those surveyed implementing campaigns before Halloween.”[1]

 If that is consensus thinking, the consensus is made up of morons who’ve lost a grip on the business they’re in. You are not in the business of being talked about. You are in the business of selling things. You are not in the buzz business. You are in The Money Business. Refuse to be dissuaded from that simple, straightforward fact.

 The Marketing Success Triangle Has NOT Changed: RIGHT Markets Get RIGHT Message By RIGHT Media.
 Simply broadcasting a message to millions by social media accomplishes little for most businesses. Companies like GoPro (the camera company) and Red Bull are great examples of brand-builders using viral videos and social media to rise from obscurity to fame in the marketplace. But your business is probably not kin to theirs. You have to be very careful —again that advice, be careful—to model and emulate businesses with much in common with your own. Capital and human resources, for example. If you are funding your business’s growth from its profits or money borrowed by mortgaging your home and your grandma’s wheelchair, you are in an entirely different place than a company into which hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital and Wall Street money flow.
 Further, viral explosions are not all they’re cracked up to be, as Greg Levitt, cofounder of 33Across.com, a social media sharing platform, admits. From his firm’s research:


-----

###### • Consumers are most likely to share articles, news, and content related
 to science, but only 9% of person-to-person recipients click on the shared links regarding these topics.
 • Timely news and political items are less widely shared at 2%, but the
 click rates are 86% and 77%, respectively.
 • Business-related: only a 4% share and a 24% click on the shared
 links.
 • Health: 3% share, 15% click.
 • Celebrity and entertainment: 2% share, but 40% click.
 • Consumer reviews of products, businesses: 1% share, 4% click.
 • Personal finance: 1% share, 11% click.

 (The above stats were based on 500 publishers of online content.) Levitt explains the wide disparity between share and click rates as “ego sharing,” that is, senders sharing content they believe boosts their perceived intelligence, informed status, etc., regardless of whether they think recipients will find it interesting or not. The overall average is 3% sharing of content and 24% of recipients clicking on shared links.
 To me, this says there are only two useful plays: First, work with a tightly targeted list of thought-leader, market-leader, and influential recipients to deliver content of high interest and value that enhances their status if shared—to hit or beat the 3% bar, but so that the 24% of those recipients who are shared with are ideal for you; or second, you need a massive volume outreach so the 3% matters.
 The stats about forwarding/sharing of “reviews” about products and businesses suggest that angst over this—and time and money spent on it— may be overdone.
 Ironically, and in the face of what I have pointed out above, you can make a case that it is important to include social media as part of your integrated marketing plan. But approach it strategically, with the same direct-response and sound business principles that you would in any other media channel. Social media is no different than any other media.

 The Stuff of Bank Deposits Has NOT Changed You can’t go to the bank and deposit likes, views, retweets, viral explosions, social media conversations, or brand recognition. Bankers are

###### extremely narrow-minded. They won’t even accept vegetables grown in your backyard garden or bitcoin. They want real money.
 You must insist on exactly the same thing from all media. Contrary to popular belief, no media is different. No media gets a pass because it is different. Don’t be fooled. Be open-minded, creative, and opportunistic. But always keep a watchful eye on the bottom line.
 Opportunism and skepticism are not mutually exclusive. They can and should work in concert, like partners, like Walt Disney, the visionary, and Roy Disney, the money watcher, worked in tandem. Approach social media this way, and you’ll avoid being burnt.

#### From In Desperate Need to In-Demand

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips I have a sign in my office that defines my modus operandi since becoming a Dan Kennedy convert:

 In God we trust, all others bring data.
 —William Edwards Deming

 Like so many, my introduction to Dan was through his No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses. That was the starting point of a series of life-changing events that led to the unlikely combination of a legendary contrarian marketer (who is not a fan of social media) writing a book with a marketing maven who uses social media every second of every day.
 It started like this … I was thinking to myself, “She looks so beautiful.” My daughter was only a couple of weeks old and was perfect. Blue eyes that sparkled. Ten toes. Ten fingers that loved to wrap around my pinky. Her skin smelled like heaven, and she was beautiful. But … she cried. A lot.
 Pretty much anytime she was awake and wasn’t nursing, she cried. She needed me all the time to comfort her and bring her solace. I was needed by this little person.
 She was sleeping peacefully at this moment and content. Swaddled up in her pink blanket in her pack-and-play, she looked so peaceful. She
