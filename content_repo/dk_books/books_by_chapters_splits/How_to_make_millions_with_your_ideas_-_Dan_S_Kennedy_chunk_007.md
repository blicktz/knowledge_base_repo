   fitness videos, and other items. The product built the business.
     It is relatively rare to find or invent such a powerful product,
   but when you do, the world is your oyster.
     In a market-driven business, a particular niche market dic-
   tates the development of a product or products or a service or
   services. The need in the chiropractic and dental professions for
   advertising and marketing assistance fueled the development of
   my own SuccessTrak seminar and publishing business, leading
   to the development of dozens of products and millions of dollars
   of revenue. A manufacturer I consulted with developed, pro-
   duced, and sold truck tarping systems exclusively for munici-
   palities’ gravel, sand, and refuse trucks, and that market’s need
   was driven by governmental mandates. These are businesses cre-
   ated to serve very specific markets. This is a relatively common
   although little-noticed, little-understood type of business. And
   businesses in this category have very high probabilities of
   success.
     In a media-driven business, a variety of products and ser-
   vices, even apparently unrelated products, or multiple businesses,
   are all sold through one primary medium. The Guthy-Renker
   Corporation mentioned in this book sells Victoria Principal cos-
   metics and has built a cosmetics business with a product line of
   over 100 products exclusively through infomercials and home
   shopping channels. But they also sell a motor oil additive, ex-
   ercise and fitness videos, self-improvement courses, and golf
   products, and have a number of businesses within their business.
   The only commonality is the media that drives all the sales.
   Media-driven businesses are modern, high-tech distribution busi-
   nesses. The entrepreneur is not a specialist in any particular
   product or service; instead, he is a specialist in a particular
   method of distribution. To me, these are the most interesting and
   exciting businesses. And businesses in this category are often the
   ones that go from zero to millions at the fastest pace.
    By understanding these categories, and the high probability
   types, you will look at all businesses differently and mold your
   own new or existent, reinvented enterprise to fit a desirable cat-

   HOW YOU CAN TURN AN
  “ORDINARY” BUSINESS INTO
    AN EXTRAORDINARY
   MONEYMAKING MACHINE
 As I said in the first chapter, one of the most accessible, prac-
    tical ways to make a fortune is with an “‘ordinary’’ business.
  It’s very difficult (although not impossible) to create an as-yet-
  unseen, revolutionary product or service. But you can take what
  you already have, even though there may be lots of competition,
  and transform it into a revolutionary leader.
   What are the secrets to getting rich in a very ordinary busi-
  ness like plumbing or housepainting? You can find a whole tool-
  box full of them in Larry Harmon’s story. Larry Harmon built
  such a phenomenal plumbing, heating, and air-conditioning ser-
  vice business that he made Jnc. magazine’s list of the 500 fastest-
  growing businesses in the United States in 1993. And his little,
  ordinary company in the town of Clovis, California, population
  barely forty thousand, topped $3.3 million in sales.
    It isn’t every plumbing and air-conditioning service business
  that conducts employee training and motivation meetings three
  times a week, puts the workers—called Service Advisors—
  through the Dale Carnegie Course, and pays them commissions
  and bonuses so that some are making $50,000 to $60,000 a year.
  That’s just one of many amazing things about Larry Harmon’s
 De-Mar Plumbing Company.

```

```
   needed plumbing, heating, or air-conditioning repairs. Today,
   De-Mar is, by name, the first choice of a whopping 84 percent
   of the people surveyed! Since 1989 the company has grown 300
   percent to more than $3 million in sales. And all of this despite
   being the most expensive service provider in the Clovis area.
   ‘‘Price objections are value problems,’’ says Larry Harmon. ‘*To
   win with premium prices, we must clobber competitors with
   service.’’ And that they do. Here are the ‘‘service advantages’’
   Larry used to set his company apart:
    1. Guaranteed same-day service. Larry found that the public’s
    number-one complaint about service people was that they
     never show up! So, De-Mar operates under the pressure of
     absolutely guaranteed same-day service. ‘‘In our surveys, we
            ' heard the same thing over and over again,’’ Larry says. ‘“Cus-
     tomers hated calling a company and being told we can get
     out to you in ‘about three days.’ They also hated the plumber
     not showing up at the time that was specified.”’
   2. Twenty-four-hour, seven-day service without surcharges.
     “‘Paying people overtime is expensive,’’ Larry acknowledges,
     ““but we make up for those costs by building our customer
     loyalty.”
   3. Price guarantee. Everybody’s number-two complaint about
     repair services was being shocked by the prices when the
    work was done. In response to this, Larry did something very
     radical; he switched from the industry norm of pricing labor
    by the hour, plus cost of materials with markup and travel
     time, with a new kind of flat-rate pricing. ‘“‘We borrowed this
     idea from the auto service business,’’ Larry says. ‘‘We’ve
    developed a price book that covers 98 percent of all the jobs
    we face. Our Service Advisors are actually tested every Mon-
    day morning on their knowledge of the price book. Then we
    quote the job to the customer before we begin, and that’s that.
     If we goof and underprice a job, we live with it.’’
     Larry also monitors the quality of the service his people pro-

  and calls versus complaint letters and calls, and point totals are
  posted for all to see in the company’s classroom. An individual
  can receive up to a 50 percent increase in his income, based on
  these points.
   Every Service Advisor is actually a salesperson. When a job
  is completed for a new customer, the Service Advisor gives that
 customer a set of brochures and a plastic discount card, and
  explains the available option of enrolling in the company’s All
  Season Protection Plan. And, yes, Service Advisors are paid
 commissions, a controversial practice that competitors claim en-
 courages ‘‘overprescribing,’’ but one that Larry defends passion-
  ately. When Larry switched from hourly wages to paying
 commissions, he paid out 21 percent more in total compensation
  than the prior year, but revenues jumped by 45 percent.
   Not everyone can make the cut as a De-Mar Service Advisor.
  In a given year, nearly half of all new hires resign or are fired.
 There’s a strict dress and personal appearance code, lots of train-
  ing, long hours, and considerable peer pressure from successful
 SAs not to damage the company’s reputation.
   Larry Harmon has won recognition from excellence-guru
 Tom Peters, USA Today, and Inc. magazine. In 1993 De-Mar
 was Central California’s Small Business of the Year. Larry says,
  ‘In 1985 we were going nowhere fast. When we shifted our
 focus to quality and service, rather than worrying about price,
 we became the most successful company of our kind in our
 area.’ In a six-year period, the company went from a mere
 $210,000 in annual sales to $3.3 million.

       OTHERS MAY CRITICIZE YOU—LISTEN

   Larry Harmon’s methods converted an ordinary business into
 an extraordinary money machine at a rapid pace, and could be
 used as a blueprint for transforming just about any business with
 a significant service component into an equally impressive

   2 percent of gross earnings is reinvested in employee training,
   including continual additions to a company library of books, au-
   diotapes, and videotapes, the Dale Carnegie Courses, and other
   seminars, classes, and special incentives. A whopping 13 percent
   of gross goes to advertising, including radio and television, and
   first-class brochures and mailings to past and present customers.
     To Get Rich with an ‘‘Ordinary’’ Business,
     Try Extraordinary Marketing and Promotion
     The blunt truth about most small business owners is that they
   are incredibly lazy, ignorant, negligent marketers. At best, the
   typical small business owner will have one, two, or three means
   of attracting customers that he relies on. At worst, he just sits
   there with his shingle hung out and door open, hoping for the
   best.
    Some years ago, I did some consulting work with a spectac-
   ularly famous chiropractor who single-handedly developed not
   one but several million-dollar-per-year practices, one right after
   the other. He was nationally known for his remarkable success
    at attracting large numbers of new patients to his office every
   month—more in some months than the average doctor would
   gain in a year. Naturally, he was constantly asked: How do you
   get x number of new patients a month? How do you get thirty?
   Fifty? A hundred?
     His answer has stuck with me ever since I first heard it. He
   said, “‘I cannot answer your question the way you want it an-
   swered, because I do not know of one way to obtain 100 new
   patients. But I do know of 100 ways to get one new patient, so
   I use every one of them.”’

    ‘How a New Jersey Bookstore Owner Uses
    ‘Strategic Alliances’’ Instead of Money to
        Diversify His Marketing
   Roger Williams operates The Wit and Wisdom Bookstore in
 New Jersey, and emphasizes ‘‘strategic marketing alliances’
  rather than paid advertising to promote his store. He puts a cat-
  alog of current business books in the backseats of all the cars of
  a local limousine service. At a pizza joint down the street from
  the bookstore, copies of Roger’s newsletter The Reader are
  stacked up and distributed free. The same newsletter is mailed
  to past and present customers and area merchants. When there’s
  a movie playing at the theater in town that has a book tie-in,
 Roger builds a window display in his store featuring the book
 and promoting the movie and puts a display of the books in the
 movie theater lobby. (For example, if the film The Pelican Brief
  is playing, all of author John Grisham’s books are displayed.)
   How does he get all this cooperation? He asks for it! He
 buys tickets from the theater to use in promotions several times
  a year, and gives them window space at his store. The pizza
 shop owner uses Roger’s photocopy machine free—and so on.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #2:
      DIVERSITY IS THE OPPOSITE OF LAZINESS.
    How You Can Revolutionize Any Business
       with ‘‘The Irresistible Offer’’
   I first met and interviewed Bob Stupak in 1987. He had al-
 ready been ‘‘examined’’ by Harry Reasoner on 60 Minutes. He
 had already beat a computer at poker, for a $500,000 bet, in
 front of 25 million people. His casino had already been visited
 by the rich and famous, including Frank Sinatra. And he had
 already irked and puzzled the powers-that-be in Las Vegas by

   percent debt free, paid for as he added each floor and each square
    foot, and running at 80 to 100 percent occupancy virtually every
    night. How could this be?
     Since then Bob Stupak hasn’t stopped. He’s added a 1,000-
    seat showroom and another tower with 500 more rooms, and
   publications from the Wall Street Journal to Newsweek reported
    on his newest addition to Vegas World: a 1,012-foot-high
    ‘*Stratosphere Tower’’ that, when completed, will be the tallest
   building in the United States and the ninth tallest building in the
   world. And he still keeps all 1,000 rooms filled just about every
   day. How does he do it?
     The ‘‘secret’’ behind Bob Stupak’s successfully slugging it
    out on The Strip with giant corporate competitors watching in
   bewilderment is: the irresistible offer.
     You’ve probably seen Bob’s full-page advertisements in USA
   Today, Playboy, or the Sunday newspaper supplement, Parade
   magazine. In these ads, and in hundreds of thousands of direct-
   mail packages sent out each year, Bob offers two nights’ lodging
    in a deluxe room, unlimited free cocktails whether you’re play-
   ing or not, champagne, free show tickets, restaurant discounts,
   and $1,000 of his money to gamble with—all for $396 per cou-
    ple. Yes, you read that right: You pay $396, and he starts you
    out gambling with $1,000. (It is ‘‘match play,’’ which means
    that on an even money bet, if you play a $5 chip of the start-up
   money and win, that chip is kept by the house, but you get the
   winnings of $5 in ‘‘real’’ chips. If you took all $1,000 directly
    to the roulette wheel, put $500 on red and $500 on black, and
   double zero didn’t come up, you’d walk away with $500 in cash,
   instantly converting the $396 to $500. The reality is that Stupak
    starts out $104 in the hole against you, in cash. On a given day,
    if all 1,000 rooms are filled with these packages, he starts out
   $104,000 in the hole against the guests.) Most of the time, Bob
   even adds on to this offer with free bonuses, such as cameras,
    faux diamond jewelry, or Hawaiian vacation certificates.
      It is an irresistible offer.
     Actually, his only marketing challenge is making people be-

 he did say that he runs ahead of capacity by some multiple. In
 other words, he sells more than the 15,000 per month he could
 accommodate if everybody redeemed them immediately. This
 means he exchanges envelopes of literature for the $396 pay-
 ments months, in some cases years, before the purchasers actu-
 ally make reservations and show up for redemption. It is the
 equivalent of having a revolving credit line of hundreds of .
 thousands of dollars, interest free. And it is simply brilliant.
    How I Personally Use the Irresistible Offer
   I was so impressed by Bob’s example that I am always
 searching for ways to incorporate the irresistible offer in other
 businesses and marketing situations. Frankly it’s quite hard to
 match the appeal of his, but you can often get close. The ele-
 ments you’ll usually work with are: (1) creating perceived value
 substantially in excess of price, (2) desirable premiums, and
 (3) strong guarantees. The idea is to make people think, “‘I’d
 have to be dumb not to say yes to this.”’
   In my own speaking business, I earn the lion’s share of my
 income not from fees, but from the purchase of my how-to books
 and cassettes by audience members. It’s not at all uncommon for
 me to sell $25,000 to $50,000 in materials in a six-minute ‘‘com-
 mercial’’ at the end of an hour-and-a-half speech. My most-used
 “‘commercial’’ is truly a million-dollar sales presentation; in
 1994, it sold over a million dollars’ worth of materials.
   In that presentation, I employ all three elements to build an
 irresistible offer: The documented value of the materials that I
 offer, combined as a package, exceeds $500, but the at-seminar
 price is just $268; I include a collection of bonuses, including a
 Critique Certificate entitling the customer to submit his advertis-
 ing materials to me for a personal critique; and I offer a very
 liberal full-year guarantee. Given that the person hearing me is
 interested in the subject matter and benefits of what I’m offering,
 he has to wrestle with the thought, ‘‘I’d have to be dumb not to

   other speakers by 200 to 300 percent.
     There is one caveat I should mention quickly: Your irresis-
    tible offer must be true and [legitimate. ] [There’s ] [no ] [point ] [in ] [con- ]
   ning people. Even if you escape [the ] [legal ] [penalties ] [associated ]
   with such behavior, and even if you’re able to sleep at night,
   you’ll only make one-time sales; you’ll never build long-term,
   valuable customer relationships, income stability, and financial
   security.
      Who Says There’s No Such Thing
             as a Free Lunch?
     In chapter 5 of this book, I tell you how my client Rory Fatt
   turned his struggling gourmet foods home-delivery business into
    a huge winner with the irresistible offer. I got the idea I gave to
   Rory from a friend and a brilliant direct-marketing consultant,
   Murray Raphel, who’d used the identical strategy to create in-
    stantly a solid customer base for a new delicatessan.
     Rather than build up the deli’s customers slowly with costly
   advertising, Murray reasoned that he could take the same money
   and spend it all at once, up front, giving free lunches to all the
   potential customers who worked near the deli. Then, if the deli
   really delivered a great meal, the customers would return, and
    the business would be built almost overnight. And he wagered
    right.
     His mailing to all the potential customers offering them a
    free lunch, no strings attached, no gimmicks, really, completely
    free, brought a flood of takers. Why wouldn’t it? And the deli
   delivered. So the customers kept coming back and telling their
    friends, and the business boomed virtually from day one.
     This idea is not limited to small businesses dealing with con-
   sumers, either; like all my techniques, it is adaptable to business-
   to-business and industrial situations, too.
     I grew up in Akron, Ohio, and one of our local barons of
