  “Dan Kennedy's smart marketing advice has been of great value to our business. |
  wish I'd read this book back when we started Joan Rivers Products. It certainly would
  have made our journey that much easier.”
  “Dan Kennedy can make dreams come true. You'll get a million dollars worth of value
  from this book. A ‘must read’ for entrepreneurs and CEOs.”
  “At our conferences we deal with thousands of inventors, authors, manufacturers and
  creative people bringing new products to the marketplace. Every one of them would
  profit tremendously by reading Dan Kennedy’s book. He describes every option for
  turning sound ideas into fortunes.”
  “It took us several years of creative persistence to finally bring our product to the
  marketplace. The challenges and obstacles that confronted us made reading your
  book that much more meaningful. We only wish it would have been published sever-
  al years ago. It certainly would have made our task much easier!”
  “As | went through these pages | saw many things I’m already doing. But | was amazed
  to discover how many things I’m not doing—but will do now! And the Million Dollar
  Rolodex at the back of the book is worth ten times the price of the book. You could
  spend $1,000 and attend the seminar, or buy the book and have the seminar at your
  fingertips forever. | like that idea!”
