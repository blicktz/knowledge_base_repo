###### If they buy X, they get one follow-up letter and email sequence. If they buy Y, they get a different follow-up letter sequence and only one email acknowledging the purchase. If they buy one product or service, we know they are good prospects for something else… so we automatically market to them. The CRM will tell the print and mailing house what to send to whom, when. It will send emails to your clients and then follow up based on their actions with the email. Did they open the email? Did they click on a link? Did they reply? It will tell you. If you need someone to follow up with a phone call, the CRM will notify the correct person in your office and continue to harass them about it until the call is made. If you collect data, the CRM will sort their names and contact information into different groups you set up. Whatever needs to be done next to strengthen, deepen, and reinforce the bond between you and your new customer/client/ patient can be programmed into the CRM. And the CRM will see that it gets done.
 If you currently have a CRM that is not doing all these things for you, you may want to investigate all its capabilities and improve your use of it or replace it and/or get outside, expert help with this. Different kinds and sizes of businesses need and can profit from different levels of complexity and sophistication in their CRM. For some very small businesses, Constant Contact is sufficient, but for others it is utterly inadequate. Many can use Keap and/or ClickFunnels. Some need multiple systems interconnected with HubSpot. You should take the time and trouble to diagnose all your needs and opportunities, evaluate different softwares, and get the best toolbox for your purposes. Often, having “fresh eyes” do such diagnosis for you, and having software selected and put into operation for you, is a good option. With it, you buy time and speed to success.

#### Movin’ On Up

###### We want to keep customers, make them more active, and possibly ascend to higher price tiers or higher levels of connection, membership, or activity. The design and use of a good Ascension Ladder is a subject too complex to

-----

###### include here. You can see a good example of one at MagneticMarketing.com. It’s important to know that ascension is the best form of retention.

 In my business, at eLaunchers.com, we want all these things: more engagement, use of more services, retention for a long time, and ascension to higher levels of relationship. Keep in mind, this entire process is programmed into my CRMs (we use multiple ones to manage all of our data). That means everything that I am about to describe is done automatically.
 You start with a free report—like the Success Blueprint on my website. As soon as you request it, I am going to take you to a thank-you page. You are going to receive your digital copy of the Blueprint, and then I am going to say, “I have a couple dozen mind maps of my notes along with some workbooks. I have a marketing planner, a printed copy of the blue book, and maybe a copy of Business Kamasutra. Or maybe just a chapter or two from Business Kamasutra.” I might offer a book from Dan Kennedy, or whatever gift that I wish to give you. I’ll suggest that if you give me your name and address we will ship you these gifts. Another way to do that is to say, “Oh, I’ll ship you all those gifts, but just cover the cost of shipping and handling, and pay $5.” It’s called a self-liquidating offer. The next step is a 20-minute consultation where you are going to meet with me by phone or Zoom. I get to meet you. I get to ask you who you are, what you are, and why you are. In my mind, I want to figure out if we are meant to be together and whether or not I would like you to be on my Ascension Ladder. I will make sure that I will be successful. I’ll make certain that I have the capacity to please you in the manner that you want to be pleased. I’m also going to ensure that you are not going to annoy me. You are going to follow my process, and you are going to allow me to practice my trade. When we need to schedule an appointment, I have an automated process that contacts the

-----

###### client and has them schedule the meeting at a time that is easy for them. When it’s time for a client to ascend to the next rung on the ladder, that marketing campaign fires off and we start asking them to ascend. (This is a specifically timed process that depends on where they are now, how much business they have done with us, how far along with deliverables we are for them, etc.) By the time you consume my four gifts, I would have installed some software codes in your website and your life, which will give me a better look at your technical landscape. Then, I will most likely have the ability to understand your win condition, what makes you pleased, and if I have the capacity to please you that way. Again, keep in mind that all the communication in this process is automated. Everything bringing you to the 20-minute call is automated.
 Now that we are at that stage, we have an initial offer of a free campaign. This is where we would look for a market segment and put together a magnetic offer to attract buyers for you. Maybe it’s a free report, a digital gift, a physical gift, and—if you have Keap/Infusionsoft—a three- to five-step email campaign. We do all of that for you—for free even though it costs me $800 to actually do this free gift. Why would I do that? Well, if you do not buy when we meet for the first time, we will have to chase you. Chasing you means we will have to call you; we will have to meet you; we will have to put you on a long-term nurture campaign. All of that takes time, energy, resources, and money. If I spend all that money that I have earmarked to convert an opportunity into a deal to do something for you, most people will accept that offer easily. This gives me a chance to demonstrate that my process will in fact work for you, and that I actually do have a capacity to make you money. We call this “Experience the Genius.” We are using our CRM in interaction with you, and using your CRM as a tool in our demonstration.
 Think about applying this to whatever you do. How can you automate a series of contacts, automate collection of data useful in determining if someone is an appropriate customer, automate pre-screening so you or your salespeople don’t waste their time, and create a demonstration experience? Dan Kennedy has helped many clients with this, including High Point University (hpu. edu), Dr. Phelps’ Freedom Founders investment club for

##### CHAPTER 7

# Choosing Your Robot Partner:
 What Marketing Automation
 Software Do You Want?

##### By Parthiv Shah

###### Once you standardize and systematize your sales lead generation, marketing, and sales lead conversion processes, you can automate it, often using off-the-shelf marketing automation tools. There is a dizzying array of marketing automation tools on the market. More arriving almost daily. Personally in my business I use ClickFunnels, Keap/Infusionsoft, and HubSpot more than others. I have clients who use Systeme. io, HighLevel, Ontraport, and others, so it’s important that my people are well-versed in multiple software solutions.
 I have been an agnostic application developer for many years. I have experience working with CRMs like Microsoft Dynamics, Zoho, Act!, Sage, Salesforce.com, TeleMagic, GoldMine, and some homegrown systems in Microsoft Access and FileMaker Pro. For email marketing, I have worked on ExactTarget, VerticalResponse, Constant Contact, MailerMailer, Gold Lasso, Mailchimp, and a few others. For e-commerce, I

-----

###### have used too many applications to mention. I have been building landing pages using HTML and SQL databases, and we have our own homegrown PURL engine that can generate personalized URLs. We have even created some advanced applications using my PURL engine and named them PURLIZED GURL and GURLIZED PURL. I am also a certified developer on multiple application platforms, and I have affiliate/ reseller arrangements with almost all platforms.

 So, given all this experience, what do I suggest you need to look for in a CRM?
 A few factors:
1. I always recommend the least expensive application that does everything you need it to do.

That would include what you expect you’ll need in the next 12–24 months. For the sake of
ease, you want it to be not only your marketing automation engine, but also your primary
data warehouse and data intelligence system. We should always look for off-the-shelf
solutions. Sure, you can build a software from scratch with similar functionality, but
wouldn’t that be over-engineering? Slow? Costly?
2. You’ll want a SINGLE DATABASE with multifaceted functionalities. It should create a

record for each human in your system, connect your humans to the company they belong to,
and keep track of all touch points, all emotional interactions, and all fiscal interactions. You
want a SINGLE DATABASE with CRM functionality, marketing automation functionality,
lead capture functionality, e-commerce functionality, Salesforce automation functionality,
and an email marketing system all-in-one.
3. You want a strong support team and network of consultants that are well-versed in the CRM.

A community of consultants is one large collaborative ecosystem. The CRM should support
this community and ideally hold it to really high standards, including an initial exam,
monthly continuing education credit requirements, and an annual recertification exam just to
make sure you are technically competent to belong in the community. In other words,
consider all support that exists behind the software.
4. You want an Open API with an ability to push/pull data from almost any ecosystem. The

CRM you choose should have a record layout that is adaptable to most business situations.
5. It should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
6. It’s great if you can find a precedent, meaning someone who is very successful in your

industry who has used a particular software—and find out what they used. The culture of
sharing information and tribal marketing goes beyond just consultants. I routinely introduce
my clients to one another, so they can collaborate and learn from one another.

-----

7. It should integrate ALL channels of communications: email, letter, fax, voice broadcast, text

messaging in an online and offline environment.
8. It should tell humans what to do, and if humans do not do what they need to do, the system

will keep reminding them until the human clicks on a button that “the call was made” or “the
gift was sent out.”

###### Here is the Business Kamasutra campaign diagram. You CAN implement this yourself. As a matter of fact, if you reach out to my office and ask me for the campaign blueprint from my Infusionsoft, I will

#### The Business Kamasutra

###### I use what I call the Business Kamasutra.
 Let us look at various elements of a typical Business Kamasutra campaign and how it works.

1. **Lead Generation: You will go through the segmentation and approach to generate**

QUALITY traffic to your website home page, a destination page, or a campaign-specific
microsite or landing page. You can use WordPress to build your website and Leadpages.net
or an Optimize Press plugin for WordPress to build landing pages, thank-you pages, and tella-friend pages. The Business Kamasutra campaign has TWO web forms. One is called Initial
Squeeze. This squeeze will capture NAME, EMAIL, and TELEPHONE NUMBER.

When you fill out your name, email, and telephone number, you are taken to a thank-you
page, which is in fact a second squeeze. On the second squeeze page I will deliver the gift I
promised on page one, and I will ask you to share your physical address so I can ship you a
“box.” The box would have a multi-piece literature package we call a Shock & Awe
package, a gift of some sort, a book (preferably written by the marketer), and an invitation to
take the next step (the low resistance offer).

There is a school of thought that believes that you should only capture an email, or name
and email. Many believe that asking for a telephone number in stage one will reduce your
traffic to lead capture ratio. For what it’s worth, I agree that asking for a telephone number
and making it a required field will eliminate prospects who would have been okay giving
you just their email. Personally, I am okay with not talking to prospects who are so
concerned about their privacy that I cannot get their contact information. My GOAL is to
have a conversation with each prospect, identify their needs, and see if they qualify to be a
client. Their privacy preferences are of little relevance to me. I just want to find out who I
can talk to and whether or not they can buy! Once I am convinced that I want you as a
customer, of course your preferences and priorities are of significant importance to me.
(Please understand that this is an opinion, not an insight. I do not claim to have data to
substantiate that my position is better. I just have a VERY FIRM opinion on this matter.) The
two-step, two-squeeze page method is designed to address the concern of people resistant to
disclosing full contact information.
2. **Lead Conversion: New Lead Follow-Up Sequence is included in this step. This is a three-**

to-five email follow-up sequence with at least two telephone follow-up steps. The purpose of
this sequence is to reiterate the message of the landing page and persuade the prospect to
schedule an appointment with the marketer to discuss your mutual interests. If the prospect
does not schedule an appointment, the prospect is placed on a LONG-TERM NURTURE
sequence. You might omit phone follow-up. You might add follow-up by mail or even
FedEx.

-----

3. **Long-Term Nurture: This is a 24-month campaign that includes a quarterly print magazine,**

a monthly newsletter (no newsletter in the month you publish the magazine), a monthly
holiday card in print, a twice-a-year gift of some sort, and a twice-a-year email newsletter.
This is IN ADDITION to occasional special marketing efforts to convert an unconverted
lead and lost opportunity. Such a thing would be impractical without full automation.
4. **Appointment Confirmation Sequence: When someone clicks to request an appointment,**

you want to send out information about the initial consultation, directions to your office (if it
is an in-person appointment), rules of engagement, what you are trying to accomplish during
the initial consultation, and what decision you expect them to make when they meet you for
the first time.
5. **Appointment Prognosis Sequences: There are only three prognoses of an initial sales**

appointment. There will be either an Appointment No-Show, an Appointment No-Sale, or
Sold and “Welcome to Our Practice.” You want to have an email, print, and telephone
sequence for each scenario, and the correct sequence should be triggered, depending on the
prognosis of the appointment.
6. **Ascension and Tell-a-Friend Effort: When the client makes the initial purchase, WHILE**

YOU ARE FULFILLING WHAT THEY BOUGHT, you want to ascend them into
something else. If you don’t sell them something else before the first transaction is over, you
are dealing with a “lost customer reactivation situation,” which is much more difficult
compared to ascending an existing customer. Be prepared to have your next gig ready before
you are even close to delivering the first product. Remember, a buyer is a buyer is a buyer is
a buyer.
7. **Customer Long-Term Nurture: This is important. Your customers should also get your**

long-term nurture. Your name should be in front of your prospects and your clients in a
meaningful way.

###### This describes my Kamasutra for my businesses and ones for clients such as dentists, cosmetic surgeons, law offices, and financial advisors. It may need to be tweaked for your business, but all businesses are more the same than they are different. This campaign will require development of about a dozen web pages, copy for about three dozen email messages, telephone scripts, and a substantial amount of print material.
 You may not be able to afford to spend the same kind of money these businesses can to nurture a prospect. If your revenue model does not justify printing a $40 Shock & Awe package, along with a $10 book, in a $20 FedEx box, etc., you may have to settle for just sending a PRINTED LETTER inviting them to a URL where they can read your Shock & Awe online. Do NOT send an email asking them to click. You can use a software like Issuu.com to publish a digital publication and place it right on your
