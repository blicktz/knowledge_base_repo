At that point, we’ve bridged $4.00 + $5.40 + $6.00, total $15.40 of the gap. Remaining gap:
$14.60. We’re roughly halfway there. Going back to the drawing board on price strategy, we test “2
payments of $29.00” vs. the price of $49.00. It does not suppress response, and causes very few
non-payment or collection problems. Factoring those in, the net gain is $7.00. The gap is now down
to: $8.00. By using the same “2 payments” and a slight price bump with the other offers—
book+DVD, and book+DVD+drink mix, another $2.00 in net is snagged, reducing the gap to $6.00.

At this point, the publisher is feeling confident enough to find and hire a celebrity to endorse the
book, who could be used in the direct-mail piece, for a cost of $25,000.00 per year divided by
16,000 units of sale, worsening the gap by $1.56. But as we both expect, it cuts $5.00 off the cost
per sale, a net gain of $3.44, leaving a gap of only $2.56.

In a final act of desperation, we increase the regular shipping and handling charge by $1.20, and
offer a new, expedited shipment option for another $1.60 on top of basic.

_Whew._

There are now 16,000 sales to be made per year at a $5.00 front-end profit, putting $80,000.00
net profit in the bank. There are also 16,000 customers with known interests, who will buy books,
DVDs, and products related to health and longevity. There is no cost of acquiring these customers
again; new and additional books can be created and brought to them, repeatedly. If this entrepreneur
were to average an annual net profit per customer of only $10.00 after the fact of the first sale, that
first year’s crop of customers would yield $160,000.00; the 2nd year, 32,000 customers yield
$320,000.00; 3rd year 48,000 customers yields $480,000.00. With reasonable spending restraint and
prudent savings, this fellow is a cash-in-the-bank millionaire in under 5 years.

A much bigger publishing business that operates in the health arena very much along these lines
(although not the basis for this example) is Rodale Books. If you are curious about all this, beyond
illustration of bridging the gap, you might look them up online. And, if you’re curious about the
self-publishing and information marketing businesses, check out the Information Marketing
[Association at www.info-marketing.org.](http://www.info-marketing.org/)

OK, I know that was exhausting. But the willingness of the business owner to work at bridging
gaps is a big factor in success or failure, especially if trying to grow and expand a business. For
many businesses, bridging a gap is not so complex and arduous. But even if it is, the asset owned
afterward can be well worth it.

The most important thing to exit this chapter with is an _attitude: that bad economics may be_
transformed to good economics with sufficient cleverness and effort if the pay-off is worth the
effort, but that you want to avoid saddling yourself with any poorer profit margins and profits in
dollars than absolutely necessary—so there’s enough money to be aggressive with marketing.

## Welcome to Math Class

Class is in session—and you would rather be outdoors, playing. Or doing just about
anything but math. I get it. I empathize. But this isn’t ordinary math. This is Money Math.
Essential and profitable.

**How a 10% Price Increase Doubles Profit**

Assume you sell a $100.00 item, with $50.00 cost of goods, another $10.00 in fulfillment
costs, a $20.00 cost-per-sale for advertising and marketing, and $16.00 allocated to fixed
overhead. Your profit is $4.00. If you can sell at just $10.00 more, but incur very minor
cost increases—say $5.00 in cost of goods, $1.00 in fulfillment, and no increase in the
cost of making the sale or overhead, your profit jumps to $8.00. The 10% price increase

-----

created a 100% profit improvement. Maybe that’s not exciting to you in the $4.00 to $8.00
neighborhood, but add zeroes and look at it as $400.00 vs. $800.00, or $4,000.00 vs.
$8,000.00.

**How To Go Broke with Rising Sales**

In their book How To Sell at Margins Higher Than Your Competitors, leading authority on
price-preservation in B2B selling, Larry Steinmetz, and my good friend, the late Bill
Brooks, assert that “most entities that go broke do so during a period of increases in sales
volume. This statement shocks most people because everyone believes businesses fail as a
result of lack of sales. However, business is not a game of volume; business is always a
game of margin. If a business doesn’t maintain gross margin at an adequate level, it is
going to go bust—regardless of sales volume.” Here’s their illustrations of three ways
margins can get away from you:
#1: If you cut price by $5.00 to sell something:

#2: If you fail to raise price when costs go up:

#3: If you find costs going up $5 and only raise your price by the amount of your cost
increase:

At first blush, you may look at Larry and Bill’s chart and think: no big deal. 2%, 3%, even
5%, in the grand scheme of things, so what? But there are two big so-what’s. First, a lot of
businesses operate at net profits as low as 5% to 20%. If you operate at 20 and drop 2,
oops, your take-home pay just took a real 10% haircut. Second, if this turns into a pattern
of mis-calculating or ignoring the true effects of margin and margin-by-percentage, it will
re-occur, and a 2% drop followed by another 2% drop by another 2% drop = 6%. But if
you operate at 20%, that’s a take-home pay haircut of 30%.

**How You Can Make as Much or More Money Serving Fewer, Better Customers**

In his seminars, Larry spends a lot of time on many examples of this, because it is such a
scary and difficult concept for salespeople and business owners to wrap their heads
around. You CAN afford to lose a shockingly, mind-bending amount of volume and still
make as much net money from minor price increases that drive away a quantity of
customers. A typical example from Larry has a company “suffering” a 27% decline in
gross sales, from $1-million to $729,927.00, produced by a whopping 34% drop in the

-----

number of units-of-sale/customers served, yet preserving the same net profit—from just a
10% price increase. Space here prohibits showing that entire math example or others, nor
do I want to replicate Larry’s excellent work. I refer you to: [LawrenceSteinmetz.com.](http://lawrencesteinmetz.com/)
Here, take my word for the math for a moment, and consider the implications. It’s
possible that less infrastructure, fewer employees and the headaches that come with them,
or shorter weeks or fewer hours’ open for business, a lot fewer customers or clients—
discarding the worst and keeping the best, less stress, and time to craft and deliver
excellent products /service could yield as much or more net, take-home income. This is
how Price Strategy can translate to personal benefit and lifestyle improvement, not just
different numbers on a financial statement.

Clever Math = Same Excitement, Lower Cost, Better Profit

[Keith and Travis Lee at American Retail Supply and 3DMailing Results.com are brilliant](http://results.com/)
B2B marketers of promotional merchandise and turn-key promotion campaigns for all
kinds of businesses as well everything from store shelving to routine supplies for retailers.
Here’s a clever discount strategy they used. “Most marketers simply do a percentage—
20% Off, 50% Off. We used to do that, then switched to running occasional discount
promotions with a set dollar discount at various order size points. But as you can see in
our anniversary promotion (shown at end of this section), we actually DECREASED the
percentage as the order size went up. Counter-intuitive yes. More profitable, also yes. The
$40.00 off order up to $200.00 equals a maximum discount of 20% but the $80.00 off an
order up to $500.00 provides a maximum discount of just 16%. Buy more, save $40.00
more but 4% less. Results: 47 clients placed orders averaging $2,026.26 and took
advantage of the $80.00 savings—just a 3.95% discount given. (Total sales: $95,234.22).
78 other clients took the $40.00 discount, average order was $278.47, yielding an average
discount of 14.37%. (Total sales: $21,720.66). Had we done a straight 20% OFF
promotion, we would have given up $16,507.97 in discounts that, instead, stayed with us.
You might speculate that offering 20% OFF rather than the set $40.00 and $80.00 might
have produced more than enough extra sales to make up for that $16,000.00, but in our
experience, based on careful testing, that is not the case. In fact, the flat 20% takes that
full bite out of every added dollar of revenue without compensating benefit. We’ve had
enough experience with this in our business to know that the flat dollar amounts off, tied
to order size, create just as much response and volume as did % offers.”

This is the kind of sage advice that Keith and Travis give their [3DMailingResults.com](http://3dmailingresults.com/)
clients, and share in their local area as Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] Independent
Business Consultants, with local Chapter members.

This is a perfect example of how the very same discount promotion idea can be
implemented with slight variation, yet the Money Math differential is substantial. One
slight tweak, $16,000.00 of additional profits captured or $16,000.00 of additional,
unproductive expense incurred.

**How To Run Your Numbers**

The dilemma: if you raise prices, sales could fall—as with Larry’s example—but will that
bring less profit or more? If you cut prices, you need to know how much sales need to
increase to compensate for your margins—which have probably shrunk further than you
think. Microsoft Excel[®] can help you do the math. An article/ tutorial, How To Use Calc_Plots To Plan Pricing Strategies, and related tools can be found at_ [ExcelSolutions.com,](http://excelsolutions.com/)
[ExcelUser.com, and in an e-book,](http://exceluser.com/) _Dashboard Reporting with Excel by Charley Kyd._
These resources enable you to create different price increase/ decrease, units of sale, and
margin scenarios and have them depicted graphically for you by plugging in numbers.

**Hate To Crunch Numbers?**

Me too. But here’s a fact from my 30+ years of doing marketing consulting with business
owners: those making the most money, especially those growing businesses from small to
big and getting rich by doing so, know their numbers inside and out, thoroughly,
completely, and just can’t be stumped by a numbers question. Those who can be easily

stumped are usually poor or headed there. In addition to the above resources—studying
Steinmetz, and getting and using Excel tools or something like them—I urge reading
