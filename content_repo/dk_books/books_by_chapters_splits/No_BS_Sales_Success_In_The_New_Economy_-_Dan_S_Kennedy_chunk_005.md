## themselves exceptional and exceptionally deserving. To the rest, I say: let them eat crumbs.
 This is a book intended to equip you to gain membership in—and keep membership in—that elite fraternity enjoying the top incomes, the greatest security, the most independence and power, and the highest status. If that is not where you sincerely, sincerely, sincerely want to be, it will be wasted on you; may be too blunt and direct and “No B.S.” for you; may suggest an “accept nothing less than the sale made” attitude you’ll find predatory or militaristic, that you just won’t like. If you prefer a more mamby-pampby approach, the bookstore shelves are full of books on selling featuring just that—feel free to trade this in. But if you want to be at the top of The New Economy and are willing to do whatever is required to be there, this is the book for you.
 This book summarizes the most important strategies I’ve developed over my 30 years—some originating from my own experience, some originating from my observation of super-successful sales pros’ behaviors, then converted to replicatable strategy, and all honed to perfection by my high six-figure and seven-figure earning clients I coach, and top sales companies I devise strategies for. These trustworthy strategies are placed in the context of The New Economy and its demands.
 There are a great many things this book is NOT. It is NOT, for example, a textbook approach to selling. It is not about moral or spiritual philosophy (those matters are left to you). It is noticeably free of trendy new terminology, buzzwords, and psychobabble so many sales trainers and authors seem to be fond of. And it is not a motivational book either. If you need someone else to motivate you, you have far bigger problems than this book might tackle. Or any hundred books, for that matter.
 This is simply, a straightforward, relentlessly pragmatic, “no b.s.” presentation of what REALLY works in selling.
 Not what should work. Not the academic theories about selling. What REALLY works.
 You may not thoroughly enjoy this book. It may make you uncomfortable. Confronting, challenging, and rethinking longheld beliefs and habits is provocative and often profitable, but rarely comfortable or enjoyable. But you can trust this book.
 My aim is very simple: after reading this book, I intend for you to implement behavioral and procedural changes that will immediately and

## dramatically increase the income you earn from selling. This book is all about putting more money in your pocket, nothing loftier than that, nothing less than that. And if we have to break a few eggs to make that omelet, then that’s what we’ll do.
 You might want to know, this book has had a former life and a long life. It was first published in 1994, continuously through 1996, a 2nd edition published in 1999, then in print through 2001, then a thoroughly updated and substantially expanded new edition was published in 2004. Of course, a whole lot happened between 2004 and 2009. A tumultuous five years. And those changes manufacturing The New Economy required yet another update of this book. But why is it important for you to know you’ve wound up with “the sales book that will not die” in your hands? Two reasons. First, as evidence you’ve gotten your paws on strategies that ARE really valuable and that DO really work. Successful salespeople recommend this book to each other, they stream to the bookstores, demand it, and even when a publisher has lost interest in it, the marketplace has insisted it be put back onto the store shelves. (By the way, now you can tell others about this book by sending them to www.nobsbooks.com, to get free excerpts. And you will find additional resources and support material for the book as well as previews of my other books—even free, view-on-demand videos—there as well.) Anyway, second, no matter its most recent updating, you will still be able to find references in the book that are obviously dated, or references to my writing of its first or prior editions, and I didn’t want you to be confused by that, thus this explanation. Given the time lapse between writing and publishing, it’s impossible for a book to be perfectly current. Furthermore, great object lessons should continue being told, however much time has passed.
 Now, to the important stuff: quick, practical actions you can take, to make selling easier, less stressful, more fun, and much, much more lucrative and rewarding.

# About the Structure of This Book

## This book is divided into five parts. In PART I, I describe the 15 strategies that I use most in selling. Each is a stand-alone application and any one of them alone could significantly improve your results in selling. But they can also be linked together differently for different situations for increased value and power.
 In PART II, I deal with what goes on before selling can even begin: finding, attracting, and getting into a desirable selling situation with a prospect. As you’ll see, I’m no fan of the way most salespeople carry out this job. Here you’ll discover some rather radical ideas.
 In PART III, I provide a framework for selling. The various pieces described in PARTS I and II can be plugged in and out of this structure.
 In PART IV, I share with you the dumbest things salespeople do to sabotage themselves.
 In PART V, I reveal my personal best, most valued, contrary approach to selling. It may not be for everybody; it may not be for you. Frankly, I argued with myself about putting it in or leaving it out. I ultimately decided I would not be playing fair with you if I sold you a book about selling and held back the information most responsible for my own success. Use it as you will, and good luck.
