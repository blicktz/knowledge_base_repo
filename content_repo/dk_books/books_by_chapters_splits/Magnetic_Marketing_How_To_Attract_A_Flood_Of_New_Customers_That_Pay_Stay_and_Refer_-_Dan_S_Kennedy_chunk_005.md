KNOWING THE WHO IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU’LL DO

 There’s a story about legendary copywriter Gary Halbert, who

 once asked a room of aspiring writers, “Imagine you’re

 opening a hamburger stand on the beach—what do you need

-----

###### most to succeed?” Answers included, “secret sauce,” and

 “great location” and “quality meat.” Halbert replied, “You

 missed the most important thing—A STARVING CROWD.”

 Your job is to find that “starving crowd” who can’t live

 without what it is you have to offer.
 What we want to do in terms of targeting is to find good,

 prospective customers for our business that can be reached

 affordably, that are likely to buy, that are able to buy, and

 preferably who already know of us, or are likely to trust us.
 Once you get this down, and you nail exactly who your

 slam-dunk customer truly is—the person you absolutely want

 to do business with over and again—then you’ll be able to

 make your marketing “magnetic” because you’ll be using

 words and phrases that’ll attract your target audience. This makes your job much easier, because you can talk to them

 using language they relate to about what it is they really

 want.

##### WHAT YOUR WHO REALLY WANTS

###### Knowing exactly what your perfect customer wants to buy is

 NOT as simple as it might seem. For example, there’s the old

 story of the guy walking into the hardware store looking for a

 3/4” drill bit. The mistake that’s easily made is thinking the customer wants a 3/4” inch drill bit.

 Wrong. He wants a 3/4” inch hole
. The drill bit is just the

 hoop he has to jump through to get it.

 Let’s take it a step further than recognizing the “want” for a

 3/4” inch hole… what’s the underlying need driving THAT desire? Is it simply to hang a picture? Or does our homeowner

-----

###### crave a lifestyle surrounded by elegance that makes their

 home the envy of family, friends, and coworkers? So it’s not

 just about merely needing a hole, it’s about Pride and an increased sense of Self-Worth.

 That’s a much deeper longing and tapping into THAT is

 where you want to connect with your WHO. You want to solve

 their problem, not just sell them something.

 It’s very easy to get this wrong in your messaging. For example, you’ll see financial planners competing with

 one another offering “estate plans.” Not that there’s anything

 wrong with estate planning, it’s a definite need in the minds

 of many fifty-plus year olds. But compare the phrasing

 “Looking for an estate plan?” to “Interested in a solution to take care of your family when you’re gone?”

 That’s a much stronger, more emotional way of connecting

 to the prospective customer using terms and phrasing that

 resonates to what’s going on inside their heads.

 Another example might concern a simple service like a children’s magician, whose primary market is selling birthday

 party magic shows to moms. A headline that reads “Joe Blow

 the Magician” followed by text all about Joe is appealing if

 “Joe” is world-renowned (not likely). Better messaging would be “Imagine: A Birthday Party Your Child Will Remember and

 Treasure Forever—Guaranteed!”

 That’s what Mom really wants. Sorry Joe.

 To help you better understand this concept, and how it

 might affect you and your business, here are fifteen different industries and what their WHO really wants.

-----

###### 1. Financial Services: Financial services can mean a lot of things.

Maybe you sell insurance, annuities, or stocks. Or maybe you have the

ability to sell a mix of products to serve the needs of your clients.

Whatever your particular specialty, in this industry, the name of the

game is “ **peace** .” What you’re really doing is helping people avoid

the 3 a.m. sweats.

No one wants to worry about whether they can put their kids through

college or becoming a burden to their family when they’re old. The

idea of running out of money with life left to live is downright

frightening.

If you’re at the higher end of service in this niche and serving the ultra
wealthy, you too are providing peace. It’s a different kind of peace, of

course. It’s the kind that results in knowing that all of their work and

investments won’t be washed away by a few bad economic cycles.

Those folks would like to know that they’ve provided true generational

wealth for their grandkids. In addition to selling your own expertise and

trustworthiness, your target market needs to believe that YOU have

the ultimate solution to their 3 a.m. sweats problem … that their

PEACE is what your business is all about.

###### 2. Insurance: There are variables in this industry depending on the type

of insurance you sell. But in all cases, as the name suggests, you are

selling **peace of mind** . Don’t think this is a luxury people won’t

invest in. They want to sleep well at night knowing that the worst-case

scenario will NOT happen to them because they have you. **They want**

**peace** and aside from talking about the particulars of great rates,

service, etc., people are yearning for you to show them that with you,

they can finally stop worrying.

-----

###### 3. Legal: In the legal industry, no matter what particular niche you

serve, the number one thing you’re selling is **advocacy** . People need

to know that someone they can trust is in THEIR corner. They need

someone on their side.

So, if you represent men in divorce and custody battles, oftentimes

you may be the ONLY person who is on their side that they can trust.

And this holds true in every legal niche … taxes, personal injury, estate

law, family, bankruptcy.

People might say they want to pay less in taxes (of course they do),

that they want custody of their kids (hopefully, they do), etc. But what

they really want is to know that they’ve got someone in their corner,

fighting for the best possible outcome for them .

It’s a lonely world out there. People need an expert like you to be on

their team when they’re going through tough times or preparing for

the future.

###### 4. Health & Wellness: There’s a lot to sell in the health and wellness

industry and so much of it can be surface level stuff that’s obvious.

Focusing on the obvious won’t get you the deep connection you need

to solidify your relationship with your market. Yes, we all want a sexy

body, a longer life, energy, a healthier heart, body, and mind. And

some of those things are really deep and personal.

But if you go deeper, you’ll see that what people really want as it

relates to health and wellness is **confidence** . So in this industry,

confidence is the REAL thing you’re selling. Sometimes we’re talking

about deep down confidence and the comfort in your own skin that

comes from being fit and strong.

Sometimes it’s the confidence you feel from knowing that you’re

fueling your body with the best nutrition available. And sometimes the

-----

confidence you’re selling is about having the confidence to know that

you’re fit enough to walk around an amusement park with your

children.

With the internet at our fingertips and a constantly changing narrative

from health experts, people are easily confused. What they need most

from you is confidence that if they buy from you or work with you to

achieve their goal, they’re doing the right thing for themselves or for

their families and that they will be able to achieve that goal.

###### 5. Chiropractic: There are obviously a lot of different niches you could

serve in this industry. But, let’s say for a moment that you serve the

elderly demographic. You might think that they just want to be able to

play a little more golf or keep up with their grandkids. Those things

might be true and they’ll certainly admit to them.

But if you go deeper, you’ll find that **they want to be the envy of all**

**of their friends who are falling apart** . That’s the secret ego

motivation that inspires them to find you. And further, they do NOT

want to be put into a nursing home. That’s the secret fear that has

them searching for you. Sell them abilities their friends don’t have and

you’ll have them eating out of your hand.

###### 6. Dentistry: There are two big things people REALLY want from their

dentist. They will usually tell you about the first thing but not the

second. First, they don’t want to feel a thing. Even people who don’t

have a dramatic fear of the dentist share this desire. Dentists are

associated with pain for good reason and mouth pain is the worst. This

fear of pain is deep and real for just about everyone on planet Earth so

it needs your attention. But what they really come to you for is

**confidence** . This is the thing that they usually won’t say out loud.

Men and women alike just want to feel attractive. They want to feel

-----

confident when they speak and smile. So while you must address the

pain issue, what people are willing to put their fears aside for is the

possibility that you can give them a smile they can be proud of. Sell

that deep down confidence.

###### 7. Fitness: Much the same as the health and wellness industry, in

fitness, you’re selling much more than a sexy body or healthy heart.

What **people really want is to believe that they can be a**

**version of themselves that has only ever been imaginary up**

**until this point.** They want to believe that it’s possible to be that

person … the person who feels incredibly confident about the way he

or she looks and rightfully so. That’s who you can help them be. Keep

in mind that mentioning the work involved with this achievement is a

turnoff. People want to believe that they can easily, magically,

transform into their best self. Sell that transformation.

###### 8. Service Business: Why choose one plumber over another? Or, why

choose one landscaper, babysitter, tutor, contractor, or mechanic over

another one out there? Again, this will vary depending on the service

you provide. But a lot of this comes down to consistently showing

people that you want the business and backing up that demonstration

with consistently excellent service, **the kind of treatment that**

**you’d give your own mother.**

###### No one wants to hire the guy who wants the work. We all want to hire the guy who would be glad to fit

 us in and take a look and then takes us under his

 wing and tells us that we’ve been spending too much

 and he has a cheaper solution or that our tires will

 actually last another eighteen months. We want someone to show us that we can count on them to

 take good care of us.

-----

###### 9. Sales: Sales is a broad industry and what people REALLY want

depends on what you sell. But if you’re up against three other suits

and you’re all making the same offer, always remember that the

winner is usually the person who puts extra time and effort into the

relationship. What does that tell us about what people really want?

They want to feel like you care about helping them. They want to feel

like you are excited about earning their business. **They REALLY want**

**to feel important.**

###### 10. Real Estate: A lot like the legal profession, people want an advocate.

So they need to know that YOU are in THEIR corner. Real estate is one

of those fields where the laws are different everywhere and always

changing. The confusion makes it such that the average citizen cannot

properly advocate for himself or herself. They need an expert. And

while they may say that they want to get a great price, **what they**

**REALLY want is an expert in their corner fighting for them.** You

are really selling that hero.

###### 11. Retail: Assuming you sell clothes, people want much more than deep

discounts, great service, and a great selection. These are the things

they’ll tell you they want. But what they won’t say is that they want to

walk out of your store feeling like the most fashionable, attractive,

“together” version of themselves. If you sell suits to men, they want to

walk out feeling “like a man” who commands respect! If you sell casual

clothes to women, they want to walk out feeling like they can take on

the world looking amazing, no matter what life throws at them. **It’s**

**about transformation.** Your marketing needs to address the

transformation, not just the discounts or other details.

###### 12. Automotive: If you own a repair shop, what your customers really

want will be different than if you sell detailing services. So it’s

important to know your market. But assuming you’re in the repair

-----

business-people will outright tell you that they don’t want to be ripped

off and they want to preserve the investment they’ve made in their

vehicle.

But what they secretly want is to never have to come into your shop

for service. And when they do, **they don’t want it to disturb their**

**lives at all** . They don’t want to feel it. Obviously this is something

you can’t actually give them. But you can address all of this in your

sales copy. You should be using language that talks about how you’re

in the business of keeping the people in your town in motion for longer

because no one wants to slow down to take care of their vehicle.

###### 13. Restaurant: There will always be people who come for a free meal or

because the fridge is empty, they’re short on time, or just didn’t plan

dinner. But at the end of the day, people choose a restaurant for a

bigger reason than all of these reasons. What they really want is a

**positive or memorable experience.** When they imagine where

they’ll eat tonight, their brains are processing what the experience will

be like. Will everyone be in a good mood? Will they have a good time?

Yes, some of those things hinge on quality, price, service, and speed.

But what you’re really selling is a “good time.”

###### 14. Coaching & Consulting: If you’re in the coaching and consulting

field, you might think you’re selling support, guidance, camaraderie, or

a helping hand. But people typically want much more than all of this

from their coach or consultant. In fact, they really want to **believe**

**that they already have the ability** within themselves to achieve

their goals.

So while what they say they want is success in your area of expertise,

what they really want is someone to show them how to bring out the

best of themselves and the power already within to achieve their

goals. This is true whether you teach yoga, piano, or business success.

-----

The key for you to focus on is that whatever they want to achieve in

this area, they already are quite capable. Your role is to first show

them that they actually do have this power and then to show them

how to use it.

###### 15. Info-marketing: You may think you’re selling specialized knowledge

in a particular field, but what you’re really selling here is

**transformation** .

Let’s say you help financial advisors make more money with your info
marketing business … you may have coaching groups, products to help

them succeed at certain aspects of the business, and maybe even

some done-for-you elements. At the end of the day, it’s not information

that they want from you (yes, the name of this industry is deceiving).

What you’re really marketing is the life they want for themselves. They

want to know that you can help them achieve the transformation

they’re looking for. That you can help them go from where they are

now (a) to where they want to be (b).

If your info-business provides parenting solutions to people with

troubled, adopted teens (point a—this is where they are now), you’re

selling a happy, well-adjusted kid that grows into a loving, productive

adult (point b—the transformation they want to achieve).

People want the “dream” and your job is to show them that your

products and/or services will be the catalyst for that transformation.

And in the case of this parenting info-biz, those parents also have their

own selfish, internal motives. They want to know that they are the best

parent they can be … that they’re doing everything they possibly can

for their child. So in this case, it’s transformation plus pride.

As you can tell, there’s a lot to truly understanding your WHO and

what matters most to them. It requires a lot of careful thought and

-----

analysis, but the rewards are well worth it.

Having a solid understanding is only the first step though. Now you

need to connect what THEY want with what YOU have to offer. And it all

takes shape with a simple triangle...
