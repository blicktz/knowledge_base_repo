 shows, almost all from home over the phone, and have sold
 well over 21,000 copies of two of their self-published books
 just by giving out their 800 number, with zero advertising
 expense.
   Joe and Judy self-published their first book, How to Get the
 Job You Really Want and Get Employers to Call You, as a result
 of Joe’s experience helping his son create a direct-mail campaign
 to prospective employers that worked like gangbusters. Joe
 started out by calling radio talk show producers and booking
 himself, and then he devised more sophisticated, less arduous
 methods. He did all the interviews from home by phone, and
 simply, enthusiastically told the story of how he helped his son
 quickly and easily land a great job, then offered his book for
 $15 and gave out his toll-free 800 number. In the first year alone,
 Joe sold over 3,000 books. —
   Joe and Judy have been at this now since 1986, making book
 after book after book a profitable success just through radio talk
 shows. But their strategy will work for other types of products
 and businesses, too. In fact, they’ve helped people with a wide
 variety of products use radio talk shows as a primary marketing
 method. |
   There are over 700 general interest radio talk shows in Joe’s
 database, and talk radio has enjoyed explosive growth in the past
 several years, with no end in sight. And every show’s hosts and
 producers are in constant, sometimes frantic, search for good,
 articulate, interesting, entertaining, or controversial guests who
 can hold listeners’ attention and, on call-in shows, make the
 switchboard light up.
  My friend Al Parinello has been the host of his own nation-
 ally syndicated radio talk show and has interviewed over 3,000
 people. He has owned and operated radio stations, worked on
 the development of both Nickelodeon and The Movie Channel,
 appeared as a guest on many talk shows, and has pioneered the
 use of radio infomercials. TV Guide called him ‘‘one of a new
 breed of space-age super salesmen.’’ Al gave me this great ex-
 ample of the power of radio talk shows:

       the topic of retirement planning. This is not an especially
       scintillating topic and I was worried that things would get
       a little boring. But, happily, the guest surprised me. He
       revealed that the Social Security Agency is making seri-
       ous mistakes in more than 10 percent of all accounts, and
       he gave out his 800 number for listeners to call, and he
      would give them, free of charge, the form they needed to
       get an analysis of their account from the government.
                     | The radio station’s phones rang off the hook and we
       had a lively and interesting program.
        The insurance agent got more than 1,800 calls to his
      number, gaining 1,800 potential clients’ names, addresses,
      telephone numbers, and interest. Needless to say, this led
       to selling a lot of insurance.
     And this was just in New York, on a local radio station.
     This same strategy could be used nationally, with interviews
    on hundreds of stations, to sell books, newsletters, or other prod-
    ucts related to seniors’ finances and retirement activities.
     Getting on radio talk shows is mostly a matter of persistence
   and grunt work. Here are the steps:
    1. From one of a number of sources, including those listed in
     chapter 13, you need to compile your own target list of sta-
     tions, program managers, and talk show hosts. You may have
      a geographic preference and only want to go after stations in
     certain states or cities. Maybe you want to start with small
     stations or maybe you only want to target the 100 biggest
     stations in the country. Using criteria that match your partic-
     ular objectives, you create your target list. For my most recent
      effort, for certain reasons, I went after only those stations of
     a certain size that carried the Rush Limbaugh syndicated
     program.
    2. You begin communicating with a basic news release, simple
      letter, flyer, or even a postcard. Joe Sabah uses an oversize
     postcard printed on a garish, eye-catching colored stock. I
     prefer the more traditional approach of a brief cover letter

```

-----

```
   creasingly common to send the news releases by fax, too.
    The cover letter should identify who you are, the name
   of your company or organization, the book or product or idea
   you are publicizing, and why you and it will be of great in-
   terest to the station’s listeners. The news release, like a news
   article, needs to be real news. It should have an attention-
   getting headline. The host or producer will be looking for the
   news angle, for what is provocative, predictive, or timely.
    Some people also include other support materials, such as
   suggested questions for the interview, reprints of articles
   about them from major media, book covers or actual copies
   of books, or reference letters from other radio station hosts
   to document that they are good guests, give good interviews,
   and attract lots of callers.
     Instead of sending all this material at one time, an effec-
   tive alternative strategy is to dole it out in a series of several
   mailings a few days apart.
    . Many hosts and program producers are diligent about exam-
   ining all of this material, and if they believe your topic will
   interest their listeners. and light up the switchboard, they will
   book you. However, the door never slams shut all the way,
   so if you fail to stimulate their interest with the first contact,
   you can keep trying. Here’s where the grunt work comes in:
  Nothing beats getting on the phone, calling, talking briefly
   with these people personally and then, if you get them inter-
   ested, immediately faxing or FedExing your materials to them
   again. This takes a lot of time, patience, and persistence.
   You’ll play a lot of phone tag. You’ll call at bad times, find
   out when you can reach a person, and have to call back. But
   it can pay off. After one recent mailing campaign to 130
   stations, we called them all, persevered in getting through to
   the right individuals, and found that fewer than twenty re-
  membered receiving and looking at the mailing: But, with the
  phone contact and sending the material again and following
  up by phone again, we’ve gotten very good results.
   . If at first you don’t succeed, try again, with a new angle. Let’s

     present you as ‘‘The Dog Trainer to the Stars.’’ You might
     time this with the Academy Awards, so you could be inter-
     viewed about Hollywood celebrities’ pets. In November, you
     might go with a ‘‘Warning to Parents About Buying Dogs as
     Gifts for Your Children.’’ Different hosts and producers will
     respond differently to different presentations at different
     times.
      An Entire Business Built on Talk Radio Interviews
     Now, here’s the most inventive strategy I’ve ever heard: A
    client of mine, who has asked not to be named, and requested
    that I ‘‘disguise’’ the nature of his product and business revealed
    this to me. I give it to you here as a “‘disguised’’ but nonetheless
    valid example.
     Bob M. is a former pro athlete who develops, manufactures,
   and markets a couple of unique health-related products. He picks
    a market, and gets just one health food store or sporting goods
    store in a well-known mall to take an inventory of his product
    on consignment for just one week. He puts the inventory in en-
    tirely at his expense and splits the sales with the store fifty-fifty.
   Then he does a blitz of every local radio and TV talk show he
    can get on, talking about his career, ideas, and products, and tells
   everybody when he’ll be at that store to meet them in person.
   Each day, he does interviews during the day, spends the evening
    at the store, and finishes the week by being at the store on
    Saturday.
      In most cities, he’ll do at least $20,000 in business during
    the week. He’s done as much as $50,000 in a single week. After
    the split with the store, travel costs, mailings to the media, and
    his cost of product, Bob keeps about 20 percent of his gross;
   $2,000 on $10,000. He usually works two weeks out of every
   month and takes two weeks off. Last year, he grossed over
   $700,000, and kept about $130,000 net. Now, he’s busy cloning
   himself with four spokespersons who will have territories, buy
   from him, and split their profits with him,

 of as much as $500,000.
       Can You Profit by Getting on
        National TV Programs?
   Why not you? My one-time client, now good friend, Lee
 Milteer, a motivational speaker and author, persistently sent her
 press kits, literature, books, and tapes to the hosts and producers
 of all the major TV talk shows in the United States and Canada,
 and advertised repeatedly in The Radio & TV Interview Report,
 a trade publication read by producers.
   She was invited to appear on The Dini Petty Show, the Ca-
 nadian counterpart to The Oprah Winfrey Show, to talk about
 goal-setting, visualization, and stress relief. From that single
 interview, she instantly sold over $40,000 of her audiocassette
 products via an 800 number and captured thousands of customers
 for later follow-up. And she was so well received she was ulti-
 mately hired by the show to make regular guest appearances. In
 total, her appearances on The Dini Petty Show alone have prob-
 ably been worth over $250,000 to her in direct business, not to
 mention the indirect benefits.
   Two appearances on The Phil Donahue Show by Gloria
 Pitzer, known as the Recipe Detective, literally made her busi-
 ness. Gloria Pitzer publishes a homemade, simple newsletter of
 recipes, featuring do-it-yourself versions of famous food prod-
 ucts like Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald’s special sauce and .
 French’s mustard. On Donahue, she demonstrated how you
 could duplicate these products with simple ingredients, very
 cheaply, right in your own kitchen. She gained thousands of paid
 subscribers to her newsletter with zero advertising expense. And
 keep in mind this was not somebody with television experience,
 influential contacts, the help of a costly publicist, or any other
 advantage you lack.

    $1.50 . . . and a few days later, somebody called her from the
    post office and asked what she wanted done with her mail. Puz-
    zled, she told them to deliver it to her home just as they always
    did. In the next few days, her mail carrier dragged bags of mail
    onto her porch filled with 70,000 checks for $1.50!
      Every Smart Entrepreneur Uses Publicity at
           Least Occasionally
     Most of the entrepreneurs I use as examples throughout this
    book include deliberately sought and created publicity in their
    mix of marketing tools and methods. Bob Stupak of Vegas
   World (see chapter 2) has played blackjack against a computer
    for a $500,000 wager on television (and won), made the largest
    recorded single bet on a pro fight in Las Vegas ($1 million), run
    for mayor, risked going on 60 Minutes, invented weird casino
   games like Crapless Craps, and is now building the nation’s larg-
    est tower—all with publicity clearly in mind.
     Guthy-Renker (see chapter 8) employs a public relations firm
    to make sure Bill or Greg gets quoted by just about any media
    reporting on infomercials. The result? Coverage in everything
    from TV Guide to Fortune. Harv Eker (see chapter 11) aggres-
    sively sought publicity for his fitness product stores, with the
    goal of attracting the attention of larger, acquisition-minded
    corporations.
     Tom Doyle at Gripping Solutions (see chapter 3) gives away
    free sets of his mountain bike grips to competitive racing teams
    and editors, writers, and columnists. of bicycle magazines. The
    result has been positive articles in most magazines and powerful
    quotes from those articles that he is able to use over and over
    again in his advertising. Joseph Cossman (see chapter 3) was an
    absolute master at using publicity and publicity events to pro-
    mote his products throughout his career. A publicity stunt he
    staged for his Spud Gun toy, in conjunction with the toy show

      MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #35: |
   EVERYBODY CAN FIND A WAY TO USE PUBLICITY.
       DO NOT UNDERVALUE PUBLICITY
        BECAUSE YOU DON’T BUY IT.
       DON’T IGNORE IT JUST BECAUSE IT
     TAKES EFFORT TO GET. IT IS VALUABLE.
   At the very least, every smart entrepreneur includes publicity
 in his arsenal of promotion and business-building methods. A
 few rely on it exclusively to build their businesses. Publicity is
 commonly used to generate “‘hot’’ leads for follow-up by mail,
 by phone, or in person, like the insurance agent on Al Parinello’s
 show did. Publicity is also commonly used to launch new prod-
 ucts without lots of advertising, like Raleigh did with the Mar-
 ilyn dol]. But there are many other ways to use publicity, and
 you should carefully consider how each one might apply in your
 situation.
    The Bottom-Line Secrets to Publicity: The 5 P’s of
              Publicity
   Whether you decide to go the do-it-yourself route and be
 your own publicist or you invest money to hire and use a public
 relations agent, the bottom line is the same. There are five keys
 to creating publicity and to getting publicity opportunities:
 1. Be predictive. The public loves predictions of the future.
   Every new year psychics like Jeanne Dixon get enormous
   amounts of publicity by issuing their predictions about world
   and national events, celebrities’ lives, and other subjects. Talk
   radio is frequently populated by experts, authors, researchers,
   and seers making predictions about everything from the stock
  market to the end of the world. In the business environment,
   author Faith Popcorn became famous on the strength of her

      is Mark Skousen’s Forecasts and Strategies, and the word
     forecasts is not in its title by accident. Mark is an experienced
      talk show guest and media manipulator, and he has learned
     the power of being predictive. In a speech in October 1989
      at an investment conference, Mark announced to 500 inves-
      tors and attending media, ““The Berlin Wall will be torn
     down,”’ and discussed the implications of that with investors,
     even though his prediction was greeted with laughter and cyn-
     icism. One month later, the Wall was down. Over the years,
     he has made a number of equally impressive predictions that
     have come true. (He has also made a number that haven’t,
     but public memory seems to be remarkably forgiving of
      seers.)
         . Be provocative. In my book The Ultimate Marketing Plan, I
      cite being boring as the #1 Marketing Sin. I believe your
     customers, clients, and prospects will tolerate just about
     anything and everything but being bored. Well, this is doubly
      true with publicity. The public has a very short attention span,
     and the media knows that grabbing and keeping the public’s
     attention requires the provocative. Doug Casey got tremen-
     dous publicity some years back for his book How to Profit
     from the Coming Economic Crisis. People instantly wanted
      to know—What crisis? When is it coming? How should I
     prepare?
      One of the most consistently successful users of radio talk
     show appearances for marketing purposes is Laura Corn, au-
     thor and self-publisher of the book 367 Questions Every
     Woman Should Ask Her Man. It is an obviously provocative
     topic. Regardless of who you are, whether you’re a woman
      or a man, married or single, young or old, it is almost irre-
      sistible. Aren’t you instantly curious about what these ques-
      tions are? Why should women ask them? What will men
     answer?
       Barbara DeAngelis, another popular author, seminar leader,
     infomercial star, and repeat guest on daytime talk shows,
     talks about “‘the five secret ticking time bombs in every in-

```

-----

```
  time bombs are. Do I have any ticking away in my rela-
  tionship?
    Authors of “‘conspiracy’’ books about topics ranging from -
  John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Chappaquiddick, and El-
   vis’s death to the Clintons’ past financial machinations and
     _ the president’s alleged sexual liaisons easily get publicity. A
  large segment of the population has immense, easily provoked
  distrust of all authority, and most people prefer an explanation
  for a tragedy, rather than chalking it up to happenstance. With —
  these tools working for them, conspiracy theorists can always
  command attention.
    Tax protestor, author, and speaker Irwin Schiff boldly
   States that all income taxes are voluntary and enforced col-
   lection of income tax is unconstitutional. On talk shows, he
  challenges anybody to bring him a section of the tax code
  that directly contradicts him. The fact—usually revealed by
  Irwin himself—that he has twice been put in prison and done
  time for tax evasion does not dissuade tens of thousands of
  people from buying his books and attending his seminars!
    Inventors of safety products, advocates for and against
  gun control, self-defense instructors, and manufacturers of
  burglar alarms all have found publicity opportunities thanks
   to the increasing public concern about crime, and those who
  take especially provocative positions are media favorites.
 3. Be public. By this, I mean mainstream. For example, it’s
  much easier for, say, Laura Corn to generate lots of media
  publicity than for me to do so; she deals with sex, love, and
  relationships, and nothing is more mainstream than that. I deal
  in business topics, of interest only to a limited percentage of
  the population. As a result, most of the publicity I do get is
  in business, financial, and trade publications, which does
  serve my purpose. But I don’t fit with Donahue, Oprah, Ger-
  aldo, or even Today very well. If you want that kind of major
  media exposure, you have to find a way to be mainstream.
 4. Be a personality. Broadcast media just about require that you
  have a dynamic or humorous or intriguing personality. Mat-
