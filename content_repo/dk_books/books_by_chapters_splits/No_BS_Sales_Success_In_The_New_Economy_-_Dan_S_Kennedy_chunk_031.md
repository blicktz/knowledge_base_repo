# CHAPTER 22

A Final Word from the Author

## Over 30+ years I’ve heard and participated in a great deal of talk about what “selling” is. To some, it’s just a job, in some cases, something temporary. Actorproducer Tom Selleck sold menswear. There’s no telling how many unemployed actors have sold the famous Cutco[®] knives. One of the most famous motivational speakers of all time, my speaking colleague of a decade, Zig Ziglar, sold cookware, door to door. To many it becomes their lifetime career, some staying in and excelling in one field, others moving from industry to industry, as trends change or new opportunities present themselves. To some small percentage of those, it becomes a profession, and they treat it with appropriate respect and dedication. To many, it is the means of starting a business that grows into a company, even into a global empire, as with Mary Kay or Rich DeVos and Jay Van Andel, who founded Amway after stints as door-to-door distributors in another company, or W. Clement Stone in insurance, or me. A great many of the business empires putting the richest men and women on the Forbes 400 grew out of one original founder selling his original wares or services, to one customer at a time.
 There’s long-standing debate over selling as art or science, as creative performance or mechanical process; as talent or skill, even as something requiring of genetic predisposition.
 To business owners and corporate leaders, it is too often an isolated function; to the savviest, part of an integrated process; to a few, only a necessary evil.
 To those of us who appreciate it as one might appreciate art, it is, done masterfully, a thing of beauty to be admired—and rewarded; that’s why some of the best customers are or were, themselves, sales professionals. To others, to consumers who’ve been treated badly, to critics, it’s something quite ugly, to be feared and loathed.

## To the economy, it is the most essential lifeblood. If the economy were required to subsist only on consumer spending done entirely of consumers’ and businesses’ own initiative, only of basic necessities, the entire world would come to an end in damn short order. We can certainly survive a few months of all politicians on vacation, all lawyers on vacation, all teachers on vacation, and just about everybody else but the doctors who cope with our health emergencies and the police, fire, rescue, and military troops who safeguard our lives here and abroad on vacation. But we couldn’t survive even a month with all salespeople on vacation. America would be in a Depression that would make 1929 look like a day at Disney World faster than a mouseclick, and the rest of the world would follow us off that cliff. Like it or not, if no salespeople sell today, nobody eats by next week. And every day, every journalist and entertainer supported by ads sold by salespeople, stocks and partnership investments sold by salespeople, the ads and investments made possible by other salespeople selling every imaginable thing, every one of them should publicly give a prayer of thanks to salespeople. Every day, every politician blithely spending money that is not his and wealth not even yet created, should get down on bended knee and thank America’s salespeople. It is something to be proud of.
 To some of us, it is all these things and more. It is a way of life. A source of independence, self-reliance, security. A way of being of service. Even a state of mind.
 However you define it and describe it for yourself, it is important. As something important, it deserves your best efforts. It should be done well or you should not do it at all, go find something else to do, and leave it in the hands of those who will do it justice. My intent for this book, above all other motives, not the least of which is to sell something (in case you hadn’t noticed), is to help you do selling justice.

# BONUS BOOK

 HOW TO READ ANYONE’S MIND

## Note: This small book was originally written for a private corporate client in 1993. It has been out-ofprint for quite some time. I’ve been told used copies have changed hands on eBay for as much as $360.00. As I said earlier, I have made very minor changes to it mandated by time; however it is reprinted here 90% as it was in original edition.
 If you have an especially strong interest in this subject, I would also recommend another book to you, which was sent to me by one of my longtime Members, a professional magician, Dave Dee. It is a book titled The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading, subtitled “a comprehensive guide to the most persuasive psychological manipulation technique in the world and its application to psychic readings.” It is a detailed inside look at how professional psychics elicit information and do what are called cold readings of people. If you cannot find this in bookstores, try the author’s website, www.ianrowland.com. I found it fascinating, accurately based on what I already knew, and valuable, enhancing techniques I use.

# Subvert Your Own Ego

## Boy, are we vain! And, at the drop of a nickel, we’ll be into the “can you top this game” with anybody we’re talking with. If the other person has an “I was so drunk” story, we’ve got a better one—if the other person has a sexual conquest story involving twins, we’ve got to trot out ours involving triplets. And, when we legitimately know more about something than the other person, we are compelled to demonstrate that superior knowledge.
 This tendency must be suppressed if you are intent on learning as much as possible about a person from a particular conversation.
 The Ego is the enemy of communication anyway. The perfect path to another’s trust is the suppression of your ego, so that his may shine.

# The Easiest Way to Get Anybody to Confide in
 You Like Their Most Trusted Friend, Fast

## There is a classic persuasive marketing principle: people want most what they get the least of. And what most people get the least of is recognition, appreciation. This is true of the most successful person you know as it is of the most “ordinary” person you know. At all levels of achievement, people are starved for recognition and appreciation. You can open a person up like magic, by dispensing lots of these two things.
 For example, the busiest person in the world will back off from his “busyness,” will have all his calls held, will drop whatever he’s doing to spend time with you and tell you everything you can think of asking—if you’re very, very appreciative of how busy and important he is, of the time he makes for you.
 When a person gives you some information, if you demonstrate appreciation for it and recognition of its value, guess what? He’ll be eager to give more. I get a lot of free consulting and help from otherwise high- priced, busy experts with this strategy. I’ll say something like: “You know, just that piece of information, that story’s worth the price of lunch. I’m going to be able to use that . . .” and I’ll describe the value the information has for me. What does this prompt? More disclosure. With this approach, I can get CEOs telling me their life stories and disclosing all the details of their businesses and finances in short order.
 Keep in mind that everybody loves giving advice. Asking people for their opinions and their advice is a certain way to open a person up and get him “spilling” what he knows.

# How to Ask Questions

## 1. Ask questions that cannot be answered “yes” or “no.” 2. Preface with “What do you think about . . .?” or “how do you feel about . . . ?”
 3. Form an extension question by repeating key words. For example: Wife: “You seem preoccupied. Is anything wrong?” Husband: “No.” Wife: “There must be something.” Husband: “Just a little trouble with the boss.” Wife: “Trouble with the boss?”
 4. Start with questions that are easy to answer. 5. Exchange information—don’t relentlessly interrogate. 6. Stimulate further disclosure by agreeing when you can.

# Study Good Interviewers

## Here’s your opportunity to watch television with a purpose. Many talk show hosts are very skilled interviewers, adept at getting their guests to “reveal themselves.” Barbara Walters, Dick Cavett, Johnny Carson, Larry King, and Oprah Winfrey are exceptionally talented interviewers.
 When you watch these and other hosts/interviewers, take note of the things they do repetitively and consistently. Look for the skill behind the style, the thing that is done so consistently it must be “principle.”

-----

# Determine That You Will Learn Something from
 Everybody

## This is an attitude that is particularly useful in getting information from others—a firm conviction that there is something to be learned from everyone and a determination to learn something from everyone.
 As with most things, attitude is at least as important as aptitude, if not more important. This simple mind-set will draw people to you and motivate them to open up to you.

# Listening Skills

## You probably know, the inability to listen accurately and effectively costs this country billions and billions of dollars annually. There are big problems —defense contractor cost overruns, airplane crashes, all sorts of mistakes made in business and industry—because while one person insists he said it right, it was heard wrong. There are little productivity problems, too. And business and personal relationship destruction. And students’ poor grades. And on and on—all because, while enormous investments are made throughout childhood and adult life to teach us how to speak and how to write, very little is done to teach us how to listen.
 I read a very interesting article years ago, where a number of professional prostitutes were interviewed, and many said that many of their “regulars” often paid not for sex, didn’t even have sex, but for someone to listen to them. Just recently, I saw a Geraldo show with operators of 900- number/800-number “phone sex” businesses, and they said the same thing —many regulars call and do not engage in explicit sex talk but instead talk about the day they had, their frustrations at work or at home, etc.—they pay for someone who will listen to them. This is just one of many situations that has convinced me that REAL listening is a rarity, and therefore immensely valuable and marketable.
 To listen effectively and ACTIVELY, I think you need to do all these things:
 L = LIKE You have to find some thing(s) to honestly like about the other person.
 I = INTEREST You have to instantly cultivate a sincere interest, either in the other person or in the content of what the other person is saying. For example, I’ll pay attention to, say, the CEO of American Airlines because of an interest in what he’s saying on a talk show, because I travel a lot, and because I’m in business, not because he is a particularly interesting person; I’ll pay

## attention to what Gregory Hines is saying on a talk show, not because I’m interested in tap dancing, but because he is an interesting, passionate person.
 S = SEE Meaning you have to really extend yourself to see the other person’s point of view, to visualize the background and causes of the person’s thinking . . . . to use your mind’s eye for greater understanding.
 T = TOUCH Meaning you have to let yourself be “touched” and, as the phone company says, “reach out and touch” the other person; let there be emotional linkage. If you try to keep yourself distant and uninvolved, the other person will sense it, respond by mirroring, and crawl into a protective shell.
 E = ENGAGE Take some initiative and be actively involved, without taking away control from the other person. Display your involvement by nodding, posture, other body language, brief questions, agreement when possible, non-offensive devil’s advocate type questions.
 N = NEED You’ve probably heard the phrase “need to know,” as in—“we’ll tell them on a ‘need to know’ basis.” I suggest operating on a NEED to know basis; you have such a thriving, thirsty curiosity about what makes people tick that you really need to know as much about other people as you need to breathe. This creates clearly sincere enthusiasm for what others tell you, encouraging them to tell you more.
 ACTIVE LISTENING means that, overall, you are as involved in a conversation as the person doing most of the talking. Leaning forward, nodding, appropriate facial expressions, in business setting taking notes, all help. The most important part of all, though, is “total concentration.”
 To be able to totally concentrate, you have to first do what the Psycho- Cybernetics author Dr. Maxwell Maltz called “clearing the calculator.” Most little hand-held calculators have to be “cleared” of one problem before working on another. You have to do this mentally. You may use meditation,

## self-hypnosis, the Silva Method, whatever. But there is nothing more flattering or compelling than totally concentrating on another person’s personality.

# The Technique of “Displayed Interest”

## Every one of us has, at least once, had the experience of meeting and spending time with someone who displayed such rapt fascination with us that we wound up telling them the most amazing things about ourselves . . . we so enjoyed being with them we sought to prolong the meeting. Many times, this is courtship behavior. We fall in love with the person of the opposite sex who seems to be unendingly fascinated with us!
 I was reminded of this not long ago, when meeting with the owner of a public relations firm that I was considering hiring. She was fascinated with me. She was so focused on me a bomb could have gone off without disturbing her concentration. I was completely captivated by her nonverbal flattery. It was only after the meeting that I logically analyzed what had just happened, how I’d been mesmerized, how I’d wound up talking so much about me.
 It’s this kind of Displayed Interest that can get people to tell you everything about themselves.

# I Will Never Forget . . .

## . . . a young lady I knew only as a business acquaintance whipping out one of her newly remodeled breasts for my inspection. What could provoke such behavior? In thinking it over afterward, I’m convinced it was nothing more (or less) than my being an extraordinarily good listener, to a person desperate for attention and consideration. It is only one of many, I think amazing incidents that have happened to me while practicing the art and science of listening.
 Most people go through their daily lives with others only “surface listening” to them. I experience this constantly myself and so do you. People ask us how things are going or how we are, without wanting to know or waiting to hear anything more than a “fine” or “okay.” Most people “listen” while doing other things—walking, shuffling paper, whatever. At home, dinner conversation is replaced by the TV trays in front of the tube, and I’m guilty of it too. After a period of time of this, a person becomes remarkably vulnerable to anybody who stops, digs in, and really listens. A great cause of unhappiness in many peoples’ lives is the absence of anyone who is thoroughly fascinated with them and what they’re all about. Filling this void gives you access, even control.

# What Does “Reading Between the Lines” Really
 Mean?

## You’ve heard the phrase—“you have to read between the lines”—but what does that really mean? When a person talks or writes, he communicates two ways at the same time; with EXPLICIT messages and IMPLICIT messages. Explicit is the actual, as-stated message. Implicit is the “extra message” implied by voice inflection, body language, punctuation, etc.
 Just as an example, has someone ever said to you, “If I were you, I would . . . ” Or, has someone said, “I don’t care where we go for lunch. Chinese would be great, but I’m up for anything.” In both cases, there is an implicit or extra message quite different from the explicit message. And, in both cases, there is an attempt at manipulative control. In the first example, the person really means: here’s what to do. In the second, the person really wants Chinese.
 Discipline yourself to ALWAYS listen for the implicit or extra message. Incidentally, the less secure a person is, in general or in a particular situation, the more likely he’ll communicate his true thoughts through these extra messages rather than his exact words.

-----

# Eye Contact

## At conventions or trade shows I sometimes catch myself committing this “communication sin”—carrying on a conversation with one person while frequently glancing around, watching for other people I know and need to talk to. Maybe it’s forgivable in the trade show environment, but it’s still discourteous to the other person and, more importantly, a huge impediment to total communication.
 Maintaining total, unwavering eye contact with the other person gives you incredible power. This is another aspect of active listening, of displayed interest, of flattery, all of which contributes to the other person’s desire to confide in you. Also, because “the eyes are the windows to the soul,” you gain an intuitive sense of the other person via the eye contact.
