When The Phenomenon occurs, it's doubly important to be on
guard against anybody or anything that may snuff out the fire. Do
not let yourself be distracted by any time- and energy-sucking,

Some people just can't stand prosperity. Their own emotional
and psychological inner mess causes them to start setting up
roadblocks to slow things down if good things start happening
too quickly. If this is a business partner, friend, or—gulp—
spouse, guess what you've got to do? I have an acquaintance I'll
not name who is married to one of these people who just cannot
stomach success. She's a great mate, right up until his career
shifts into high gear. Then she gets physically ill with mysterious
diseases. She starts picking fights. She wrecks the car. I've
watched him slammed to a stop by this roadblock-builder several
times. Watch out for such a person in your life.

Now, back to The Phenomenon itself. I cannot tell you how
to turn it on. But I can tell you about a few of the factors and conditions that seem to be present when it occurs. First, it seems to
happen to already hyper-productive people. Second, it comes to
people already in hot pursuit of worthwhile, well-defined goals.
Third, it seems to occur to people who have "stepped up" in
associating with other high-performance people. Fourth, it often
starts out with a single "big break"—which you've got to be
astute enough to recognize and massively exploit.

You can create the conditions in your life most likely to spark
The Phenomenon. Then embrace it!
