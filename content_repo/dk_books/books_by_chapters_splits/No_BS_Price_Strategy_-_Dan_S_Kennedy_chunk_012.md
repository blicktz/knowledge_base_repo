As for using discounts to bring new customers through the door, my suggestion is to have
something that is designed to be the thing that you use to drive traffic. By doing that, you can isolate
the damage discounting will do to your price integrity. You can, if you wish, preserve full, fixed
pricing for all products and services other than that one thing you periodically discount during new
customer promotional campaigns, or perpetually discount for that purpose if you must.

## Free as The Enemy?

Dan calls FREE the most powerful word in the English language. He’s right. But I’d like to add that
FREE is also the most hypocritical word in the English language. Nothing is free. Everything must
be paid for by someone, somehow. If nothing else there is always a cost of time, intelligence,
privacy, or quality. Admittedly the digital world has blurred that line. However, it has not erased it.
There is no doubt that FREE is a powerful word. The word FREE can generate a lot of traffic. The
word FREE can get buyers off of the fence. The word FREE can even get people to take action
purely to get something free that they have absolutely no interest in.

**Like all powerful things, FREE has a dark side. The word FREE has destructive force,**
because it can create expectation of more free and more free after that, literally downgrading buyers
to mooches, and creating barriers to you ever (or ever again) selling value and being properly paid
for it.

You hear the cries, “we won’t pay for it,” “we’ll get it someplace else for free.” The news media
is currently being browbeaten with that mantra while Rupert Murdoch and some other newspaper
owners try desperately to charge for what they have been giving away. The irony of the news media
is that many once charged for their online content, but then removed the price in favor of giving it
away for free since there was no extra cost for posting it to their websites. Oops. It’s hard to walk
that one back. The news media is a cautionary tale of which every business should take note. They
confused the costs of their print editions with the value that they provided. They lost sight of the fact
that their value should be based on the information they provide regardless of the medium used to
distribute it. Predictably, this mistake has destroyed the value of the information they provide. It has
also reinvigorated the entitlement junkies’ demands for free.

Of course this is not a new phenomenon. Back in the ’70s people actually rioted over having to
pay for concerts. They demanded that the music be free. They had no concern for the time and
energy the musicians put into creating the music. They put no thought into the cost of the venue, the
electricity, the development of the music, or the countless other expenses required to put on a show.

Now we find ourselves moving into a new era of problems with FREE permeating our society. In
Queens, New York, a group of kids repeatedly stabbed a bus driver because they wanted a free ride.
In Florida, a cop was fired because he repeatedly demanded free coffee from Starbucks; store
employees finally complained that he came in several times a night cutting the line and demanding
coffee for free. President Obama got himself elected by promising to give a lot of things away for
free. This is a widespread and growing problem. In Greece, Spain, even in Puerto Rico, rioters fill
the streets protesting small cuts in the benefits government workers and retirees have been receiving
for free. In a Midwest city last year, a pizza chain ran an outright free pizza promotion and had
thousands—on a work day—lined up in cars, requiring four- and five-hour waits. When the stores
ran out of pizza, fights broke out, several cars were lit on fire, and people were hurt and taken to
hospitals. When Oprah gave away free cars to her audience, they were vocally unhappy and several
threatened lawsuits upon discovery they owed taxes on the gifts.

We marketers feed this by offering more and more things for free. That’s why you need to be
extremely careful how you use the word free. Using FREE is a dangerous and slippery slope and
you need to recognize that. FREE trains buyers to not only expect things to be free, but to demand
it. To make matters worse, as the news media has learned, people do not value free. You have got to
be very, very careful when using free.

It seems like everywhere I look FREE is being used without regard to consequences. In fact, I’d
like to take this space to make a bold prediction. I predict a day of reckoning is coming to some very
well known internet marketers if they don’t change their ways. If you have paid any attention to
internet marketing you undoubtedly know what I am talking about. It seems like every week there is
someone giving away what they once charged three thousand dollars for. You have to have seen the
pitches: “When this was released six months ago, it sold for $2,997.00 and 50,000 copies of this
sold out in 3 minutes, but you can get it for free by entering your name and e-mail in the form below
right now.” If they did sell 50,000 at $2,997.00, will those buyers ever trust them again after seeing
it given away for free? This is a strategy called Skimming (see Chapter 17), but carried to
extraordinary extreme. If they did not actually sell it at the price they claim, they are lying, and liars
are always eventually exposed. They would also be running afoul of the law.

Giving away something that was once priced at a premium will devalue it and all your other
offers. It will erode trust. It will train buyers to expect that which is $2,997.00 today will be free

tomorrow. I have taken several up on their free offers. They would be much better off giving away
highlights of the original program as opposed to the whole thing. A highlights program would still
have caché but it would not degrade price integrity since it never had a price. Done right it could
even lead to more sales of the original product. Giving away a premium offering for free degrades
its perceived value. To make matters worse, the more recently it had a premium price, the more
likely giving it away for free will compromise the price integrity of the other offerings by the same
business. I’m sure the guys who are doing this have convinced themselves otherwise, but they are
wrong. I don’t care how fast this grows your list, I don’t care if you think you are triggering
reciprocity, you are degrading the quality and viability of your buyers by giving away a premium
offering for free. You are not, I repeat not, building trust or loyalty. You are building discontent and
sowing the seeds of hatred. Watch the long-term behavior; it will deteriorate just as it has for the
news media. As the old saying goes, why buy the cow if you can get the milk for free?

## NO B.S. Price Strategy Warning #1

Discounts and FREE are powerful but dangerous weapons that can backfire badly. Handle

with care!

There are ways to use them profitably, and times and places where you must use them, but

thoughtful concern for the consequences is always required.

**With all that said, FREE used thoughtfully, carefully, and sparingly, or with a standard new**
**customer offer, or in ways that do not degrade product previously sold at full price without a**
**very good reason palatable to all, can be a powerful business-builder. (You will find mine in an**
offer to you on page 233 and Dan’s on page 234.)

I do not believe you can simply swear off free—or discounts, for that matter. Despite personal
biases, I strive to adapt to the evolving culture of free in ways that help rather than harm my
businesses and my clients’ businesses, and you should too. Darwin taught us that the survivors were
not necessarily the strongest, but those most able to adapt to current conditions. Having enormous
market share and deep pockets does not exempt you from extinction.

The music industry is learning this the hard way. They have long viewed MP3s, file sharing, and
piracy as threats despite the fact that these threats were expanding the overall market. So instead of
figuring out how to capitalize on the revolution that is happening they have been wasting critical
resources on a war they can’t win. The sacred cow of the traditional record label will be slaughtered.
They need to evolve. We all do. Again, this is why it is so important to challenge how you see
things. Free is no different. You have to constantly ask yourself if you should fight the battle, join in
the use of FREE, or leave altogether. You have to contemplate if you should entrench and try to
protect your cash cow, or sacrifice it. If you should sacrifice it, what are the new opportunities? We
don’t get the answers to those questions without challenging our beliefs.

I had to challenge my belief about participating with free. As much as I hate it, I had to come to
terms with the fact that I can use it. Most of us do. We give certain things away while charging for
others. Maybe it’s a bonus, maybe it is a sample, maybe it is free information such as a blog post or
an e-zine, but free is there and being used. Free is not going away anytime soon. It and the
expectation of it is expanding. If you ignore it or deny the threat it poses to your current business
model, you do so at your own peril. If you ignore it or deny the opportunities it offers, you operate
under a handicap.

“Never discount. Never free.” is impossibly stubborn, but for very, very, very few providers of
elite professional services to very small numbers of elite clients. “Always/often discount. A lot for
free, all the time” is a high-risk game, too high-risk for my taste, and historically, consistently, a
path to a cliff’s edge from which there’s no retreat.

## Can Free Be Your Ally?

It is easy to feel dismayed or even helpless when thinking about free. It is hard to imagine
competing with it let alone providing it but still profiting.

Using free can be tricky. If you start off free and then try to move to paid, at worst you will have
an angry list that revolts; at best you will have poor results. If you have a premium offering then you
give it away, you will devalue it and everything else you offer. Free is a fickle mistress. It seems
there is nothing you can do to please her. Such is the nature of powerful things. Free is a force to be
reckoned with. It is pervasive and evolving. It’s like using dynamite. It has a purpose. There is a
time and place for using it. You just have to be very careful with it.

**That poses the question, how do you use free without destroying your business? The answer**
to that question tends to be unique to each type of business. If you have something addictive or habit
forming you could give away samples. Drug dealers have long used this tactic. So have vendors on
the food court at the mall. The main reason they hand you teriyaki chicken on a toothpick is because
they hope you’ll love the taste so much you’ll buy it. There’s also a reciprocity component.
Unfortunately, that strategy won’t work for everyone. While the local sandwich shop can give away
free samples of food without any risk of damaging their price integrity, a high-end restaurant such as
Morton’s would not be able to get away with it so easily. And when it comes to someone such as
Dan or me, we can’t give away samples of our consulting without damaging our ability to command
premium fees. We can demonstrate our wizardry, though, in seminar environments where everyone
has paid to be there, and we can carefully give away some information in media, free or deeply
discounted as with this book.

This is something every business can do, as demonstration of expertise or value, at deep discount
or for free, that does little damage. For almost every business, I’ve become a fan of giving away
information since it can be created once and given to a lot of people over and over again. I like free
newsletters, information packages, booklets, and even websites. I’m not talking about information
that negates your customer’s need to use you. I’m talking about information that helps educate the
customer. Information that helps the customer understand key issues and identify if they belong in
your camp or someplace else. I call this edu-marketing.

I say that like it is a new thing, but it’s not. Companies have been using educational campaigns to
gently woo customers since the dawn of commerce. However, it is growing more advanced now.
Educating your buyers helps to cut through the traditional advertising clutter. It builds trust. It
allows you to get your point across and create more informed buyers. Every business has things that
are important for the buyer to know. Give these things away. Use them to improve the market. I
prefer an educated buyer. When you have an educated buyer they “get it,” They understand what
they are supposed to do. They are far more apt to help you maximize your ability to help them.

On the other hand, an uninformed buyer will be much more prone to sabotage your efforts due to
their lack of understanding. That is the natural response to not knowing what you are doing. This
happens because when we don’t know what we are doing we operate with something called the
Executive Mind. The Executive Mind is our conscious thinking brain. It is only able to process and
handle a limited amount of information because it is trying to create a map for the Habitual Mind to
follow in the future. The Habitual Mind is the mind we use when we’re “in the zone.” It is the mind
we want our customers using when they come to us. We want them to know what they want and
have an idea of what it takes to get there. We want them to understand and not be confused.

Again, I’m not talking about giving away the farm. I am talking about giving away the basic
foundational information and ideas that buyers need to make informed decisions. Every business
has this information. Every business should be using this to their advantage.

_Tell me, what do I need to know to do business with you? What do I need to know to feel confident_
_about deciding to place my trust in you? How will I know I’m right for you and you are right for_
_me? Once you answer those questions, you can advertise that information to people who will take_
you up on it. It will build your credibility and will give you the opportunity to convert them to
buyers. This is something any business can and should do.

## Two Things You Should NEVER Do

**“Never” is a very strong word. It’s rarely advisable to use it. But in these two instances, I feel so**
strongly about the advice I’ll risk the permanent, no exceptions ban.

1. **If you have a prestige offering, do not give it away for free. There is nothing**
prestigious about free. There is no faster way to dilute your ability to charge a high price
than by giving it away. **Also be careful about offering it at discounts. Even that can**
destroy its price integrity. Protect prestige. If you find you need extra “juice” to sell that
product, add value to it with stronger or more dramatic warranties, bonuses, and
premiums, a special event for all who buy it during the promotional period, financing. But
don’t sacrifice its price outright.
2. If you must discount, must put items on sale or must promote free offers, don’t be
**predictable. This is the only way to negate training people to expect something. If you do**
the same thing at the same time, every time, you train them. Once you train them to
expect something you have to deliver it or you sow the seeds of discontent. If they come
to realize you advertise at full price for three weeks, then discount the fourth, they’ll wait;
if you stop the discounting, they won’t buy at all. If you run a Half-Price Sale every July,
customers will sit on their hands in May and June. If you frequently discount, they’ll lose
all faith in real prices and buy only when you run sales, then build up immunity to that,
forcing you to conceive bigger sales with bigger discounts and more free gifts.

## CHAPTER 3

 If and When You Discount, Get Quid Pro Quo

 Dan Kennedy

**I am in general agreement with Jason about all the evils of discounting. This does not necessarily**
preclude my use of discounting, for my own businesses or for clients, but it makes me wary and
reluctant, and motivates me to try and get something in exchange.
