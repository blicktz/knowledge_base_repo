A simple exchange of value might be immediate response. In marketing seminars, for example,
there is often an early registration discount tied to a set deadline. I will come right out and say: “If
we have to keep chasing you and sending you mailing after mailing after mailing, we’ll eventually
get you (you know you want and need to come), but we will have spent a lot of time and money.
Better to give that to you as savings in exchange for your earliest registration.” This has two virtues.
One, it provides a reason for the offered discount, which is some buffer against cheapening of the
product or the thought that the retail price is simple fiction. Two, it has a ring of truth, because, in
this case, there is real truth in the justification of the discount.

Years ago, when I was engaged in person-to-person, face-to-face selling of a particular product, I
found myself running up against last minute price resistance. I succeeded with the strategy of
“pulling the discount rabbit out of my hat”—conditional on the buyer assisting me with referrals to
secure appointments with at least two friends, neighbors, or colleagues. That dates back to the
1970s, and I first learned it from Howard Bonnell, then a sales management executive with the
World Book Encyclopedia Company, and from Paul J. Meyer, the founder of Success Motivation
Institute, who gave a talk about perpetuating an “endless chain of referrals.” Very recently, I spotted
an item in Entrepreneur magazine about a similar strategy, referring to an electrical contractor who,
after closing the sale reveals a lower available price, if the customer will fill out referral postcards to
be sent to the neighbors, right then and there.

In my consulting/copywriting practice, as of this writing, my base daily fee is $18,800.00, and
copywriting project fees are calculated by multiplying that times the number of days I estimate will
be required. Ten days = a fee of $188,000.00. I sometimes discount the daily consulting fee for a
client booking consecutive days back to back or pre-booking multiple days spaced through the same
calendar year, with reason given that I am getting value from that client in exchange for the
discount; either time efficiency or the convenience of filling the calendar and not needing to worry
about getting more clients. I sometimes discount the copywriting fee if I am getting several projects
all related to the same product to do at the same time, with reason given: time efficiency—the same
research supports all the projects, some of the copy written for one migrates to three. These are, in
essence, quantity discounts, but with more elegant reason given. The one thing I never, never, never
do is discount fees purely because of the client’s desire to negotiate or some competitive pressure.
Never, without good reason featuring some quid pro quo.

## Money at a Discount

In the above example, the idea of a $188,000.00 fee for copywriting work might shock you. And if
it were being paid by the client simply for a few days of copywriting work, i.e., for the time or the
labor, it would be outrageous. He could hire his own copywriter as a full-time employee to be
underfoot forty hours a week every week for a year for that sum. But for me, it’s relatively routine
because I’m not charging for time or labor; I’m charging to develop an asset the client will own, that
will yield dividends over time far beyond the initial investment. For example, if, for that fee, he
obtained an ad campaign driving prospects to a website where they read a sales letter and bought his
products that he used for the next five years, that amortizes the fee to $37,600.00 a year. And if it
sells $500,000.00 of goods each year, that’s $2.5-million across its five-year life, a return on
investment of almost 1,400%. Or: a discount of $2.3 million; the buying of money at a huge
discount. This is what intelligent businesspeople try to accomplish anytime they pay for expertise;
buy money at a good discount. And, just how many times would _you like to buy something for_
$188,000.00 that will yield $2.5-million over five years?

**There are actually two price strategies in play in the above paragraph’s explanation of my**
**fees: first, apples to oranges comparison (see the end of Chapter 13); second, selling money at a**
discount. The second can even lend itself to visual demonstration. For a speaker selling a
moneymaking program to seminar audiences, I fashioned the exercise by calling for volunteers,
picking three, bringing them up on stage, and having them bid to buy $100.00 bills—high bidder
getting the $100.00 bill. Usually, some goof bid a dollar, another twenty dollars or so, some wiz bid
ninety-nine dollars. He would give the high bidder the $100.00 bill, then pull out a giant roll of
hundreds, say he would average the bids to, say fifty, and invite all who wanted in on the deal to
“come on down”!—then quickly stop the madness, get everybody back in their seats, and explain
that his proposition to own his system was even better, because they’d be turning a few hundred
dollars into hundreds of thousands of dollars in just the next twelve months. Show of hands, how
many would bid at least $1,000.00 on a briefcase containing one thousand of the $100-bills (photo
shown on screen), thus paying only one dollar for each $100? **This took all the focus of the**
**audience off his price and fixated it on the large gain to be had. The price was now** **_felt_** **as a**
**huge discount rather than as a stiff price for the product, which consisted of some audio CDs,**
manuals, and an online coaching program; the whole thing fit into a single three-ring notebook.

Back to the quid pro quo: to let somebody have a product like this, purported to be worth
$100,000.00 this year and again next year and the year after that for the small price of just
$1,000.00 makes no sense. Franchises sell for 50 times that much and then require even more
investment, risk, and working 60 hours a week. This discount must be made rational. In this case,
several reasons were given, the specifics of which are not important here, but the fact that they were
given, vital.

## The Something-In-Exchange Split-Test

**In direct marketing, there is the all-important split-test, where just one variable is tested, “A”**
**against “B.” That might be price or the ad’s headline or two different photos or any other element.**
Some years back, I had a regional chain of optical stores as a client. We ran a “Sizzling Summer
Sales Event,” with customers getting a pair of prescription-lens sunglasses free when purchasing a
regular pair of glasses, plus a family pass to a popular area water park as a free bonus. For its time,
it was an extremely generous, enticing offer. I worried it might be too good to be trusted, absent
some quid pro quo. So we tested one change in the advertising in one market vs. the same
advertising in the other: in one, we added the requirement that the customer bring a donation of two
canned food items or at least $10.00 cash for the local food banks; in the other, no such charity
connection or requirement. The results were so much better with the charitable donation
requirement that no argument was possible. It mattered.

As I was writing this, a popular, national menswear chain was advertising the rather preposterous
offer of “buy 1 suit, get a 2nd suit and a sports-jacket free.” I bet I could improve response by
making those customers bring in a used article of clothing to donate to Goodwill. Doing so would
do good, too, by the way. Why not help out a charity and let it boost your sales?

## CHAPTER 4

 The Nasty Cancer of FREE

 Dan Kennedy

**Historically, FREE has been one of the most powerful words in advertising. It still is, but it is also**
**become the bane of existence to many of us, particularly those of us dealing in intellectual**
properties—like this book, home study courses and other education, or entertainment product like
music, comedy, and movies. A destructive sense of entitlement in general, entitlement to free to be
specific, and entitlement to free if cost of delivery is free—regardless of investment in creation—to
be very specific is metastasizing through the consumer culture. It is most pervasive among young
consumers rather than boomers or seniors. For example, a 2010 study by a major research firm
(Piper Jaffray) revealed that only 40% of teens legally purchase music online, with 57% admitting
they acquire pirated music from peer-to-peer networks and see nothing wrong with doing so. The
percentage willing to pay up to 99-cents to download a song from a legal source dropped from 25%
to 18% in just one year.

A must-read book about the culture of free, and its current and potential impact on various
businesses, is appropriately titled _FREE, by Chris Anderson. I do not agree with all the author’s_
conclusions, but highly recommend thinking through all the questions he raises and the trends,
evolving and predicted, he brings up as they may apply to or even mandate reinvention of your
business.

**Overall trends in American culture have affected and do affect both price and presentation**
**of price. My grandparents lived in a pay-as-you-go culture. With very rare exception, they saved up**
to make major purchases and simply did without until they had accumulated enough money. Piggy
banks, Mason jars, and coffee cans labeled with the purpose of their savings were common sights on
kitchen counters—one for Vacation, another for Washing Machine, another for Back To School
Clothes. Virtually every bank promoted Christmas Club accounts, to which deposits were made
weekly all year long, for withdrawal only on the Friday immediately following Thanksgiving, the
official start of the holiday shopping season. Most stores borrowed the idea with their own layaway
plans, where you made weekly or monthly payments toward the purchase of a product in advance of
getting it. Some smart merchants injected a little price strategy into that, by matching every dollar
the customer put in with a dime, providing the plan was kept in force to completion and product
ultimately purchased. The few things for which consumer credit was commonly used, notably
homes and automobiles, were viewed by most as necessary evils and required 20% or higher down
payments. And home buyers lived for the day of their backyard mortgage-burning party, with family
and friends invited. This entire scene must seem a silly fiction to many reading this. But real people
really lived this way. Honest. My very own father, after coming home from the Army, rode a little
Briggs and Stratton motor scooter—not motorcycle; motor _scooter—to and from work for over a_
year while he and mother saved up coins in a can for the big down-payment on a car.

**In that culture, price was very real, because it was almost always paid in cash, with money**
**saved up over time. Even Friday night out for pizza and a movie was the result of setting aside**
money for a couple weeks in advance. There was a realitybased mindset about money and therefore
about price. That’s why your grandparents can accurately recall and report the exact price they paid
for many things big and small—car or gallon of gas in a given year, while today’s consumer often
can’t tell you the price paid for much of anything since it happened with a thoughtless swipe of a
card, or in payments for which the total price, interest included, isn’t known because it’s irrelevant.
Even I can tell you the prices I paid for my first three cars, in 1972, 1973, and 1975, but I can no
longer recall the price of the ones I bought after that. I bought the first two for cash, the third with a
hefty, saved-up down-payment, a 24-month loan (the longest then possible was 36), and a co-signer.
The ones after were bought much less thoughtfully or arduously, pretty much just signing my name.

## A Different Time

In 1973, the year I graduated from high school, here were the prices for the following:

Average New Home $32,500.00
Average New Car $3,950.00
Average Rent $175.00/month
Harvard Tuition $3,000.00/year
Movie Ticket $1.75
Postage Stamp .10
Gas .40/gallon
Coffee $1.00/lb.

**My parents lived in a cultural transition from pay-as-you-go to go-now, pay-later, over time.**
Gradually, attitudes about credit and debt changed, and expansive use of credit not just for home
and car, but furnishings, backyard pool, trips, clothes and gifts became the fast-growing normal and
accepted way of life. Marketers quickly capitalized on the opportunity to shift focus from price as
reasonable or fair or competitive, to monthly payments you could afford. In a relatively short period
of time, we went from very little bought on credit and debt feared and loathed to much bought on
credit and debt accepted with little question or angst.

My generation went all the way. We buy everything down to our morning coffee and doughnut at
the 7–11 with credit and think nothing of it. We wouldn’t dream of delaying a washer and dryer for
three years and trekking to the laundromat while saving up money for that purchase, if we have a
credit card that will take the hit. Consequently, in a great many product categories, price is not much
of an issue, and sometimes not even mentioned; instead only the monthly payment matters. We are
now not just a society of consumers rather than producers, but we are a debt-based society rather
than an ownership-based society. Given the quick obsolescence of much of what is bought on
extended payments, most people actually own next to nothing, ever, and are renting everything,
although most do not think of their situation in those terms.

**Along the way, a parallel cultural conversion took place. My grandparents’ generation**
subscribed to self-reliance as secular religion. Any hand-out was shameful. They knew there was
never a free lunch. As interesting side note, the earliest attempts by marketers to offer senior citizen
discounts or have seniors enroll in discount plans fell flat; seniors considered it an insult to suggest
they couldn’t pay their way and needed a subsidy because of their age. My parents’ generation
gradually embraced a less rigid allegiance to “if it is to be, it is up to me” and became more
accepting of, then slowly eager for government expansion and liberal philosophy. Today, the secular
religion of self-reliance is as antique as pay as you go; in its place, a fast-growing, politically
encouraged lust for unearned goodies, benefits, support and assistance, transfer of responsibility—to
the point of entitlement.

Now, with pay-as-you-go a quaint historical footnote, go-nowand-pay-later the foundation of
most consumer purchasing, the internet as a commoditizing force, and an overall cultural shift from
independence to entitlement, everything related to price is impacted, and broadly, price is under
**pressure. This is more than an abstract dissertation of societal change or disintegration and political**
power expansion. It gets right to how Herb and Susan think about prices, payments, what they
should have to pay for this or that, and what they should just be given or given access to without
paying for it at all.

It’s very interesting to look at media. All TV was once free. But consumers were convinced they
should be willing to pay for more, more diverse, better, and “adult” TV, and cable subscriptions
went from odd luxury to something most now think of as essential. Moving people from free radio
to paid radio has not been nearly as successful. I say that with sorrow; I own stock in Sirius. But
even while consumers seem evermore willing to pay for TV, via cable, satellite, [hulu.com TV](http://hulu.com/)
replays, pay-per-view, they are revolting against paying for news media, particularly newspapers,

-----

prepared by real journalists with professional research; counting Tommy’s blog from Mom’s
basement as equivalent and demanding _The New York Times give their content free or go away_
altogether. Their demands—and weak-kneed publishers’ acquiescence—are driving prices of books,
magazines, and music into the dumpster. Even in one category like this, customers will pay for one
version but insist another version should be free.

The new entitlement mentality does not stop within the borders of media and product drawn from
intellectual property. A substantial percentage of people now think of health care as a right, not as
products and services—so any price is viewed with hostility by many. Pensions sufficient to support
oneself well throughout 30+ years of retirement, once thought of as something carrying price tags,
that you bought from banks and insurance companies by saving and prudent money management,
are now widely viewed as a right to which all are equally entitled regardless of what the individual
has done to get educated, to advance in a career or business, to save responsibly. No less than the
Ben of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream has suggested that everybody’s income be capped by law not to
exceed the salary paid the President, with all the overage confiscated and re-distributed according to
need, to grace all with equal amounts of these basic entitlements: food, housing, health care,
retirement. Thus, entire industries and professions are threatened deeply by this attitudinal trend. All
are undermined to one degree or another.
