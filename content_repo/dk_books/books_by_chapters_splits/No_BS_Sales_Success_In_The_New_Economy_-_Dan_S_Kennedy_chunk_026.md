## Here is a secret few salespeople use—not because it is unknown to them, but because they are too lazy to use it. The secret is to ensure the satisfaction of the customer after the sale. There are several good reasons to build this step into your sales process.
 First, some people suffer from “buyer’s remorse.” They wake up and feel differently about the purchase a day or two after the sale. The emotion of the moment is gone. They are groping for reasons to justify the action. Buyers like this need “post-sale reassurance.” This can often take the form of a well-written letter that thanks a customer for his or her purchase, congratulates him or her on the purchase choice, and restates the reasons why the decision was such a good one. In direct marketing, we call this a “stick letter”—designed to make the sale stick. There’s a classic example in my book, The Ultimate Sales Letter.
 You might also send or deliver a thank-you or welcome gift, a bonus that was never discussed during the sale. Oh, and here’s a secret from selling situations where there is typically a high level of buyer’s remorse and/or refunds: immediately deliver a “welcome to our customer family” gift of food. Cookies, brownies, a big fruit basket, or steaks. This is the close equivalent of “breaking bread” with someone and their office staff or family. It is much harder for someone to cancel a purchase and go back on their commitment after they’ve eaten your food.
 Second, a customer’s first purchase should be the beginning of a long, happy, active relationship. You need to do little things after the sale to cement that relationship.
 Finally, if you can create a system that motivates your customers or clients to refer others to you, you will never have problems building a giant income and a secure career in selling. As a matter of fact, any sales professional having to worry about prospecting after he has more than a dozen customers is, frankly, doing something wrong in the selling or post

## sale satisfying of the customer. Early in my career, I heard a recording from Paul J. Meyer, the founder of Success Motivation Institute, about “the endless chain of referrals.” Its premise simple: if you get one customer and he gives you at least one referral and the same is true of each subsequent customer and you never break the chain, you never run out of new customers. The reasons most sales professionals fail to own such endless chains are many, but it is because the sales professionals fail at it, not because the endless chains aren’t there to be had.
 This is more important than ever in The New Economy. Remember that New Economy Customers have been conditioned to be more cautious and conservative, more skeptical, and thus more difficult to obtain by all means other than a referral or recommendation from a family member, friend, associate, or peer. As the monetary costs of acquiring new customers through advertising and marketing rise, and the time costs of acquiring new customers through traditional prospecting rise, securing every possible referral grows exponentially in importance. One of the best pieces of advice for sales professionals in The New Economy is to invest a lot more of your attention in what happens after making a sale than you do in making the sale in the first place.

## If you flick through the pages of business magazines and traditional sales training material, you will find a constant flow of messages like, “Focus on closing the sale”; “Overcome objections”; “Be relentless”; “Accept rejection as a normal part of selling”; and “Chase the sale.”
 In most cases, it becomes about getting the sale at the expense of the human relationship. For the customer, this approach is transparent and all too familiar. But in this New Economy, there is a much better way to succeed in selling. It begins with moving away from the hidden agenda of focusing on making the sale. When you do this, a new world opens up for you. In other words, when you stop just selling and start building authentic relationships based on trust, authenticity, and integrity, the possibilities become endless. It’s a whole new mind-set in selling, which I call Unlock The Game[®].
 The vast majority of traditional sales techniques contradict everything we know about what it takes to build relationships. But shouldn’t selling be about creating new relationships with customers, clients, and patients? No one likes to be pushed and no one wants to talk to someone whose only agenda is to get what they want.
 Have you ever made a sale without trying to “make the sale”? You know what I mean, it just happened naturally without you having to force it to happen. That process you did unconsciously is the process that I have created at the conscious level so that you have a “system” you can follow that makes the sales process effortless.
 Selling is all about trust. People can sense when you are more concerned about your commission than their best interests. When you treat people as people, not prospects, and reveal your trustworthiness, they will start to trust you. They will see you as a problem solver

## Let’s take a closer look at these concepts so you can begin to open up your current sales thinking and become more effective in your selling efforts.
 1. Stop the sales pitch. Start a conversation. When you begin talking with your prospect, never start out with a mini-presentation about yourself, your company, and what you have to offer. Instead, start with a conversational phrase that focuses on a specific problem that your product or service solves. For example, you might say, “I’m just calling to see if you are open to some different ideas related to preventing downtime across your computer network?”
 Notice that you’re not pitching your solution with this opening phrase. Instead, you’re addressing a problem that, based on your experience in your field, you believe they might be having. (If you don’t know what problems your product or service solves, do a little research by asking your current customers why they purchased your solution.)
 2. Your goal is always to discover whether you and your prospect are a good fit. By simply focusing your conversation on problems that you can help prospects solve, and by not jumping the gun by trying to move the sales process forward, you’ll discover that prospects will give you the direction you need.
 3. When you lose a sale, it’s usually at the beginning of the sales process. If you think you’re losing sales due to mistakes you make at the end of the process, review how you began the relationship. Did you start with a pitch?

-----

## Did you use traditional sales language (“We have a solution that you really need” or “Others in your industry have bought our solution, you should consider it as well”)?
 Traditional sales language leads prospects to label you with the negative stereotype of “salesperson.” This makes it almost impossible for them to relate to you with trust or to have an honest, open conversation about problems they’re trying to solve and how you might be able to help them. As Dan said, the last thing you want to be is “another salesperson.”
 4. Never chase prospects. Instead, get to the truth of whether there’s a fit or not. Chasing prospects has always been considered normal and necessary, but it’s rooted in the macho selling image that “If you don’t keep chasing, you’re giving up, which means you’re a failure.” This is dead wrong.
 Instead, ask your prospects if they’d be open to connecting again at a certain time and date so you can both avoid the phone tag game. Further, if you play the game better, prospects will chase you.
 5. When prospects offer objections, validate them, and reopen the conversation. Most traditional sales programs spend a lot of time focusing on “overcoming” objections, but these tactics only create more sales pressure.
 They also keep you from exploring or learning the truth behind what your prospects are saying.
 You know that “We don’t have the budget,” “Send me information,” or “Call me back in a few months” are polite evasions designed to get you off the phone. Stop trying to counter objections. Instead, shift to uncovering the truth by replying, “That’s not a problem.” No matter what the objection, use gentle, dignified language that invites

## prospects to tell you the truth about their situation without feeling you’ll use it to press for a sale.
 6. Never defend yourself or what you have to offer. This only creates more sales pressure. When prospects say, “Why should I choose you over your competition?” your instinctive reaction is to defend your product or service because you believe that you are the best choice, and you want to convince them of that. But what goes through their minds at that point?
 Something like, “This ‘salesperson’ is trying to sell me, and I hate feeling as if I’m being sold.”
 Stop defending yourself. In fact, come right out and tell them that you aren’t going to try to convince them of anything because that only creates sales pressure. Instead, ask them again about key problems they’re trying to solve.
 Then explore how your product or service might solve those problems. Give up trying to persuade. Let prospects feel they can choose you without feeling sold.
 The sooner you can begin to shift your mind-set toward creating trust with your prospects, the sooner you can start bringing in more sales and creating long-term relationships.
