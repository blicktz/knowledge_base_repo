###### were ready to pull the trigger. (And I’m not going to lie, I also wanted them to have the budget to pay me more than the clients I currently had on the roster.)

 The “pinnacle moment” everything changed:

 I remember the first time I got an incoming message that changed everything.

 It was from Steve, and he messaged me … “We’ve never met, but I see you as an expert, and I’d like to hire you to do consulting work for my firm.”

 (Happy dance! )

 This new way of getting clients was working. And it kept working. And working. And … well, you get the idea.

 Share your results:

 Through this new system I was able to grow our firm to 7+ figures
 work with some amazing clients, including several celebrities, and eventually sell our firm for a really good exit. Taking my team of 17 on a cruise to celebrate was incredible.

 Call to action:

 It all started with a new way of doing things … I put together a free course for you to show you exactly what to do to get more clients right now. Imagine … getting new clients quickly and easily, over and over again … That’s exactly what you will discover when we get together on the webcast.

###### Imagery


-----

###### For Powerful Professionals, we know that lifestyle photos and photos of Kim perform best. But it took some testing for us to arrive at that conclusion. We tested all kinds of images—stock photos, illustrations, real- life photos—and I suggest you do the same. Bonus points if you find an image that has a pop of red because that always draws the eye in. Here are some ideas:

 1. Lifestyle:

 • Working from home/beach/other relaxing location
 • Enjoying time with kids/grandkids
 • Celebrity/luxury life
 • Vacationing with your family

 2. Saving Money or Making Money:

 • Money falling from the sky
 • Stacks of money

 3. Celebrity/Guru:

 • Photo of yourself—city background
 • Photo of yourself—nature background
 • Photo of yourself—plain background

 Types of Ads to Run DRIVE TRAFFIC TO BLOG CONTENT Kim has a huge audience of people who already know, like, and trust her. But in order to steadily grow that audience, we needed to continue to add new people into our funnel. Asking someone to opt-in to your Juicy Carrot is kind of like asking someone on a date. You wouldn’t walk up to a stranger and say, “Let me take you to dinner Friday.”
 Most people would find that creepy. The same goes with online advertising. So, driving traffic to a blog is a great way to warm up an audience and build a relationship before you ask them to opt-in for something.
 In some instances, we’ve seen our opt-in cost drop by 25% when using this strategy.


-----

###### Bonus Tip: Have an opportunity for someone to opt-in to your Juicy Carrot through a sidebar on your blog (see Figure 8.4).

**FIGURE 8.4: Example of a Juicy Carrot Opt-In a Blog Sidebar**

###### RETARGET You know when you are shopping online for a nice pair of summer flip- flops and then you start seeing ads in your Facebook newsfeed for flip- flops? That’s retargeting, and it’s all done through the magic of the pixel.
 After driving traffic to your blog, you can retarget visitors with an opt- in. For example, we send people to a blog titled “How to Quickly Grow Your Audience & Sales … in Just Four Steps.” Once someone lands on that article they will begin seeing ads for our 10,000 Fans webinar. This is a great way to build trust with your audience before asking them to take action.
 To do this, you’ll need to create a Web Audience. For instructions, visit: www.powerfulprofessionals.com/webaudience.

 VIDEO ADS


-----

###### This is an amazing low-cost way to reach your audience. We love using video ads to target a specific audience. For example, someone registers for a future webinar. You can keep them engaged by creating a quick video with some tools, hacks, or other valuable content to share before the webinar. If you already held your webinar, create a video for the nonbuyers and target them for seven days after your webinar to help push the “on the fencers” to purchase.

 DIRECT TO OPT-IN If you’re running Facebook ads that ask someone to take action (register for an event, opt-in, purchase something), the Facebook pixel will allow you to track exactly how many people clicked on your ad and took that action. Having this data allows you to experiment with your ad imagery, ad copy, and audiences to see what performs the best. Data is power!
 Not only that, but just like a good pan in cooking, your Facebook pixel becomes “seasoned” over time. Also, as you get more opt-ins or registrants, the pixel learns more information about the type of person you are trying to reach and will start focusing your ads to those people. Pretty smart!

 Ad Placement When you advertise on Facebook you can also launch your ads to Instagram (even if you aren’t on Instagram). It’s a beautiful thing—two birds, one stone. Facebook also allows you to break out performance based on placement so you can see how each performs differently.
 For the most part, you can set up your Instagram ads the same as Facebook. Just know that any links in your ad copy won’t be clickable (though the ad image is still clickable).
 With the focus of Instagram being visual, it’s important to use high- quality, vibrant images so your ads will stand out. See Figure 8.5 for an example of an Instagram ad.

###### The True Key to Success The tips I’ve shared are strategies we’ve learned over the span of years, running thousands of ads. But do you want to know the real secret to success?
 Just get started. That’s it. When we were first started running Facebook ads, we weren’t doing it right. Definitely not.
 Did we see success? Yes. Did we fall flat on our faces? Yes.

## to Sale


#### Side Note from Kim

###### “I’d like to buy your company.”
 He spoke these words as we swiftly walked to dinner with the rest of the attendees at this top affiliate mastermind.
 Josh Turner was expressing his interest in purchasing my firm after hearing earlier in the day that I was considering selling. While this should have made me nervous, it didn’t. Something just felt right from the moment he suggested it.
 Our companies were so similar. His for LinkedIn and mine for Facebook.
 Our philosophies on caring for our people and clients aligned. Our vision for work/life balance mirrored each other.
 He was ready to move, and so was I. And three months after that conversation, he would own the agency I spent 18 years running.
 We’ve stayed aligned since the sale, and I’ve continued to be impressed by their work and client service. The results they bring their accounts are unparalleled. It is because of this that I asked Josh

#### How to Book High-End Sales Appointments from
 Social Media

###### by Josh Turner What if I told you that any business could fail overnight? Even a business that sees an annual revenue in eight or nine figures and seems to have everything figured out is at risk if it doesn’t have one seemingly simple thing: a reliable way to bring in new customers.
 Now that may seem obvious. But far too many small-business owners are put in a tough spot.
 You need to maintain what you’ve got, but if you aren’t focusing on how to consistently generate new sales opportunities, who else will? It’s your number-one priority, pure and simple.
 The first time that I learned this lesson, I was just 21 years old. I was working for my dad’s remodeling business on the side between college classes. I thought we were doing great. From outward appearances, things were thriving. He was always busy working. I had plans to join him full time after college. But behind the scenes, being busy wasn’t the same thing as having a consistent pipeline of opportunities. And when things turned south, there were no leads to call upon. Dad had to shut the doors. I was shaken. I didn’t think this was ever a possibility.
 The second time I learned it was a couple years later after I landed a new job at BOA Construction. I was in charge of the finance department, among other things. The good news was that, in just a few short years, we went from $5 million to over $23 million in annual revenue! But the reality was that we were living paycheck to paycheck.
 When times were good, we had a lot of work, but our sales team was more focused on working with current clients or asking for referrals (which are no doubt critical, but they can’t be your only focus).
 So, in 2008, when the market got more competitive, our sales team couldn’t find any new business because consistent prospecting and


-----

###### appointment setting hadn’t been prioritized. The work dried up. One day, we realized we couldn’t afford to keep the lights on anymore. Finally, in 2009, the company was forced to shut its doors.
 Both companies failed because they weren’t able to generate enough new business. We provided great services and our clients loved us … but alone that’s not enough.
 It was one of the lowest moments of my life. I felt like a total failure. The business I was so proud to have been a part of … it was simply gone. I was like so many other people, cast aside by the corporate world and out on my own.
 I had seen enough by this point, so when I started my own business in early 2010, I decided I was definitely not going to fall into that trap ever again. So, with my finance background and a LinkedIn network of about 500 contacts, I decided to call myself an “outsourced CFO.” I created a terrible-looking website and had some business cards made at Kinko’s. They were terrible too. But I was in the game.
 It wasn’t so easy. I started riding what I call the “cash-flow roller coaster.” Things would be great for a month or so, and I was extremely busy—spending most of my time working hard for my clients, not looking for new ones. Before I knew it, things started slowing down, and because I wasn’t keeping the pipeline full, I was suddenly out of work. I had fallen into the same trap after all …
 That’s when I set out to discover how to truly generate a consistent flow of opportunities and leads so that I could protect myself from the cash-flow roller coaster. Not only that, but I also set out to discover how I could grow my business without having to work all the time once I got my client- generating machine rolling.
 I realized something critical and so simple that I had originally dismissed it as too “old school” because none of the marketing thought leaders were saying anything about it. At the end of the day, I found the only way to get more clients was to get in front of more prospects and schedule more appointments, consultations, strategy sessions, and sales calls. I wrote a very simple math formula (remember my finance background :-)) on a Post-It note at my desk: More appointments = More sales.


-----

###### In order to do that, I had to question my approach and what I had been doing. I simplified my marketing drastically and put all my efforts behind tasks that directly resulted in appointments. What I found was that I could use social media in a very systematic way to find my ideal clients (the exact market for my services), book appointments (creating consistent new sales opportunities), and grow my business to over seven figures. Today, I help businesses all over the world do the exact same thing.
 My company, LinkedSelling, recently conducted a study of over 1,300 business owners. And through it we uncovered some troubling data. Most notably, 88% of business owners struggle to maintain consistent cash flow. Only 12% said that they do not have cash-flow problems. That’s not just crazy, it’s downright unacceptable.
 A lot of online strategies, including those in this book, are geared toward internet marketers who sell online training courses, but there are so many more businesses out there who are desperate to get appointments with high-quality prospects. If you sell a high-end service or product via appointment, this chapter will teach you the myths to avoid (that most businesses learn the hard way), as well as the exact outreach and lead generation strategies I use on Facebook and LinkedIn to get hundreds of quality appointments for my sales staff.
 So if you are interested in learning exactly what I did to get off the cash- flow roller coaster and grow my business to almost eight-figures in just a few years using a combination of paid and unpaid tactics, keep reading.

 Social Media Myths: Can I Really Get Sales Appointments via Social
 Media? When I started LinkedSelling, I turned to social media and soon learned why people don’t have success. All too often, myths about social media keep businesses from using it to book appointments with new leads. As a result, of course, they end up losing opportunities to close more clients. I don’t want that to happen to you.

 MYTH #1: MY PROSPECTS AREN’T ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR DON’T ACTIVELY
 USE THE PLATFORMS The myth is based around this type of thinking:


-----

###### • “This won’t work because I’m B2B …”
 • “I work with C-level executives; they don’t spend time on social media
 …”
 • “I don’t think my business is ‘exciting enough’ to capture attention on
 social media …”
 • “I’m not selling a book or online course, and my fees are too high for
 social media to work …”

 Anything above sound like you? If so, you need to keep reading more than you could ever know.
 If you only think of Facebook as a place to post cat memes and Sunday brunch pictures, you probably won’t get great results booking appointments. However, if you understand the psychology of Facebook users as opposed to LinkedIn, for example, you can position your outreach and your ads to attract ideal prospects, taking into account the mindset they’re in when they’re on these platforms.
 The truth is, if your ideal client is on social media (and they are), you can and should use it for nurturing prospects and booking sales appointments. It all depends on your approach. Even more traditional businesses like professional service providers, consultants, IT companies, marketing agencies, and more can use social media to get high-end prospects to booked sales appointments.
 “But Josh, I target C-suite execs and successful business owners, and they don’t use social media like the rest of us.”
 How can you know where your audience is? Consider this: Over 1.56B users log on to Facebook every day, spending an average of 43 minutes on the platform. On LinkedIn, over 40% of their 640M users log in daily.
 Combined, that’s 1.81B users logging in every single day. So, if you’re wondering whether you can find your audience on social media, if they use the internet, there is a high chance they’re on either Facebook or LinkedIn.
 Now, if you’re a B2B business specifically, you’re probably already comfortable with the idea of LinkedIn, but maybe you’re concerned about whether or not you can get appointments from other businesses on Facebook. Let me set your mind at ease and tell you that decision-makers exist on Facebook as well. In fact, Facebook has found decision-makers are


-----

###### 2.2X more likely to be daily users than nondecision-makers. And there are over 70 million businesses on Facebook.
 So, to discount either LinkedIn or Facebook entirely would be a massive mistake and result in opportunities left on the table.
 This leads into the second myth …
