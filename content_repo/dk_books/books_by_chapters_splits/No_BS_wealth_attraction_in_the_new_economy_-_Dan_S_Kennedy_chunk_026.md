#### Just for example, I worked 12 hours today, on a Sunday, on this book. I didn’t wake up highly motivated to do that. I wasn’t inspired by a muse. Nor did I try to get inspired or motivated or find somebody to motivate me. I didn’t need to listen to a motivational recording. I didn’t waste even a minute trying to modify my attitude. I just went to work and wrote, because I had an imminent deadline and I prize keeping my commitments above just about everything else. That’s what I do. I work to meet deadlines. This is all about behavior, not “positive thinking.”
 Sure, that’s little more than self-imposed, situation-imposed discipline. But there’s another layer that goes on top of this that’s even more important. Step #1 is: Behavior. But advanced wealth attraction Step #2 is: Congruent Behavior.

#### Step #1: Behavior

 Step #2: Congruent Behavior

#### Congruent with what ? First—and this is key—congruent with the behavior of people already achieving the goals you want to achieve, already living the kind of life you want to live. This is called “modeling.” Find them, study them, model them. And model their behavior. Don’t worry too much about their thinking or attitudes. It’s what they do and how they do it that matters most.
 If your behavior is incongruent with the behavior of the people who enjoy the kinds of successes to which you aspire, you can’t get those kinds of successes. Simple example: top golfers use great coaches and practice regularly and frequently. If you are too cheap to get a great coach or too

-----

#### lazy or busy to practice, you can forget about being a top golfer. And you can “be motivated” and “think positive” and “visualize” all you want, bubba, you still ain’t going to be a top golfer!

#### “By following your behavioral goals, you get to your objectives.

 “Instead of trying to break par, a result we cannot control, we concentrate on putting a good swing on the ball, an action we can control. The distinction is crystal clear, surely, but it never ceases to amaze me that the same folks in my workshops who nod their heads in agreement with the golf analogy turn right around and announce that their goal in this negotiation is to sign the deal and collect the money. So I ask you again: Is this signing and collecting something you can actually control? What you can control is behavior and activity, what you cannot control is the result of this behavior and activity.

 “Think behavior, forget result.”

 —JIM CAMP, AMERICA’S #1 NEGOTIATING COACH, AUTHOR, START WITH NO, WWW.CAMPMETHOD.COM .

#### On the other hand, the quicker you align your present behavior with the behavior of people who already have, are achieving, and are experiencing the results to which you aspire, the faster you get those results. In fact, the result will so closely follow the behavior alignment it will seem instant.
 Second, congruent with the goals themselves . Consider a goal to lose 40 pounds. Dropping by the doughnut shop every morning is incongruent behavior. Stocking your pantry with cookies, incongruent. Going out with

-----

#### friends to a place that only serves pizza, incongruent. Taking the elevator up to only the second floor instead of walking up the stairs, incongruent. The quicker you re-arrange your behaviors to be congruent with the goal, the quicker you get the goal. The more behaviors you adopt and adhere to that are congruent with the goal, the more certain you are to achieve it— automatically.
 Most people are, bluntly, bullshitters—b.s.’ing themselves! What could be worse than lying to yourself? But if you claim a goal but behave in ways incongruent with the goal, you’re a b.s.’er.
 With regard to wealth, if you get your behavior congruent with whatever your wealth goals are, and congruent with the behavior of others who’ve achieved your wealth goals, it is an absolute certainty that your wealth will come flowing in—probably faster than you would have imagined. In fact, there is a thing I call The Phenomenon. Every wealthy entrepreneur I work with has experienced it at least once, most several times, in their lives. Personally, three times for me, including right now. The Phenomenon is when you accomplish more or attract more wealth in 12 months than in the previous 6 years, or some similarly amazing ratio. For most, The Phenomenon seems to just happen. Most think “finally!” But The Phenomenon can actually be made to happen, can be helped along and accelerated, because it is little more than a reflection of both kinds of Behavioral Congruency converging. You can’t directly make The Phenomenon happen, but you can make Behavioral Congruency happen.

#### The more aligned you are with the things you want, the more
 powerfully you attract them.

 The things you congruently want have no choice but to be attracted
 to you.

 People who are congruent are attractive, magnetic—even
 charismatic.

 When you are fully congruent, you are irresistible.

## Wealth Magnet 25

 Act Wealthy to Attract Wealth

#### There are actually two Wealth Magnets here that work in concert as one. One half will seem obvious and logical, but the other will seem completely illogical, and will be very difficult to accept. It usually takes hours to present properly, and the equal of that in pages just isn’t available here. So I can only caution you against using one Magnet without the other, and encourage you to try The 90-Day Experiment that I suggest here. You need not have any confidence in it working for it to work. You only need to do it for 90 days. You’ll see results. You’ll be amazed. Then you’ll stick with it even though you may never be able to logically explain it to anyone else, just as I can’t logically explain it to you.
 First, let’s get clear about what I’m NOT talking about here: “act as if.” In a lot of “wealth seminars,” the speakers encourage you to buy new clothes, new cars, a mansion, start living the lifestyle of the rich and famous, and essentially pretend to be rich, somehow fooling yourself and others. Their idea is “pretend and money will follow.” Actually, most people

#### experience “pretend and bankruptcy will follow.” However, they are onto something when it comes to fooling your subconscious. If you act in ways that the wealthy really act, you set in motion a big collection of internal changes and external effects that do attract wealth. It so happens I know hundreds of very wealthy people intimately, almost all firstgeneration rich, entrepreneurs who’ve made it from scratch. A few are “new-money flashy”—private jets, big mansions, bling bling. Most are not. Most behave more like the millionaires described in detail by Thomas Stanley in his book The Millionaire Next Door and his other research. But there are two things all really wealthy people do, that you can mimic, and that will have surprisingly dramatic, positive, wealth-attracting effects.
 The logical one is: saving . Systematic, disciplined saving. This is important because wealth is not about income. Most people focus only on increasing income. But the wealthy are just as concerned or more concerned with increasing equity. So, here’s The 90-Day Experiment: immediately establish a new bank account and call it your Wealth Account. It can be checking, interest-bearing checking, money market. At first, it doesn’t matter. Next, determine a fixed percentage of every dollar that comes your way that will be diverted into that Wealth Account. Something between 1% and 10%. You may think you can’t do this—hey, I can’t pay my bills now with 100% of every buck, how will I pay them with 90%? Well, maybe you won’t. But you aren’t now either! So just do it. Pick a percentage, deposit the money, and then do NOT touch it, no matter what. And make these deposits every time a dollar arrives. Daily if need be. The more often the better. The act of putting money into your Wealth Account does things to and through your subconscious mind that cannot be fully explained. The amount matters a lot less than the act. You could be poor, getting paid $10.00 a day, decide on 1%, and be putting only 10-cents a day into a piggy bank, and even though you would directly accumulate little in 90 days, so many other things would change in your life, you’d still be amazed.
 If you feel like reading about the core practicality of this, try the classic book Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason.
 Anyway, make a deposit to your Wealth Account of a predetermined percentage of EVERY dollar you receive.
 If you do take money out during The 90-Day Experiment, you MUST limit it to true investment. If, for example, you are paying a home mortgage or auto loan, and have enough in the Wealth Account to pay an extra

#### monthly principal payment, that’s acceptable. But NOT to pay your regular monthly payment. That’s not kosher.

#### “The hole you give through is the hole you receive through.”

_—DR. EDWARD KRAMER, AUTHOR AND CREATOR “SYNCH ROMATICS” AND_

_INVENTOR OF THE “THANK-U-GRAM”_

#### Now here comes the completely illogical one: giving . This is important because all wealthy people give. Giving has an incredible effect on your psyche. So, immediately open another separate bank account and call it your Giving Account. Also predetermine a fixed percentage of every dollar that you receive to divert to your Giving Account. There, you will build up amounts to give to your charities, churches, people in need, even over-tip hard-working people. If you take money out during The 90-Day Experiment, which I encourage, it must be to give away with no direct quid pro quo or expectation of return or gain, and it should not replace giving you already do, such as whatever you now drop into the church collection plate every Sunday.
 Obviously, it’s hard to imagine how SUBTRACTING 10% from your income and giving it away can increase your income or wealth. 100% minus 10% = 90%. $10,000.00 minus $1,000.00 = $9,000.00. But, somehow, this math works more like this: 100% - 10 % = 100% x 4 = 400%.
 The first time I heard this from Foster Hibbard, I thought he was nutty as my grandmother’s fruitcake. I don’t blame you for thinking I’m smoking crack. But I assure you, try it for 90 Days, and you’ll be a convert.

#### Later, by the way, you can get more sophisticated. Your Wealth Account money can move through the account into various investments. Personally, for my Giving Account, I use a charitable trust account with Fidelity Investments, that puts the money in my choice of Fidelity funds, dispenses donations as I direct, and provides the charitable tax deduction the year I deposit the funds whether they are dispensed that same year or not. Others create their own foundations. There are also complex issues, like donation of appreciated assets free of capital gains taxes. But all that can wait. First, run The 90-Day Experiment.
