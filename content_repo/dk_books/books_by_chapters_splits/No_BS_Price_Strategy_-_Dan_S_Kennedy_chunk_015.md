**Here’s an interesting question: would you rather have a sale or a customer? Traditional forms**
of advertising are all about buying eyeballs and ears, and are typically priced to you, the business
owner, based on number of impressions, expressed as circulation, readership, viewership, and
sometimes verified by independent auditors, like Nielsen. Some advertisers settle for exposure and
hope. Other direct-response advertisers strive for sales. So most advertising is either about brand or
a buy-this offer. The first, brand, is then all about hope. You’ll remember the brand if and when you
feel need or desire for a product or service in its category. A bowling center, for example, would
advertise with its name, location, logo, maybe a jingle in a radio spot, and chatter about how much
fun bowling can be—and hope. Or a bowling center would focus its advertising on urging people to
come in this week and buy two games for the price of one or join a league. This sharply narrows the
influence to those very much predisposed to bowling as recreation and ready to spend money doing
it. But there’s a third option: advertising Free. Done right, Free can broaden appeal and draw in a
much larger number of people and get them to try something they would not pay to try. That’s a bad
thing if there’s no good system in place to roll them over from Free to paying, repeat customers, or
if the Free is so expansive and openly advertised that it spoils everybody and damages the value of
everything you do. It’s a very dynamic thing when it’s well managed—and for that I have a threepart strategy.

Since you’re reading this book, using Free will be counterintuitive, but I’m not talking about
doing Free just to do Free, or indiscriminately doing Free either. Instead, there is a three-part
strategy you can use involving Free to draw in a lot of good prospective customers, in a controlled
way. You need 1) a compelling Free offer that people need to register to get, so you collect their
contact information for all the follow-up you care to do; 2) a controlled environment, so the Free
offer is directed at the right customers, and there’s good reason for it that does not extend to ruining
your price positions; 3) a marketing system to convert the people attracted by the Free offer to
paying customers immediately after their Free experience. (You can’t just let them loose, to wait for
the next Free.)

**A lot of business owners fear or emotionally dislike Free to such a degree that they**
**unnecessarily pay a lot more to get new customers than they need to. By refusing to “give it**
away” or by insisting on miserly, nearly free offers, they wind up having to spend a lot more on
advertising or promote themselves as cheapest-price providers to attract their customers than if they
offered an exceptionally appealing Free. Consider a new restaurant placing a Grand Opening
coupon in a Val-Pak mailing delivered to good potential customers in the right neighborhoods, with
cost of $500.00. With a very ordinary 2-for-1 offer, they might get 20 customers in the door from
10,000 homes, costing about $25.00 each to get them in the door, less, say $5.00 net on the first tab
so each customer costs $20.00. But with an irresistible “Free Dinner for Two, No Strings Attached”
offer, they might get 50 customers—reducing cost to $10.00 + $10.00 costs for food = $20.00. Same
cost but 2.5 times as many new prospective customers. If they used my approach and drove them to
a web site to register for the Free Dinner For 2, they might get those same 50 first-time customers in
the door immediately, with another 50 or more registered but not immediately showing up, but who
could get follow-up marketing. If they made visiting the site much more appealing—maybe with a
chance to win some great prizes just for visiting and registering—maybe they could get the same 50
in the door immediately plus 200 for follow-up. If they subsequently convert just 50 of the 200 to
come in, they’ve drawn 100 in for their “free trial,” at a cost of just $5.00 each. With a good,
immediate conversion process—for example, to a prepaid three-month Dining Club Membership—
you can build up a restaurant’s business a whole lot faster, with a lot less money tied up in
advertising, buying customers for $5.00 rather than for $20.00, and in clumps of 100 rather than in
clumps of 20. It’s 5 times the number at greater speed but at a quarter of the investment. Wow!

## How You Can Do It Too

**Just as the above example illustrates, any ordinary business can use Free intelligently, to**
**switch from brand or buy-this-now advertising to lead generation advertising, and to**
dramatically accelerate growth. Here’s exactly how we did this for bowling centers.

Their slowest time is dead of summer. In effect, they have excess, perishable inventory going bad
every day in the summer months in the form of capacity not used today, gone forever. We created a
program that provides two Free games—entirely free—every day (!) all summer to children of
certain age. This Free has a price value of over $500.00 per child. It’s huge. Parents and kids grasp
its value immediately and eagerly snap it up, and it has created a lot of buzz online. Because of the
[“bigness” of this Free, the bowling centers and KidsBowlFree.com promoting on their behalf do not](http://kidsbowlfree.com/)
need to spend a lot of money advertising; it’s also viral, and most importantly, it brings a lot of
people forward who would otherwise never even think of bowling, let alone buy it. There is an
immediate upsell in place, to put some cash in the centers’ registers even before anybody shows up
to bowl a single game, accomplished online—and, of course, the kids who do come in to bowl free
buy sodas and snacks. Because they can come often free, they get addicted, and they rope in all their
friends. Because there’s logical reason for the Free limited to kids and to summer vacation months
only, conversion of these families to paying customers works just fine. Most importantly, we capture
every piece of data we need to do very targeted, efficient, and effective follow-up marketing; we
successfully get actual addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and—of enormous subsequent
value—birthdays of all the kids and adults in each household before a game is given away.

This “big” Free enabled us to register the first 478,000 families and 1,078,000 kids in just 90
days, entirely online, automatically. Our participating centers are able to spend less on advertising,
instead converting their slow season’s excess, expiring capacity to capital. With the data collected,
we are able to survey and organize these customers throughout the summer, to then conduct
precision-targeted marketing campaigns about birthday parties, leagues, and other services. As I was
finishing this chapter, we tested a referral campaign, to just 90,000 families in this database and
secured 30,000 new customers in 48 hours. We are in the business of managing and mining this
continually growing database in as many profitable ways as possible, for the participating centers,
for our own company, and for sponsors not competitive with the bowling centers.

**With this approach, any business can buy good, convertible leads with Free rather than**
**with advertising dollars. Used this way, carefully, Free becomes a form of capital used to buy an**
asset, not a “giveaway” that permanently cheapens the business. Obviously, not everybody can do
so on the grand scale we are, but don’t lose sight of the fact that there are hundreds of bowling
centers each using our system. And just about everybody has the needed component parts to
replicate this: some slow times or unused capacity that expires if not used, the ability to create a
really extraordinary and compelling Free without undermining its other price strategy, and the
ability to force registration for the Free through an online data capture place, to create a valuable
asset of a well-organized prospect and customer list with a lot of information useful in follow-up
and on-going marketing.

## CHAPTER 7

 Antidotes to Commodity Thinking

 Jason Marrs

**Few business owners begin with the goal of being average. They hope for more. Yet most permit**
themselves to be boxed in to average by their prices, led by thinking of their products or services as
ordinary commodities. If what you deliver isn’t truly unique and special, how can you charge
anything but ordinary and average prices? This acceptance of commodity thinking is everywhere—
and it drives me insane!

The sad thing about it is that every business that is selling a commodity is doing so by choice.
And they’ll continue to sell commodities, think of themselves as selling commodities, and being
commoditized, until they make the decision not to. **The minute you decide not to think of**
**whatever you sell as a commodity, you liberate new, different, and better price possibilities.**

## Commodities

For purposes of this discussion, a COMMODITY is an ordinary, common, even mundane
product or service that, in the absence of differentiation deliberately created by its
provider, is perceived by consumers as having limited, usually low value, and being
interchangeable with other products or services of its type. Generally speaking, for
consumers, grocery items, household cleaners, paper products, batteries, gasoline, auto
insurance, and a car wash are commodities. For business/industry things like raw
materials, cleaning supplies, office supplies are commodities. A universal example would
be coffee. To a great many consumers, coffee is coffee and there is no reason to pay more
for one brand or another, or to favor getting it from the convenience store on the far side
vs. the near side of the street. If anything, lowest price might sway such a decision. Yet
Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks prosper, at successively higher price levels. Aspirin is, in
_fact, aspirin, yet Bayer Apirin exsists as a brand and sells for a higher price than the_
generic equivalent, side-by-side on the same shelf. Permitting yourself to be perceived as
an interchangeable commodity, i.e., commoditized is a fast and certain path to price and
profit erosion.

**There is no such thing as a commodity, there is only commodity thinking. To prove it, let me**
ask you a question: Can you get more commoditized than air? No, you can’t. Oxygen is the most
abundant element on earth. It makes up 90% of water. You can’t take a breath on this planet without
it. It is free to everyone. No need to buy it. You’d think that it could not be sold, but it is. And I’m
not talking about oxygen tanks for the sick. I’m talking about oxygen being sold to healthy people.
One place this occurs is in “oxygen bars.” The FDA argues that it’s not healthy to breath pure
oxygen and that oxygen bars are breaking the law. However, that doesn’t stop people from selling
oxygen to the public. Oxygen bars, spas, and other trendy places are selling oxygen for as much as
$1.00 per minute. You can even get it in various scents and flavors, like strawberry oxygen. But any
way you look at it, you are paying $60.00 an hour just to breathe.

Does that seem outrageous? Brace yourself. $60.00 an hour is a steal when you compare it to
[what www.go2air.com is doing. They sell Personal Oxygen Devices for $19.99 each. What do you](http://www.go2air.com/)

-----

get for your money? You get roughly forty breaths. Considering the average human takes roughly
15 breaths per minute you’re getting 2.7 minutes. That translates to $7.40 per minute to breath.

**[FIGURE 7.1: Website page from www.go2air.com. Reprinted with Permission.](http://www.go2air.com/)**

That’s a staggering $444.22 per hour. Of course, this is being sold as a health product. But it’s air.

If you accept the idea that these guys are helping people improve their health, you might then
insist that you don’t do anything that important or beneficial. Or that devices providing pure oxygen
are unique despite their dispensing the most readily available, free commodity there is. Well, in that
case let’s take a look at something you cannot possibly make that argument about: underwear.

We can all agree that underwear qualifies as a commodity. Most people wear it. Women can buy a
six-pack of Hanes for around $1.33 a pair, so they don’t _need to pay $5.00 or more a pair for_
Victoria’s Secret. But they do. That may not sound like a lot in terms of dollars but it is a 300%
price difference. But why stop at a paltry 300% increase? The Australian Wicked Weasel brand has
an entry-level Hipster Cotton Workwear for $15.42 each. That puts their panty well over 1,000%
higher priced than the Hanes panty and roughly 300% higher priced than the Victoria’s Secret panty.
All three are cotton bikini panties. Not much difference in the actual panty but a huge discrepancy in
prices.

Even if you combine all of their prices together they still pale in comparison to the price of our
next example. If you go to [www.NancyMeyer.com you can buy the Carine Gilson Silk & Lace](http://www.nancymeyer.com/)
Shorty for the everyday low price of $448.00. Admittedly it’s not cotton like the others, but it isn’t
spun gold either. It has no jewels. It is just a lace panty (Figure 7.2). That sure is a long ways from
$1.33 isn’t it?

I recently had a long, drawn-out conversation with a lady who was the owner of what she
considered to be an upscale lingerie boutique. I mentioned something about the Carine Gilson panty
and she said, “I don’t know of any pants that are that expensive.” I said no, not pants—panties. She
kept hearing pants. She could not imagine pants, let alone panties costing that much money. She
flatly refused to believe that I was saying panty. She had been in the business for 35 years and
“knew” such a thing was not possible.

**[FIGURE 7.2: Website page from www.NancyMeyer.com. Reprinted with Permission.](http://www.nancymeyer.com/)**

Not only are such prices possible, they are not even rare. There are super exclusive “jeweled”
panties that can go for millions of dollars that are rare. I didn’t include them just because they are
too easy for someone to write off as an anomaly. The ones I included are not. They are something

-----

that anyone with the money can buy. You do not need special connections. You can buy any one of
them right now if you have the money. Many, many, many women do. Everyday. Some, routinely.

The woman who owned her own lingerie store was also wrong about the existence of $450.00
jeans. They are not considered expensive in many circles. $450.00 is actually the base price of many
luxury brands. In fact, that price is but a tiny fraction of the $4,000.00 starting price tag attached to a
pair of APO Jeans of New York with diamond buttons and rivets. See Figure 7.3.

**[FIGURE 7.3: Website page from www.apojeans.com. Reprinted with Permission.](http://www.apojeans.com/)**

Each of these things has a focus on individuality and how it makes you feel. It may not be
explicitly said, but it is there. That sense of individuality is what drives such purchases. You don’t
spend $4,000.00 on pants for function. You do it to make a statement to yourself and those around
you. Personally I appreciate the audacity of those who create them. They are doing the necessary
task of moving money around and pushing us forward. It does not matter if the majority appreciates
it or even understands it. It is essential that they not be deterred.

One final, mind-expanding example: Kopi Luwak. That’s a fancy name for cat-poo coffee. The
Asian Civit Cat, which is actually more like a weasel than a cat, has a fondness for coffee beans
(Figure 7.4). They are said to eat only the best berries from the coffee plant. These beans then pass
through the cat’s digestive tract mostly un-digested. Workers then search the jungle collecting catpoo that gets turned into the world’s most expensive coffee. (Think about this the next time you’re
walking your dog with baggie in hand or are out in your own yard with a pooper-scooper. If only
that pup ate coffee beans, you could be rich!) At [www.bantaicivetcoffee.com the cat-poop coffee](http://www.bantaicivetcoffee.com/)
sells for $85.00 per 4oz bag. Or you can save $20.00 by buying a pound for $320.00.

**[FIGURE 7.4: Website page from www.bantaicivitcoffee.com. Reprinted with Permission.](http://www.bantaicivitcoffee.com/)**

I’m curious about the taste, but I just haven’t been able to talk myself into consuming something
that’s from a cat’s butt. My views don’t matter. Neither do yours. That gets us back to the larger
point here. While you must believe in what you sell, your opinion is not nearly as important as that
of your buyers. They are the ones who decide what is worth their money or not. The world would be
an awfully mundane place if we all liked the same things. It is your job to align your offering with a
group of people who love what you are selling and are willing to pay for it.
