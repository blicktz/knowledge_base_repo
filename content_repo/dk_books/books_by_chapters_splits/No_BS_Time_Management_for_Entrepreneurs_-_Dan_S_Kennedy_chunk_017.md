###### How to Turn Time

is an old j°l?e _th&t_ says: "I've been ricli and I've been
poor. Rich is definitely better." Well, I concur. I make
absolutely no apology for striving to be rich and for
teaching and inspiring others to do the same. Furthermore, I
believe you have every right to figure out ways to make maximum money from minimum time. When you can honestly apply
the axiomatic advice of "work smarter, not harder," more power
to you! I do not think any special heroism comes from earning
your money through back-breaking work or long hours.

My Platinum Member Ron LeGrand, who has bought and
"flipped" thousands of properties and teaches his real estate profit
methods to thousands of investors each year, has a pet saying:

_equal_

"The less I do, the more I make." It is obviously open to misinterpretation. Ron works and does so cheerfully. But he has learned
to focus on work that directly produces wealth.

I suspect I am unique in working up close, personal, hands-on
with more than 100 first-generation millionaire and multimillionaire entrepreneurs, most of whom built their wealth by creating
and building new businesses from scratch, many of whom hit the
million-dollar mark in a hurry. I have been in their offices, they
in mine; had hundreds of hours of telephone conversations with
them; worked with them individually and in groups; and had
countless opportunities over years to observe their behavior and
probe their psyches. My Renegade Millionaire System and oncea-year seminar I hold deal exclusively and extensively with
what separates these "renegade millionaires" from the pack.
(For more information about my system and seminars, go to www.renegademillionaire.com.)

One of the key factors in their
success is the way they link time to money, and think in terms of
investing time. Most, like Ron, are always looking for ways to get
more for less, invest fewer minutes of work, extract more dollars.

One way they do this is by making themselves into bona
fide experts in some field, one thing from which wealth can
come. There is the old story about the customer angrily
demanding an itemized bill from the plumber, who submitted a
$250.00 bill for two minutes' work—smacking the clogged pipe
with a hammer. The plumber wrote out the itemized bill as follows: For hitting pipe with hammer: $5.00. For knowing where
to hit pipe with hammer: $245.00. Getting into that position—
when you can be paid not (just) for what you do (physical
labor) but for what you know (intellectual equity)—is a very
worthy objective.

So, let there be no mistake. I think you deserve to be rich. I I
hink you have a right to be rich. I think you provide enormous
service to society by getting and being rich. I think government
should be forbidden from penalizing or attacking you for being
rich.

###### "On the Other Hand ..."
With all that said, though, I have to suggest that money isn't
everything.

It is a lot easier to give the "money isn't everything" and
"money doesn't buy happiness" lecture after you have a considerable amount of money than before. Personally, I always resented
hearing it when I was broke. And believe me, I understand that
a person NEEDS a certain level of financial success before he can
give a great deal of thought to the bigger philosophical issues of
life. And I think in our land of great opportunity, it is disgraceful
not to do well. I don't see any honor in being poor. No shame in it

as a temporary condition but there should be shame if being
poor is accepted as a permanent way of life. But, to be certain,
money is only part, and maybe a small part, of "wealth."

On a surprisingly cool summer morning in Cleveland, Ohio,
I sit in a dirty jog cart (the work-a-day version of a sulky), reins
in hands, bouncing along behind an aging, mildly lame,
Standardbred horse on the Northfield Park backstretch. Damp
dirt, gravel, and bits of manure are kicked up past the mud
screen onto my boots and pants, occasionally hitting my face. I
am in seventh heaven. Of course, I'm just fooling around. But
most of the folks there doing the same thing and taking care of
these horses as work are in seventh heaven too. They couldn't

imagine doing anything else. On this particular day and night, a
70-year-old man, Earl Bowman, and his wife, Joanna, were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. Earl, a retired driver and
still a very good trainer, took his horse to the paddock, took care
of it and worked just as he would any other night. After the race,
Joanna joined him as he led the horse into the winners' circle for
the photo. Then he took the horse back to the barns where he had
another hour's work ahead of him, stripping off the harness,
bathing the horse, walking the horse to cool him out, bandaging
the horse's legs, and so on. And if you asked Earl if he could have
gone anywhere else or done anything else on that night, what
would he wish for, he'd have no answer. This is wealth.

On a Thursday afternoon, General Norman Schwarzkopf
finishes his speech on leadership; the emcee quickly introduces
me; I step to the stage in The Palace in Auburn Hills, Michigan,
where the Detroit Pistons play basketball; I address more than
20,000 people for an hour and then answer questions and sign
autographs. When all the dust settles, I earn about $25,000.00
from the audience's purchases of my books and tapes. A few
weeks later in Phoenix, I have 22 people in a three-day seminar,
each paying $2,500.00 to be there, and I talk to them about my
favorite subject: direct marketing. I and the group "brainstorm"
each attendee's business and project. In these situations, I'm
having a ball. It definitely beats REALLY working for a living!
_This is wealth._

Many days, I get paid handsomely to consult with interesting
people, one on one, and help them figure out the best answers to
their marketing problems. Other days, I sit at my computer and
create powerful sales letters and marketing documents for my
clients or my own products. Or I write newsletters, articles, and
books like this one. I enjoy every minute of it. This is wealth.

###### A Wealthy Man In
South Bend, Indiana, one of the brightest, most interesting,
most generous, most spiritual men I know, Dr. Herb True, teaches
**,1 management class at Notre Dame in the afternoon. Then he**
rushes home, takes phone calls from students, briefly visits with his

wife, Betty, gathers up a slide presentation, and goes to the (enter
for the Homeless, where every Monday night, he conducts classes on humor (yes, humor!), self-esteem, hope, faith, .ind
love. Early in his career, Herb taught at Notre Dame, but I
hen he left, went into the "real world," and became one of the
most successful and sought-after professional speakers in
America. In 1982, he set aside his very lucrative speaking career .ind

returned to Notre Dame to work with young people and
give his time to his community. The pay cut he took is, well, epic. These

days, he still accepts a couple dozen speaking engagements from companies that pursue him, but he donates all the
fees to the homeless centers in South Bend. Herb is 71 years
young. He works harder than he ever did. Although he lives in I

he same very modest home he has lived in for decades, although
he does not drive a new car, although his annual income is noth-ing

to brag about, Herb is a very, very wealthy man.

The individual who gets to use his time in ways that bring
him great joy and fulfillment, who gets to do work that is genuinely personally interesting, who gets to choose his associates,
and who gets to make some kind of a contribution to his fellow
man wakes up wealthy every morning and goes to bed wealthy
every night, regardless of his bank balance.

I do not happen to believe in the vow-of-poverty approach. To
the contrary, I favor making very good money. But, unlike some
"motivational speakers" insistent on telling everybody they should
pursue millions of dollars, I've long been willing to acknowledge

that these tilings have different meanings for different people. You
do not necessarily need a million dollars in the bank or a huge
home on the hill or Jay Leno's fleet of expensive cars in order to be
wealthy. Many people manage to get rich, but comparatively few
get wealthy. As long as you're going to put in your time on the
planet, why not invest it in a way that makes you wealthy?
Napoleon Hill, most famous for his classic best-selling book, Think

_and Grow Rich, spent his entire life encouraging people to_
pursue great goals, including financial riches. Hill was originally
set out on his mission by America's first billionaire, Andrew
Carnegie, who believed there were "universal principles of success" that could be taught and learned, just as any other collection of mechanical skills could be learned. Carnegie helped get
Hill in-depth interviews and relationships with hundreds of the
greatest achievers of that era. Hill identified 13 commonalties,
and wrote about them, first in The Laws of Success, then in Think
_and Grow Rich. Following publication of that book in 1937,_
Napoleon Hill lectured, trained large sales organizations, recorded
inspirational messages, and, in various ways, distributed his
"science of success" based on those 13 principles.

Late in his life, Napoleon Hill wrote another book I highly recommend: Grow Rich with Peace of Mind. In this book, after acquiring great riches, losing great riches, and a long career, Napoleon
Hill did his best to reconcile the issues of pursuing great financial
success and achieving total wealth, in the bigger, broader sense.

How Much Is Enough?
So, how do you turn time into wealth? Reverse engineering.
Decide what "wealth" means to you. This includes what I call

you need to feel secure and spin off sufficient income to support
you and your family as you wish to live. Not at wild-fantasy, win-the-lottery,

your time?
Once you have this entire picture built, with detailed clarity,
you can begin looking backward, to where you are now. You

can construct a plan. Establish yearly, monthly, weekly targets
and benchmarks. Then, most important of all, you can judge
whether your present moment's choices made with your time are linked

to creating the wealth you desire.
