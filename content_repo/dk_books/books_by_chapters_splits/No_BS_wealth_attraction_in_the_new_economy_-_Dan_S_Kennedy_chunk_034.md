#### for the entire 15 minutes of your $15.00 haircut. Pleasurable experience, this was not.
 Alternatively, some men still went to the very same barber who remembers putting them in a high-chair to cut their hair. While Vinny might only charge $10.00 per cut, he more than likely no longer shaves and frills have long since been forgotten.
 We knew there had to be a better way—so we created it. Why the old- school barbershop experience had to die with the Rat Pack was beyond us. We wanted to resurrect it. Bring something of quality back. Something that had been so wrongly missing. The opportunity to exploit this underserved market was obvious to me, so we jumped on it.
 Having now successfully done this with Kennedy’s and continuing to branch-it-out across the country, I’ve now turned my eye to other “future items” in the Kennedy’s arsenal, things that also aren’t there right now: members-only travel excursions; private-label music, merchandise and beer; and much, much more. These will all be grafted onto our platform, but they also demonstrate that Kennedy’s is about much more than just hair, hence the need for philosophies, beliefs, and a point of view.

#### The key about this Wealth Magnet is not being too far ahead of the “acceptance curve.” If you can catch it just right, it can prove to be immensely profitable.

### Wealth Magnet 23: Marketing Prowess

#### Most franchises get their marketing all wrong. I’ve financed around 45 different franchised concepts over the past dozen years in my commercial lending career, so I’ve seen a lot of franchised business models; the good, the bad, and the ugly. The commonality among them all is poor marketing. As this isn’t necessarily a marketing book, I won’t get into too much here (especially in a Dan Kennedy book ), but suffice to say marketing is one of our greatest strengths at Kennedy’s, and it will always be a source of immense wealth for us.
 At Kennedy’s, we know what our ideal client “looks like,” and we know how to market to him, to get him into our Clubs and to try us out. It’s as simple as that. Well, truth be told, it’s simple on the surface, but very complicated below that. We do LOTS of marketing at Kennedy’s to boost our Clubs’ memberships quickly, and our marketing serves one purpose and one purpose only: to get that customer to part with his money (on the spot or eventually). Moreover, with our patent-pending membership concept for barbershops, continuity income kicks in from this new Member and, in return, the new Member has the perception of unlimited grooming services.
 It took a lot for me, a successful commercial banker, to add to my plate with this franchise, but the economics were too attractive not to pounce. There simply isn’t a better value proposition (for our Members or our Franchisees) in the hair care business—or to put it another way, we have the best-groomed men in America in our “movement business.”

## It’s No Wonder

 He’s So Successful. Look At ...

#### T his is the last chapter, the last of the dissertations in these covers on wealth attraction.
 I’m about to give you—and then illustrate—an extra, bonus Wealth Magnet. I didn’t number it as one of mine because it is 100% borrowed from my friend Jim Rohn, perhaps the pre-eminent success philosopher of our time. Personally, for the record, I enjoy and am inspired by listening to Jim more than any other author or speaker whose works I have in my vast library of audio programs.
 One truth of my life that also seems to exist in other wealthy entrepreneurs’ lives is a patchwork piecing together of the philosophy and practical strategies from myriad sources. I don’t think there’s any one person who has all the answers anyone needs. In my case, I can point to three keys developed thanks to ideas I heard Earl Nightingale advance, one from Jim Rohn—which I’ll tell you about here—a couple from Gary

#### Halbert, one here, one there, each originating from a different source then validated by many others and ultimately evolved into my own.
 The idea Jim Rohn puts forth almost every time he lectures, which I’d be very remiss if I were to omit it from this book about attracting wealth, might be described as the whirling dervish principle. Jim says, if you got an opportunity to shadow any super-successful person 24/7 for just about any week of their life, you’d come away from the experience weary and exhausted and saying to yourself, “Well, it’s no wonder he’s so successful— look at everything he does.” Most people only do a few things to attract wealth. A handful at most.

 Consider Diana Coutu, the pizza entrepreneur I’ve mentioned briefly a couple times in this book. In one 60-day period this past year, here’s some of what she did to promote and attract recognition and interest for herself and her business:

 • Attended, competed at, and served as a judge at the World Pizza
 Championship Games held in Italy. There, she was made an official honorary member of Les Pizziolos du France and given a plaque to hang in the pizzeria. None of this happened by accident, incidentally; it was the result of a great deal of promotion, networking, and effort preceding the event. Of course, she used all this as fodder for news releases to local and national media.
 • Appeared on a show on The Food Network.
 • Attended the annual HonFest in Baltimore, put on by Café Hon, and
 recognized by Cosmopolitan magazine as one of the top ten events of the year to attend in the United States—and she used this as fodder for publicity, too. These same “personal interest stories” made their way to her Facebook page, her printed newsletter that goes to all her pizzeria’s customers as well as a target list of customers-to-be every month, and her websites.
 • Was hard at work on her first cookbook, Passionate About Pizza, only
 months from release, for which there will be a promotional blitz to coordinate and execute.

-----

#### • Began collecting recipes from her customers as well as from
 celebrities for a second cookbook to quickly follow the first, to be called Canada’s Best Pizzas Cookbook .
 • Developed three new specialty pizzas for promotion for each month.
 • Accepted a new post on the Board of Directors of the Canadian
 Restaurant and Food Association, and went to its meeting in Toronto.
 • Provided training, consulting, and coaching to several U.S. restaurant
 owners on the pizza business.

 In the operation of the pizzeria business itself—recently moved to a new location doubled in size—she and her husband Pierre coordinated:

 • the launch of a new online ordering system
 • a special joint venture promotion giving away a luxury condo vacation
 in Florida
 • a different joint venture promotion for Mother’s Day with a local
 florist.

 And there’s everything on-going: twice weekly, or more often, e-mails to all the customer-members of their clubs, referral promotion of the month, direct-mail campaigns, new box-stuffer fliers to create, not to mention the on-going training, motivation, and management of staff, product, and delivery quality control, and running of the business. Well, it’s no wonder she’s so successful—look at everything she does!
 Diana’s available, incidentally, for consulting to those in the restaurant and food service fields, for speaking engagements in and outside of her industry, and at some point, intends franchising Diana’s Gourmet Pizzeria. You can contact her at DianasGourmetPizzeria.ca .

 Consider my client Michael Gravette. In a short time, he has multiplied a single business into many under the same umbrella. SafetyTechnologies.com was already the largest wholesaler to dealers of personal safety, self-defense, and home security products—from pepper- spray key chains to Tasers to nanny-cams. But in multiplying its size at fast

#### pace, he divided it into one business selling to and supporting retailers like gun shops and professional dealers; a second business putting individuals into the business as independent distributors; then added an in-house website development and hosting service, creating online product catalogs for the re-sellers in both those companies, featuring instant online business set-ups with as many as 200 products, full drop-ship and fulfillment services, and state-of-the-art webstores including secure ordering, e-mail marketing, and video presentations. Nearly simultaneously, he added coaching and training courses for people new to the business as a whole or new to internet marketing. To fuel all this, he coordinates print advertising in over a dozen magazines, direct-mail campaigns to a multitude of lists, e- mail marketing, online article syndication, an online blog, frequently making new videos for the blogs, YouTube and other media, and weekly teleconferences. If that sounds like a full load, wait—there’s more! This past year he launched a second sister-business, SafeFamilyLife[®], with its own online marketing as well as availability to his existent distributors, to bring a new line of SafeLife Kits to the market, which include some of the Safety Technology products paired with educational manuals, DVDs and audio CDs; for example, The Women’s Kit for Personal Safety; The Safe Apartment Living Kit; The College Survival Kit. This company required development of new products and product packaging, literature, and website development, varied test marketing (some of which failed) and back-to-the-drawing-board re-invention before there was a viable business. Much of this change, improvement, and brand new initiatives took place in 2009–2010, incidentally, against recession headwinds. You can see all this at Safety Technology.com . And it’s no wonder he’s so successful—look at everything he does. Go back and count. Inside what might superficially look like one business there are seven businesses in operation, two different salesforces or groups of customers—whichever way you choose to think of them, and nine different, major categories of ongoing activity to bring in business.
 In both Diana’s and Michael’s cases, you have to imagine a very long list of daily Do’s, once weekly Do’s, and get done by others Do’s. If you shadowed either one of them for a week, you’d say “whew.” And you would see for yourself the very visible secret of creating a force magnetic to wealth.

-----

#### As one other example, I’d like to take you through much of what I do on an ongoing basis to promote myself, make myself viable, support myself as a valuable brand, and fuel the businesses that support me. I realize, of course, you are most likely in a very different business than mine so many of the specifics may not apply. More do than you might first think, though. But it’s more important to grasp the magnitude of the whirling dervish housed here at the Dan Kennedy Command Center, and to grasp the all-important idea of having many, many, many, many doors open and welcoming in new customers. One welcome mat for wealth won’t do. So, my list, not necessarily in any priority order:

 • Books. Obviously, I write books, and then promote my books, and
 have my books and new book launches as excuse for promoting me. There’s a list of all of them now in print on page 243. Each year I have at least one new or revised, updated but recycled one released, and in most years, more than one. There are books getting started, books being written, books getting finished and shipped off to publishers, book promotions beginning, in progress, and ending, virtually every day, continuously. We have had as many as 15,000 people attend “a teleseminar with the author” connected to my books, thanks to getting hundreds of other authors, advisors to industries, associations, our own Members, business owners of every stripe, and my personal friends to promote it. I have done a fourcities-in-four- days book tour by private jet, personally speaking to over 1,200 people and generating buzz, done in-store book signings attended by as many as 300, blitzes of radio interviews, and lobbied for and gotten “ink” (exposure and praise) in magazines and newspapers, including USA Today and Inc. and Entrepreneur magazines. Much of this is just not possible without the books. It’s my contention, incidentally, that every businessperson should write a book and have it as a promotional tool.
 • Radio and Teleseminar Interviews . Most weeks, two or three,
 sometimes more. Some connected to my role as political commentary columnist with BusinessAnd Media.org, more connected to my books,

#### or to Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] . The teleseminars are usually put on by other leaders of industries, industry groups, or associations, and I’m there as guest expert.
 • “Fan Mail.” I get a lot of correspondence from Glazer-Kennedy
 Insider’s Circle[™] Members, readers of my books, people who hear me speak, and so forth. Some ask questions, some tell me of their successes. I read it all, answer much of it personally, delegate some, answer some in newsletters or online. Some weeks, maybe only a couple dozen. Other weeks, that number multiplied. In a year, thousands. About half of this is with Members, so you might categorize it as “customer service,” although that would be underestimating its significance. The other half is with people who are not yet Members but may join, or who’ve bought and read one book who may buy them all, who have no relationship but may develop one —even leading to a good consulting engagement for me. The daily and weekly flow of correspondence crossing my desk that must be responded to is daunting—but any one piece might be the piece connected to the person who, sooner or later, is worth $10,000.00 or $100,000.00 or $1-million to me.
 • Thank-You Notes, Congratulation Notes . People send me copies of
 articles they think I’ll find interesting or can use in my newsletters, send me photos, gifts. They all get thanked. Anytime somebody refers somebody to me or otherwise assists me, they get thanked. If I read about one of our Members, another author or speaker I know, another contact in a publication, or I see them on TV, or hear them on the radio, or am told they were there by somebody else, I drop them a congratulatory note. This reminds people I’m around, reminds them they might have reason to conduct some business with us or tell somebody about us.
 • Articles. I pump out a lot of articles for others to use, that keep me
 living in their newsletters, magazines, blogs, and other media. We formally syndicate some articles from Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™], I personally write some for different outlets, I encourage reprinting excerpts from my books. I look for people who have the same kind of customers as we do or clients as I do, with whom I am not directly competitive, and actively work at being shown to their customers by them, as often as possible.
