##### point Hill found himself, and need a number of barriers to restrict access to me in order to have any peace. You need to know that the affluent have enormous demands assailing them, and look, above all else, for breathing space. A multimillionaire client recently told me of buying a very expensive “cabin” in a relatively remote area near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a popular playground of the rich. He showed me a picture of the area around his place, just miles of snow-covered emptiness. He talked of going dogsledding. Mostly, he talked of enjoying the sense of distance and isolation from people and their demands on him.
 Beyond this, the affluent are seeking liberty from critical judgment and guilt. This nation attacks its affluent relentlessly, in the media, in politics, in public and private discourse. The affluents’ Spidey-sense detects envy, jealousy, resentment, and disapproval emanating from most of the people they interact with and from the public at large. One millionaire told me: “The more successful I get, the more I feel eyes in the dark hungrily watching me.” Another said to me: “To my face, they are deferential. Behind my back, they are angry critics who believe themselves infinitely smarter and harder working and more deserving than I.” Another described feeling as if the target painted on his chest got bigger and brighter with each passing year. In his outstanding book Paranoia and Power, Gene Landrum, the leading authority on the psychology of the rich and powerful, states: “Paranoia is rampant among super achievers.” Further, attempts to influence the affluent with guilt for the admittedly growing gap between them and the have-nots is pervasive and unrelenting. It comes from close family members and distant relatives—as comedian and game show host Louis Anderson so painfully showed off in one of the most memorable Oprah shows ever and wrote about in his autobiography. It comes from the endless charities, causes, and others at their doorstep asking for or, in some cases, nearly demanding handouts. It comes from political demagogues, media, and even rich limousine liberals themselves, acting out of guilt. Behind closed doors, this is frequently discussed, a shared angst of the affluent.

 How to Make Yourself Magnetic to the Affluent If you truly understand this quest of the affluent, it’s not difficult to see what is required of you to make yourself magnetic to them—and to their

##### money.
 Not necessarily in any priority order, there are three big things to do. One, develop, display, and convey a profound position of expertise, good judgment, understanding, professionalism, and competence. Present yourself as the most trustworthy of advisors. The most trusted advisors relied on by the affluent automatically and certainly become very affluent themselves. Almost next to, or only a step behind, every person famous for wealth and power stands an almost equally wealthy—in some cases wealthier—trusted advisor.
 Two, relieve your affluent clients of time, pressure, anxiety, stress, day- to-day hassle, tasks they’d rather not do or even think about or that should be below their own time’s value. Create privilege and luxury-level convenience for them. Make standing in lines, filling out forms, mere mortals’ normal burdens go away.
 Three, give them acceptance, approval, and applause. They are extremely responsive to those who celebrate their success and respect it as earned. Become known as a supporter and advocate of achievement and affluence. Take philosophical positions that counter the constant criticism they receive from most other quarters.
 We will flesh out specific strategies supportive of these three objectives in Book Three.

#### Book Two Summation

### What is most predictive of human behavior is human behavior.
##### Surveys, polls, focus groups, statistics, psychological theories are all useful yet often not predictive. In direct marketing, we try to use all the indicative information we can get, but we also put a lot more importance on the only predictive information there is: how a target group of consumers has historically behaved and currently behaves toward a particular type of product and service category and proposition within that category.

 There are only two certain facts we can always start with. One, that everybody is much more enthusiastic about spending on what they want


-----

##### than on what they need—however, huge numbers of consumers are extremely restricted in this by lack of money for anything but bare necessities. Two, the more affluent the consumer, the more they can, and the more they do, spend on wants.

 When marketing to the affluent, it is essential to understand your target consumers’ desires, not their needs. Sometimes they overlap, sometimes not. In 2018, “sleep” became a big thing. One Wall Street Journal headline proclaimed “Sleep the New Luxury.” This enables a mattress maker and marketer to talk about that product very differently than he has in the past when marketing to the affluent. And he should. The $500.00 special edition, hand-crafted in Sweden, presented in carved wood box woodsman’s axe I bought as a gift for friends leaving a big city and moving to a cabin in the woods does fulfill a utilitarian function, i.e., a need if called upon to do so, but its intent is more as décor. I bought it for symbolic and comedic purposes, and I suspect everybody buying it is doing so by want, not need. If motivated by need for an axe, it need not be special ordered or take $500.00. Nor would anybody pay $500.00 to meet the need.

 The thrust of Book Two was: Know thy customer. Most importantly for purposes of marketing to the affluent, know his wants (not just his needs) and know how he behaves as a consumer fulfilling his wants in the category of goods or services you are in or can most closely align your business with. This is an ongoing project, not something that gets completed by reading a book. Business owners usually define their own jobs poorly. They get lost inside the running of the business. This— constantly verifying, modifying, and deepening understanding of your affluent customer—is a key part of your job. It requires work. It is not good enough to get data from a boat show about the attendees. You must also go to the boat show and observe, listen, eavesdrop, get into conversations, be amongst them.

 In Book Three, we will move onto the more mechanical functions for obtaining and successfully selling to affluent customers. But these

### Connecting with the Affluent Customer You Want

##### “Every individual lives in a world of their own. And the only way
 you’re going to make the sale is to enter the world.”

—HARRY BROWNE

# Here’s the formula:

##### 1. Decide exactly who you want as a customer—notably, deciding on
 the level of income, net worth, overall affluence, lifestyle and ambitions, aspirations, interests, and attitudes about spending you want him to have.


-----

##### 2. Be sure you have crafted products, services, a business, its
 positioning—everything—for that consumer. 3. Go to that consumer wherever he is.

 That third point is succinct, but far beyond most business owners’ comprehension. Most business owners act as if they are trees with deep roots, at the mercy of whatever fertility or infertility, favorable or unfavorable environment exists and evolves around them. Today, consumers, especially affluent consumers, can be found, identified, effectively communicated with, attracted, and sold to at any distance near or far.

 The Power of UN-Obvious Place At the racehorse auctions I go to, there are a number of sellers of horse business goods and supplies—harnesses, sulkies, wheels, drivers’ uniforms and helmets, and veterinary supplies. And one pop-up jewelry store. Because, when the guy goes to the auction, he tells his wife: “NO—I am NOT buying ANOTHER horse. I’m just going along to keep the boys company.” When he returns home with a rope in one hand attached to another $25,000.00 horse, it’s helpful to have a $5,000.00 pair of diamond earrings in the other hand. This is about going to where the right consumer is.
 My wealth advisor client advertises in obvious places, like Investors Business Daily. But also, and often more productively, in the sports sections of affluent, business-vibrant cities’ newspapers and in affluent-aimed magazines like Cowboys & Indians and Private Jet Traveler. My gun manufacturer client advertises in the obvious gun magazines and in NRA media, but also in motorcycle magazines. The dating service, It’s Just Lunch, for whom I’ve done a little work, advertises in airline magazines. This is about going to where the right consumer is.

 Circumvent Search Far more premium-priced goods and services are sold to affluent buyers who were not searching online or by other means for them than are sold to buyers actively engaged in search. Their interest was aroused by direct


-----

##### outreach from the marketer. I say: live by search, die by search. Every marketer relying on Google is at its mercy—and it is not particularly merciful. Online search via Google or Amazon is all about commoditization, price equalization, and profit destruction. For true commodities, being present there is essential. But for many, many categories of goods and services, finding pathways to customers you interest, before they search, is to your immense advantage.

 No Boundaries Anymore “We’re not in Kansas anymore.”

—DOROTHY, IN THE WIZARD OF OZ

##### The U.S. is no longer the leader in wealth creation. The affluent and ultra- affluent in other countries, combined, number roughly eight-to-one those in the United States, and the fastest growth in new affluents is abroad.
 If you have long thought of yourself as a local or U.S. business, it is past time to rethink that, and think global. Many of the great difficulties to marketing and conducting business in faraway places have been erased or minimized. The internet, its media, and e-commerce is a boundaries killer and a major gateway for U.S.-based marketers to the entire globe and to these specific hot spots of rising mass-affluent and affluent consumer populations.
 At the very least, you must replace local with national. The location of prosperous consumer populations is dynamically changing and re-arranging itself as you read this.
 But why would somebody 1,000 miles away from you pay high prices for what you sell in Boise, Idaho, when there’s some of the same stuff within walking distance of their Boston townhouse? Or London townhouse? If you have to ask, you really haven’t been paying attention to the changing world around you. Cosmetic surgeons and dentists advertise nationally, in airline magazines, and affluent, discriminating patients fly to them. My client Ted Oakley, a wealth advisor, has clients in his home cities in Texas, but has more scattered throughout the country, and instead of advertising locally, advertises nationally. There’s certainly a bakery close to everybody, but Fairytale Brownies in Phoenix, Arizona—not celebrated as a gourmet

##### Redraw your map. Focus more on the ideal customer than on self imposed limitations.


##### The more affluent the customer, client, or patient, the less concerned with convenience and the more he is willing to conduct business at a distance, import from afar, or travel to places in order to get exactly what he wants and what he believes to be the best of a category. Personally, I live mostly in Ohio. One of my three wealth managers is out of state, most of my real estate investments are in Iowa and managed by the aforementioned Mr. Garman there, some of my shirts are tailored in and come from England. The affluent buy a great many things without regard for normal and customary boundaries.

 We Know Where They Live “If your ideal customer is a one-legged midget who bowls in a league on Tuesday nights, has one wife, two kids, three dogs, and a riding lawn mower, we can get you a list of them in your ZIP code.
 It won’t be a very big list, but …”

—DAN KENNEDY, FROM HIS FAMOUS “MAGNETIC MARKETING” SPEECH

##### Finding the affluent consumer ideal for you, in your area, or pinpointed like tacks on a map all over the U.S., is no great mystery.
 Twenty-three percent of U.S. households have more than 64% of all the earned income. Again: More than half of all the income is concentrated in only one of five households. Surely it must be easier to profit by marketing only to the one in five, while completely excluding and ignoring the four in five. Buying behavior supports such a notion. Affluents spend 2.6 times to 3.6 times more than non-affluents across all categories. They are 5 times more likely to buy or lease an automobile in any given year, 3 times more likely to spend over $2,500.00 on jewelry in a year.
 They outspend the four-in-five group in virtually every type of product category, except camping equipment.
 Yet, as obvious as it is that selling to the top 23% while avoiding wasting even a penny or a minute on the remaining 77% has to be the winning strategy, few marketers act this way. Most invest in mass advertising that reaches five in five and hope to be noticed by the one in five. Hope may be a laudatory human emotion, but is a very poor strategy. And an unnecessary one. We can do better.
 A lot of people ask me about finding the affluent, as if they were all residing in secret, undisclosed locations. Actually, privacy in America and many other places in the world is dead. We not only know where they live but also know what they’ve been buying, and whether they’ve been naughty or nice.
 For starters, there are people who have already gone to a great deal of trouble to spy on them, dig up data on them, monitor their buying behavior, and compile lists of them sorted by their interests and passions, by their level of affluence, by the frequency of their spending in a category, as well as by gender, age, ethnicity, marital status, home ownership, income ZIP code, and a myriad of other divisions. In mailing list lingo, these are called selects. The world of mailing lists commercially available for rent is an amazing place, where you can pretty much find any kind of group of desired prospects, then drill down closer and closer to your ideal prospects within the group by these selects.

### Dan Kennedy’s #9 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### More wealth has been created through the use of mailing lists than any
 other media.


##### When you pass through the gateway to the mailing list world, you will discover that tens of thousands of mail order, retail, service, credit card, publishing, and other companies have all their lists of past and present customers, cardholders, and subscribers as well as their prospects or inquiries available for rent. A dirty little secret is that many companies earn substantial sums this way, some eclipsing the net profits from their core businesses and a comparative few are in business solely to build and rent lists. These are called response lists, because people have responded to an ad or direct-mail solicitation or have otherwise asked that company for information or made one or more purchases. Another type of list is a compiled (nonresponse) list. These are even more widely available and generally less costly to rent. The people on these lists did not, in any way, volunteer to be on them. The list owner accesses one or more sources of public records and information and assembles the list for the express purpose of renting it. Both kinds of lists can be very useful. Both offer different kinds of selects.
 For better understanding, we’ll work our way through a few hypothetical examples.
 Let’s assume you own a very upscale French restaurant with a good wine cellar, snooty waiters, and high prices—and you wish to go in search of affluent new customers. This happens to be an easy one, which is why I picked it. There are hundreds of list choices. For example, there is a compiled list of yacht and private plane owners, available by state or county. There are 213,090 prospects on the list. On that list, within a 45- minute driving radius of your restaurant in Beachwood, Ohio, there will be
