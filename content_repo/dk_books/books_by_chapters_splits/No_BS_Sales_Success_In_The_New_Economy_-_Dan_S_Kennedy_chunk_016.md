# CHAPTER 10

STRATEGY 10 SELL MONEY AT A
 DISCOUNT

## This selling strategy is vital in The New Economy. A new sense of “responsible consumerism” has spread—or, if you take a very long view of history, returned—and people now need more sensible, defensible justifications for buying what they want to buy, and what you want to sell to them. The good news is that almost anything can be sold to anybody at any time, if there is desire for it on their part, and if you have a sufficiently compelling money-at-a-discount story to tell. It is imperative that you develop ways to make yours a money-at-discount proposition.
 I was once retained as a consultant to an individual who lectured on methods of preventing theft from employees and vendors’ delivery staff. This individual was a reformed thief who knew how it was done from having done it. (This kind of theft is a little-known problem of huge magnitude. In the typical convenience store, for example, the theft equals or even exceeds the owner’s profit.)
 This expert ex-thief was teaching business owners how to prevent this sort of loss—and they were thrilled. In fact, he had boxes full of testimonial letters from store owners and executives citing specific amounts of money saved in the weeks or months following his seminar. These letters documented the saving of thousands of dollars per store. Some big companies reported savings of as much as $100,000.00 in just a couple of months by applying what they learned.
 He had no idea what he was worth. He was charging only $500.00 to conduct his all-day seminar, and he had one little reference notebook with six audio recordings that recapped the seminar, simply packaged in a bag, that he was selling for about $30.00.
 Let me confess: this was the easiest marketing task I ever had. The first thing I suggested was that he raise his fees. In fact, I convinced him to triple his fee from $500.00 to $1,500.00 immediately. To his shock (but not mine)

## there was very little protest and no loss of clients. Shortly after that, the fee was raised again to $2,500.00 with just a little client grumbling. Even at $2,500.00 a day, he was such a bargain that no one could afford to grumble too much. In essence, we were now selling up to $100,000.00 for $2,500.00. Who wouldn’t buy that? And we had the proof to demonstrate it. Within a year, his fee was $7,500.00, and then doubled to $15,000.00, and he was still attracting more business than he could handle.
 I based his entire marketing program on proving that he was offering money at a discount. In other words, we showed the prospect such a large, compelling return on investment that he or she couldn’t say no, regardless of the price, and provided preponderance of proof that the bargain was real. So, there is the secret magic formula, in just seven words: prove you offer money at a discount.

# Secret Magic Formula . . .

## In just seven words: prove you offer money at a discount.
 There are numerous consultants in the fields of real estate mortgages, office leases, utility bill auditing, and freight cost reduction who guarantee to help clients save at least $10,000.00, and require fees of only $1,000.00 to $2,000.00 or a percentage of monies saved. Well, who wouldn’t agree to that deal?
 That’s the kind of money-at-a-discount “picture” you somehow have to engineer and present for your product or service. The same basic principle applies to negotiating other types of financial transactions. Again, you can sell just about anything if you can show the buyer how the thing (not the buyer) pays for the purchase, how the thing is, in effect, free.

# Dan Kennedy’s #8 No B.S. Truth About Selling

## In persuading others to part with their money, your best possible approach is demonstrating that the apparent expense is not an actual
 expense at all; that the thing being purchased is either free or, better
 yet, actually pays.
 You may never come across a situation where that demonstration is as clear-cut as it was with my client in the theft control business. I know I haven’t come across another such situation. But the technique can be applied, to some degree, to most businesses. It may take some long, hard thought, some research, and some patience, but I assure you it’s worth all that and more.
 Sometimes this has a great deal to do with who you choose to sell to, and, although I’m going to cover the subject of prospecting later in this book, this is a good place to point out the impact of “The Who Factor” in your income and success in selling. In many cases, the single most important factor governing a sales professional’s income is who he chooses to sell to. Not what he is selling, not its virtues and weaknesses, not its price, not competition, not his own sales skill level. Who he chooses to sell to. Stubborn marketers and sales professionals refuse to acknowledge how much “The Who Factor” matters, instead striving for improvement that is fundamentally unavailable from better propositions, better presentations, better skills, or greater effort.
 Going back to my theft expert, there was a “sweet spot” for him, in the grocery store industry, once his fees topped $15,000.00. A single owner of one or even two neighborhood stores was not a good prospect; he had the problem, but the entire amount of inventory in the stores and his sales volume was too small. A big corporation with 30, 40, 50 stores was not

## ideal, because he had to sell to salaried executives who weren’t having their own money stolen. The entrepreneurial owner of 4 to 12 stores—ideal.
 Consider something like private air travel, whether charter or fractional jet ownership. It is so costly there’s no possible money-at-a-discount argument to be made, to most businesspeople. I fly private, and to fly, say, from one of our homes near Cleveland to Orlando and, the next day or days later, back can cost $15,000.00 by private jet. To fly first class on Continental, no more than $1,500.00, or $3,000.00 if Carla and I are both traveling. Sure, flying private, you get free valet parking for your car and don’t have to buy magazines at the airport, but c’mon. One of the very few types of people this can be sold to with a money-at-discount story is the person whose time has enormously high value, in terms of billable hours or deal-making. In private practice, for example, cosmetic surgeons and cosmetic dentists call it “chairside value.” So a client of mine, a dentist, who has case values from $40,000.00 to $100,000.00+, and will chalk up about $20,000.00 for every day chairside, and has more patients on a waiting list than he can accept, sacrifices $20,000.00 for every day he’s away. If he goes to speak at a seminar and loses a day going, a day there, and a day flying back, he’s out of pocket $60,000.00. So if he flies there by private jet in the morning, speaks, and flies home that same afternoon, he “makes” $40,000.00. I’m in roughly the same position: my time at home, meeting with clients, or writing is worth, on average, about $30,000.00 a day. If I can buy a day for less than that with private jet travel vs. commercial flight, I’m buying money at a discount. Of course, I also have to be the sort of person who really wants to travel this way before it can be sold to me, but then the money-at-discount rationale helps a lot.
 There’s a similar, multifaceted profile to be identified for the ideal prospect for any product or service at any price point, and your income and enjoyment from selling will rise dramatically the more time you spend selling only to your ideal prospects.

# How to Put Money in Their Pockets and Then Set
 It on Fire

## You’ve undoubtedly heard the saying “his money’s burning a hole in his pocket.” It’s used to describe people who can’t keep their hands off their money; they can’t wait to spend it. This is why furniture and electronic stores, auto dealerships and other businesses bring in tax preparers and offer free tax return preparation and instant refunds during tax season—that refund is instantly money burning a hole in the customer’s pocket, and he’s quite likely to put out the fire before he gets out of the store! I’ve done a lot of selling by first putting money in the prospect’s pocket, then setting it on fire. You can too. Let me explain.
 When I sold millions of dollars of audio learning systems to doctors in evening seminars, the seminars were free but the doctors had to post a $25.00 deposit to guarantee they would show up; the deposit was “refundable” at the end of the seminar. After presenting the “commercial” and closing the sale, I’d do a “Columbo”—a sales technique named after the rumpled raincoat character played by Peter Falk, famous for saying, “Just one more thing . . . ”—I would say, “Oh, just one more thing. You’ll recall you paid a $25.00 deposit to guarantee you’d be here this evening, and you’ve kept that promise, so your $25.00 is refundable. And we’ll double that refund right before your very eyes; we’ll match it with $25.00 of our money, so you can deduct $50.00 from your System purchase this evening. Just cross out the $499.00 price, deduct the $50.00, and write $449.00 on your form.”
 Even with an audience that many would argue was too sophisticated for such a strategy, this worked magically. What I did was put $50.00 into their pockets and then set it on fire. If they didn’t buy a System, they “lost” that $50.00, and that hurt! Learning from that, I’ve used “purchase roll-up” in countless structured selling situations since. That means that the amount you just spent for “x” is fully credited toward “y” if you act by the deadline.

-----

## In my own practice, for years, the initial day’s consulting fee was credited and deducted from the much larger project fee if the client signed on then and there, which gave me a near 100% “first call close” on sales from $50,000.00 to $500,000.00.
 The idea is simple: if they fail to buy or to upgrade, they “lose” money already invested or already in their pocket. Creating this “loss” changes the entire perception of price, and moves the prospect from thinking about what he’s spending to what he’s about to lose by failing to act.
 I’ve replicated this strategy in other group sales situations in person-to- person selling, even in direct-mail campaigns. In fact, all discounts or bonuses tied to deadline dates in direct marketing offers live this strategy.

# Becoming an “Added-Value” Sales Professional

## Many sales professionals feel challenged by commoditization, and in some fields price shopping facilitated by the internet has worsened the situation, or at least their own perception of the situation.
 A handful of years ago, I spoke at the Advertising Specialty Institute’s national convention, where all the people who sell imprinted giveaway items like pens, litter bags, snow scrapers, key chains, etc. congregate. I opened my talk with this statement:

 “If you are in a commodity business, get out.”
 Afterward, I got a lengthy, outraged letter from one attendee who accused me of being a lazy idiot who hadn’t bothered to gain any understanding of their business and had insulted them by telling them to get out of business.
 She missed the point. Others in the room and in that industry who I work with got the point: that their business is commoditized, that the “trinkets” can be easily price- shopped, and that to prosper, they must focus on bringing “added value” to clients. To counter this, some have designed year-long, multistep, multimonth customer retention and reward programs for businesses involving the delivery of one of these same ad specialty products every month. Others have customized “trinket” based promotions for certain industries—like the Mother’s Day cultured pearl promotion built for a restaurant owners. The pearls are a generic premium available to any one, and can be price shopped, but the pearls “bundled” with a turn-key, ready to use promotion including Mother’s Day cards, postcards, coupons, window signs, table tents, even a website cannot be easily price-shopped. The added value makes the sale possible, and at premium prices to boot.

## that business, he’s up against price competition all over the internet. But with the added value of membership in his vacation club, arranged adventures—from backstage Disney tours to private astronaut training to race car driving adventures, and many other extra services—he doesn’t simply set himself apart from competition, he changes the entire conversation and places his company in a category of one. I also mention him here because he has entered the premium business I just mentioned one paragraph above, by “packaging” vacation home rentals and selling them to businesses to use as gifts-with-purchase premiums or other sales incentives. The page from the customer newsletter put out by another of our Members, Diana Couto of Diana’s Gourmet Pizzeria, features a vacation package from Nigel as a giveaway. (See Figure 10.1.)
 Not long ago, I bought a classic car from a seller in Florida. I needed to get it moved by a transport company to Ohio, checked out by a good mechanic, whatever work needed, done. I needed to get the title changed and get its license plates. The auto shop that got my business—run by another of our Members who understands how to sell, Keith McCrone of Automotive Specialty Services—took care of arranging for the transport and receiving the car so I wasn’t bothered with talking to transporters and juggling my own schedule to take delivery of the car; using my power of attorney to get the title changed and get the plates; inspected the car, faxed me the list of needed work for my okay; temporarily garaged the car; and delivered the car to me by appointment at my convenience. The added value here is maximum convenience—minimum hassle, a great way to add value to many things, especially if selling to affluent or busy clients.

## These are the questions of the day: how can you add value to your core deliverables, so as to . . . create competitive differentiation, even create your own category of one . . . escape commoditization and price-based comparison shopping . . . and make yourself more appealing to certain clients, even if customizing the “package” of core and value added services for the individual client?
 In simple terms, stop trying to sell what you’ve got and start selling what customers want and can’t get—at least all under one roof—anywhere else.

# Be Able To Say: No Other _____________Will . . .

## The New Economy can be most succinctly summarized as: more demanding. More demanding of what? Of many things. Of everything. But above all other things, more demanding of the truly unique benefit. Sales professionals who insist on selling the same products and services without adding a truly unique benefit obtainable only by their customers will find The New Economy a difficult economy.
 The response from most sales professionals will be: “But, there’s nothing unique about what I sell.” Well, whining about that won’t fix it, will it? A key word in the last sentence of the above paragraph: adding.
 One of my Members is a very successful financial advisor who targets only owners of businesses with $5 to $15 million of investable assets, and family succession issues within their businesses. He hosts quarterly three- day mastermind meetings exclusively for his clients, where he brings in top attorneys, psychologists, authors, and experts in family businesses. He says to his clients: “No other financial advisor will bring you together with 50 to 100 other family business owners in similar financial situations, to network, share ideas, advise each other, even identify profitable strategic alliance opportunities.” The key words there are “no other financial advisor will”.
