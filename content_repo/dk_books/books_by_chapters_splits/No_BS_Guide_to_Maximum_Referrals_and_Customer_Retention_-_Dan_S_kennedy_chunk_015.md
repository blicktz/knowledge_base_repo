#### Marketing Technology for Referral Marketing
##### In the Business Kamasutra Benchmark Campaign for Infusionsoft users, we use a workflow specifically designed to ask for referrals from select clients who are likely to give us a referral. Our system sends out a single-question survey asking them “On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to introduce us to a friend or colleague?” If they give you 1 to 4, you have an unhappy customer, and you should call them to resolve the issue. If they give you 5 to 7, you will probably not get a referral from them anytime soon. If they give you 8, 9, or 10, you should add them to your VIP Club, however you design it, and send them tools they can use to give you referrals. Figure 10.2 on page 88 shows the workflow.
 There is a special tell-a-friend workflow in Infusionsoft that would capture the name of the friend who is being referred and starts a special, personalized communication with the friend being referred. Special data engineering allows us to insert the referring client’s name in the message. Figure 10.3 shows the workflow for that.

#### Shock and Awe, VIP Packets, and Big Bear
##### In all of this, what you do needs to impress, have impact, and be different. That’s what gets potential customers excited about you versus everyone else, and it’s what stimulates the most referrals. People like sending others to you when they know those referred are going to have a unique experience!

##### If you go to YouTube and search for the phrase “Dan Kennedy Shock and Awe,” you will find a five-minute video where Dan talks about this very subject on how you can use shock and awe. You can watch the entire video on one of the DVDs when you buy The Ultimate No B.S. Referral Machine from www.GKIC.com/store. In this session Dan talks about how to effectively use your shock and awe package as a referral-generating tool. The concept is this: When a customer or patient agrees to give you a referral, you give them a couple of shock and awe packages—wrapped up in a plastic bag so they don’t get disturbed as they are tossed around in the car or house—along with a book you wrote or a video book if you don’t have a book. You hand the shock and awe to your client and ask them to say, “Here is the package of information from Dr. ____. You will find it interesting. He is the one we trust with our _____.” When you give a tool like a shock and awe package and help them practice what to say when they want to recommend you to someone, they are far more likely to give you a referral. Remember to eloquently express gratitude. Be sincere in your expression and give a meaningful gift. (No, a $100 discount added to their account or deducted from money they owe you does not relieve you from your duty to express gratitude.)
 A version of a shock and awe package, the VIP Patient/Client Package, is something we are experimenting with in 2015. When clients/patients give you a referral, you would upgrade their experience to a VIP experience and have them join an exclusive club with some special benefits. You can give them some free services or treatments, send them birthday gifts or spa treatments, or whatever you consider tasteful. We also encourage you to send a VIP client a WOW box and a giant teddy bear (see Figure 10.4). A WOW box is a box filled with some chocolates or chocolate chip brownies, a couple of Starbucks gift cards (so they can treat someone to a cup of coffee and talk about you), a deck of business cards with a personalized QR code that takes someone to a personalized tell-a-friend landing page, eight postcards that they can hand out (eight because you can print eight postcards on an 11-×-17 sheet and personalize them on demand), and a couple of copies of your flagship free report or consumer guide to choosing the right ____.

##### We have teamed up with a print production and fulfillment facility that has developed an application program interface (API) bridge between Infusionsoft and its print engine. We now can trigger a WOW box shipment directly from Infusionsoft so the entire experience is hands off.
 In 2015 we developed four types of WOW boxes for health practitioners:

 • New client/patient welcome WOW box
 • VIP client/patient welcome to VIP club WOW box
 • End of treatment celebration WOW box
 • Parent appreciation Wow box

 I got the idea of the Parent Appreciation WOW box from Mac Bledsoe’s book Parenting with Dignity. Mac’s son Drew Bledsoe played for the New England Patriots. Besides being an awesome football player, Drew is also an amazing father, a wonderful husband, a generous philanthropist, and a successful businessman. I think Mac did a good job raising his son. In his book, Mac talks about teaching your kids how to adequately express


-----

##### gratitude. I encourage my dentist clients to buy a box of Mac’s books and send the book along with a handwritten card by the child to the parents. Some kids write an entire essay. Some kids just write a few words to thank their mom or dad for all they do or thank them for spending money on their braces. The experience creates a special bond between the dentist and the family. The grateful child and the joyous parent are now ready to share their experience with their friends. I always encourage the dentist to send TWO copies of the book in the Parent Appreciation WOW box. The second copy of the book will always find its way to a family friend who will become a prospective patient.
 Oh, yeah, the giant Teddy Bear! You should check out Vermont Teddy Bear Company (www.vtbear.com). They have a big bear that they can ship to your clients who give you a referral. Just imagine a large box arriving at your office or your home and when you open it . . . out comes a four-foot- tall, large, round teddy bear. It is a theatrical experience.
 Do you want to go through that experience? Do you want me to send you a giant bear? Introduce me to a friend or a colleague who would consider using our services. Tell your friend to go visit my book website at www.businesskamasutra.com and download a digital copy of my book. Tell your friend to visit http://elaunchers.com and download my free report. When your friend becomes a client, I will send you the big teddy bear! (Just the bear. Not the girl. Just the bear.) See Figure 10.5.

##### For those of you who know me and have seen me at Dan Kennedy’s events, you know how much I love and admire Dan’s work. Dan’s work has changed my life and made quite a contribution to my lifestyle. I have been looking to give a gift to Dan that would eloquently express my gratitude. It is a tough decision. What do you give to a man who has literally everything? And one day it just came to me. I was reading the “Mailbox Millions” transcripts from that seminar, and in the opening pages he talks about Ogilvy doing a direct-mail package where they sent out a pair of white homing pigeons to prospective private jet buyers. (If you don’t have “Mailbox Millions” material, you should consider buying The Ultimate Lead Generation System from www.GKIC.com/store, or you can come to my office in Maryland and spend a day in my library. I have over a hundred Dan Kennedy transcripts that your eyes can feast on.)
 So I managed to find the guy who runs an association of dove raisers and asked him to ship me two white homing pigeons to my hotel in Cleveland. I told Dan’s assistant, Vicky, about them ahead of time so she asked Dan to step outside and in the garden we released the doves. I have the whole thing on video, and we took lots of pictures. Yeah, Dan was


-----

##### happy. I was happy. We both had a very happy day. Sure, you got to do some planning ahead of time, you got to spend some time, you got to spend some money . . . but the whole experience would be priceless.
 Dan talked about the birds in the next session. As he was talking about the birds, he mentioned that if the box was slightly larger they could ship Parthiv in the box. See Figure 10.6 on page 94.
 After the event was over, I sent the giant Teddy Bear in a big box. When I was coordinating the logistics with Vicky, she asked me if I was sending a “live” bear. I promised her that it was a Teddy Bear.
 So there we have it. Dan now has a box large enough to ship Parthiv in the box!
 As I am ending this chapter, I want to ask you a question: How far will you go to wow your clients? What will you do for your clients so they would want to tell your story to their friends?

## How to Engineer Your Business or Sales Career to Provide You with a Steady Stream
 of Referrals and Testimonials

##### by Craig Proctor

 eal estate agents, like many sales professionals, spend the vast majority of their hours each week hunting down new prospects by cold-calling and begging for referrals, ironically leaving them little time to take care of their existing clients. My Millionaire

# RReal Estate Agent System fixes this by operating on an entirely different

##### platform that changes this equation and allows sales professionals to instead spend the majority of their time actually taking care of their clients. By reversing the age-old prospecting equation, the agent becomes the “hunted” vs. the “hunter” and is able now to focus on ensuring outstanding results for clients. My complete Millionaire Agent System makes it easy for agents to deliver this consistent and exceptional service, and, as a result, their clients become raving fans and an ongoing, automatic, and lucrative source of referrals.
 I started out like every other agent, and actually achieved a great deal of success through pure, unadulterated, nose-to-grindstone prospecting, prospecting, and prospecting. But it nearly killed me. I built my reverse

-----

##### prospecting approach to save myself. It worked so well I began sharing it with other agents, and, as the saying goes, the rest is history. Tens of thousands of agents have lifted themselves not just to very high incomes but to great lifestyles with my system, and combined, we’ve literally changed the way the business works. Yet, with all the impact we’ve had, there are still huge numbers of agents; frankly, hundreds of thousands of agents operating like I did 20 years ago. To me, seeing them struggling is like finding cavemen in Silicon Valley. Here, I can’t deal with this in its entirety. We’ll focus just on referrals. And, on referrals obtained without humiliation, begging, cajoling, or struggle.
 The foundation of my referral system is actually a marketing system. I call it my ARPS (Automatic Reverse Prospecting System), and it consists of simple, inexpensive, and proven direct-response marketing that compels qualified prospects to contact the agent first. With my system, agents never waste their time cold-calling and begging for business. Instead, they simply return inquiries from qualified prospects who have come to them on their own volition. Talk to the thousands of my students nationwide, and they’ll tell you that generating qualified leads is no longer a problem in their businesses.
 The fact that those using my lead-generation system spend very little time hunting and prospecting for clients liberates them to refocus their efforts on the referral system I teach that is simple and highly effective. There’s no disputing that people are more likely to believe what their friends or relatives say about you versus anything you could possibly say about yourself. The trick is getting those friends and relatives saying it, and saying it effectively. Nurturing that takes some thought and some time.
 The ultimate goal of your marketing is to have the process come full circle. The direct-response ads that underpin my system will always be a critical, external, front-end engine for my members’ businesses, but with time and with effective client servicing and results, the internal engine of referrals also kicks in and delivers a lot of business. By the way, while I’ve built this for real estate agents and will use the real estate business as my example here, it is easily transported and translated to any business where there is direct contact with a customer or client, service provided—that either amazes, is found ordinary, or is disappointing, and potential referrals to be had from customers or clients. That probably describes your business,


-----

##### whether you’ve ever thought about it in that way before or not. It describes 95% of all businesses.
 While the direct-response marketing I teach easily attracts qualified prospects via the offer of great information (which ultimately positions my students as Information Providers versus salespeople), some work is required to convert these leads into clients: nurturing the lead through my systemized conversion process, and then meeting these prospects face-to- face to deliver a killer listing or buyer presentation. This is less the case for a referral, because a referral prospect comes with a predisposition to using your services. Because you have come through a powerful third-party endorsement from someone who has gone through the process they are just embarking on, they are already somewhat presold on your credentials. So while referral business will never eliminate the need for my Automatic Reverse Prospecting System (after all, my ARPS is an extremely easy, proven, and inexpensive way of reaching and motivating new business), referrals do add an important depth to your business. I will now explain how I automated this part of my business, and why it’s a good idea for you to do the same.
 The basis of the referral program I teach agents is to make it easy and motivating for clients to take the step of making a referral, and to plant this seed in their minds and program clients to send you referrals at the best possible moment. There are three tools in this system:

 • Referral Cards
 • Referral for a Worthy Cause
 • Referral Newsletter

#### 1. Referral Cards
##### The best time to ask your clients for referrals is at the time they love you the most, i.e., for real estate agents, that’s right after they’ve signed a listing or buyer contract with you. I did this automatically in my own, highly successful real estate business that spanned over 20 years. It was simply part of the process I followed with every new client. With a newly signed buyer or listing contract, you have just shown your new clients exactly what
