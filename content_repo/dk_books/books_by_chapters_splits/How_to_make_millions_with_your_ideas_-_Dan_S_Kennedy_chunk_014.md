    pany. His company, Personal Wealth Systems, Inc., is following
    a relatively conservative growth plan, marketing goods, services,
   and monthly dues-driven memberships, all with the stated mis-
    sion of helping ambitious Americans live debt-free. Last year,
    its ninth year in business, PWS’s sales doubled from the previous
    year’s, topping $5 million.
     Gary Haiser’s first career was in the music business, as a
    studio musician in Detroit’s Motown community, playing backup
   drums for some of the biggest names in the music world. While
   working as a studio drummer and playing club gigs, he started
    a home-remodeling business, failed miserably, and wrestled with
    a guilt-inspired drinking problem. As he describes it, ‘‘One
    night, I realized that hanging out in clubs and drinking all night
    long was going to kill me.’’ He sold his drums for $800, and he
    and his wife got out of town.
     Gary sort of stumbled into sales, connecting with Culligan
   Water Softeners, and, on the side, experimenting as an Amway
    distributor. Through those activities, he discovered goal-setting,
   self-improvement, and positive thinking, subjects he speaks
    about enthusiastically to his rapidly growing, nationwide orga-
    nization of PWS distributors.
     Discovering that they had a knack for MLM, Gary and his
    wife joined a fast-growing, new MLM, gave it their all, and in
    a very short time built a very large, profitable business—only to
   have the company go bankrupt. Gary determined that he would
    never again build a business that would always be at risk to
   someone else’s management mistakes. He analyzed everything
    he’d learned from his MLM experiences, and designed his own
    marketing and compensation plan, for the new company, Per-
    sonal Wealth Systems.
     Gary’s main twist was and is annpigis on marketing a col-
    lection of consumer services, discounts, and benefits all linked
    to a monthly magazine, as a subscription, not unlike an auto club
    or travel club membership, but more like a Price Club member-
    ship in that PWS’s members have access to over 200,000 prod-
    ucts. By focusing on the membership concept rather than

 tomers/members and PWS distributors authorize the company to
 charge their credit cards or debit their checking accounts for a
 fixed amount of dues each and every month, unless they take
 action to drop out. This technique dramatically reduces turnover
 in the ranks, which is the bane of MLM.
   He has also creatively combined direct-marketing media and
 methods with the multilevel business, so that PWS and its dis-
 tributors (sales consultants) recruit additional subscribers and
 consultants with lead generation advertising, direct-mail cam-
 paigns, recorded messages, and audio and video brochures, rather
 than totally relying on face-to-face, person-to-person selling.
 This is the trend in the industry, and Gary is in sync with the
 trend most months, ahead of it now and again.
   I’ve known Gary for a number of years, and watched with
 great interest as he has worked very hard to create a solid, stable
 business in a very fragile, volatile, highly regulated industry.
 What can be learned from Gary’s example?
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #11:
      CREATIVE COMBINING CAN CREATE HUGE
         BUSINESS BREAKTHROUGHS.
   There’s abundant evidence that you do not need:something
 entirely new and revolutionary to make a fortune. In fact, having
 such a thing may be more of a liability than an asset! But there
 is great opportunity in combining the “‘old’’ in new ways.
   Gary Haiser has combined the traditional, highly consumable
 MLM products, such as cleaning compounds, cosmetics, and nu-
 trition, with the types of services customarily associated with
 union, association, or club memberships, such as a credit union
 and low-interest loans, health and dental insurance, long-distance
 telephone savings, and travel discounts, and put it all under one
 umbrella: the Personal Wealth Systems Savings Network. Then
 he has combined a very common, proven direct-marketing in-
 dustry strategy, the continuity program, with the membership, as
 a means of reducing turnover and creating predictable incomes

    forbid programs,”’ are used in direct marketing for book clubs,
    record clubs, movie clubs, recipe clubs, etc., where the customer
    enrolls for an automatic monthly shipment of goods and an au-
   tomatic monthly charge.) Then he combined direct-marketing,
   mail-order, and even high-tech advertising methods with
   person-to-person selling. And he combined high-quality self-
   improvement, sales training, and even financial-planning training
   and services with his business opportunity to support the theme
   of his pitch to distributors: Use PWS as a vehicle to get out of
    debt and stay out of debt while still living well.
     And all that’s a lot of combining!
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #18:
        CONSIDER PRIORITIES OTHER THAN THE
           FASTEST-POSSIBLE GROWTH.
     Some years ago, I watched several friends destroy their very
   young, explosively growing MLM company from the inside out.
   Their growth was so massive and uncontrolled that they couldn’t
    fill orders, so products were constantly on back order; they
   couldn’t get all the incoming data into the computers, so bonus
   checks were late; and they couldn’t properly communicate with
   and enforce policies in the field, so overzealous and, in some
    cases, unscrupulous distributors were lying, cheating, and abort-
   ing the business’s system at will.
     This is only one of many times that I’ve seen growth tum
    negative. Gary Haiser’s seen the same things, and has very de-
    liberately insisted on conservative growth for PWS. Over the
   nine years that PWS has been in business, he has kept a grip on
    the reins of geographic expansion, product-line expansion and
    diversification, and corporate debt, and has stubbornly enforced
    policies, often at the expense of losing talented, productive peo-
    ple. My bet is that the long-term survival and stability of his
   company will prove his approach right.
    When a business sacrifices product or service quality, financial
    controls, or integrity in favor of growth, it mortgages its future for

   Gary Haiser certainly sees PWS as ‘‘another Amway’’ and
 more, as a multibillion-dollar business, not just a multimillion-
 dollar business. In fact, he’ll tell anybody who’ll listen that he’s
 becoming ‘‘the Sam Walton of network marketing.’’ You might
 be tempted to laugh at the idea of this funny little company beating
 Wal-Mart’s $40 billion+ annual revenues. But don’t laugh too
 loud. The ranks of the millionaire entrepreneurs are full of people
 who’ ve been loudly and widely ridiculed for their big ideas, when
 they had nothing but big ideas. There seems to be a certain extra
 power or energy that comes from having very big goals.
     Instead of Starting a Network-Marketing
        Company, Supply One!
   Another way to reap profits generated by the unique dupli-
 cation and multiplication of network marketing is as a supplier
 to one or more of these companies. In any given month, one-
 fourth to one-half of all new MCI residential customers come
 through Amway, so you can bet that MCI is very, very happy
 to be supplying Amway.
   On a smaller scale, my client Eagle International Institute is
 a publisher of time-management courses, diaries, and systems.
 The Eagle Day Planner generates huge revenues as a supplier to
 several network-marketing companies. In its ‘‘regular life,’’ Ea-
 gle competes head-on with products and companies like Day-
 Timers and Franklin, and conducts seminars for and supplies
 major corporations with time-management assistance for their
 employees. And that, itself, has grown into a phenomenally suc-
 cessful business. But in its ‘‘other life,’’ Eagle private-labels and
 customizes its time-management materials and Day Planners for
 several different network-marketing companies, which, in turn,
 sell them to and. through their proliferating distributor networks.
   ‘‘The multiplication effect is staggering,’’ Mark Colosi, the
 founder of Eagle International, told me, “‘because, in a multilevel

```

```
    every distributor seen carrying around and using the Day Planner
    automatically influences other distributors to get and use the
    Planners. There’s a snowball effect. The more who show up at
    a meeting with their Planners, the less comfortable those without
    Planners become. Soon, everybody’s just got to have one.”’
       How Will the Market for Business
       ‘Opportunities Stand Up in the Future?
      If you have some kind of a business or moneymaking system
    you duplicate, or you supply someone who does, you can count
    on a continuing boom, with no end in sight. There are forces at
    work, many irreversible, literally flooding the market with people
   who must choose from self-employment options: buy a going
    business, start from scratch, buy a franchise, buy a distributor-
    ship, join a network marketing company, or enroll in a boot
   camp or similar training program.
     Think about mid-level executives, for example. American
    corporations are in a downsizing mode, squeezing layers of mid-
    dle management out, streamlining their bureaucracies, and, in the
    process, eliminating awesome numbers of jobs. So we have a
    fellow forty, forty-five, maybe fifty years of age, with twenty
    years or so into a management career, accustomed to éarning
    $50,000 a year, probably considerably more, and his position is
    eliminated. And most companies that might provide him with a
    job are eliminating the same kinds of positions, too. He’s too
    old to go back to school and too young to retire, but the jobs he
   may get offered will be inferior in status and offer considerably
    less income. He is firmly pointed toward self-employment.
     Add the downsizing of the government in general, specifi-
    cally the military, early retirements from government and private
    sectors, women reentering the workplace in droves, technical
    jobs replaced by evermore sophisticated automation, and you
    have a growing hunk of the population firmly directed toward

 part-time, home-based businesses for another cluster of reasons.
 All these trends virtually guarantee that people marketing valid,
 duplicatable opportunities will do very well in the coming years.
       Duplication of Another Kind,
           as a Private Labeler
   Duplication can take many forms. By private-labeling his
 time-management systems for other companies, with their name
 and identity on them instead of his own company’s, Mark Colosi
 takes an asset and duplicates it over and over again, with each
 one potentially as valuable as the original.
      How an Oklahoma Beautician Became a
       Millionaire by Supplying the Multilevel
        and Direct-Marketing Industries
         with Her Home-Grown Aloe
   At age seventy-four, my friend Edna Hennessee runs her
 sprawling cosmetics-manufacturing plant, aloe farm with sixty
 commercial-size greenhouses, and team of chemists, inventors,
 graphic artists, and account executives with an iron hand, a
 mother’s love, and the energy of a teenager. Her multimillion-
 dollar enterprise has had much of its growth fueled by too many
 multilevel companies to remember, some gone, some still
 around, some growing explosively.
   Edna’s company is the only private label manufacturer of-
 fering home-grown, all-natural aloe from its own farms with
 complete formulation and packaging services all under one roof.
 The same fifty or so formulations that Edna created and produces
 are packaged for and sold by hundreds of different companies,
 including multilevel companies, TV infomercial companies, even
 the highest-priced, ritzy skin-care and beauty salons in New

   Oklahoma. After six years of selling Merle Norman cosmetics
    and running a beauty salon, Edna decided she could produce
    better products than she was getting from her suppliers. Edna
    studied everything she could find at the library about chemistry
    and about cosmetics. In 1956 she formulated her first product, a
    face cleanser, in her kitchen, making eight or nine jars’ worth at
    a time in a pan with a handheld blender. Two years later, her
    first line of products—‘‘Youth in a Jar’’ lotions, creams, and
   treatments—was being sold in her own store, by mail, and by a
   few sales agents scattered around the country. Her business’s
    explosive growth started when she switched from using water
   and oil as bases (common in the skin-care business) to using
    aloe as a base, not just a top-off ingredient, Consumers were
    thrilled with the effects of aloe-based products, and it wasn’t
    long before other companies’ executives were finding their way
    to Edna, eager to find out what she knew.
     Edna kept her formulas to herself, and acted quickly to tie
    up as much aloe-plant production as she could. The only way to
    get this self-taught chemist’s formulas, savvy advice, and top-
    quality aloe was to have her produce and package products for
    you. And hundreds of companies, including names you’d know,
    do just that.

         PRIVATE LABELING IS A FANTASTIC WAY
          TO GET MASSIVE DISTRIBUTION FAST,
          WITH NO ADVERTISING AND LITTLE
            MARKETING EXPENSE.
     Imagine what it must cost to create consumer awareness and
   demand for a new line of women’s skin-care products! You’d
   need famous models and actresses, $25,000-to-$50,000-per-page
    ads in Cosmopolitan and other magazines, TV commercials, and
    fancy packaging. Could you invest a million before selling your
    first jar? That much and more.

 private-label it for companies that already have consumer con-
 fidence, advertising, and, most importantly, extensive distribu-
 tion.
 __ Let’s assume you have an incredible new kind of car polish.
 You might package it one way for Wal-Mart, with their name,
 logo, and identity all over it, as ‘‘Sam’s Favorite Polish.’’ But
 you might also package it in a different size and shape container,
 labeled entirely differently for sale through The Sharper Image’s
 catalog as ‘‘Sharper Image Auto Polish.’’ And repackage it for
 a multilevel company.
  Even a writer can use a version of private labeling, combined
 with recycling, to make money. Here’s an example: Some years
 back, I thoroughly researched the subject of raising capital and
 borrowing money for business purposes from public, govern-
 ment, private, conventional, and unconventional sources, and I
 put together an audiocassette course on this subject (The Money
 System); my company has sold thousands of these cassettes, and
 continues to sell them today. I took that same course, altered its
 packaging slightly, and private-labeled it for Hume Publishing,
 for their use as a premium. I took chunks of that course and built
 a smaller audio product that was used by another direct marketer.
 Over about five years, I’ve recycled some or all of that same
 information into six different products, four of them private-
 labeled for other companies.
      MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #34:
       CREATE YOUR OWN TOLL BOOTH.
  Edna set herself up in a toll position. There’s a finite quantity
 of top-quality aloe vera in the country. Edna has the largest aloe
 farms in a ten-state area. But to get to that aloe, you have to go
 through Edna. Edna also created and kept confidential proprie-
 tary, exclusive, highly effective product formulations as well as
 expert know-how about how each item should be positioned,
 described, and demonstrated. To get that knowledge and exper-
 tise, you gotta go through Edna!

  HOW TO MAKE YOUR MILLIONS
    IN THE EXCITING WORLD
    OF DIRECT MARKETING
  pes may be nothing more joyous than getting the day’s mail,
     opening envelope after envelope after envelope and taking
   out—no, not bills!—orders with checks and money orders. And
   arriving at your office to find the tray of your fax machine filled
   with orders. And to walk through your office and hear your em-
   ployees on the phone, taking orders. What used to be called
    ‘‘mail-order,’’ the direct-marketing business today is almost
    irresistibly attractive. This is the world I live in the majority of
    the time. I have my own publishing/direct-marketing company,
   I’m a partner in another, and about half my consulting clients
    are in this business.
     In this chapter, I cannot and will not even attempt to teach
   you direct marketing from A to Z, for two reasons. First, such
    a task is herculean; if you choose this as your main path to
    millions, you’ll have to become a dedicated, determined student,
    read dozens of books, go to seminars, join several associations,
    and otherwise immerse yourself in self-education. The second
    reason is that there are aspects of the business I know little about
    and try to stay away from myself, such‘ as the complexities of
    inventory and fulfillment management. Instead, I will zero in on
   only a few, hopefully eye-opening, opportunity-revealing ways
    that fast fortunes are made in direct marketing.

     The One-Page Typewritten Letter That
      Brought in 7 Million Orders and
          Built an Empire
   The company is now twenty years old; it sold to over
 500,000 customers in 1993 and projects almost doubling that for
 1994; it sells its products in thirteen countries—and it all began
 with a single, one-page typed letter that became one of the most-
 mailed sales letters in history.
   In 1970 a young fellow struggling to succeed in mail-order
 after a series of abysmal failures was sitting in a dark house
 (the utilities went unpaid in favor of postage for sales letters).
 With an understandably unhappy wife looking over his shoulder,
 he decided to do the sales letter for his newest idea—a ‘‘family
 crest research report’’—as if his life depended on it. The result
 was a very unprofessional-looking, typed, almost ugly letter, sent
 in a plain, typewriter-addressed envelope with a stamp on it, all
 to give the appearance of a personal letter from someone you
 know.
   To date, an estimated 100 million copies of that letter have
 been mailed, all first class, pulling over 7'/2 million cash orders.
   This letter made Gary Halbert both a millionaire and a living
 legend in the direct-marketing business. And, although he sold
 his interest in the enterprise early in the game, his letter built a
 continuing business that has become the world’s largest marketer
 of family research publications and family crest-related mer-
 chandise: plaques, glassware, sweaters, shirts, and gift items.
 That company, Numa Limited, boasts a combined mailing list
 database of over 200 million people worldwide, organized not
 just by zip code (as all lists are), but uniquely by family surname.
 It’s the only database of its kind.
   Gary’s original partner, Dennis Haslinger, has done a phe-
 nomenal job of expanding the company’s products and services,
 creating strong customer loyalty, and applying very sophisticated
 marketing techniques to sustain this business. Can you hope to
