STRATEGY 9 FRED HERMAN’S K.I.S.S.
 PRINCIPLE

## Earl Nightingale once called the late Fred Herman “America’s greatest sales trainer.” It’s a title I think he deserved. To my knowledge, Fred is the only salesman ever to appear as a guest on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. (Carson said, “OK, since you’re the greatest salesman, sell me this ashtray.” Fred picked it up, examined it, and asked, “If you were going to buy this ashtray, what would you expect to pay for it?” Carson named a price. Fred said, “Sold!”)
 I discovered Fred Herman’s work after I already had years of experience in selling; I wish I had found it when I started. Fred is probably most famous for coining the KISS Principle for Selling: KEEP IT SIMPLE, SALESMAN! This is an immensely valuable lesson that I learned the hard way.
 In my first sales position, with the publishing company I described earlier in this book, one of the things I was most effective at was opening new accounts where we could place the entire six-foot-tall spinner rack. The standard procedure prescribed by the company was to review the catalog of books with the buyer, choosing the titles to be displayed in the rack. As the rack only held about one-third of all the available titles, this selection process was a time-consuming chore. The customer and I had to discuss just about every title. Inevitably, he or she wanted more variety than the rack could accommodate. I found it took almost two hours, on average, to place a new rack.
 Then I realized that almost 90% of the racks I placed carried the same titles on them. So I reasoned that I knew better than the customer which titles would do best, and I was wasting his or her time and mine discussing products that would not be on the rack. From this realization, I created a “standard rack assortment” which I copied and used every time I sold a new customer a rack. All the customer had to do was initial the precompleted

 How come nobody else in the company had thought of this? People have an incredible tendency to complicate their lives. I’m not sure why that happens, but I know that it happens. I even have a name for it: complexity creep. Complexity just creeps up on you when you’re not looking. And, unnecessary complexity creates a whole host of problems. It wastes time, it drains your energy and enthusiasm, it often confuses the customer—and confused customers do not buy!

# The New Economy’s Chaos of Choices and New Economy Customers’ Desire for the Easy Button

## There’s an excellent book by Barry Schwartz, The Paradox of Choice, that explains the ever-growing unhappiness of most consumers as their choices in every category of product and service expand exponentially. You might think more choices would make people happier, but that’s not the case. Having 10 brands of designer shoes to choose from instead of 3 does; having 200 does not. I happen to like soup, and I find myself confused by the dizzying and ever-growing choices just within the Campbell’s brand. This past year they premiered V-8 soups by Campbell’s, and for the life of me, I don’t know why the V-8/Campbells vegetable soup is different or superior or inferior to the regular Campbell’s vegetable or their premium vegetable or their Select Harvest vegetable, and to be honest I find all that more thinking than I care to do, just to buy some soup. So I haven’t bought any in months. If only there was a really good soup salesman to guide me to precisely the perfect soup for me—given that I am diabetic, I am in my 50s, I need a lot of energy for my work, I’m usually in a hurry so complex preparations are out, and price is no object.
 In the emerging New Economy, one way companies are competing for business is to divide and conquer; even to compete with themselves; and keep bringing more and more and more choices of a product or service to market. This, however, is contrary to the New Economy Customer’s time pressures from an always-connected, always-multitasking, always-on-the- run existence. One of the reasons the office products store chain’s “Easy Button” ad campaign resonated with so many people and lasted as long as it did is this wish for simplicity.
 There’s never been a better time to do what I started doing 30+ years ago: simplifying the buyer’s deciding for him.
 If you can secure the trust of a customer, then he will welcome you deciding for him. This is why a sales strategy like the bundling together of

# You Can Get Rich Making the Complicated
 Simple

## I recently saw an interesting advertisement placed by a copywriter looking for work. He billed himself as a “professional explainer” who specialized in “making complicated things simple and easy to understand.” That’s exactly what you need to do in your efforts to persuade others. (Too bad there’s nobody who’ll do that for me, for assembly directions for things I buy or for my damned computer.)
 Not long ago, I was wrestling with a direct-mail project involving the sale of a rather complicated financial product to unsophisticated investors. Two consecutive test mailings failed miserably. I thought they were well- written, clear, and exciting. I thought they offered a great deal to the customer. I thought everything was right. Just one small problem: they didn’t work. I read through them a hundred times and still found no clue to the problem. One evening, I got the idea to add a little diagram at the end of the literature that showed—in cartoon form—the gist of the product. The addition of this little drawing, which showed visually what was said in the copy, made the piece a huge success. The mailing with the drawing got phenomenally good results. That one little drawing made the complicated simple and understandable.
 P.T. Barnum once said that, “No man ever went broke overestimating the ignorance of the American public.” Maybe that judgment of the American consumer is a little harsh, but it does introduce a major mistake made by the majority of sales and marketing people over and over again: overestimating the sophistication of their customers. New Economy Customers may have been conditioned by recession to try and be more circumspect, but that does not mean they miraculously got smarter.
 It’s natural for you to insist that the people you deal with are smarter than everybody else’s customers. That reflects well on you, doesn’t it? It’s good for your ego to think that you’re dealing with a “better class” of people. It

## may be good for the ego, but it’s bad for the bank account! Here is the best way to succeed in advertising, selling, marketing, or persuading others (regardless of who they are or how smart and sophisticated you believe they are): present everything in the simplest possible language and in the simplest possible form.

# Close the Doors on the Sales Prevention
 Department

## A lot of companies have a more active Sales Prevention Department than they do a sales operation—overrun with saleskilling policies, rules, laws, forms. Often this happens if the lawyers and bean-counters gain excess power back at the home office. I do not envy those of you working for the worst of these. My first and only sales job mentioned earlier in this chapter was with a company who had such a department, but even more so, had management focused on everything but the ease and simplicity with which an account could be opened, a new customer brought into the fold. I was able to circumvent the home office and invent my own streamlined, simplified sales process. Maybe you can too. But if you must try dragging the powers-that-be above you out of the sales prevention mode, here’s a story that may help you sell your ideas. Feel free to use it as your own.
 There’s a little neighborhood, mom-n-pop coffee shop near my home, where I sometimes eat breakfast. On the counter, next to the cash register, there are three different receptacles for coins, for charitable donations—one for Kiwanis, one for something for the blind, one for disabled veterans. One morning, as I dropped my change into one of them, it registered with me that I always plunked my change into the same one. Why? I stood there for a few minutes, pondering my own behavior.
 Then it hit me. The reason I always put my change into the disabled veterans jar was . . .
 NOT because I had any preference for that charity over the others. NOT because of any reasoned decision to support it instead of the others.

 NOT because of the graphic design or appearance of the different containers. NOT because of any sales copy on the containers. NOT because of their arrangement on the counter.

-----

## NOT for any thoughtful or logical or admirable reason. BUT definitely for a reason.

 The reason, and the only reason, I put all my change into only one of these charity jars, each and every time, is . . .

 the hole in the top of the jar I put all my coins into is bigger than the holes in the lids on the other two jars.
