out and getting this done overnight!”
 That’s the time for you to say something like: “Hey, you

 know, we’re trying to grow the business here, we’re taking on some new equipment and you know we really depend on clients like you for referrals. I wonder if you would just take a

 few of your business cards and jot down on the back of each one the name and the phone numbers of a few people that I

 can call and talk to.”
 And when you ask, you get. Here’s perfect proof of this. One of the most challenging

 groups I’ve found to convince to do referrals are chiropractors. For some reason, they seemed to have a hang

 up about this. Even so, we devised a plan.
 They offered a back care class in their clinic that all the patients come to in a group and then they teach them about

-----

###### their back and how to take care of themselves. We came up

 with a very simple mechanism where at the end of the class the doctor essentially says:
 “Oh, by the way, many of you got here as a result of being

 referred by somebody who cared enough about you to refer you, and that’s how we get most of our new patients. We

 would really appreciate it if you would refer others, too. And for that reason, I am passing out these forms.”
 They passed out these little forms which have places for

 ten names, addresses and telephone numbers. And they asked them to fill them out and they’re going to send them

 some introductory information about chiropractic.
 Now, they did that very fast and it’s a very soft request. It is very painless. It’s done at the end of the class, so if

 somebody doesn’t want to do it, it is easy for them to just leave the form on their chair and sneak out of the office.

 Guess what happens? Seven out of ten patients fill out the form, turn in the form with somewhere between three and ten names and addresses and telephone numbers. Costs nothing

 to get those names, addresses and telephone numbers.
 Of course, then those names, addresses and telephone

 numbers get plugged into the three-step campaign system and one-third of them become new patients.
 All from the power of simply asking for referrals.

###### CHAPTER 10
#### APPLYING THE MAGNETIC MARKETING
 SYSTEMS

-----

###### I want to share with you a story that illustrates how a very common business owner could take everything we have discussed so far and put it into their own

 Magnetic Marketing System.
It’s really important that you go through it carefully. Here’s why:

 First of all, it takes everything we talked about so far and a few things we didn’t, and stitches them together in chronological application order, so you

 see how they work.

 Secondly, it does it in a real-life business. This is a true-life example.

 Third, it does it in a business where most of you

 would never expect to find good marketing, thereby demonstrating if this guy can do it, you can do it too.

 Fourth, it gives you a complete marketing strategy, a

 step-by-step system, that you can use exactly as it is described to you in this story and see results in your bank account in twenty-one days or less.

 And there’s a bonus. It gives you a new market, a farm, a group of prospects perfect for you, which you already have access to but are not currently

 harvesting.

 For it to do all of those things, every little nuance is important, you will want to pay close attention.

 One day, in the mail, I get an envelope. The envelope is addressed to me, Mr. Dan Kennedy. It has a real live stamp on

 it. And in the return address corner is the name of someone I

-----

###### know, a colleague in business who also lived in my hometown.

The takeaway for you is the envelope is from someone whose name I
recognize. It’s addressed to me. And it’s got a real postage stamp on it. Not
“bulk rate”—a stamp. What I’ve just described to you is one almost certain
way to get an envelope opened. It’s not the only way. Sometimes it’s not the
best way in a given situation, but it is a very good way.

###### So I open it. The letter headline says, “I suppose you’re

 wondering why I’m writing to you about a plumber.” I say to myself, “Yup, what’s is this all about?”

Second takeaway. If you want to make your marketing work, write down, “Got
to get them to open it, got to get them to read it.” And you’ve got about ten
seconds from flap to trash to compel readership. Curiosity is one way to do it.
Not necessarily the best, but it’s the way that was used here. (By the way, it’s
exactly the same with email. You need have a great subject line if you want
people to open and read your emails.)

###### The letter goes on to tell a story about how my colleague was having a party at his home on a Friday evening to which I had not been invited, and at about nine o’clock at night, a pipe in

 the den under the bar began to spew water everywhere.
 A horrible mess.

 He had to find a plumber who would come out on a Friday night at nine. Made calls out of the phone book, finally found this guy, Al the plumber, who rushed out, gooped this,

 tightened that, didn’t have to sell him any parts. He had the whole mess cleaned up in under twenty minutes and only

 charged him a small amount of money.
 And in order to say thank you to this plumber for this extraordinary service he decided to send this letter to all of

-----

###### us, his colleagues who live in town, and let us all know that if

 we ever need a plumber, Al’s the guy we’ve got to call.

There’s more you have to know about the Al story. But a major money-making
thing just happened. It’s called a champion circle of influence
. Everybody has
a circle of influence in which you could do business if you were properly
introduced, but you haven’t been.

###### The plumber goes back to the customer and says, “You know, when I was here the other night, you were very grateful and I

 appreciate that. What you probably don’t know is we get very little of our new business the way we got you, from advertising. We get most of our new customers through

 people like you, because you probably belong to something. You belong to Rotary?” “No.”

 “Country Club?” “No.” “Homeowners association?” “No.” “Well, everybody belongs to something.”

 The guy confesses. He says, “Well, there is this speakers’ association I belong to.”
 “Great! How many of those are there in Phoenix?” “Three

 hundred.” The plumber says, “Terrific. Here’s what I’d like to do.” Here’s the second thing. The plumber says, “Here’s what

 I’d like to do. I wrote up what you said to me as I left, now as a letter from you to those three hundred people. We can change anything you want to change. But then I want to take

 it and I want to put it on your stationery. Again, not mine, yours. I want to put it in your envelopes. Not mine, yours. And

 I want to send it to those three hundred people who know you by name but do not yet know me. I pay for everything. May I do that?”

-----

That’s called an endorsed mailing to a champion circle of influence. It’s the
only piece of mail on the planet that will 100 percent get opened and 100
percent get read.

###### So I got the envelope, opened the envelope, and read the whole letter.

 And when I got all done with it, I didn’t call Al the plumber. Why didn’t I call Al the plumber? Right, because I didn’t

 need a plumber, sure. So all that’s wasted, isn’t it?
 Wrong. If he stops there, it’s a giant epic waste.

 Think of what has to happen now for it to turn into business for the plumber. I got the letter and read it. Al sounds like a

 pretty good guy. But I don’t need a plumber.
 But for this to work for Al, I’d have to make eighteen copies of this letter, then get eighteen zip-lock sandwich bags and

 eighteen pieces of duct tape, because he’s got eighteen pipes. I’d have to put a letter in each bag, then I’d have to go around and stick one to every pipe so someday when I DO

 need a plumber, I can find this guy.
 This is no way to get a flood of business.

 That’s why, about ten days later, I get what I would call letter number one from Al the plumber.
 “Hi, I’m Al the plumber. You remember me? I’m the guy

 your friend wrote to you about, who had the party you weren’t invited to, who had the leak I rushed out and took

 care of. Now the reason I’m writing you now is we have this very important free thing we do only for people referred to us for our VIP customers. That free thing is a free home

 plumbing problem-prevention audit. And the reason why it’s

-----

###### so important for you to have a free home plumbing

 prevention audit is every home ten years old or older has at least one hundred horrible plumbing problems that could occur at a moment’s notice. And we come out and make sure

 none of those things are about to happen to you, for free.”

Notice what Al’s just done—he’s using his “Free Home Plumbing ProblemPrevention Audit” as a Lead Generation Magnet to get me to raise my hand
and invite him to provide further information. Yes, it’s a consultation, but
because he’s already established credibility through the endorsed mailing
from my buddy, the threshold barrier’s been lowered enough to go with this
as a first step. Of course, Al could’ve offered instead a more standard LGM
like a report, “100 Horrible Plumbing Disasters Just Waiting to Destroy Your
Home and How to Prevent Them—Guaranteed!” in his system. Again, in this
situation the audit works just fine.

###### I still don’t call Al the plumber.
 Now I’m hearing drips in the night I wasn’t hearing before,

 but I still don’t call Al.
 That’s why ten days later, Al the plumber, sends me a second notice.

 “Hi, I’m Al the plumber. You remember me? I’m the guy your friend wrote to you about, had the party you weren’t

 invited to, had the leak. I wrote to you about our free home plumbing problem-prevention audit. I haven’t heard from you and I’m very concerned. If you’ll take a look at the enclosed

 article reprint, you’ll see why.”
 And I take this article reprint out of the envelope. It’s from a

 small community newspaper. Everybody knows everybody. They only publish once a week. Here’s a front-page story about this couple, elderly couple. They went away just for the

 weekend to visit the grandkids, a little drip under the sink

-----

###### when they left. They put a little Tupperware bowl under there to catch it.

 They come back on Monday. And in the article, there’s a photograph of the house in five parts floating in a pond.

 There’s another photograph of the family dog clinging to a piece of wood, waiting to be rescued.
 I go back to the letter and it says,

 “As you can see, even small plumbing problems can become big plumbing problems at a moment’s notice.”

 I still don’t call Al the plumber. But now I’m going through the basement looking at pipes and thinking, “They look okay to me.”

 Ten days later, Al the plumber sends the his third “final notice” letter:

 “Dan, we’ve twice offered you our free home plumbing problem-prevention audit. We haven’t heard from you, but we sure have heard from a whole lot of other smart folks. That’s

 why if you want the free home plumbing problem-prevention audit, it’s very important you call within the next seventy-two

 hours. Otherwise, we may have to put you on a waiting list of up to one hundred days. And enclosed is a list of some of the horrible plumbing problems that may occur during…”

 I call Al the plumber.

Now, I’m going to tell you the rest of the Al story in a second, but first let’s do
some quick analysis. Al the plumber did everything we’ve talked about
brilliantly. Let’s analyze his marketing campaign.

Al the plumber, our marketing genius, goes and he gets himself a small,
carefully-selected, manageable target market. His is his champions circle of
influence
, one of the most productive farms you’ll ever own.

-----

The first seed he plants in his farm is the endorsed mailing, the only piece of
mail that 100 percent gets delivered, 100 percent gets opened, 100 percent
gets read.

He then kicks off his campaign with a sequence of communications.

He creates a Lead Generation Magnet, which is the offer of a free in-home
plumbing audit.

He continues to pound this offer, referencing prior mailings, adding urgency
with a final notice.

He did everything we talked about brilliantly.

And if a plumber can do it, you can do it too.

Now let’s talk about showing up like no one else.

###### Al arrives at my home, virtually no resemblance to what I expect when I think “plumber.” He’s not wearing work
 clothes, he’s not carrying a tool box.
 Al the plumber is in a three-piece suit, freshly pressed white

 shirt, quality tie, and shined shoes. He’s carrying a brown calf- skin attaché case.
 The only resemblance between this business executive and

 a plumber is on the breast pocket of his suit coat, there’s a cloth patch sewn on that says, “Al.”

 He comes into the house, he opens up his attaché case, takes out a matching clipboard.
 “Mr. Kennedy, as you can see, this is the form I’m going to

 use to check the one hundred possible plumbing problems. It takes me about twenty minutes to do that. While I do that, do

 you have a DVD player? You need to watch this DVD.”
 I watch the DVD which talks about one of the greatest health care crises in America today.

-----

###### Seems an alarming number of us seasoned citizens are falling and slipping in our bathtubs. Serious injuries, breaking

 hips. It turns out they’ve got this invisible glop that replaces bathmats forever, one-time application. Nothing to clean, and you’ll never slip and fall. A lifetime warranty.

 The video clicks off in nineteen minutes. And as it does, Al is standing there.

 Obviously, Al has done this before. “Mr. Kennedy, I have very good news for you. You do not have ninety-six of the most common household plumbing

 problems. The ones you do have are very trivial. I have everything with me to take care of them today. I just need to

 go out and get some work clothes and get some tools. While I do that, did you watch the DVD?”
 Yep, I watched it.

 “I noticed you have five baths. You have one in the master suite, then you have these other four. While I’m here today, shall we just protect the one in the master suite or shall we

 protect all of them?”
 $389 later, Al the plumber gets in his new Lexus and drives

 away.
 I was intrigued so I called him a few days later, “Look, I didn’t want to bother you when you were out at the house

 working. I know that’s rude. But I teach Magnetic Marketing systems and you used one of them brilliantly. I wonder if

 you’d mind sharing the numbers?”
 Al says, “Not at all, I’ll just have to put you on hold and get the project file.”

-----

###### I’m now on hold, listening to a recorded commercial for his brother’s pool cleaning service. When that’s over, he’s back.
 “What would you like to know?”

 “How many homes did you mail to?” “About three hundred.”

 “How many of those home problem-prevention audit things have you done so far?”
 “Seventy-two.”

 Do the math, if you wish. Assume no one but me gave him money immediately. A poor assumption on your part, but

 make it if you wish.
 For the price of three hundred letters times three, he’s been in seventy-two homes where he’s put on a show and a

 half.
 When they need a plumber, who are they going to call?

 To make sure, at every place there’s a pipe, there’s a sticker.
 Of course Al’s newsletter “Plumber’s Helper” arrives within

 the week.
 Again… who are they going to call?

 You get the picture. THAT is how you work the Magnetic Marketing System
, soup to nuts. And if a business like a plumber could do it, it’s

 a pretty sure bet your business can do so as well.

 NOW IT’S UP TO YOU
