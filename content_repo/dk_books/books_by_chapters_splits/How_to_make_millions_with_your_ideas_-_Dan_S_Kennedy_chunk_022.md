    tive, and that’s good discipline. Finally, the newsletter business
    allows you to stack up predictable renewal income, ultimately a
    significant measure of financial security.
     The bad news, and the secret to the newsletter business, is
    that it is very hard to directly sell a newsletter subscription as
    your first transaction with a new customer. Newsletters are best
    sold to established customers who are already satisfied with other
    information you’ve provided to them and are set up to want a
    continuing relationship.
     You might also consider an audio newsletter. The Guthy-
    Renker Corporation has been phenomenally successful selling
    subscriptions to Power Talk, a monthly audio series, to buyers
    of Tony Robbins’s Personal Power Program from their TV in-
    fomercials. Power Talk subscriptions have been sold by direct-
    mail and by outbound telemarketing. Executive Book Summaries
    is a widely advertised, monthly audio series providing condensed
    versions of current bestselling business books for executives who
    don’t have time to read.
     Whether you ‘‘package’’ your information for sale on paper,
    on audiotape, on video, on a diskette, in a newsletter, or even as
    a 900-number recorded message, remember that the fundamen-
    tals of marketing remain the same.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #30:
     CHOOSE DIFFERENT INFORMATION PRODUCT FORMATS
        AND PRICES TO FIT THE TARGET MARKETS,
         THEIR PRICE SENSITIVITIES, THE VALUE
        THEY’LL DERIVE FROM THE INFORMATION,
              AND OTHER FACTORS.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #31:
        SELL THE SAME INFORMATION IN A NUMBER
             OF DIFFERENT FORMATS,
          AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PRICES.
     The same basic marketing principles and strategies that I
    teach repetitively are now sold in several books in the $10 to
    $20 price range, in audiocassettes for $99, in complete multi-

  from $295 to $3,495 per person, and expanded on and updated
  in a newsletter at $199. Versions customized to different, very
  specific types of businesses are also sold. The variety in my
  product line welcomes the very casual person, the very serious
  student, the person who wants bare-bones, no-frills information,
  the person who wants to immerse himself in detail, the person
  who needs motivation and encouragement mixed with how-to
  nuts and bolts, the individual entrepreneur, or the corporate CEO.
    Some products that are 90 percent the same are priced quite
  differently, based on their target markets. We sell a marketing
  kit targeted at a high-end, high-income profession for $200 more
  than a very similar generic kit that can be used by any small
  business owner. There is not a $200 difference in the product
   itself. There is a $200 difference in the value the user can easily
  perceive, accept, believe in, and get.
        MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #22:
    REMEMBER THAT WHAT YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED,
      BECAUSE IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE TO YOU,
            IS A REVELATION, A SECRET OF
         IMMENSE VALUE TO SOMEONE
      WHO DOES NOT KNOW OR UNDERSTAND IT.
       DO NOT UNDERVALUE WHAT YOU KNOW.
    I had a client some years ago, an ex-thief, who was a bona
  fide expert in all of the ways that employees in grocery and
  convenience stores steal merchandise and money from their em-
  ployers. His information could easily save a single store owner
  $25,000 in ninety days to a year. When I met him, he was selling
  it all in a little booklet and four audiotapes for $50. When I gave
  him a makeover, that same information yielded two manuals,
  each priced at $29; two six-cassette audio programs with refer-
  ence booklets, $199 each; a video series for employee training,
  $995; and a master course with all that plus interviewing, hiring
  information, materials, and honesty tests for $1,250. In the first
  year, his sales jumped from about $30,000 to $500,000. He was
  grossly undervaluing and poorly packaging his information. Sim-
  ple corrections made a $470,000 difference.

  HOW PUBLICITY AND PROMOTION
  CAN PRODUCE MILLION-DOLLAR
    BUSINESS BREAKTHROUGHS
      ossibly the biggest challenge and most daunting expense for
     most entrepreneurs starting a business is acquiring customers.
     Is it possible to build a business with virtually no investment in
    advertising? Yes, and here’s proof:
      How Hellfire & Damnation Sauce Created
            Heavenly Profits
      ‘If you can’t stand the heat, get out of this catalog!’ That’s
    the warning given by Tim Eidson to his customers. He also
    quotes Mark Twain: ‘‘Part of the secret of success in life is to
     eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside.”’
      In 1989 Tim and Wendy Eidson decided to get into the mail-
    order food business. After discovering that foods known to Tim
    from his Midwest upbringing, like sugar-cured hams and goose-
    berry pies, were already widely sold by mail, their attention
    turned to spices, then to hot things, and that’s where they landed.
    Tim is a hot-foods fanatic and decided to go with his own pas-
    sionate interest in business. The result: the Mo Hotta—Mo Betta
    catalog of foods that ‘‘put sweat on your brow, a tear in your
     eye, and a smile on your face.’’
      With a $15,000 loan from a friend, and Tim’s own ferreting
    out of products, Tim and Wendy got their first catalog produced

  contacts. Incredibly, they pulled a 25 percent response rate. And,
  since its launch, the business has grown at a rate of 300 percent
  a year. Today, the catalog has an annual circulation of 200,000
  and generates nearly $3 million a year in sales.
        But Advertising Failed to Heat Up
         Mo Hotta—Mo Betta’s Sales!
   Tim and Wendy experimented with ads in magazines ranging
  from Cooks to Spy, and with direct-mail to rented lists, but were
  unable to get satisfactory results. Tim told Direct magazine:
  ‘‘We didn’t really start to take off until people started writing
  about us.”’
    Publicity became their one and only method of adding new
  customers. They targeted the food editors of every major news-
  paper in the United States, and began sending them samples of
  items like their Wasabi Chips, a Japanese snack heavy with a
  horseradish-like substance that sets your scalp on fire and drains
  your sinuses. Within a month, articles about the company, the
  catalog, and their products started appearing in newspapers.
  Thanks to clever product names like Hell in a Bottle, Hellfire &
  Damnation Sauce, and Satan’s Revenge, Tim’s offbeat catalog
  copy, and persistent contact with the media, Mo Hotta—Mo Betta
  has continued to generate lots of publicity.
        ‘‘T Love You, You Love Me...”’
    Yes, it’s that beloved-by-kids, occasionally annoying to par-
  ents, and even somewhat controversial giant purple and green
  plush dinosaur singing his trademark song and making millions
  for his creator.
    Sheryl Leach was a typically underpaid schoolteacher on ma-
  ternity leave when she got the idea to create educational videos
  for preschool children that would feature a child’s ‘‘snuggly’’

    ited a traveling dinosaur exhibit and she took note of his unusual
   enthusiasm for the creatures. The result, Barney the Dinosaur, is
    a friendly, happy modification of traditionally terrifying creatures
   made to look like a cuddly stuffed animal infused with life. He
    is a teddy bear in a dinosaur costume.
     The first video, Barney and the Backyard Gang, was pro-
   duced with a limited budget, and Sheryl ignored traditional toy
   manufacturers, trade shows, jobbers, and manufacturers’ reps in
   favor of a unique grass-roots salesforce of mothers of young
    children, dubbed ‘‘Mom Blitzers,’’ to descend on stores with
   enthusiasm, and convince the store owners to stock and display
   the videos.
     The big breakthrough occurred when a Public Television ex-
   ecutive bought one of the tapes for his four-year-old daughter.
   He was astounded by her enthusiasm for the jolly purple crea-
    ture, and put Barney on the air, on PBS, in April 1992, and he
   was an instant hit. Public Television is a unique kind of public-
    ity, by the way. PBS specials have made Covert Bailey into a
   household name in diet and fitness, and supercharged his career
    as a bestselling author. PBS specials made motivational speaker
   Les Brown famous. |
     Barney and Friends quickly became the most watched chil-
    dren’s program on PBS, reaching'a weekly audience of over 14
    million viewers, two-thirds young children, one-third parents.
   Not only was and is all this exposure free, it is actually a busi-
    ness in itself, creating, producing, and providing the weekly pro-
   gramming. And what has it created? A dino-sized fad!
     There are more than 700,000 members in the Barney Fan
   Club. More than 4 million Barney videos, 2 million plush toys,
   and 1 million books have been sold, with no end in sight. Bar-
   ney’s first record album went double platinum. As I was com-
    pleting this book, Barney was appearing ‘‘live’’ in a series of
   twelve sold-out concerts at Radio City Music Hall in New York
    City, NBC-TV was finishing work on a one-hour, prime-time
   Barney special, and Sheryl and her partners were negotiating
   Barney’s first movie deal. A continuing blitz of news releases to
    the media has helped sustain Barney as a hot commodity. One

  news releases. There is value in persistence.
   According to Forbes magazine, Barney ranks in the top forty
  entertainment industry money earners, with an estimated 84 mil-
  lion in the last two years. And even though Barney’s marketplace
 power seems to be finally waning, he has delivered a dino-sized
  fortune to his creator, Sheryl Leach, and her production com-
  pany, The Lyons Group. Sheryl is a millionaire several times
  over.
   The happy creature has even sparked his share of contro-
  versy. Conservative Christian groups accuse Barney of sneaking
  up on kids with ‘‘New Age’’ and liberal political messages. The
  subject has even been debated on the Rush Limbaugh radio
  show! Shery] insists there’s nothing more to Barney than a ‘‘spe-
  cial friend’’ for children, invigorated by their own innocent
  imaginations, sharing universally acceptable ideas like good
  health habits, friendship, self-esteem, and respect for others. And
  none of this controversy hurts Barney in the least. Maybe it
  helps, as his fans rally to his defense. One thing is certain: Bar-
  ney is a moneymaking force to be reckoned with!
   MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #14; BREAK THE RULES.
   To this day, Sheryl is convinced that Barney might have
  gotten lost in the shuffle and been ignored if she had taken the
 conventional approach of trying to place Barney with publishers
  or existent video producers, or sought distribution through es-
  tablished rep organizations. In an interview with the National
 Enquirer, she suggested: ‘‘If it’s a new idea and you have
  limited resources, try an untraditional path. Go through the back
 door instead of the front door. And just never take no for an
 answer.’
      The Power of the Publicity Event
   My friend Gary Halbert, consulting with Tova Borgnine in
 the very early days of her skin-care, cosmetics, and fragrance

           ‘‘unveiling,’’ the invited, at
    a major Los Angeles hotel, advertised with the denial of a secret
    sexual stimulant included in the fragrance’s formula.
         ‘‘Tova Borgnine Swears Under Oath
            That Her New Perfume
              Does Not Contain
           an Illegal Sexual Stimulant!”’
           . screamed the newspaper advertisement’s headline. Thou-
   sands caused a traffic jam and filled the hotel’s ballroom to sam-
   ple the new perfume and hear Tova deny the rumor of the aphro-
   disiac ingredient.
     Another friend and colleague of mine, publicist Raleigh Pin-
    skey, author of the book The Zen of Hype, used the event strategy
    to gain a ton of publicity for the Marilyn Monroe doll. When
   Raleigh was called to discuss the campaign, the toy company
   was only interested in coverage in the toy trade media—a basic
   who-what-where-when-why campaign on the project conception,
   development, and distribution coverage to boost orders at the
   upcoming toy fair. Ms. Pinskey showed them that instead of
   applying their efforts to the trade, they should approach the trade
   from the consumer angle. A back-door approach to the theory
    of supply and demand suggested that by creating a properly or-
    chestrated rush for the doll on the consumer side they not only
   would generate orders from every possible avenue, but also
   might have a textbook legend on their hands.
     Following Raleigh’s advice, the manufacturer held back re-
    lease of the doll, and led with a limited-edition, porcelain version
    outfitted with a real, although midget-sized, fur coat designed
   by a famous furrier, diamond earrings by a famous jeweler, and
    hair and makeup by a famous cosmetic artist to the stars. This
    limited-edition doll was priced at a whopping $5,000.
     The porcelain Marilyn was kept under wraps until a much-
   publicized public unveiling: ‘‘She’’ arrived at New York’s fa-
   mous FAO Schwarz toy store in a Brinks armored car, and was

  look-alikes.
   When the truck arrived, the media was waiting, and they had
  attracted a crowd of curious onlookers. The event made all the
 TV news programs, the cover of the New York Daily News, a
  story in Time magazine, and, of course, all the trade publications
  of the toy, gift, and collectibles industries. The limited edition
  of $5,000 dolls sold out in a week. The regular doll had a suc-
  cessful tenure in toy stores nationwide. And the doll maker made
  a fortune.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #13:
            IT DOESN’T HURT TO BE A
          “CAPTAIN OUTRAGEOUS.”’
   Media mogul Ted Turner was dubbed ‘‘Captain Outrageous’
 by the press some years ago, and he has generated a huge amount
  of publicity by being outrageous. But the all-time queen in this
  category is Madonna. Arguably of little talent other than creating
  publicity by being outrageous, she’s become a multimillionaire.
 Gary Halbert went down this path to promote Tova’s perfume,
  and you can, too.
   How I Deliberately Play at Being a ‘‘Captain
             Outrageous’’
   I applied the outrageousness strategy myself, incorporating a
  ‘‘No B.S.”’ theme into two books and my personal promotion,
 beginning in 1993, with the publication of The Ultimate No B.S.,
 No Holds Barred, Kick Butt, Take No Prisoners, and Make Tons
 of Money Business Success Book. The outrageous length and
 content of the title accomplished several important things. First,
  it got the book displayed face out, cover out (rather than spine
 out) in a number of bookstores, including a national chain. A
 relatively small publisher, like the publisher of my ‘‘No B.S.”’
 books (Self-Counsel Press), has to fight to get its titles stocked

```

```
    ple were drawn to that title, grabbed the book, and told friends
    about it. Third, it generated considerable publicity, notably in-
    cluding being featured not once but four times in Success mag-
    azine and in Inc. magazine, countless newspapers, trade journals,
    and radio interviews.
     One radio talk show host told me he hadn’t read the book,
    but could ask me five good questions just based on the title. And
    he did: What do you mean by ‘‘No B.S.’’? . . . What do you
    mean by ‘‘no holds barred’? . . . What do you mean by “‘kick
    butt’’? .. . and so on. We had a lively fifteen-minute interview
    and I responded to a number of callers.
     At the American Booksellers Association convention, the
    publisher’s staff wore and gave away buttons reading: ‘‘’'m A
   NO BS Entrepreneur’ or ‘‘I’m A NO BS Manager,’’ and we
    sent those buttons as well as desk placards to media contacts.
     The success of the book prompted quick release of a second
    printing, packaged with two audiocassettes, sold off racks and
    counter displays, mostly in office supply stores and warehouses
    or club stores by the thousands. And, in 1994, the second book:
    The Ultimate No B.S. Sales Success Book. For this one’s cover,
    I was photographed in a three-piece, pin-striped business suit,
    shirt and tie, sitting on an 1,800-pound, white Brahma bull
    (‘‘Tiny’’), out in the middle of the desert, at sunset. As you
    might imagine, I get a lot of comments about that book cover!
   And I use the same photo in a lot of my other promotion as a
    speaker and business consultant.
      Yes, there have been critics and criticisms. But my theory is
    if you don’t seriously offend at least one person a day, you’re
    not saying or doing much.
      How to Make a Million Just by Being
        Interviewed on Radio Talk Shows
     The gurus of this unusual business are Joe and Judy Sabah
    of Denver, Colorado, students, subscribers, and friends of mine.
