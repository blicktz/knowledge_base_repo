rich. If that offends you, please put this book back on the shelf or
take it back to the store and get a refund. Spend your money on
milk and cookies instead. You'll be happier. In fact, I'd like to
quickly clear up a big misconception about what being an entrepreneur and owning and building a business is all about. The
purpose is not to employ people, not to do social good, not to pay
taxes. A lot of liberals think those are the purposes of business.
Nuts to them. The purpose of being an entrepreneur is to get really, really rich, and reward yourself for taking on all the risk and
responsibility with exactly the kind of life and lifestyle you want.
Facilitating that is the sole aim of this book.

Before getting into the "meat," on the next few pages, you'll
find a brief description of my business activities past and present
and my current business in the back of the book beginning on
page 247.1 think you'll benefit more from the book if you understand where I'm coming from; however, you can choose to skip
these pages if you like and jump right to Chapter 1. Your choice.

I'd like to explain the Mary Poppins quote at the top of this
Preface. Mary Poppins was one of the first movies I was taken to
see in a theater as a child. I watched it just the other night on
cable TV and enjoyed it thoroughly. If you've seen it, you can
probably call up the scene of Julie Andrews and the children
singing the "just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go
down" song. It's a lovely thought. (Or as she would say, "loverly")
In real business life, however, the emotional need for spoonfuls
of sugar is very dangerous. How well you can take medicine—
deal with reality—has a great deal to do with how successful
you are as an entrepreneur.

There's a legendary book by Napoleon Hill I hope you've
read, titled Think and Grow Rich. In that book, he enumerates 17

success principles adhered to in common by the hundreds of history's greatest entrepreneurial achievers he studied, interviewed
and worked with, such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford,
Thomas Edison, and so on. Of the 17 principles, the one everybody seems to like the least and ignore the most is "accurate
thinking." I believe it to be the most important one. So this book,
my book, is heavy on that principle. It is medicine without the
accompaniment of sugar.

Finally, let me say that, when I graduated high school, my
parents were flat broke. I started with no family money. I didn't
step into a family business. No one handed me anything on a silver platter. At age 49,1 am semi-retiring, a multimillionaire, free
to live precisely as I choose, indulging my interest in horse racing. It was all made possible through the kind of thinking, attitudes, habits, and strategies I've laid out in this book. I have been
blunt, forthright, and held nothing back.

With that said, I still hope you not only profit from this book,
but enjoy reading it. And I welcome your comments, thoughts, or
questions. You can communicate with me directly by fax, 602269-3113. —Dan

are basically four types of salespeople: sales professionals with strong ambition who are eager to strengthen
and fine-tune their skills; sales professionals who are
jaded, close-minded, cynical, and stuck; nonsalespeople who
realize they need to be, such as doctors, auto repair shop owners,
carpet cleaners; and nonsalespeople who either do not recognize
they need to be or are resistant to the idea.

This book will resonate with those in the first and third quadrant. It will be wasted on the others. I've spent more than onefourth of an entire lifetime, more than 25 years, working with
people in both the first and third quadrant—and doing my level
best to avoid the folks in the second and fourth. This book liter­
ally summarizes the most important strategies I've developed
over those 25 years—some originating from my own experience,
others originating from my observation of super-successful sales
pros' behaviors that I have converted to replicatable strategy.

_There are_ _a great many things this book is NOT. It is NOT, for_
example, a textbook approach to selling. It is not about moral or
spiritual philosophy (those matters are left to you). It is only
slightly about the psychology of selling. It is noticeably free of
trendy new terminology, buzzwords, and psycho-babble so
many sales trainers and authors seem to be fond of. And it is not
a motivational book either. If you need someone else to motivate
you, you have far bigger problems than this book might tackle.
Or any hundred books, for that matter.

_This is simply a straightforward, relentlessly pragmatic, "no b.s."_
_presentation of what REALLY works in selling. Not what should_
work. Not the academic theories about selling. What REALLY
works.

_You may not thoroughly enjoy this book. It may make you_
uncomfortable. Confronting, challenging, and rethinking longheld beliefs and habits is provocative and often profitable but
rarely comfortable or enjoyable.

_My aim is very simple: after reading this book, I intend for you_
to implement behavioral and procedural changes that will immediately and dramatically increase the income you earn from selling. This book is all about putting more money in your pocket,

nothing loftier than that, nothing less than that. And if we have to
break a few eggs to make that omelet, then that's what we'll do.

You might want to know that this book has had a long former
life. It was first published in 1994, has been in print continuously
through 1996, a 2nd edition was published in 1999, which was in
print through 2001, and now this thoroughly updated and substantially expanded in this new edition. Why is it important for
you to know you've wound up with "the sales book that will not
die" in your hands? Two reasons. First, as evidence you've gotten your paws on strategies that ARE really valuable and that DO
really work. Successful salespeople recommend this book to each
other, they stream to the bookstores and demand it. Even when a
publisher has lost interest in it, the marketplace has insisted this
book be put back onto the store shelves. (By the way, now you can
[tell others about this book by sending them to www.nobsbooks.](http://www.nobsbooks)
com, to get free excerpts.) Second, you will see references in the
book that are obviously dated, or references to my writing of its
first edition, and I didn't want you to be confused by that; thus,
this explanation.

Now, to the important stuff: quick, practical actions you can
take to make selling easier, less stressful, more fun, and much,
much more lucrative and rewarding.

###### About the Structure of This Book
This book is divided into six parts. In Part 1, I describe the 15
strategies I use most in selling. Each is a stand-alone application,
and any one of them alone could significantly improve your
results in selling. But they can also be linked together differently
for different situations for increased value and power.

PREFACE TO NO B.S. SALES SUCCESS

-----

###### ® NO B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs

In Part 2, I deal with what goes on before selling can even
begin: finding, attracting, and getting into a selling situation with
a prospect. As you'll see, I'm no fan of the way most salespeople
carry out this job. Here you'll discover some rather radical ideas.

In Part 3, I provide a framework for selling. The various
pieces described in Parts 1 and 2 can be plugged in and out of
this structure.

In Part 4,1 share with you the dumbest things salespeople do
to sabotage themselves.

In Part 5, I reveal my personal, best, most valued, contrary
approach to selling. It may not be for everybody; it may not be
for you. Frankly, I argued with myself about putting it in or leaving it out. I ultimately decided I would not be playing fair with
you if I sold you a book about selling and held back the information most responsible for my own success. Use it as you will, and
good luck.

In the last decade, the sales world has been flooded with new
technology, and Part 6 of this edition contains an updated section
on my "no b.s." observations of this. —Dan
