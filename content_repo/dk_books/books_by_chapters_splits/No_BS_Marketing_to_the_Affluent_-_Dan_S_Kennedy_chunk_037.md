##### customers won’t say a peep. The number of referrals you get indicates your Authority to some extent. Even more important to note: When you are the Authority, your customers want to refer you because it enhances their status for making the referral. A concept most people fail to grasp with referral marketing is that your customers, especially affluent ones, never want to feel like salespeople. When they pass out your business card, it makes them feel like a salesperson. A book, on the other hand, is not traditionally seen as a marketing tool. So, if your affluent customer is able to hand their friend a copy of your book, brag about how they “know the author,” and help their friend secure a “celebrity dentist,” it serves to enhance their status level in the eyes of the person they’re referring to you.
 In other words, if you want more referrals from your affluent customers, ask them, “What can I do to increase my level of Authority?” The more Authority you have, the more your clients will want to talk about you to their friends.
 A rhetorical question I often ask my clients is: When your clients go out to dinner with their friends, do they brag about you? If the answer is no, then you’ve got work to do.

 7. Lead Generation The more Authority you can demonstrate, the higher the volume of leads you will generate. You’ll also attract a higher quality of leads, who will want to talk to you. However, the reality of today’s skeptical landscape is that most people aren’t ready to buy immediately upon discovering you. The first step is simply getting someone to raise their hand and say they’re interested. Be ready to capture the people who show interest by offering a free report or your book (and so on). Most people miss this opportunity because the only things they offer on their website are purchase options or a free consultation, which most people aren’t ready to do. The more Authority you hold, the more likely they are to raise their hand. The other thing that increased Authority can accomplish is accelerating the sales process, taking prospects from simply being aware of and interested in you to wanting to do business with you, and promptly.

 How to Build Your Own Authority Marketing Blueprint


-----

##### Now that you know the Seven Pillars of Authority Marketing, you can begin building your Authority Marketing Blueprint. Here are the steps:

 Step one. When we are helping an entrepreneur or business owner build Authority, we start with an assessment to gauge where their current level of Authority is and locate areas of improvement. (You can identify your current Authority status and where you could improve by taking our FREE Authority Assessment at https://advantagefamily.com/authority- assessment/.)

 Step two. The next thing we do is diagnose the issues in your current marketing framework. We then draft a clearly defined Authority Marketing Blueprint, beginning with the end results in mind. We take each of the Seven Pillars of Authority Marketing and craft an actionable plan to deploy them in your business. Authority is not an accident, it is built in a strategic and systematic fashion. For example, if you want to gain lots of media exposure, you need to carefully strategize where you will pitch your news stories. You’ll want to focus your efforts in the prime radius of your practice, then work to ensure you become visible in every corner of media for that specific area.

 Step three. Get everyone on your team aligned and on board with the plan. Be sure that your team understands the blueprint and that everyone is on the same page.

 Step four. Once you have your Authority Marketing blueprint and the cooperation of your team, go forward and implement it. It is only through deliberate intention and disciplined action that true Authority can be gained.
 Armed with the knowledge of how to attract the affluent customer through book authorship and Authority Marketing, you can get started. When you do, you’ll increase the quantity and quality of affluent clients who come knocking on your door, eager to work with you. If properly leveraged, Authority Marketing is an objectively powerful tool to have in your arsenal. With sound strategy and determination, you can become the outright Authority in the eyes of the affluent and reap the rewards that follow.

#### CHAPTER 26

### Using Client Hero Stories

##### By Cindy Cyr

# One of the biggest mistakes business owners make is being company##### centric instead of client-centric. The affluent client doesn’t care about your story, they care about their own.
 Which is why it only makes sense that to win over customers and close more sales the proof is overwhelmingly in favor of including your customers’ stories, often referred to as customer “reviews.”
 Cited as one of the most influential pieces of content in affecting purchase decisions, what a customer says about you matters. A lot.


-----

##### Ninety-seven percent of consumers say reviews influence their buying decisions.
 Consumers say reading what a customer has to say about your company, product, or service increases trust and their likelihood of buying.
 And if you have at least five written customer experiences you multiply the purchase likelihood by almost four.
 This becomes even more important for higher-priced products, where reviews can increase conversion rates by 380%.
 An important note to make here is that these written reviews must be from an affluent consumer, because consumers not only consider the review but the reviewer. If the affluent reader perceives the customer reviewing the product to be unlike him, the affluent reader will discount it.
 The problem is affluents generally aren’t too excited about sharing their experience publicly. Most won’t. Nearly three-quarters of affluents say they need to be motivated to do so. Which means if you fall under the umbrella of a luxury brand or a brand targeting affluent consumers, it’s more necessary to provide rewards and recognition in order to get consumers to share their story about the experience they had with your business.
 One of the most effective ways to accomplish both objectives (reward your client and secure a review) is to invite your best customers to be featured as the hero in your company’s story.
 What I call “Client Hero Stories” are stories that feature your best customers and their experience with your products and services. Similar to case studies, client hero stories help clarify the burning questions your prospects have in their mind.
 Case studies and client hero stories are more than a testimonial. They both speak to the specific customer pain. They both are designed to sway purchase decisions and make a case for why the buyer should choose your company. The main difference between a case study and a client hero story is that in a case study, the emphasis is on the COMPANY being the hero of the story while, in a client hero story, the CLIENT is the hero.
 It’s a subtle difference, but a critical point you must get if you want your affluent consumers to eagerly participate in giving your product or service a glowing review. The client hero story shows the client identifying a problem and choosing your product or service as the solution and shows what life looks like after they use your products and services.


-----

##### But the client is positioned as the hero. The client is the smart one … the creative one … the one with good taste … the brave one … and so on.
 Like a knight choosing his sword as he heads into battle, they make the decision and choose your solution to solve their problem.
 These stories captivate readers and listeners because they focus on human elements such as ambition, battling a challenge, and perseverance.
 This can be done with virtually any product or service … from the man surprising his wife with the perfect piece of jewelry to the mom who raises her teen’s confidence when she finds an orthodontist to fix her teen’s smile without the teen ever having to miss her favorite school activities to the business owner who is able to reduce his taxes.
 While you can identify your best affluent customers, you may not always know their whole story. That’s OK though. When you take time to ask, you’ll not only build a better relationship with them and make them feel you care, you’ll discover the hero in them.
 Once you feature clients as the hero of your brand, you’ll find that when you recognize wealthy clients in this way, they are eager to help you with these stories. That’s because being featured as the hero raises their status among their friends. It makes them feel special and recognized.
 I write client hero stories for No B.S. Inner Circle® (www.nobsinnercircle.com). Featured in their monthly No B.S. Marketing Letter, one column, called “Member Spotlight,” features members who have been guided by Dan Kennedy and implemented marketing strategies they received through their membership in No B.S. Inner Circle®. In many of these stories, the hero client has built their business from scratch to a million-dollar or multimillion-dollar business. In another column, called the “No B.S. Legends,” the story features a longtime member as the hero. These are entrepreneurs who have been members often in the neighborhood of 15 or 20 years, and are tremendously successful. It’s not uncommon for them to have spent $100,000.00 or more during the lifetime of their membership.
 When I reach out to these clients to inquire if I can interview them and feature them, I am met with replies along the lines of, “I’m honored to be featured” and “I’m excited to be featured.”
 After the story comes out, it’s not uncommon for the featured client to send thank you notes. They also frame these stories and hang them in their


-----

##### offices. They share them on their social media pages and tell their friends, families, and even customers about being featured.
 One member recently wrote to me, “Holy cow, the interview is amazing! Thank you for making me sound smart. You’re very talented, and I appreciate you using your skill to help tell my story.”
 Another member told me it was on his bucket list to be featured. He excitedly called me immediately upon receiving the newsletter with his client hero story, shared it on his social media when the story came out, and shared it again at the end of the year listing it as one of his top memories from the year.
 Mind you, both of these members are accomplished and own highly successful businesses. The point is these clients were recognized for what they did and rewarded for being the ideal client. When others read their story, they can see themselves in the story. They are inspired to emulate the member in the story and want to, in some cases, outdo the member they’ve just read about. They aspire to be the one featured in the story.
 Of course, client hero stories aren’t just about recognizing a valued customer. They can accomplish a number of things for your business.
 Prospects identify with the heroes in your story, and because they can see themselves, it increases their trust in you.
 These stories can be used in a variety of ways too. You can use them as indoctrination for your principles or to overcome common objections your prospects have, for example. And because these stories are interesting to read and have the power to transport the reader emotionally, prospects don’t feel like they are being sold.
 Let me show you what I mean. Let’s say you are looking for a new doctor for your family. As you scan a list of doctors, you find a doctor who has a list of top credentials, talks about how his office gives great service, and include a couple of testimonials from people saying he is a great doctor. Then you come across another doctor who has the same list of top credentials, but you read a story on his site in which the parents of a young patient tell a heart-wrenching story of their search for a doctor who could help their son, how they finally found said doctor who went above and beyond, gave out his cell phone number to them so they could contact him directly, and healed their child when no one else could. Which doctor would you choose?

##### Stories make sense to people and help clarify how you can help them. And by positioning your customer as the hero instead of your product, service or brand, you are seen as a trusted resource that can help overcome whatever challenge your target customer is facing.

 Start with the End in Mind Before you can identify your hero, you’ll want to determine how and where you will use these stories and who will read them. Will you feature these stories on your website? In your newsletter to current customers? In your newsletter to prospects? In a package you send out to a prospect? In a book you are writing? In a video or podcast?
 While you can use these stories in multiple marketing pieces, it is helpful to determine where you plan to start. Because how you will use your stories and who will read them will help you identify who to feature, what questions to ask, and how to position the story.
 Start with the end in mind. What is your objective for this story? Is it indoctrination of your principles? Is it to help current customers consume your product so they will become raving fans, refer you, and buy more? Is it to help prospective clients overcome an objection? Is it to help people see that your product or service worked for someone just like them?
 The No B.S. Inner Circle newsletter, No B.S. Marketing Letter, is mailed to current clients as part of their paid membership benefits. Each month there is a theme assigned to it. One month might feature strategies for retention, ascension, and referrals. The next month might be about using information to market your business. The client hero story is going to be read by clients who’ve already bought into the company. They may own one or more products and will be of varying levels of success as well as levels of how “sold” they are that the principles will work for them. Client hero stories in this publication help readers consume the product, reinforce principles, and help them see that the principles will work because they see them working for people just like them.
 Another client is using client hero stories in a book that will be used for lead generation to sell an opportunity business. A designer is using client hero stories on her social media to showcase how her affluent clients use her home décor products to decorate their home. A periodontist client uses

##### hero client stories in videos on his website to help overcome objections his prospective patients have.
 Most times, you’ll be able to accomplish more than one of these objectives. However, in each case, you want to identify one main objective to focus on so you don’t confuse your reader or lose their interest.

 Identify Your Hero Once you know where the client hero story will appear, how it will be used, and the objective as well as who the target reader is, you can now identify who you should invite to be the client hero featured.
 You’ll appeal to your ideal prospects by choosing hero clients who are like them. In other words, they should be affluent and fit certain criteria that match your ideal customer.
 For example, many heroes featured in the No B.S. Marketing Letter are made-from-scratch millionaires who invest in themselves and their success. They’re successful because they’ve implemented the strategies from the featured theme of the month.
 The book client is looking for people who have completed the program they are selling, implemented the strategies, and as a result, are living their dream lifestyle.
 The designer is looking for clients with upscale homes who have used her products to create rooms themselves that look like they should be featured in a magazine.
 The periodontist is looking for patients who had a major fear about having work done, did it anyway, and are overjoyed by the results he was able to provide them.

 Getting Affluent Clients to Agree to an Interview Before you approach a client about being featured in your client hero story, decide exactly what you’ll need from them so you can quickly and easily convey that information. For example, how much time will you need for an interview? Do you need a photo from them?
 When you reach out to an affluent client and present the idea to them, show them what’s in it for them by highlighting the advantages of participating. You’ll also want to approach it as a compliment to them
