your attorney regarding your case. Dr. Charles Martin charges

Many years ago, when I was in the field, selling, I quickly figured out that you could fit in two, three, four, or five appointments
per day, depending on how you routed yourself. A salesman half
as good at selling as a competitor but twice as good at efficiently
routing himself and clustering prospects makes the same amount
of money. Today, when I get on an airplane, I have "clustered" as
much productive activity as possible into that one trip. We'll talk
about this in greater detail in Chapter 8.

By working at home, as a writer, consultant, and tele-coach, as
opposed to going to an office, I make a lot of money each day just
by not commuting. I have conditioned myself to go directly from
bed to shower to work in 15 minutes. If I were leaving the house
to go to an office, I'd have those 15 minutes plus another half
hour, maybe an hour commute, than another 15 minutes getting
settled in at the office. Not to mention the commute at end of day.

In whatever ways you can, in your business, you need to
seek leverage. In terms of work productivity, leverage is, in
essence, the difference between the base cost for your hour and
the amount of money you get for it or from it. One good way to
evaluate your personal effectiveness is measuring and monitoring this differential, hour by hour, for a week.

Now, let's go back to the term: base earning target. Since you
are your own boss, you write your own paycheck, and you decide
how much that paycheck is going to be. For most entrepreneurs,
that number is—whatever's left! This is a huge mistake, for two

reasons: it indicates zero planning, and it means you pay yourself last, the number one reason entrepreneurs wind up broke.
So, let's reverse all that, and start with the planning. You've got
to decide how much money you're going to take out of your
business or businesses this year, in salary, perks, contributions to
retirement plans, and so on. What is that number?

_I'll tell you this: eight out of ten entrepreneurs I ask can-_
_not come up with this number._

Anyway, if you do not have a base income target, then you
cannot calculate what your time must be worth, which means
you cannot make good decisions about the investment of your
time, which means you are not exercising any real control over
your business or life at all. You are a wandering generality. Is that
what you want to do—just _wander around and settle for whatever_
_you get?_

billable hours as I do, so how
can this strategy work for you?
It has to. It's even more important to you than to me. Let's
say you own six stores. Each
store has a manager. Hey, this
is complicated. Well, you'll
have to decide how much of
the business' bottom line profit
goal will be provided by the
managers whether you sleep
or work and how much is still
inextricably linked to you. If

bottom line, and you figure half is dependent on you, you've got a
$250,000.00 target.

For me, it's reasonably precise. For you, it may not be such an
exact science. But that's OK. I promise you that coming up with a
number, even if it is arrived at through some pretty questionable
calculations, is still a whole lot better than not having a number at
all. Having a number is going to make such a dramatic change in
so many of the decisions you make, habits you cultivate, and people you associate with, that the benefits will be so extraordinary,
it won't matter if the original method of getting to a number had
a technical flaw or two buried in it. At least for the sake of our
conversation, in this book, get a number: YOUR base earnings target for the next full calendar year. (See Figure 1.1.) Divide it by the
number of workday hours. Multiply it to allow for unproductive
vs. productive hours. If you haven't a better estimate of that, use

the three time multiple I've used here. Now you have what your
time is supposed to be worth per hour. Divided by 60, per minute.

That little number may just change your life.
It's sort of like a heart attack—or, in my own case, a diabetes diagnosis—being
required to really get somebody to change their
eating and exercise habits.

A lot of your decision-making gets easy with this number
staring you in the face. It's hard to con yourself with this number
staring you in the face. In fact, I suggest having it stare you in the
face a lot until you internalize it. Write your number "$
Per Hour" on a bunch of colorful 4 x 6-inch cards, in bold black
letters, and stick those cards up in places where you work and
will see them often.

Generally speaking, two business life changes probably come
to mind immediately, with this number staring you in the face:

First, you realize that you've got to surround yourself with
people who understand and respect the value of your time and
behave accordingly. This is not easy. And they will forget, over
time. Familiarity breeds contempt. Periodically, you will have to
re-orient them. You also must get people who do not respect the
value of your time out of your business life. If you let people who

do not understand and respect the value of your time hang
around, you won't even have a fighting chance.

Second, you have to eliminate the need for doing or delegate
those tasks and activities that just cannot and do not match up
with the mandated value of your time.

###### How Low Can You Go in Valuing Time?
I grew up in Ohio, where people spend their weekends shoveling snow in the winter, cutting grass in the spring and summer,
and raking leaves in the fall. Used to make me crazy to drive
around and see somebody in my sales organization out shoveling, mowing, or raking. I'd say: if your time isn't worth more
than the $5 an hour you could give some neighborhood kid to do
this, you should be shot. Plus, you're robbing some kid out of the
money. When I moved to Arizona, I envisioned sand, rocks, and
cactus; nothing to shovel or mow. Guess what? A bunch of folks
bring grass with 'em and stick it everywhere, then alternate
between watering it and mowing it. Others, with "desert landscaping" can be found out there raking their gravel—-like cats in
litter boxes! What conclusion did I draw from all that? Most people will find ways to avoid confrontive productivity and will
waste their time, even if they have to work at it!

Well, my "philosophy of time valuing" can be boiled down to
this: every one of my working hours has to be worth a certain
amount of money; I do everything I can to create and protect that
value; and anybody screwing that up had better watch out.

Another, related issue is "project valuing" or "opportunity
valuing" or "account valuing" for salespeople. In short, a "thing"
has to be worth X-dollars, whatever you decide X must be, for
you to even touch it, think about it, or be involved with it. Many

of my best clients have adopted this idea and now have their
own litmus test, helpful in quickly and decisively saying yea or
nay to whatever comes along.

For example, my Platinum Member Matt Furey started in
business only a handful of years ago with a $10,000.00 minimum:
a new product he might develop or a new marketing campaign
he might initiate had to be worth at least $10,000.00 to him or
he'd pass. Today his number is $100,000.00. He has mastered the
wisdom that just because something is a viable opportunity
doesn't mean it's an opportunity for you, just because something
is doable doesn't mean you should do it.

Most sales professionals hang onto clients and accounts that
consume far, far more time than they can ever be worth. Better to
send them to a competitor. Most entrepreneurs perpetuate projects that consume far, far more time—theirs or employees'—than
they're worth. I've done it more times than I care to confess. But
I'm getting much better at NOT doing it with each passing year.
