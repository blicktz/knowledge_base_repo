# CHAPTER 14

STRATEGY 14 I’D RATHER BE DUMB AND PERSISTENT THAN SMART AND IMPATIENT

## A friend of mine tells a story about a dumb frog that fell into a big barrel half full of cream. He was close to drowning, and all the other frogs circled the top of the barrel and laughed and jeered at him. But this frog was so dumb he thought they were cheering him on, so he paddled faster and faster and faster until he churned the cream into butter, and then he was able to hop back out of the barrel.
 It’s possible to be too smart, to know so much that you know all the reasons why it won’t, can’t, and shouldn’t work. While you are sitting around stymied by all those problems, some dumb frog down the road is doing it!
 Now, with all my experience, I have to continually fight the disadvantage of being “too smart.” Yes, it can be a disadvantage. You can be too familiar with what has not worked in the past, thus too close-minded to new ideas or re-testing old ones under new conditions.

# How Being a Dumb Frog Got This Rookie a
 Veteran’s Top Income—Fast

## I remember at the very beginning of my speaking career getting cornered at a National Speakers Association workshop by a very successful, very prominent “old pro.” He generously explained to me, at great length and in great detail, all “the dues” I would have to pay to “get good” before I could even hope to do well in the business. He painted a rather dreary picture of years of begging for low-paid or even zero-compensation opportunities to speak and gain exposure. He told me that if I made a practice of hanging around guys like him and watching their every move, I might amount to something some day.
 Finally, when I could get a word in edgewise, I brought up the subject of money. Instead of talking about the number of different audiences he had spoken to or the number of miles he had traveled, I wanted to hear about money: the only real measurement of the worth of a person, product, or service in the marketplace. I asked how much might I expect to earn in the business. His long-winded answer culminated with: “. . .as much as $100,000.00 a year after 10 or 15 years.” I said: “Pardon me, but I made $5,000.00 my first month, and it looks like I’ll top $100,000.00 this year, my first year. I was sort of looking for someone who was really doing a big job.” I did, in fact, top $100,000.00 my first year and routinely made from $250,000.00 to $1-million most years thereafter.
 I don’t tell that story to be arrogant or to rub the other guy’s nose in it, but rather to illustrate this point: this guy did know all the ropes. He really understood the business inside and out and upside down. Compared to him, I was a dumb frog. And I was going about some things the hard way. (For example, I was selling myself as a speaker door-to-door, business-to- business, in person.) But through ignorance, confidence, patience, and determination, I was getting spectacular results.

## The next time you run into one of these know-it-all “experts” who gives you all the reasons you can’t succeed, walk away. Who are they—who am I, for that matter—to tell you what you can’t do? When I wrote the first edition of this book, there was a guy pitching in major league baseball with one arm. I wonder how many people tried “for his own good” to convince him to forget about baseball? The experts in the amusement park business laughed Walt Disney out of a meeting room. Among other things, they told him the idea of having just one entrance and exit for a big park was the dumbest idea of the century. I could fill a book with such stories, including quite a few of my own, times when different grizzled old pros and anointed experts have told me I couldn’t do what I went right on and did.
 Unfortunately, salespeople new to a particular selling environment are often set upon by these grizzled veterans—the resident experts in everything that’s already been tried and everything that won’t work. Often, their beliefs and biases haven’t been tested in years, and are now erroneous. This is especially true in The New Economy. What was working may not work well now; what didn’t work might be just the ticket. There’s a lot to be said for finding out some things for yourself.
 There’s also something to be said—although cautiously—for persistence. There was a time in my life when I put “persistence” on a much more exalted pedestal than I do now. In fact, I talked about it in the earlier editions of this book without caveat, which I have corrected here and now. There is a fine line between essential and admirable persistence and stubborn, costly stupidity. All astute entrepreneurs and marketers learn to welcome the swift sword. To find out what won’t work as quickly and cheaply as possible, then on to the next experiment. In concert, though, if they find or figure out something that shows promise, they have bulldog tenacity and tremendous patience in tinkering, tweaking, testing, and tinkering some more, to get it fully functional. They are then very resistant to others’ discouraging opinions. I would suggest these three New Economy Rules:
 1. Be very open-minded to testing new, or, for that matter, old ideas and strategies under new conditions.
 2. Be very quick to abandon those that show little or no promise, regardless of your hopes for them.
 3. Be patient and persistent with those that do show promise, regardless of anybody else’s opinions.

## Even we legendary experts can be wrong! In my Platinum Inner Circle several years ago, one of its 18 Members, a marketing expert for the mortgage industry, announced a brand new, radical approach he was implementing, in selling subscriptions to his publications. I saw and enunciated three major drawbacks to his idea and concluded that it was fraught with more peril than it was worth. The other Members agreed. He ignored us all and tested his premise. Today we all use his strategy.

# Does Success—or Failure—Breed Success?

## In my speaking career of about 30 years, I’ve built 19 different platform selling presentations for my own use, culminating with the one I used at all the public seminars with Zig Ziglar and many other engagements for 10 very successful years. Each one has provided me with excellent income. Each one, however, started out as a failure. Each one produced unsatisfactory results the first few times I used it, but each of those times, I learned from the audience reactions what was working and what wasn’t. Then I adjusted the presentation, delivered it again, observed and learned, adjusted again, until I finally “hit.” Fortunately, each successive one has required less of this, thanks to the cumulative experience. Still, it’s the willingness to fail and the failure itself that makes success possible.
 My friend Ted Nicholas, famous self-publisher and promoter of the best- selling book How to Form Your Own Corporation without a Lawyer for Under $75.00, has sold over $200-million worth of all of his books through mail-order ads he has written himself. Yet he’ll cheerfully tell you that eight out of ten of his ads failed. It’s what he learned from the failures that made it possible for him to create the big winners—direct-response ads that returned two, three, four, and even five times their ad cost consistently, month after month, year after year. This experience is shared by most direct marketers and direct-response advertisers, who are, essentially salespeople selling one-to-many by media rather than one-to-one by manual labor. It is certainly my experience.

# Dan Kennedy’s #9 No B.S. Truth About Selling

## If you’re going to arrive at the sales presentation that achieves the
 maximum possible results, you’re going to have to be willing to persistently test a lot of different things that disappoint along the way.
 Don’t ever mistake genius for persistence. When you look at top achievers in any field, selling included, the temptation is to credit them with genius status, which makes it impossible for an ordinary mortal like yourself to match them. But the truth is, more often than not, their current ability to perform is the result of dogged persistence, methodical testing and tinkering, discarding what doesn’t work, identifying what does, not gifted genius, and that you can replicate.
