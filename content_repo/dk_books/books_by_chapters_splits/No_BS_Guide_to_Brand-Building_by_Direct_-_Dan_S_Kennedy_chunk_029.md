###### Toby Keith originally built his brand by direct selling of concert tickets and the manual labor of performing. In fact, he built a fan/customer base to make money day-to-day, while building his brand that could be leveraged far beyond the stage. I built my brand and brand equity predominately with 15 years of intense travel speaking 70 to 80 times a year, accompanied by direct-response advertising in magazines, direct mail, article placement in media, and other direct-response marketing. I built a fan/customer base to make money day to day, while building a brand that could be leveraged far beyond the stage. I have now routinely taken successful business owners in different niches and rapidly made them famous names and known brands in those niches entirely through direct-response advertising.
 I have always told my peers in professional speaking, and told authors, that the nifty trick is to avoid going broke while you’re busy getting rich and famous. Personal brand-building by direct response makes that trick possible.

## The Brand No One Believed
 In

###### Exclusive Interview with MARK VICTOR HANSEN,
 Co-Creator of Chicken Soup for the Soul
 by Dan S. Kennedy


###### AN: Mark, we’re going to talk about the Chicken Soup for the Soul books, publishing empire, brand, and brand-licensing business. I want to acknowledge that you’ve also built a very good

# D

###### personal brand for yourself, and if people aren’t aware, you’re the author of a number of other books, you’ve had a long and very successful speaking career, and you’re involved in all sorts of entrepreneurial ventures. People can visit www.MarkVictorHansen.com. With Chicken Soup for the Soul, you and Jack Canfield built one of the biggest, if not the biggest and best- known brand on the nonfiction side of publishing, starting with nothing more than the idea and determination. I want to look at the brand-building, from the beginning to the present. We can start with the start.


-----

###### MVH: Jack Canfield and I were both speaking at the Mandela Conference. There were 6,000 people there. Jack and I were both breakout session speakers. He sat in on my presentation. I think there were 600 or 700 there. When I was done, he asked to take me to lunch. We swapped stories and befriended each other. I think we each saw something in the other person. Jack is a really brilliant Harvard guy. We started talking regularly on the phone. We met up again some months later. He told me he was thinking of doing a book of stories—I think he called them happy little stories. He said, “I’ve got 63.” I said, “A lot of them are mine!—that I shared with you. I think we should do this together.” So we started working on this thing. Of course, at the start we were both just thinking book, not brand. But pretty early on, I started seeing this in a bigger way.

 DAN: I’d like to point out that this isn’t a particularly amazing origin story. Two speakers working in the same subject categories meet, bond, start brainstorming, and agree to work on a book of inspirational stories. What a lot of people don’t get about success is that starting and doing something, anything, can lead to great things. Not starting can’t lead anywhere.

 MVH: Well, here’s where that led: in June 2013, we came out with the 20th Anniversary Edition of the first, original Chicken Soup for the Soul book. My story is the lead story. Jack wrote the preface, which tells this just as I did. In total, there have been more than half a billion Chicken Soup for the Soul books sold worldwide. Anyway, we went to work, and it took us three years to put that first collection of stories together. Then we went to the publishers in New York City to sell it. That didn’t go so well. As you know, 144 publishers turned us down. One hundred and forty-four nos. Our agent fired us. I still have his signed letter in my office, telling me that this book will never sell. Jack and I put three-ring notebooks in our backpacks and went to the big book publishing industry convention, and pitched publishers ourselves. At the very end, we connected with the owner of what was then a very small publishing house, HCI, Health Communications Inc. They had only published a couple books successfully, and they were in the hole financially, but we didn’t know it. The publisher, Peter Vegso, said, “We’ll publish it if you’ll guarantee to buy 20,000 copies at $6.00 each.” It cost


-----

###### about 50 cents to print, and we’re paying six dollars. But we had a publisher.

 DAN: Joan Rivers has this line: walk through any door. By the way, I got my first book deal exactly the same way you did—on the convention floor, accosting publishing executives who didn’t want to talk to me. I finally connected with the president of a small Canadian publisher and made a deal. And I had to first write books they wanted as a contract author before they would publish the one I wanted to do, my original No B.S. Business Success book.

##### In Search of a System

###### MVH: After 144 rejections, any yes is a good yes. So, Jack and I looked at each other and said, “Now what?” Jack was the creative guy, the writer, the Harvard scholar, and he wasn’t sure whether we’d sell one or a million. I said, “Let me do the selling. I’ve been selling since I was 9 years old.” I knew there had to be a system for making a book a big success. I worked for Dr. R. Buckminster Fuller, and he always said everything is a system. That’s a big tip for people, about a brand, and about licensing, which has become the business built by the books. There’s a system. I knew I could figure it out. I learned early, starting with speaking, at the National Speakers Association. When you and I were hanging out there, there were usually only about ten people who were the best in anything. At the time, the book business was a $25 billion business, with a lot of personal growth type of authors. So I made up my list of the best of those, the most successful of those, and went around and personally interviewed them—Scott Peck, Wayne Dyer, Barbara DeAngelis, John Gray, a number of others. I didn’t ask about writing—I can write, and Jack is the finest editor on planet earth. I wanted to know: How do you promote, market, and sell books? Scott Peck had a number-one book for 12 years that made $40 million. I wanted to know what he was doing that nobody else was. We got something from each person, and mostly, something different from each person. We had each suggestion on a sticky note and wound up with 1,094 of them all over a wall in Jack’s office. We kept shuffling them, until we had a business plan.


-----

###### The way I laid it out, we’d sell 1 million, then 10 million books. We’d do $5 million, $10 million, $50 million. I had these crazy goals, but I also knew what had to be done to achieve them, so they weren’t that crazy.

 DAN: I just want to emphasize that point. You just described a process that anyone could do but hardly anybody does. Very few people are really determined and dogged about getting the information they need. You did your homework. You gathered information. You kind of made a pest of yourself to get it—which, by the way, you are very good at. I tell people all the time that nobody is better at what I call “The Ask” than Mark Victor Hansen. You prepared. You also got started moving forward, taking action. I suppose your book, your Chicken Soup idea could be called The Brand Nobody Believed In. But you did, with good reason, because you put together information that led to a plan you could believe in.

 MVH: That’s what makes crazy big goals realistic. People are always trying to shrink others’ ambitions, telling them they have to set more realistic goals. It’s not the goal that’s the problem. It’s the lack of a realistic plan. So, here we are. We’ve sold half a billion books, with 300 million of those in China, which is interesting. According to the people at Guinness Book of World Records, nobody’s done that. And I want to be the first guy to sell a billion books.

 DAN: I would not bet against you. And I want people to grasp the amazing nature of what you’ve accomplished, just on the publishing side. Big brands are rare in the book business, particularly on the non-fiction side. In fiction, there are character brands—for kids, for example, you can go back to The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, Baum’s Oz series, and come forward to Harry Potter. On the non-fiction side, you have established brands that come to books, like Betty Crocker® or Weight Watchers®, You have a few business niche series, like Levinson’s Guerrilla Marketing or my No B.S.- branded series. Maybe the biggest broad one is the For Dummies brand. But you spread Chicken Soup very wide, touching every kind of person: mothers, fathers, military veterans, every niche. The number of titles is dizzying. And, really, the success of the books is just the beginning. So,


-----

###### let’s stay on track. You’ve put together a plan out of collected tips and Post- it Notes®. Now what?

 MVH: The publisher wasn’t going to do anything but publish—and push those 20,000 books on us. Jack and I scraped up about $180,000.00 for promotion. We tried several different publicists, but I kept trying to connect with the best, Arielle Ford. She was working with the biggest authors in this area. I finally got to her by calling a friend of mine, an author, who knew her, Dr. Harold Bloomfield, and I asked him to tell me what her biggest challenge was, what she had a shortage of and a need for. He said: time. Now I called her and, instead of trying to sell her on representing us, I said, “Look, you need time. When I was in graduate school with Bucky Fuller, he taught us how to expand time. I can solve your problem for you. You can solve a problem for me.” That got us Arielle Ford. Then I got us with Rick Frishman, who is the best at booking drive-time radio. I was starting a day of interviews at 3:00 D1P . my time and moving across the country. At one point, we had some luck: Dr. Deepak Chopra got delayed in India and couldn’t do a cover story interview for People magazine, and Arielle had to replace him. She asked if we were willing to let the reporter basically live with us for a week. Well, we’re busy. We’re consumed with the books and their promotion, but we’re both speaking and earning a living, too, but you make room for opportunity like that.

 DAN: I’d call it earned luck. And what I want to hear about now is the sacrifice. Here you started with a book, then books, and wound up with a very valuable brand—which we will get to, but I think it’s important people understand that such a thing rarely happens without people making very big trade-offs and sacrifices.

 MVH: On the front end, the sacrifices are huge. Jack and I sacrificed a lot of income to take time away from the ways we earned income and put that time into writing and promoting these first books. I was personally calling owners of independent bookstores all over the country. Doing radio interviews. We found it literally ate our lives. We quickly figured out we didn’t just want a book out of it, some brief fame. So, a second book. Then


-----

###### a third. Our third book was Chicken Soup for the Teen Soul, and our publisher predicted a bomb. “I’ve got teenagers,” he said “They buy clothes, music CDs, and concert tickets. They will not buy your book.” And we sold 19 million books. I like to say that teenagers talk all the time but don’t talk at the soul-ular level, and this book opened up those conversations. It also opened up the college speaking circuit for me, and I was quickly getting booked, first at $10,000.00, then at $20,000.00, and talking to 20,000 college kids at a time—because Chicken Soup for the Soul was a huge thing. Kids were telling me, “I stayed in college because of you . . . I was so lonely and scared I was going to quit school and go home.” Anyway, at certain points, a thing like this picks up speed and begins generating its own momentum. But I’ll give you a specific sacrifice story . . . .

 DAN: Those college speaking gigs basically gave you book-and-brand promotion opportunities without you dipping into your pocket. I always looked at speaking as an advertising opportunity, and instead of paying to advertise, getting paid to advertise. It’s important if you’re starting this process without access to the gold in Fort Knox to figure something like that out. It’s no guarantee of success, but it can be easy to build a brand if you can pour a ton of money into it. Richard Branson said the way to start an airline and become a millionaire is to start with a billion dollars. The focus of this entire book that I’m interviewing you for is brand-building without lots of money to buy it with.

 MVH: We definitely did not have a lot of money. So, this story. Jack and I were traveling, by ourselves, no assistants, and we didn’t have a lot of money, so we’re staying together in one hotel room, and finally we are going to be on a major NBC show. At the time, we might do a speech or seminar during the day in one city, get on a plane at night, arrive somewhere at 1:00 in the morning and have to get up to do interviews at 6:00 D1P . This time, we had to get up at 4:00 D1P . to be in the NBC studio at 6:00 D1P . And, by the way, when the media hits, they all want you, right now. There were no cell phones then—we were squeezing in phone interviews with rolls of coins in our pockets at pay phones. Anyway,


-----

###### Jack and I get to our hotel room at about 1:00 D1P . and the alarm goes off at 4:00 D1P . I look over, and Jack’s gone to sleep in his little three-piece suit and little red tie. I said, “Jack, you’ve got to get up, we’ve got to get to the station.” He said profane words to me. At the time, NBC LIVE was the biggest thing. It’s interesting how much has changed in just 20 years. Then, there wasn’t the proliferation of media. You had a handful of big shows on networks. It took us five years to get on Oprah. People say—didn’t Oprah make you? No, we were a success already. Jack and I probably sacrificed a billion hours of sleep to get everything going to ultimately sell half a billion books. At least it felt that way. We were starting this fire by rubbing sticks together. We were exhausted most of the time. We overate and ate for energy. There was no time to exercise. It was a blur of book signings, interviews, speeches, travel. It takes a lot to build momentum. Then, like Napoleon Hill said in Think And Grow Rich, when riches begin to come, they come in such an avalanche and overflowing abundance, you wonder where they’ve been hiding all of the lean years. I know you’ve had that experience. We certainly had it.

 DAN: I have on several occasions—and teach it as “The Phenomenon®,” the time in your life when you suddenly accomplish more in one year than in the previous ten years. When it happens, it happens for a reason. People can learn from you and me how to trigger and accelerate The Phenomenon®.
 Anyway, the story. At this point, you’ve hit, you’ve got one book after another coming out of your story factory, you and Jack are in demand by the media and as speakers. Now, let’s leap from the books to the brand built by the books—and that is vital to get. You didn’t invest in brand-building per se. You didn’t even start with that as a clear intention. This brand was built by the selling of books. But let’s get into its value . . . .

##### Beyond the Original, Core Business to the Even Bigger
 Opportunity

###### MVH: As you know, I’m a voracious reader. I’ve probably read over 5,000 autobiographies and biographies. I read every one of your books. One of the
