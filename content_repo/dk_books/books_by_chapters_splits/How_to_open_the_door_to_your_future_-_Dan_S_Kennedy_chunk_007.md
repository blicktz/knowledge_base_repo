    in just two years, it costs you $180.00 for the $500.00. In
    five years, your cost doubles. This means, if you finance,
   say a $500.00 stereo system on a credit card or plan, that
   stereo may cost you $680.00, $770.00, even $950.00
   before you get it paid for. If you do that a lot, say with
   $5,000.00 worth of credit instead of $500.00, if II cost you
   at least $900.00 a year just to keep the interest current. If
   you go through life paying double what you should for
   everything you buy, it stands to reason you're not going to
   win the money game! A sure sign that you're losing badly,
   by the way, is making only the "minimum monthly
  paymenf on your credit cards.

   where can you invest it and make 18% a year on it?
   Nowhere! (An ordinary savings account may pay only 3%
   or 4% or 5% a year in interest.) But you can get that high
   of a return by using it to get out of debt and stay out of
   debt. The chart below shows how paying just $50 a month
   toward the principal (not the interest) of a credit card
   balance pays off in a big way.

   possible. If you are deeply in debt and unable to make
   even the minimum payments due on all your bills every
   month, you should probably get some professional
   assistance. Legitimate credit counselors can help you
   work with your creditors and devise a plan you can live
    with, to get your debts under control. Look in your city's
   Yellow Pages under "Credif and find "Credit Counselors"
   or another reputable credit counseling and assistance
   organization. If in doubt of which organization to call,
   check with your local Better Business Bureau, your bank
  manager or your family accountant for a referral. If you're
   just mildly in debt, you will be able to reverse the process
   without help. One way or another, escape from high
   interest debt is a very smart financial move.
    In fact, here are the three steps to end slavery to debt:
   Step#1 : STOP doing whatever has gotten you into debt in
   the first place . If it is buying things on impulse, stop doing
       it. Lock your credit cards in a drawer and only take them
   out for a carefully thought-out purchase if you must, but
   don't carry them with you all the time. If ifs living way
   beyond your means, stop that. Pull back. Do without if you
   must for a while. Delay major purchases. If there's a more
   serious problem, like drinking or gambling, get help. There
    is no shame in getting help for a problem. The shame is
    in refusing to honestly face your problems.
   Step#2: Devise a plan to systematically reduce your
   burden of debt . After you pay yourself first, then take a
   pre-determined percentage of your paycheck and any
   and all other monies that come to you and use that to
   reduce debt. If you happen to own your own home or

```
   may be able to use the equity in your home to get a debt
    consolidation loan, pay off a bundle of the high interest
    debts, and have a lower interest (ie. lower cost) loan in its
    place. If you do this, though, you MUST avoid running up
    the credit cards all over again â€” even if you have to cut
   them in half and close the accounts to do it.
   Step#3: Avoid taking on new debt unless it definitely
   IMPROVES your financial situation , such as incurring
   debt to buy a home and stop renting, or further your
    education, or move to a new city to take a better job, or to
   take advantage of a carefully chosen business
    opportunity.
        Poverty-Inducing Habit #3:
       Not Increasing Your Value In
          The Marketplace
    Just about everybody WANTS a bigger paycheck. And
   most people WANT better career opportunities. There's
    certainly nothing wrong with that, and a whole lot right with
        it, but 'SA/ants" alone won't get much accomplished.
    Actually, the size of most paychecks, and the
    opportunities that become available to different people,
    are largely determined by a concept called "value."
   Think about the pro athlete, for example. A player has a
   phenomenal season, he plays a very important role in
    getting his team to the championship, and his popularity
    increases, which means more ticket sales, higher ticket
    prices and more television exposure for the team. That
    athlete has increased his value through PERFORMANCE.

```
   paycheck. He may not get it instantly, though. His contract
    with his team may limit his raises. But one thing is certain:
        If he continues to improve his value through improved
   performance, in another year or two or three at the most,
   when he negotiates his next contract with that team (his
    current employer) or moves to a new team (next
    employer), he WILL get a much bigger paycheck that
    reflects his increased value. But this is very, very
    important: Note that the increase in his value comes
  BEFORE the increase in his paycheck. 4
   Here are the four main ways people can increase their
   value in the marketplace, to cun-ent or next employers:
           1. Performance
           2. Experience
           3. Education
          4. Combinations of 1, 2 and 3

   only repeat the same one year of experience twenty
   times. That does not appreciably increase their value. But
       if, with each passing month, you are learning a new skill,
   getting better at the job, even finding ways to do things
   more efficiently and effectively, then experience counts.
  One great mistake, by the way, is to presume that you are
    entitled to more money just because of the number of
   years on the job. The idea that an employee keeps getting
   raise after raise only because of the number of years of
   employment is as out-dated as the Model-T automobile
   great grandpa started with a hand crank; that worthed
  when we had a "closed economy." Today, just about every
   industry and business is part of a "global economy," and
   companies cannot compete in that environment if they
   pay people a lot more than a particular job itself is worth.
      If they can get the job done right for $1 0.00 an hour, they
   cannot justify paying you $20.00 to do that same job,
   even if you've been there for twenty years. You may not
    like that, but that's the way things really are.
   Education is the great income MULTIPLIER! Education
   absolutely, definitely, inarguably increases your
   mari<etplace value.
   These days, you need a PLAN for increasing your value.
  Odds are excellent that someone starting out, say 1 8 to
   25 years of age, will not only change employers but will
   change careers at least three to five times during his
   working lifetime. Computers will play an ever-increasing
    role in everyone's lives. And roughly one-third of all
   adults will, at some time, choose to start and operate a
   part-time, home-based business of one kind or another.

    The Three Prosperity Building Habits
   Just as there are habits that induce and perpetuate
   poverty or "lack of money," there are habits proven to build
    prosperity; "having more money than you need." If you
   apply these habits in your life, you are CERTAIN to
    gradually but significantly improve your overall financial
    "health."
    Prosperity Habit #1 : Saving . Back to Lincoln's "a penny
   saved is a penny earned" axiom; yes, even pennies
    matter! A penny saved helps build the habit of saving.
   Every time you "save," you create a feeling, an inner
   sense of "building," and you strengthen a habit. If you
   SYSTEMATICALLY save, that feeling becomes pretty
    powerful. It has an impact on your self-image, self-esteem
   and self-confidence. If you SYSTEMATICALLY save, that
    habit becomes automatic behavior.
     In the beginning, your saving activity may not mean much
     in pure dollars and sense. You may start just by putting
   "spare change" into a coffee can at the end of every day,
   and by putting a tiny 1 % of every paycheck into a savings
   account. That WILL take a long time to build up. But
    getting this habit working for you is whafs important,
    regardless of the dollar amount.
    Later, as your savings build, you can begin using more
   sophisticated investment methods, like Individual
   Retirement Accounts (IRA's), mutual funds, and so on.
     In the beginning, very ordinary savings vehicles are fine.
   And even small but CONSISTENT savings, in ordinary

    rate during each time period. Any increase in the amount
   saved and/or a better average rate of return via
    investments would produce a substantially larger total
   amount. It is quite possible, at today's interest rates,
    and, at some point switching to mutual funds, using an
    IRA, and other investment opportunities, for this small
   savings habit to accumulate over $150,000.00 by
    retirement. Although this is no fortune, it would yield a
   monthly interest income of $500, $600, possibly more,
    to supplement Social Security, company pensions, etc.
  â€” and most retirees will tell you that can make all the
    difference in the world!

   even call it mystical. We are not even going to attempt to
   explain it. But we will INSIST that it works. Every individual
  who tries this idea reports remarkable results.
      If you have three apples and give one away to a hungry
   person, your 'Svealth" has DECREASED from three to
   two, right? On paper, yes. But in real life, the act of giving
  seems to increase wealth rather than to decrease it. The
   act of giving actually violates the math we learn in school.
  When people combine The Habit Of SAVING with The
   Habit Of GIVING, they seem to "attracf new job
   opportunities, promotions, raises, even money coming to
   them from unusual and unexpected sources.
   You may want to pick a favorite charity, your church, a
    local civic project, a food bank, a homeless shelter,
   whatever, and regularly and consistently give a small
   donation. Just like "paying yourself first," you might set a
   percentage, even 1% or 2% or 3% of all the money that
  comes to you. Each time you get paid, give even just
   $5.00. The amounts are less important than consistency
   and frequency.
   Giving of time counts, too. Your community is overrun with
   worthy, charitable organizations and projects in need of
   volunteers. Volunteerism is an American tradition that
   enriches everybody's lives.
    'The only certain way to multiply wealth
       is to divide it^'. . /'for just as you feel you are!"

  We are 'the TV generation." No previous age group has
   spent as much time watching television as we do. Now,
   we're not going to "bash" television. We enjoy TV just as
  much as anybody. We use TV for news, for entertainment,
   for watching sports, for information, even for shopping.
   But the person who uses the TV as an "escape" from real
     life...who flops in front of it as soon as they arrive home
   from work and stays there until they fall asleep.... this
   person does himself a terrible disservice. Instead, some
   portion of your time should be deliberately and wisely
   invested in self-improvement.
  When you stop to think about it, "YOU" are the only thing
    in life over which you have a great deal of control. TOU"
   are the one asset that can never be lost or stolen. Doesn't
      it make good sense to invest time and money in improving
   that asset?

   You drive your car by habit. And most of these habits get
   formed mostly by accident.
   Think about the foods we like, for example. Why do we
    prefer cake, cookies, ice cream and other sweets as
   desserts? Why don't we prefer fresh fruits and cheeses
   instead? Because of habit. As children, we got sweets as
    treats. Thinking of those foods as treats became a habit.
   Had your parents started out and stayed consistent with
    giving you fresh fruits as treats and never giving you
   cookies or cakes, by the time you toddled off to
    kindergarten, you would have fomned a habit of preferring
   and desiring those fruits. Of course, peer pressure from
     all the other kids would have undoubtedly interfered with
    that in pretty short order. But if we ALL were raised with
   the fresh fruit habit instead of the candy habit, we'd
    certainly be a healthier society!
   The good news is that, as an independent thinking adult,
   you can CHOOSE to break certain habits, and to create
    other habits. You can choose habits that work for you.
     "Laws are never as effective
      as habits."

       If you create a habit, you create character. If
    you create character, you create a destiny."

   How To Manage Your Career,
      To Get Ahead In Life
   A huge, positive step in life is switching from '^/vorking for
   a living" to "developing a career."
   There has been a fairly recent societal trend of young
   people choosing just to take "jobs," claiming to have little
    interest in the income or the nature of the work, and
    focusing entirely on their after-work pastimes and
    interests. This is sort of dropping out halfway. The truth is:
        It wears thin pretty quickly.
   And an interesting truth about human psychology is that
   we derive a great deal of our personal satisfaction and
    self-esteem from our work. It turns out you can't just stick
   your job in a pigeon hole, go through the motions, and still
    feel good about yourself. Our work and our self-esteem
    are closely linked. If our work is unsatisfactory to us, we
     will be unhappy. People stuck in unsatisfactory jobs carry
    that unhappiness over into other areas of their lives and
    find that nothing else makes them happy either.
     How To Escape A Dead-End Job
          (Before It's Too Late)
   A trend of recent years in the American economy,
    unfortunate in many ways, has been that a big chunk of
    the new jobs being created are low-end, low-wage
    service-oriented jobs, like fast food restaurants, delivery
   and store clerk jobs. This is not to say you cannot start out
     in such a job and work your way up to better and better
    positions. You can. And many companies in these types
