# Introduction

## How to Make Your Business Much
 More POWERFUL

### by Parthiv Shah

###### I want to congratulate you on picking up this book, and I want to make you a promise… This book WILL help you build, automate, and use profit- producing systems in your business. We discuss how technology can help you do that, and we share different tools that you can use. But this is a marketing book, NOT a technology book. What I mean is that we discuss the use of technology to an end. For a purpose. More sales, more profit, and a higher valuation of your business. More power to accomplish more of your vision and ambition, faster. The ability to do things that now flummox you. This is what technology, properly organized and used, can do for you —like nothing else can. However, just because a Pandora’s box of tech exists does not mean you should feel pressured to use it. As you’ll see, I use many different companies’ tools, but different ones for different clients and their different purposes.

-----

###### We are going to discuss software that will help you generate more and more profitable sales, on autopilot, with less money invested in getting each sale. By the way, the fact that we will most likely be able to bring down your Cost Per Sale (we discuss this and several metrics later in the book) is not an excuse to spend less on marketing. Instead, our goal is to empower you to confidently invest more, to get more growth, and more speed of growth. A key goal of Marketing Automation is leverage. This comes from power. The power to do more, do it faster, do it better, do it more consistently, and do it more cost-efficiently so that growth or expansion can be friction-less, and you can exert competitive advantage.
 To gain these benefits, you need to have your entire marketing as a fully integrated SYSTEM, not day-by-day, reactionary, random acts. My co- author, Dan Kennedy, says that the more random you are, the less money and success you ever have. Randomness is the enemy. This is not a new success principle. Napoleon Hill included “ORGANIZED Effort” as one of his 17, in Think and Grow Rich, in 1937. Today, with business at the speed of light, and so much more to do, use, and manage than in the 1930s or ’50s or ’80s or last year (!), disorganized efforts are not just ineffective, they are deadly. SYSTEMIZING your marketing has moved from luxury to necessity.
 Technology can help you build out your marketing system faster and more efficiently than ever in the history of business. I’m reminded of T.J. Rohleder, who has been a very large and successful publisher of business courses and packaged business opportunities for decades. He built his company from scratch to category dominance before we had the tools we have today.
 And so Rohleder bought an old hospital to keep everything straight. He would set up different marketing / direct mail pieces in each room and when his employees would come in that day he would tell them which room they would be working in. Today you could have that same kind of precision, and even better, with an average CRM! Today the CRM will just send an email to your printer, or your production team if they are in-house, with a list of people and the marketing piece that they should get. They set it up and run the piece, assemble it, and get it in the mail. No need for a hospital

###### building with 1,000 rooms, giant whiteboards with production schedules on them, physical movement of teams from one project space to another. The computer and all the tools it offers does it all for you!
 To back up a step, when we talk about marketing systems and marketing automation what exactly, do we mean by: marketing? It includes:

Advertising, and coordination of all ad media
Lead generation
Converting leads to set appointments or other selling opportunities
New customer, client, or patient acquisition
Selling by media replacing manual labor
Converting first-time buyers to committed customers
Facilitating upsells, repeat business, retention, and recurring revenue
Implementing sophisticated, complex multi-step, multimedia communication
Implementing multi-step follow-up to Call, No Appointment; Appointment, No-Sale; New
Promotion, No Response
Facilitating data mining from within your own records, in order to unearth additional selling
and cross-selling opportunities; matching specific offers to specific prospects
Creating customer enthusiasm and evangelism, and generating more referral activity

Supporting new product or service launches, seasonal promotions, or other limited-timeperiod campaigns
Fully managing ALL online and offline advertising, PR, content distribution, and social
media usage
Creating a lot of “set it and forget it” processes
And much, much more. Essentially SYSTEMIZING everything leading up to acquisition of
a new customer, everything that then happens to keep, fully monetize, and develop a great
relationship with that customer.

###### This is NOT simple or easy. This is NOT a book for people who are lazy or looking for a single magic bullet or a way to get very rich very quick. If you are a serious person, into building a sustainable, successful company and willing to invest both time and money in doing so, you’ve found the right book! It’s not necessary to be tech savvy or even to like tech, incidentally. It’s much more important to be or make yourself marketing savvy than use tech or have tech used for you to fully implement your marketing vision, plan, and system. For that, too, you have found the right book.
 Now let’s get started!

##### CHAPTER 1

# The Jetsons

##### by Dan Kennedy

###### Electric, self-driving, flying cars. Robot housekeepers, cooks, valets, secretaries, and personal assistants. The paperless office. Our entire life operated for us by automation. Where is it? We have a future arriving late.
 The first electric “aerocar” prototype was built in 1926, and aerocars for all was promised to us in 1940. Individual, personal jetpacks were presented in 1964. Picture-phones were first made to work in experiments in 1956. We saw all this and more in the popular cartoons of the 1960s–1980. We do have sort-of-robots we converse with and get answers from that will also turn lights on and off, operate the TV, order things from the Internet, named Alexa and Siri. The fast-food industry has prototype robot cooks. We may wind up living like the Jetsons, with even more AI-based automation replacing our labor, moving us from place to place faster and easier, erasing many of our human problems. But, from earliest predictions and prototypes, it’s slow in coming.
 Then there’s that paperless office thing. LOL! Have you been in a hospital, doctor’s office, or CPA’s office lately? They still have file rooms. At OfficeMax and Office Depot stores, the main items purchased are paper,

###### paper file folders to put the paper in, envelopes to send the paper hither ’n yon in, and printers to put things onto paper.
 We have successfully miniaturized the computer—the phone. My first business computers were 6’ tall, big, and had to be kept in a temperature- controlled room. We have successfully consolidated the computer, typewriter, file cabinet, camera, video camera, clock/watch, alarm clock, etc. into one handheld device. That device has many automation capabilities. It can work with many of the Marketing Automation tools presented in this book. It can also monitor our health vitals, automatically reading heart, blood sugar, and other medical matters, automatically alerting you to your own needs.
 We are getting there. Late, but getting there.

#### To Win Business, We Began with Office Automation

###### When I was a wee lad in short pants, I worked in my dad’s commercial art studio, amidst drawing boards, rulers, rubber cement bottles, X-Acto knives, our pet parrot, and the modern miracle of the moment: the IBM electric typewriter. The ads on the pages at the end of this chapter announce the Office Automation that I grew up with, and that were part of my first businesses’ offices as an adult.
 The Tech Revolution most of you are more familiar with took all the equipment of an office or an advertising agency or commercial art studio and put it inside one box: the computer. Before, in order to have 15 different type fonts, you needed 15 different IBM electric typewriters—a room full. The need for phototypesetting and a dark room ended. For the most part, the drawing board, knives, glue, and paste-up artist, all gone. Today, we’ve come a long way, baby. Your desktop PC, your iPad, even your handheld device includes an entire building full of Office Automation. Of Production Automation. For good or bad or both, you carry typewriters, paste-up artists, cameras, video cameras, photo and video editing, file cabinets, an encyclopedia, maps, a telegraph machine, endless DIY resources like

###### LegalZoom in place of a lawyer or bookkeeper in place of a payroll clerk, and, gee, I almost forgot, a phone. In your pocket.
 Along the way, a whole new kind of automation emerged, too—the one we’re tackling in this book, which people in my world call Marketing Automation. It began humbly, slowly, unsophisticated. Then it grew like a California wildfire, out of control. Today, it is its own industry. Choices are confusing. But if selected and used wisely, it can…

Erase many advantages big companies long held over small businesses—David can do
everything Goliath plus an army can do, what you needed an army for.
Dramatically boost speed-to-market. The idea you have at 9 a.m. for an ad, marketing
campaign, product, or service can be tested for response by noon.
Virtually eliminate human error in CONSISTENTLY implementing marketing, follow-up
marketing, and customer relationship management.
Facilitate true target-marketing, with fully customized or even personalized marketing
communication to different segments of your customer population or overall market— for
much greater impact.
Go so far as to replace a lot of marketing you do (as a verb) with marketing systems you
own—liberating you to turn attention to other opportunities and initiatives you otherwise
wouldn’t have time for, or just “go fishing.”

Make money while you sleep, by converting your marketing operation to 24/7/365, the
world we now live in, where potential customers want responses to their expressed interest
instantly, any moment, day or night.
Make your business’s sales and customer obtainment and growth more predictable.
…and more.

###### For these reasons, even if delving into it and talking about it makes your head hurt as it does mine, you must participate.

#### I Opt Out, but I’m All In

###### On a personal note, I am what is now called a “modern Luddite.” I do not own a cell phone or smartphone, my computer is not connected to the Internet, there is no Alexa or Siri in my home or office, I use no apps, I wouldn’t do online banking if you paid me, and I judge social media to be a deep, poisonous, mental-illness-creating, soul-killing, dehumanizing, time- wasting sinkhole. I have even more Luddite eccentricities discussed in my book No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs. Working on this book

###### required Advil[®]. If you dislike the unleashed Pandora’s box of technology, I feel your pain.
 But I have it all used for me, for my business activities, and for clients. I want this to give those of you flummoxed and viscerally averse to tech and tech talk hope and courage. You can dislike it and still have it put to work for you. You can limit your knowledge and engagement to understanding, but delegate all the implementation. I make a study of it, but I don’t do it. A chief marketing executive managing online at my client Guthy- Renker said that you need three things to make a powerful, effective sales website: a legal pad, different colored pens, and selling knowledge. If you can draw and explain what you want and how you want it to work, people like my co- author can make it a reality. You need to understand all the opportunities and options available to you with Marketing Automation, which is the purpose of this book. You do not need to personally wrestle with it. And, as you’ll discover in this book, there are incredible software options that can do a lot of what you know could be done with your marketing if you only had the time, staff, or money. The right-sized software for your business can do it for you, efficiently, cost-efficiently, and effectively. THAT is why all the detail of this book is vitally important to you. It is why I agreed to do it and include it in the No B.S. series of business books.
 Rather obviously, I am not the guy to present these details. It’d be like having the best heart surgeon in the world teach you everything you need to know about long-haul truck driving, or vice versa. Thus, the bulk of this book is from Parthiv Shah and several guests invited in by him. Parthiv is a client of mine but also a valued resource for me and for a number of my clients. He will be your capable guide on this journey, sort of Alice and Alex in Wonderland. You’ll find that I chime in, in various places throughout.
 One last point, an incentive to take this book most seriously. In my 50+ years of working with small- to mid-size business owners, entrepreneurs, and sales professionals who get very, very rich, and those who don’t— despite working very hard—I have discovered a single golden thread running through all the successes. It is a golden thread—i.e., theme—of this book, as well as No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits and
