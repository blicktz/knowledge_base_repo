##### liberals want; if it were, their kids wouldn’t be in private schools and there would be affordable public housing in ZIP code 90210. It is certainly not what affluent people want—they have worked very hard to arrive at the financial ability to segregate themselves.
 As a political exercise in America, we keep trying to desegregate society in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, and economic status; we have geographic redistribution schemes engineered into the code. Just about as fast as we democratize something, the people affected resegregate themselves. Hotels were once used only by the rich and by business travelers; they democratized prices, but then added concierge floors, then higher- and higher-priced hotels, even to the point of putting a Four Seasons inside the Mandalay Bay. When I started flying on business in the mid- 1970s, I was the young oddball in first class. With very rare exception, it was all 50-year-old white guys in suits and ties, frequent business travelers —the riffraff could not afford sitting there, and the divider was firmly policed by the flight attendants who brought us drinks, food, and even Playboy magazines and on long flights sat and played cards with us. Today, many flights have no first class, and those that do have seats dispensed at cheaper prices than 30 years ago (inflation adjusted) and often to people getting up there with frequent flier points. Air travel has been price democratized and desegregated, and even the crowd that used to go Greyhound® now flies the unfriendly skies. What happened? A giant boom for private aviation, featuring fractional jet ownership. You can’t stop segregation. And you damn sure can’t stop those with money from segregating themselves from everybody else.

##### What the Gates Really Are A gated community is not really about protection from thundering hoards of criminals, as was a drawbridge and alligator-infested moat for the affluent tribe’s early predecessors. You are, of course, at far more risk of home invasion, burglary, and other crimes living in an inner-city ghetto than in a suburban gated community. Today’s gates are symbolic far more than functional. They are the grown-up version of the boys’ tree house with the rope ladder pulled up after only the chosen few in the club have climbed up. A symbol of exclusion. We are in, you are not, nah, nah, nah. The gates are symbolic of exceptional achievement, accomplishment, and status. Symbolic of the very existence of an elite tribe. Mostly, this is simple economic segregation. But as another example, consider the Florida city

##### envisioned by Domino’s Pizza® founder Tom Monaghan, into which he poured hundreds of millions of dollars, his intent to create a Catholic gated community devoted to Catholic life. As a legal practicality, he couldn’t ban heathens or Baptists or Jehovah’s Witnesses; he could only design every brick, every cultural icon, every tribal activity to make them feel unwelcome. Gate at community’s entrance or cross in its town square, symbols of tribalism.


### Dan Kennedy’s #3 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Create the tribe your desired customers are eager to be a member of.


##### As a marketer to the affluent, it is vital you fully understand tribalism in general, and the affluent’s devotion to membership in smaller and smaller, seemingly more and more elite and therefore profoundly exclusionary tribes.
 The affluent tribalism is simply an extreme variation of all tribalism. The most important thing to understand about it is its emotional driving forces, so that you fully incorporate those same forces into your marketing. Those forces include those common to all tribalism: acceptance, recognition, peer approval, like-mindedness, and elitism. But the overriding driving force of affluent tribalism is validation of superiority. The affluent believe—whether through heritage or achievement—that they are inherently and profoundly superior to all others. The majority have arrived through accomplishment born of ingenuity and innovation, discipline and persistence, work ethic and related behavioral characteristics, as well as a philosophy they see lacking in the masses, so they do not view their affluence as luck or a gift but as a product of and then as proof of their superior character. In short, their affluence is a special form of moral authority and superiority. This is the belief system that gives


-----

##### affluent liberals and socialists their moral authority to dictate to others how they should live: Barbra Streisand telling people to dry their clothes on clotheslines rather than wasting energy on electric dryers, although it’s doubtful she has James Brolin out on the Malibu beach with laundry basket and clothespins. Al Gore preaching energy conservation to save the earth from global warming while flitting about in gas-guzzling private jets between giant, energy inefficient homes. Warren Buffett insisting “the rich” should pay more income tax while virtually all of his income is not subject to it, but instead taxed as capital gains. Nothing new here. Limousine liberals have been with us since first wealth. And, for the most part, they do not perceive themselves as disingenuous hypocrites. In their minds, they possess their special moral authority as superior beings.
 This is the same belief system that gives affluent conservatives their moral authority to dictate to others how they should live: Limbaugh, of whom I’m a fan, but still, Limbaugh railing against drug offenders from his radio pulpit while, for a time, indulging in his own addiction to pain killers not just by doctor shopping, but allegedly by sending his housekeeper out to buy stolen drugs from back-alley dealers. This is the belief system that keeps the rich’s reaction to the homeless fellow in the doorway “Get a job” rather than “There, but for the grace of God, go I.” Affluent conservatives believe their affluence is result of superior initiative and discipline, certainly not luck of the draw.
 If you are an affluent by accomplishment yourself, this may seem an unflattering glimpse in the mirror. Be that as it may, accurate, honest, realistic, and pragmatic assessment of the deep-seated beliefs of those you seek to sell to is valuable beyond price. Even the price of turning one’s self- portrait to face the wall. We are what we are.
 So, what do Superior Beings want? It’s really quite simple. Recognition as Superior Beings. The sort of segregation that kings and queens have always had, that is appropriate for kings and queens. Special privileges. Fawning service. Products, services, and places inaccessible to anyone but kings and queens.

### The Affluent E-Factors

# A short preface … since publication of the first edition of this book in
##### 2009, I’ve gotten more unsolicited, favorable comments about this chapter than I would have guessed. Marketers and merchants of every stripe have told me of very practical applications—reworking their marketing, rewriting or replacing their advertising, altering the sales presentations and scripts they and their staffs use. A dentist conducting public seminars to get implant patients sent me his “before” script, his “after” script, and reported a 170% improvement in booking of appointments at the end of his

##### seminars—accounting for over $600,000.00 more dentistry performed, year to year. I tell you this so that you don’t miss its importance. An investment firm retooled its lead generation advertising, making sure to embed all seven of the extra, affluent E-Factors below, and more than doubled response. I could go on. I tell you this so that you don’t somehow miss the importance and usefulness of this chapter.

 E-Factors are the emotional drivers of buying behavior. For years I have taught sales professionals and marketers a generic list of E-Factors and done my level best to get them to rely on that list, whether selling to the CEO in the boardroom or mom ‘n’ dad in the kitchen at home. The most common mistake made by marketers is an egotistical belief that their customers are smarter, more rational, and more sophisticated than others, thus not controlled by E-Factors. It’s a costly egotism. Everybody’s buying behavior is driven by emotions, justified as necessary, after the fact, with logic.


### Generic E-Factors that Apply to Everybody

##### Fear Guilt

 Pride Greed

 Love


##### In addition to the E-Factors affecting everybody, the affluent have a particular set of E-Factors to consider, some of which may surprise you:


-----

##### • insecurity
 • fear of being found fakers
 • desperate desire not to commit a faux pas
 • today, not passé
 • feeding emotional emptiness
 • giving selves gold stars
 • after all, what’s the point of being rich

 The affluent are insecure in many ways. They certainly worry about going backward, about losing their money, status, or privileges. If you’ve never been rich, you have no frame of reference, but if you’ve been rich then poor, you know what you’re missing! They are acutely aware of the aggravations, inconveniences, and financial difficulties endured daily by ordinary mortals that they have left behind—and lose a few winks every night worrying about waking up back there again.
 More importantly, they are concerned with being found out. Affluents who have gotten there largely or totally on their own become keenly aware that everybody else thinks of them as profoundly smarter or more talented or privy to special information or otherwise superhuman. Many actually use this in the attainment of career or business success, making themselves into and being accepted as wizards. I’ve been in the wizard business myself for three decades and have wound up hanging out with an entire community of them. We know wizardry is more illusion than reality. I often say if ordinary people realized how ordinary in capability most millionaires are, there’d be a lot more millionaires—what holds most back isn’t lack of opportunity or lack of capability, but the illusory belief that millionaires possess some special abilities they do not. The affluent are also very sensitive to judgment by their own chosen tribe or other affluents and are worried about “using the wrong fork” one way or another, showing up in an out-of-fashion dress, not knowing what the others know and converse about during cocktails at the club. Think of the whole thing as a high school clique, and everyone in it as desperate for acceptance by the others and secretly feeling the others may be superior.
 These anxieties actually spur a lot of productive behaviors and ironically contribute to the successful becoming more successful, the rich becoming richer. They may eat healthier and exercise more to look better as


-----

##### a path to status with peers. They may read more, read more eclectically, and stay more abreast of political and financial news, leading to more successful investing. They may contribute to charitable and civic organizations and activities as a means of self-validation and validation within the tribe. These anxieties can obviously be used in selling to them, and both for-profit and nonprofit marketers should pay heed.
 Then there is the matter of emotional emptiness—the longstanding debate, and joking about, whether or not money can buy happiness. People without money like making themselves feel better about their situation by insisting that the rich are no happier and may be less happy than the non- rich. Having been poor and now relatively rich, I can assure you that money buys a lot of access to opportunities, experiences, comforts, and conveniences that can lead to happiness, but I don’t think it directly and itself buys happiness. Other than Disney’s® Scrooge McDuck®, I don’t know of anybody who gets joy from going into his vault and playing with his money like a child playing with toys. But I know quite a few affluent adults who buy some very expensive toys and enjoy playing with them very much. There is, however, an underlying level of disappointment in most affluents with the fact that their affluence isn’t a true Easy Button™ that works without fail or a crown everyone recognizes and bows to. When I switched from driving old, bad, cheap, beater cars to my first shiny new Lincoln Continental, it was a supreme disappointment to discover that birds crapped on its hood with impunity, just as they had my bad cars. You’d think the birds would show some respect! And it is true that a lot of affluent consumers’ purchasing is done as a means of showing themselves respect and giving themselves recognition for their hard work and accomplishment that they don’t feel they are getting from others. Being told, subtly, that “you deserve this (and most others don’t)” and “owning this signifies accomplishment and status and commands respect” is extremely persuasive to the affluent.

### Dan Kennedy’s #4 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Make owning your product or being your client signify something.


##### Recognition Does Matter Should you, for a moment, think the affluent are not motivated by this seeking of recognition, you should familiarize yourself with the fundraising modus operandi of the Republican and Democratic parties and candidates. Much of it revolves around motivating affluent individuals to be bundlers and bring together groups of maximum donors, thus raising $50,000.00 to $100,000.00, or more in clumps, for which the bundler is rewarded with invitations to special events like cocktail receptions at the Vice President’s home or dinners with a Congressman seated at every table of eight, photos with the politicians, little trinkets like presidential seal cufflinks and suitable-for-framing parchment certificates. I have seen it as a donor myself and used it to help political candidates as an advisor. It is every bit as pin and medal driven as a direct-selling organization like Mary Kay® or Amway®, except money is being raised rather than made, and it is millionaires and multimillionaires vying for the emerald or ruby or diamond pin, rather than cosmetic, vitamin, and soap sales agents.
 The mass-affluent also have their own special E-Factors:

 • the aspirational acquisition
 • I own therefore I am
 • knowing the secret handshake and having those who know it know
 you know it

 This is all about being part of the clique. It once was all about having stepped up. Having visibly arrived. In the post-World War II era, when the suburbs were becoming both a place and a way of life, it was called “keeping up with the Joneses.” Auto, TV, home improvement, and similar industries—as well as credit companies—benefited by this force of nature; if one driveway on the street suddenly provided home to a new station wagon, a fleet of station wagons was sure to follow. But today, there is a more complex collection of emotional drivers behind the purchases of the


-----

##### mass-affluent. There is some of the “Look, we’ve arrived” going on, but a lot of purchases are made as a forward statement of “where we’re going.” I call these aspirational acquisitions. The woman with a full-time career and two kids who is too exhausted to cook anything you can’t microwave in its own dish still buys a $75,000.00 custom kitchen with a cooking island and state-of-the-art equipment, as she aspires to be more Martha than Rachael, and intends to devote more time to the art of cooking very soon. If you carefully tour the typical mass-affluent’s home, you’ll find ownership of all sorts of things bought because his peers have them, other things bought with the strong intention of investing time and energy in them sometime soon—from nearly empty home wine cellars to rarely used home gyms and saunas.
 The affluent seem to mature in their attitudes about owning things, and the longer they are affluent and the more affluent they are, the more they choose and buy luxury goods and services for practical and functional reasons regardless of symbolic statement made. But for the mass-affluent, the things they buy and own and their self-images are tightly linked. “I own, therefore I am” is a powerful driving force. If the most popular and perceived-as-sophisticated mom in the neighborhood wears x, drives x, enrolls her child in x, and I do the same, I am as sophisticated as she. Ownership equals being.
 You can profit significantly by giving serious thought to how you may present your products, services, and business in sync with these E-Factors.
