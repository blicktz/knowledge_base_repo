###### CHAPTER 2
#### WHY MARKETING FAILS

-----

###### Over the course of this book, you’re going to discover

 a totally new and different way to market your

 products and services.
 In fact, you could consider this “an alternative universe” of

 marketing, where all the fundamentals you thought were true have been turned on their head. Kind of like that episode in

 Star Trek where Captain Kirk was a bad guy and Spock sported an eminently logical goatee.

 It’s important that you set aside any preconceptions you

 might have about changing gears with your marketing, because the fact of the matter is clear and has been for

 years. Indeed, way back in 2006, long before the explosion of social media like Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, and

 much more, I wrote something that remains as true today as

 ever:

#### Most small business advertising and
 marketing STINKS.

###### I stand by this still. Monstrous sums are wasted and opportunities lost. Even amid all the change in technology

 and practically limitless options available to get your

 message out, nothing has changed for the better. In fact, if anything, it’s gotten worse.

 Businesspeople are really confused and overwhelmed—told they must do this, that, the other thing, more and more—just

 to get the same results.
 I’m here to guide you to clarity about a relatively short list

 of mistakes that, when understood and addressed, can

-----

###### safeguard your sanity from the assault of a thousand points

 of media options demanding your attention, time, and money.

 MISTAKE #1: MARKETING TO THE WRONG PEOPLE

 Most businesses market to the wrong people. When their

 marketing fails to deliver, they blame it on something else, as in it’s not pretty enough, it’s not big enough, we didn’t get

 the messaging right, the billboard’s stuck in the wrong

 location, we didn’t advertise in the right magazine or on the right cable channel or whatever.

 I’m not saying that any of these factors AREN’T a problem. They very well could play a role in any ad’s success or lack

 thereof.
 But the bigger problem
 is the simple fact that in most

 cases, most advertising is not directed at any one person.

 Instead, it’s directed at EVERYONE.
 The marketing lacks a clear understanding of WHO they are

 trying to target.
 And here’s the rub. Unless you have extremely deep

 pockets like one of the giant multinational corporations, you CAN’T market to everyone. You have to discriminate. It’s not a

 bad word, in fact it’s your safe passage to focus and

 prosperity.
 When you focus on a specific WHO, you’re able to hone in

 on exactly what makes that person tick. You’re able to adjust your offers and your messaging in a way that perfectly

 matches their desires and abilities to fulfill those desires. Knowing that WHO inside and out enables you to craft a

-----

###### compelling, emotional message that reaches deep into their

 hopes, dreams, fears, and pain.

 At any given moment in time, only 5 percent at best, are intellectually, emotionally, practicably and financially ready to

 act on or make a buying decision about your product, service or proposition. Inevitably, 95 percent of most advertising falls

 on “deaf ears.” This makes it imperative to “hit the bullseye” with the 5 percent, by narrowing your focus. However, you

 can and should also scheme to get those who aren’t ready

 but will be to raise their hands early, and we’ll get to this later in this book.

 MISTAKE #2: SAYING THE WRONG THINGS

 Not only does your marketing have to talk to the right person, it has to say the right things to that person. When you say

 something that fails to connect with your target customer, we

 call that a failed “Message to Market Match.”
 Going back to my example of Domino’s USP, they

 understood their initial market perfectly—ravenously hungry college students desperate for something, anything, to ease

 the munchies. Their message was “fresh hot pizza in thirty

 minutes or less”—the perfect solution delivered to your doorstep in record time. THAT is a perfect “Message to Market

 Match.”
 What makes it even more powerful is that they entered the

 conversation going on inside their customer’s head—which in simple terms could be boiled down to “Hungry. Food. Now.”

 Had they instead focused on “delicious sauce, mama’s old

 country recipe, ingredients sourced from the finest, all

-----

###### organic farms, delivered in style by a man in a tuxedo…” it

 would have tanked. Because that’s NOT what the market was looking for and it certainly didn’t match the dialogue taking

 place in that college kid’s mind as he was watching the TV or studying for finals.

 Another key mistake many make involves the language used in the marketing. When you focus on a specific group of

 people, you’re able to tap into the vocabulary they use every

 day. Doing so is critical—for example, with musicians (and magicians) you would want to promise them “more gigs” not

 “more jobs.” Golfers have a vernacular all their own as well, with “bunkers,” “buried lies,” “shanks,” and “skulled shots

 a.k.a. wormburners.” Just like you wouldn’t attempt to communicate with a Frenchman in Mandarin Chinese, you

 don’t want to use “outsider” language and terminology when

 communicating a sales message to your prospective customer.

 To our 1970s pizza-eating college student now approaching seasoned citizen status, it’s not about hearing a little better—

 that’s not worth spending the money on. He can crank up sound system and The Rolling Stones will sound as good as

 ever. The real problem, which IS worth investing in, is not

 hearing what my kids are saying, them thinking I’m losing my mind because I’m not responding, and them then sending me

 off to the old folks’ home because of that.
 You only know this when you truly know your WHO. You

 need to know more than just their demographics, you need to

 know their hopes, dreams, fears, and most importantly, the

-----

###### conversations that are going on in their heads—the things

 they will never tell you.

##### MISTAKE #3: ASKING THEM TO DO THE WRONG THINGS

###### This boils down to asking for the sale too quickly without first

 narrowing down our universe of potential buyers.
 We live in an extremely skeptical age. Once-respected

 professions and institutions now have practically zero

 credibility, including journalists, clergy, education providers, and so many more. And even lower than politicians rank the

 oily, slimy salesman who’s all-too-eager to shake your hand and pluck your purse.

 Making a sale—especially for something that’s largely

 intangible as a service—requires asking a person to take a leap of faith. Without first establishing a significant level of

 trust in your credibility, responsibility, and authority right from the get-go, you face a significant uphill battle enticing

 anyone to do anything, let alone sign on the dotted line.
 Therefore, instead of going right for the sale out the gate to

 everyone on the planet, a more effective marketing strategy

 is to first narrow down your focus by getting a subset of your potential market to qualify themselves by “raising their hand”

 in response to an offer that’s much easier to say “yes” to—a free gift of some sort, possibly a video or a report. This

 enables you to begin that process of gathering a group of people who have a problem you can solve. It enables you to

 begin establishing credibility, authority, and trust, turning an

-----

###### unknown, potential customer into a self-acknowledged “lead”

 with whom you can follow up more intensely and personally.
 We call this concept “lead generation” and we’ll discuss it

 in much greater detail in just a bit.

 MISTAKE #4: THINKING YOU CAN ADVERTISE ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE

 Marketing used to be relatively simple when it came to

 choosing which media platform to use. CBS. NBC. ABC. PBS. Local radio. Local newspapers. Yellow Pages. A limited number

 of high profile magazines. Billboards. And the few other outlying options of varying effectiveness, such as skywriting,

 smoke signals, and a strange new technology that was called

 “the world wide web.”
 As the giant reptiles vanished from our planet, so too has

 disappeared this once-simple media menu. Today, you as a marketer face a far more complicated, diverse, and

 challenging array of options from which to choose. New media channels and technologies seem to appear daily.

 This constantly changing media landscape challenges even

 the most tech-savvy marketer. Not only do you have to keep up with the latest and greatest, you face disruptions caused

 by shifting public opinion, government intervention, and even changes to corporate strategy. Google adjusts its search

 algorithms continuously, potentially rendering an easily found, SEO-optimized website practically invisible. In regards

 to Pay-Per Click (PPC) ads, whole businesses were destroyed

 when the infamous “Google Slap” completely shut down lead

-----

###### generation ads and systems that previously delivered

 handsome returns.

 Because of this overwhelming complexity, many business owners simply throw up their hands and hand this task over

 to a so-called expert or ad salesman and then write the checks based on them saying “you have to be on xxxx.”

 The only way to avoid this mistake is to nail down exactly

 the WHO to whom you are selling. Once you know that, it’s actually quite simple to choose which media channels to

 advertise in—you go where they go.
 If they’re on Facebook, you go on Facebook. If they read

 Model Railroading
, you advertise in Model Railroading
 (and note—what you sell inside Model Railroading
 doesn’t even

 have to relate in the slightest to trains, it just needs to appeal

 to the kind of person who reads that magazine).
 And even though many consider them outdated, the Yellow

 Pages can still offer huge benefits to marketers if they’re targeting an older demographic who relies on their use.

 You want to only be where your who is and then you want to EVERYWHERE they are.

 It’s a huge mistake to try to sort out all the different options

 for media without first having a plan for what you intend to use that media for. The worst thing you can do is a series of

 random, disconnected marketing attempts across various media channels. Instead, you want to create a true system

 that attracts new customers in an organized way. Because it’s only with this kind of system that you can achieve reliable,

 predictable results—so you know when you invest X you will

 get Y in return.

-----

###### MISTAKE #5: NO MARKETING SYSTEM

 This is probably one of the biggest, most widespread

 mistakes made: Marketing without a system.

 Without a system, you are flying blind, literally throwing jello against a wall, seeing if any of it sticks, and if, by

 happenstance, something does work, you have no way of leveraging that data because anything that did produce a

 positive result is now a oozing green puddle on the office floor.

 Without a system you’re forced to pray for and then rely on

 one-hit wonders (e.g., remember the “Macarena”?) which offer you a brief moment in the sunshine of success, but then

 vanish like dust in the wind. It worked, but you don’t know why, you can’t repeat the process, and once it’s gone, it’s

 gone.

 This goes hand in hand with what I call “Rollercoaster Marketing”—where, when times get tough and customers are

 scarce, you throw everything plus the kitchen sink into your marketing efforts. If you’re lucky and manage to catch a bit of

 traction, your funnel gets filled up and your business starts the ascent. So you drop everything and get to work, because

 you’re now too busy to market and the inevitable perception

 is that you don’t need to because everything’s fat and happy. But this only delays the inevitable, because when you stop

 marketing, your funnel will eventually dry up—new customers stop coming in, existing clients move on—so you start the

 descent, howling all the way to the bottom. And you’re back to where you started.

-----

###### Having a reliable, scientific, and predictable marketing

 system is what you must put in place instead. You want a system where marketing works like a faucet that you can turn

 on or off depending on the needs of your business and where you want to go with it.

 At a minimum, you want your Marketing System to focus on

 three key areas:

 1. Lead generation—the ongoing acquisition of leads for
 your business

 2. Conversion—taking those leads and converting them

 into paying customers

 3. Retention/Referral—keeping that customer base

 intact and generating new leads based on referrals.

 Once you have this system set up, you simply put it in motion and let ‘er run. I have clients who have magnetic marketing

-----

###### systems that have been running untouched for seven to ten

 years.

 MISTAKE #6: CHASING CLIENTS

 Almost as big a mistake as not having a system is the wrong
 headed perception by business owners of all stripes that it’s your job to CHASE customers, clients, and patients. While it

 may seem logical to do so, ponder the implications on a

 personal level for a moment…

 Q:
What’s your natural impulse when you see someone following you in hot pursuit?

 A:
You skedaddle.

 And that’s what your prospective customers, clients, and

 patients will do once they see you chasing after them—and no matter what kind of shape you’re in, they can outrun and

 outlast you. You will wind up left in their dust… undoubtedly

 along with the rest of your fellow competitors, because it’s almost certain they don’t know any better either.

 I recommend a different approach. Stop chasing. Start magnetically attracting. Lay out something they would value

 as “bait” to magnetically attract them and that will cause them to take notice and request information from you. This

 “bait” could be as simple as a two-page report promising to

 solve a specific problem they face or a free consumer report guide. (You do this based on your research and how well you

 understand them.)

-----

###### This idea of having “them come to you” flips everything around and changes the game. Using this kind of approach,

 where you offer something of value for free in exchange for getting someone to step forward, raise his/her hand, and say

 “I’m interested in learning more” gives you the opportunity to separate yourself from the competition and it completely

 reverses the power position of who’s chasing whom.

 When you stop chasing, you no longer have to resort to gimmicks to set yourself apart from the pack of hungry

 competitors running alongside you—like slashing your prices, or grouponing specials—they are magnetically attracted to

 you.
 When you use attraction, this allows you to charge and

 collect premium fees. People pay more for a solution that

 they’ve already at least partially embraced, or better yet— asked for.

 Attraction brings to you clients who are more committed and likely to remain with you over the long term. Another

 benefit is that customers who come to you through attraction are naturally inclined to remain with you and do business with

 you over and again.

 Attraction also builds trust, which is a key to making sales in our exceedingly skeptical age. The customer attraction

 system in Magnetic Marketing
establishes your credibility and authority by delivering the results—initially on a small scale—

 exactly as promised, laying the foundation for even bigger

 sales and greater trust as you continue to deliver real value.
 Attraction enables you to sell exactly what they want to

 buy because it ONLY draws in prospects who fit your criteria

-----

###### and mindset. You know them inside out, you know what they

 want, you attract them with something that you know works, and they’ll buy and keep buying.

 So what kind of marketer do you want to be? Constantly chasing after people who may or may not want you? Or

 calmly waiting and watching as eager, new prospects knock

 on your door and ask for the help only you can provide.

 MISTAKE #7: THINKING YOU HAVE THE AD BUDGET OF COCA-COLA

 It’s only natural to think the advertising you should emulate is what you see every day on TV. Because that’s where the big

 ad dollars get spent and by the biggest, most respected

 brands in business like GE, GM, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Kellogg’s, Anheuser-Busch, and Coca-Cola.

 Millions pour into the coffers of ad agencies to produce high-definition, high-dollar commercials for the itching

 eyeballs of the nation. With these ads, they hope to move us emotionally, to make us laugh, and to make us associate their

 brands with happy feelings so that when the time comes to

 make a relevant buying decision, we choose them.
 That’s the game they’re playing. And the cost to join them

 at the table is enormous. Most small businesses have nothing even remotely close to the ad budgets of these companies. In

 2017, Coca-Cola’s advertising expenses were $3.96 Billion.
 Do you really want to play that game too? You’re not Coca
 Cola. You’re not going after every parched throat on the

 planet. You don’t need to copy what they do with your advertising.

-----

###### You need to do what works for you.

 MISTAKE #8: RACE TO THE BOTTOM IN LOW PRICE

 When you don’t have a real system in place to market your

 products or services, you tend to look at what your competitors are doing to build up their businesses and nine

 times out of ten it’s lower prices.

 This occurs in practically every industry, every marketplace from ice cream to IT. A mad dash to the bottom in the hopes

 that lower prices will give you the edge you need.
 The only problem with this is the simple fact that there can

 only be ONE lowest-priced offering. Someone’s got to take the hit to be number one in that race. But pole position is

 easy to come by, especially if you have deep pockets and you

 don’t care if you lose money over the short term. You can afford to drive the competitors out of business.
