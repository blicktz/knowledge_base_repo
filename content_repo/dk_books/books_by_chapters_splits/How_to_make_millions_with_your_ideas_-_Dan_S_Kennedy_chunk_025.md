    there’s nothing wrong with letting them be arrogant. Go ahead
   and be humble and dumb. And cash the check.
      It’s axiomatic, by the way, that the arrogant big company
   buys the entrepreneur’s business, ruins it, and destroys it in a
    matter of years. Gerardo Joffe, one of the real wizards of mail-
    order, built up a terrific business with Haverhills. It was a fore-
    runner to The Sharper Image. He sold it to Time/Life for a lot
    of money, and they ruined it. After they killed it completely and
    his noncompete agreement was void, Joffe started all over again
    and built up a Haverhills-clone called Hennikers.
     The big company that I sold my company’s manufacturing
    division to really got the short end of the stick in the deal, mostly
   thanks to their own arrogance. First of all, they devoutly believed
    I was wrong about many of my approaches to the business. Sec-
    ond, they believed they could dictate their policies to the cus-
    tomers if they became the only game in town. Third, they
   overestimated the value of the entire market. What they didn’t
   understand was the ‘‘smallness’’ of most of the clients in this
    particular market, so when they tried to force high minimum
    production runs on them and took away the ‘‘babying’’ person-
    alized service we’d been giving them, they lost 80 percent of the
   customer base over a couple of years. Other smaller competitors
    sprang up and took that business away from them. They still did
    okay. They made a profit on the deal. But nothing like they
    thought they would, because ego and arrogance got in their way.
      How to Get the Very Best Deal Possible
        When Selling Your Business
      I’ve violated most of these steps in the two deals I’ve done
    for myself, because I was willing to knowingly trade off dollars
    against speed and simplicity. In one case, I initiated the talks,
    flew to the candidate, pitched his executives, and closed a deal,
    all in two days. Could I have gotten more money by handling

 or urge to appear otherwise. If you want maximum money,
 though, these are the six steps followed by those who get top
 dollar: :
 1. Do not need to sell. In most negotiations, the person most
  willing to walk away from the table wins. If Harv had not
  found a buyer, his $36,000 in profits could easily have gone
  to $50,000 or $60,000 the next year, $100,000 the year after
  that, and he could have gone on living very well running his
  chain of stores for years.
   . Demonstrate tremendous potential. 1 think one of the best
  cases that can be made to a buyer bigger than you are is that
  your business could grow much bigger, much faster if it only
  had the capital and credit, and be much more profitable if it
  only had the buyer’s expert management.
    Imagine having a farm that is productive, has good yields
  per acre, an immaculate appearance, and a good water supply,
  and you are farming it with a mule-drawn plow. Along comes
  a big company that owns and manages thousands of farms,
  has every imaginable piece of modern, automated equipment,
  efficiency experts, soil analysts, and so on. That’s how Harv’s
  business must have looked to Heinz, and he did nothing to
  interfere with that picture, and did everything he could to
  paint it. ‘What I’ve done is good—but imagine what you
  could do!”’ is the message. ;
    During the last couple of months that I was writing this
  book, Ron Perelman invested a very large sum of money in
  the Guthy-Renker Corporation. Ron Perelman is, according
  to Fortune’s 1993 list, one of the 101 richest people in the
  world, a billionaire and then some. The terms of the deal
  allowed Bill Guthy and Greg Renker to immediately take out
  capital gains and enhance their personal fortunes, provided
  the company with more capital and much more credit, and
  gave them special access to other assets and opportunities
  ‘within Perelman’s ‘‘empire’’ (such as Revlon; SCI Televi-
  sion, a chain of TV stations; Marvel Comics; Genesis Enter-
        New TV

```

```
     company), and let them retain control over their company.
    Why would Ron Perelman make such a small deal, in com-
     parison to his other interests, and give them such a good deal?
     He must believe that the synergy between Guthy-Renker and
     his other interests is so great, and that the potential for grow-
     ing Guthy-Renker is so great, that just by adding his resources
     to the mix, the value of Guthy-Renker and his piece of Guthy-
     Renker will massively multiply.
      A lot of what went on in making this deal was, from
     Guthy-Renker’s side, ‘‘Look at everything we’ve done, but
     here’s what we could do if we had .. .’’ and from Perelman’s
     side, ‘‘What they’ve done is good, but imagine what they
     could do if they had a, b, c, d, and e, and we’ ve got all that.”’
    3. Attract suitors, don’t seek them. There are certain business
     situations where proactive, very aggressive action perversely
     works against you more often than not. In my business, sell-
     ing consulting and speaking services, you have to learn how
     to attract clients, because if you go right at them, they run
     away. The same thing’s true in finding buyers or major in-
     vestors for your business. If you go after them, you’ll prob- .
     ably drive them away or, at the very least, you’ll diminish
     the price you'll be able to negotiate and get.
       Capitalizing on having the first retail fitness product store
     in Canada, Harv did everything he could to create massive
     amounts of publicity for his company. He also invested in
     creating a corporate image that made his business appear big-
     ger and more sophisticated than it actually was. He deliber-
     ately assembled elements likely to be attractive to a big
     corporate buyer or investor. He carefully constructed a giant
     magnet and let it attract. ;
      When I look at Guthy-Renker’s deal with Ron Perelman,
     I see the payoff of several years of substantial investment in
     public relations and publicity that served no direct purpose as
      it was being done. To a much greater degree than the owners
     and leaders of the other companies in the infomercial indus-
      try, Greg Renker sought out and welcomed opportunities to

```

```
  nal. He employed a professional publicist. He frequently gen-
  erated news releases. He got a lot of ‘‘spotlight time’’ as the
  organizer of this young industry’s trade association, the Na-
  tional Infomercial Marketing Association.
    Also, at the expense of certain and quick profits, Greg and
  Bill passed on infomercial projects likely to create negative
  publicity and regulatory agency interference. While other in-
  fomercial companies got hit with FTC, FDA, and state attor-
  ney generals’ actions and adverse publicity over some of their
  most successful but arguably sleazy shows, Guthy-Renker
  took a higher road, a more conservative approach, and in-
  vested heavily in thorough documentation of advertising
  claims made in their shows, and served as the primary force
  raising the production standards of the entire industry. There
  is no doubt they could have pulled greater short-term cash
  profits out of the business with a different approach. But just ~
  like Harv Eker learned, bottom-line income is not the most
  important factor in attracting favorable attention from much
  larger corporate entities.
   . Be patient. If you are going to design and develop a business
  with the intent of selling it in order to walk away a millionaire
  or better, I think you have to plan on a five- to ten-year time
  frame. Harv Eker got there in just shy of five years, Guthy-
  Renker in about seven. And as I look at similar examples, I
  see that five- to ten-year time frame appearing consistently.
    It also took Harv about a year to get from Heinz’s deci-
  sion to a done deal. And that required considerable patience!
  But most big corporations cannot and do not move with the
  speed the small entrepreneur is accustomed to. Most multi-
  million-dollar deals will take months to get done, and will
 come apart and be put back together a couple of times along
  the way.
  . Ignore conventional evaluations of what your business is
  worth. ‘‘My accountant,’’ Harv Eker said, ‘‘told me that the
  maximum my company was worth was $400,000.’’ Harv got
  $1.6 million. The accountant’s assessment will always be

     textbook correct. But it is not the way to walk away wealthy.
     And, contrary to all the textbooks in the world, it is not the
     way big deals are done in the real world.
       In the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Paul
     Newman is ridiculed for riding a bicycle and talking about
     the modes of transportation of the future. His character says,
     ‘‘The whole world’s looking at things through bifocals while
     I’m lookin’ through binoculars.’’ Accountants use bifocals.
     You need to get your buyer looking through binoculars.
      ‘‘That vision thing,’’ as President Bush used to say, is very
     important.
    6. Start by asking for a lot more than you want. Actually, many
     smart negotiators believe in forcing the buyer to make an
     offer without first naming their price. Harv told me, ‘‘Ignor-
     ing the $400,000 my accountant told me about, I sat quietly
     and waited until the people at Heinz named a figure. It was
     $1 million. And I was ecstatic, but I calmly told them I wasn’t
     interested in selling unless it was so clearly worth my while
     that I couldn’t say no.’’ Harv then set his price at $2 million.
     They settled at $1.6 million.
       The most important thing that Harv did, though, was to
     create a bare minimum scenario below which he knew he
     would not go. ‘“‘There is no way,’’ Harv said, ‘‘that I was
     leaving that business unless I was an after-tax millionaire.’’
     In most cases, I believe in starting with a number double my
     acceptable price, and with a strong rationale for that doubled
     number.
      Earlier in this chapter I mentioned Gerardo Joffe. He started
    his first mail-order business, Haverhills, in 1966 and sold it in
    1971 to Time, Inc., for 18,000 shares of stock with a market
    value of $56.56 each. When he started Haverhills, he had no
    mail-order experience. He had a background as a mining engi-
    neer, no training or mentors in the field, little capital, and he
    was over forty years old at the time. He learned as he went along.
     One key thing he did, early on, was to lock in on the idea

```

```
walk away a millionaire. Like Harv Eker, his intent all along
was to create a salable million-dollar asset. In his book How You
Too Can Make at Least One Million Dollars in the Mail-Order
Business, he points out an advantage of developing a mail-order
business for sale. “‘By the very nature of the mail-order business,
you will create multimillions of advertising impressions. The
name of your firm, even if still on the modest level of $1 to 2
million in sales, will have large public recognition and will al-
most have become a household word. Those in charge of ac-
quisitions in major corporations will know about you and your
business. They will have formed a positive impression about
your business and will be predisposed toward acquiring it.”’
  When Gerardo Joffe sold Haverhills to Time, he admits to
being in negotiations with three other firms also interested in
buying Haverhills. Like Harv Eker, Gerardo Joffe constructed
the right kind of magnet, then he let it do its job of attracting
suitors. And you cannot chalk it up to luck. After his noncompete
agreements with Time expired, he started an almost identical
business, Hennikers, which he sold to another mail-order com-
pany in 1979. Later, he started and built a third similar company,
Russells, which he sold to an airline in 1982. He then purchased
the name Haverhills back from Time and started another com-
pany. There is a model here that you can follow.

   THE ULTIMATE MILLIONAIRE-
     MAKER STRATEGY
  lk this book, I’ve exposed more than 100 different categories,
     types, and applications of businesses useful in taking any good
    idea and turning it into a fortune, highlighting forty-five different
   Millionaire-Maker Strategies. Unfortunately, many people will
    read this book with bifocals and blinders on, hastily tuning out
    anything that doesn’t immediately seem directly and specifically
    relevant to their particular product, service, or business, as they
    see it at this moment. That’s a big mistake. If you’ve gone
   through this book quickly, saying ‘‘that doesn’t apply to me’’
    and ‘‘that certainly doesn’t apply to me,’’ my purpose here is
    to send you all the way back to the beginning with a new
    perspective.
    How an ‘“Ordinary,’’ Small Hotel Gift Shop
       Became a $5 Million-a- Year Business
     Bob Neumann became a hotel owner sort of by accident. In
    1985 Bob opened a small, specialized gift shop, Grizzly’s Gifts,
    in the lobby of the Anchorage Hotel. His family had been in
    retailing for years. He saw the transition of Alaska’s economy
    from oil to tourism, so opening a gift shop featuring Alaskan
    artifacts, crafts, gifts, and souvenirs was a natural evolutionary
    event.

 gift store, among the Eskimo-made knives and blankets, salmon,
 seal oil candles, and scenic postcards, a funny little item,
 **Canned Alaskan Earthquake,’’ became the star. (This is a clev-
 erly labeled can that grumbles and shakes when it is picked up,
 and rocks from side to side if picked up and quickly set back
 down.) People began writing in and calling in to buy more of
 these Earthquakes, and Bob responded by first advertising that
 product, and then developing a catalog to make follow-up sales
 to his lists of customers.
  Then a little crisis hit. Grizzly’s Gifts’ home, the Anchorage
 Hotel, was a famous landmark visited by most tourists coming
 through the city. In its heyday, the Anchorage had hosted the
 likes of Will Rogers, Walt Disney, and President Warren Har-
 ding. Unfortunately, the hotel had lost its luster. In fact, it had
become a run-down dog housing prostitutes and drug addicts. Its
 decline led to its going on the block. Bob was certain that anyone
buying it would want to get rid of the few stores housed there,
including his and his parents’. Finding another prime downtown
 location would be prohibitively expensive, if not impossible. So
he bought the hotel in 1988. He and his wife then invested
$250,000 and a lot of hard work in turning the fleabag into a
classy, European-style hotel. The result has made Grizzly’s Gifts
prosper wildly; the store has doubled in size and, during the
prime tourism summer months, employs forty-five people. The
mail-order business has grown from 5 percent to 15 percent of
all of Grizzly’s Gifts’ business, and its sales have jumped from
$200,000 in 1985 to nearly $5 million in 1994! And that doesn’t
include the hotel business, which is also a raging success.
  Admittedly more reactively than proactively, but nonetheless
courageously and effectively, Bob Neumann has utilized the ul-
timate Millionaire-Maker Strategy: synergy. By fitting three
businesses together in a synergistic manner, the whole is much
more valuable and successful than the sum total of the parts.
Synergy takes pieces and multiplies rather than just adding.

       Succeeding in the Success Business
            with Synergy
    By now, you have probably seen a Celebrating Excel-
   lence catalog. If you haven’t received one in the mail, you
  may have seen them bound into airline magazines. The Cele-
   brating Excellence catalogs, now called Successories, feature
   plaques, posters, paperweights, awards, notecards and statio-
   nery, and T-shirts all sporting motivational, inspirational, cus-
   tomer service-oriented or management axioms, and books, gift
   books, and cassettes. Many of these are upscale products. The
   posters, for example, are beautiful original photographs—called
   ‘‘Action Art Lithographs’’—that sell for as much as $69.95
   each.
    The original catalog operation started small, as an extension
  of a printing and graphics business based in Lombard, Illinois.
   Its owner, Mac Anderson, himself a devout believer in good old-
   fashioned positive thinking, used his graphics company’s capa-
   bilities to create the business’s first products. After seven years
   of building his catalog business, Mac opened his first Succes-
   sories Store, with the idea that it would act as a showroom,
   corporate headquarters, and base of operations for his outside
   salesforce calling on businesses in the Chicago area. But the foot .
   traffic, off-the-street sales at the 1,700-square-foot store were
   pleasantly surprising. In 1991, its first year, the store exceeded
   $700,000 in sales.
    Mac then opened three more company-owned stores, and
   quickly put the power of duplication to work through franchis-
   ing. Today he owns over 80 franchised stores in U.S. cities,
   rapidly growing toward his goal of 250, plus distributors in Aus-
   tralia, Holland, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South
   Africa. The stores benefit from constant, massive national ad-
   vertising of all the locations through the millions of catalogs
   mailed and distributed via airline magazines and gift catalogs
   during the year. And almost every store has an outside sales-
                         focusing
