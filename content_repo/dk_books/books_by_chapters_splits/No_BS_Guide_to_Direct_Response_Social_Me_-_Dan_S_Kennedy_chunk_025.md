When we went straight to cold traffic, our cost was $3.00 per webinar attendee, and our show-rate was 20%. When we changed this strategy to a micro-commitments plan, our opt-in decreased to $0.87 each and our show- rate jumped to over 50%.
 Even if you add in the $1.23 it takes for us to get someone on our email list, we are ahead of the game by using this formula.

###### • Marketers talk too much about themselves. Think about the
 pain points of the end user or the person you’re trying to reach. #NoBSsm

 • Your prospects don’t have time to figure out why they should
 buy from you. After all, that’s not their job. It’s yours. #NoBSsm

 • Before you go for the sale, start from a position of value with
 your target market. #NoBSsm

 • Raise your relevancy by offering great content to identify your
 target market, and only once they have been nurtured should you sell. #NoBSsm

 • Do not spend time trying to be everything to everyone. Focus
 your brand around your Unique Selling Proposition and target market. #NoBSsm

 • Your content should be 85% PBS and 15% QVC, meaning that
 you shouldn’t self-promote or sell more than 15% of the time. #NoBSsm

##### CHAPTER 13

### The Biggest Secret in

## Social Media Is Offline?

#### The Cost of Not Following Up

###### by Dan Kennedy

 “The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.”

—MARK TWAIN

###### Today, the death of “old” media and offline media is wildly and foolishly exaggerated. For a wide variety of businesses, newspapers, print magazines, merge-mail like Val-Pak, the new USPS’ Every Door Direct-Mail, printed catalogs, even the Yellow Pages directories not only continue to work, but provide improved and improving returns on investment.
 A local marketer utilizing FSI’s (Free Standing Inserts) in his city and suburban community newspapers consistently gets an 8:3 to as high as an 11:3 ROI from them. That means he gets $8 to $11 for every $3 spent. He cannot match that ROI from any online or social media, despite being smart about it. While his two chief competitors exited this “dead media,” he stayed and doubled his ROI.
 One of the media most often, and most vociferously, pronounced dead is the printed and mailed customer newsletter. Bloggers and social media experts love to conduct its funeral. They are dead wrong. Their opinions— and that’s all they are—are ignorant and dangerous.


-----

###### Personally, my business empire has not only been built with print newsletters as its foundation and a centerpiece around which everything else orbits, but they continue to be the chief reason my companies enjoy TCV (Total Customer Value) 2X to 20X above all our competitors (and yes, I know their numbers).
 Well over 50% of my high-value private clients rise up out of the newsletter subscriber base. It would cost me a fortune to find them otherwise. You might judge my business “unique;” however, my model has inspired literally thousands of people in a wide range of consumer and B2B categories to aggressively invest in their own print newsletters for their customers, clients, patients, or donors—and all report significant improvements in retention, ascension, frequency of purchase or patronage, and referrals. Many are in their 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 20th year of continuous use of their own print newsletters and wouldn’t stop their use of this “dead media” under any circumstance.
 One of the very best at it is Annette Fisher, founder and operator of Happy Trails Farm Animal Sanctuary, a thriving and growing animal rescue operation. I suggest you go to www.HappyTrailsFarm.org, look around, make a donation to get on the newsletter list, and treat each newsletter you receive by mail as a masterclass in session. The best B2B model is, unhumbly said, the one I created and still contribute to, obtainable at GKIC.com.
 Another demonstration of how very much alive the oft-pronounced dead print newsletter is can be found with Shaun Buck at NewsletterPro.com. Shaun’s company creates and produces semi-custom and custom customer/patient newsletters for dentists and orthodontists, day spas, specialty retailers, and other small businesses, and in total, mails more than 1.5 MILLION of these for his clients every year. It is expensive, in raw terms, for these businesses to print and mail such monthly newsletters. Shaun has a 98% retention rate year to year with these clients, and they can’t all be fools. They must be getting positive results. Shaun eats what he serves, too, and has grown his own businesses by 4,000% in a very short time by mailing newsletters. You’ll hear from him later in this chapter.
 So, in this age of digital media and proliferate social media, with abundant opportunities to post and distribute the same content you’d put into print newsletters or even the exact same newsletters free of

###### cost, why the devil are so many business owners still creating, producing, printing, and mailing real newsletters?
 Didn’t they get that memo from Al Gore? “Hey, look, I invented the internet!”
 Print newsletters arriving by mail, opened, physically handled, read, clipped from, saved, and shared have positive effects that cannot be replicated online.
 First, customers recognize and appreciate the fact that you are investing real money in communicating with them, providing information and entertainment, and expressing appreciation for them. This engages reciprocity, and for in-depth understanding of that, I recommend reading Robert Cialdini’s books.
 Second, consumers place a higher value on printed publications. One 2014 survey conducted by a major newsletter publisher I work with found that over 80% of respondents indicate they always read the print newsletters and magazines they subscribe to or receive free, regularly, from businesses they have relationships with. Those same respondents said they read ezines, blogs, and other digital media included in paid subscriptions only about 20% of the time. That’s a 400% differential. You can’t win if your output never gets read. Frankly, a whole lot of online communication is killed with the delete button and has no value placed on it whatsoever.
 Third, print newsletters have a much longer shelf life. It’s very common for me to hear from somebody just getting around to reading one of my newsletters sent months ago or even after revisiting an issue from years ago, then asking about products or services. How often do you think somebody settles into their comfy chair for an evening and reads email or blog posts from months ago?
 A client of mine who is a financial advisor and wealth manager recently had a new client bring him over $9 million to invest and manage, after being on a prospect list and receiving a client newsletter every month for five years. An article about teaching kids to respect wealth before they inherit it rang his bell. He read it in an issue of the newsletter four months after it had been sent. My client could have gotten nothing else from mailing his print newsletter to his entire list for those five years and still come out ahead financially from just this one client and the several referrals he’ll certainly obtain.

###### Fourth, print newsletters are a great place to profile, feature, showcase, and give recognition to customers, clients, or patients. It’s meaningful to people to see themselves in print. I get a lot of thank yous from the GKIC Members and my clients when I dispense atta-boys and recognition in newsletters. One of the grand masters at doing this, and driving referrals by doing it, is a long, longtime follower of mine, Dr. Gregg Nielsen, a chiropractor. You can find him at: http://thewaterfordchiro.com.
 Of course, none of this works if you commit the ultimate marketing sin —being boring. A great newsletter is never much about your basic deliverables, products, or services. It shouldn’t be technical. Look at what makes popular magazines thrive:

 •  Human interest stories. They can be about your own adventures,
 about your customers, and about celebrities that somehow relate to what you sell. The long-standing giant Reader’s Digest was built on and lives by its human-interest stories.
 •  New, unusual, and fascinating information. Information people are
 motivated to repeat to peers and friends, thereby supporting word-of- mouth advertising for you. It’s called a NEWS-letter for a reason; it’s supposed to contain news. If you want to see the most successful newsletters built of “many short bits” of fascinating and new information, look at the publications by Bottom Line Inc., notably Bottom Line Health (http://bottomlinehealth.com) and Bottom Line Personal (http://bottomlinepersonal.com). My friend, the late Marty Edelston, created this now-giant publishing company from a tabletop in his spare bedroom. The most successful topics that he made his bones with include “Foods Never to Eat on an Airplane” and “What Big Drug Companies Don’t Want You to Know About Cancer.”
 •  Opinion. Yes, care must be taken. But if you have a personal
 relationship with customers, and your personality is linked to your business or you operate in a business where trust and affinity matter, then people are interested in your philosophy, ideas, and opinions, and can be motivated by shared values.
 By the way, the best work on “being fascinating,” as a person, as a marketer, and with content, has been done by my friend and colleague

###### Sally Hogshead. Both her books are important reading. You can learn more at www.howtofascinate.com.
 •  Useful tips. “How to” relieve a sudden headache (from a
 chiropractor), remove pet stains from carpet (from a pet store or a carpet cleaner), ready your car for a long trip (from an auto service shop or an insurance agent), grow giant tomatoes (from a lawn care company), etc.

 You also want to incorporate limited but direct promotion, such as introduction of new products or services, lead generation offers of free information about a different specific product or service each month, and seasonal “preferred customer” offers.
 It is my firmest conviction, based on solid and overwhelming evidence, that nothing can “glue” customers to your business like a good print newsletter mailed to them frequently, on a regular schedule.
 You can, of course, link and integrate it with online and social media in many ways. Extensions of short “teaser” articles, videos, tools, contests, and surveys can be housed online and driven to by the print newsletters. Engagement, comments, and contest participation can occur on Facebook or other social media sites, pushed by the print newsletter and reported in the newsletter. The circular possibilities are endless. Addition, multiplication, and integration are all, as Martha Stewart says, very good things. But subtraction of the proven and reliable print newsletter from your media mix is just dumb.

#### Nurturing Prospects into Sales and Retaining
 Customers Through Newsletters

###### by Shaun Buck

 Side note from Kim: Why include a chapter about print newsletters in a book about social media? Because once you bring in a lead, your job is to do everything you can to nurture them into a customer and to have them keep buying from you for life. Dan shared earlier in this chapter, “So, in this age of digital media and proliferate social media, with abundant opportunities to post and distribute the

###### same content you’d put into print newsletters or even the exact same newsletters free of cost, why the devil are so many business owners still creating, producing, printing, and mailing real newsletters? Print newsletters arriving by mail, opened, physically handled, read, clipped from, saved, and shared have positive effects that cannot be replicated online.” Shaun Buck, president of The Newsletter Pro, www.TheNewsletterPro.com, is my go-to expert for newsletters and the no-brainer choice for this chapter, and on the following pages he does an excellent job of connecting the dots.

 A few months back, I was sitting in the audience of the largest internet marketing conference in the world when one of the main presenters took the stage and told us he was going to reveal the latest and greatest “new” thing in internet marketing during the next presentation. After a short 15-minute break, I, along with 3,000 or more other marketers, anxiously awaited the big reveal.
 The presenter took the stage once more and repeated his promise of letting us in on this big new idea. I opened my laptop, prepared to take notes, and after a few moments of monologuing, he dropped the bomb we had all been waiting for. “The biggest new thing in internet marketing,” he said, “is direct mail.” At first I wasn’t entirely sure I heard him correctly, but then, almost on cue, he repeated it. This time there was no mistake; at the world’s largest internet marketing conference, the main presenter had just told the audience that generating a new lead via social media and immediately taking that lead offline with direct mail was “the new big thing.”
 I couldn’t help but laugh to myself at the thought that offline marketing was considered “new.” After all, the United States Postal Service can trace its roots back to 1775! But for many of the marketers in the room, the new idea wasn’t offline marketing; it was generating a lead online and following up with that lead using offline media.

 The Case for Online Lead Generation with Offline Marketing How could offline marketing be considered a “new” idea? Offline marketing was around for decades, if not centuries, before online marketing


-----

###### was ever invented, so why did it seem like such a novel idea to so many of my fellow audience members?
 When it comes to online marketing, the idea of spending money on offline media after you have acquired a lead from social media can be hard to swallow; it could even feel a bit counterintuitive, but let’s look at the reality of the situation.
 Shortly after waking up each morning, you sit down at your computer and open your inbox—sound familiar? You’re instantly flooded with dozens of new messages ranging from spam to special offers to important memos. (Isn’t it a good thing our computers no longer say “You’ve Got Mail” every time we get a new email?) The first thing you do is search for any and all emails you can instantly delete without ever having to open them, in hopes that you can get your number of emails down to a manageable level.
 As a business owner, here are a few email stats you need to know:

 • The average commercial email deliverability rate is just 67%.
 • 55% of all emails are spam.[1]
 • The average open rate is 9%.
 • The average time spent reading each email is 3 seconds.
 • According to Lifewire, the average person gets 121 emails a day.

 According to the United States Postal Service 2018 fact sheet, the average delivery point (household, business, P.O. box, etc.) only receives 4.24 pieces of mail in their mailbox each day. Compared to the average 121 emails hitting inboxes per day, you are marketing in a vacuum with direct mail.
 Can you imagine 121 pieces of mail showing up in your mailbox each morning? If they were all checks, it would be cause for a celebration! But if they were bills, commercial mailers, or advertisements, you would likely start to dread going out to the mailbox each day.
 I’m not suggesting that you shouldn’t use email in following up with your newly acquired leads or that you shouldn’t continue to optimize them through social media, but I am saying digital marketing alone is leaving a massive amount of money on the table. Let’s look at how complementing your current email efforts with a prospect-nurturing campaign can drastically increase sales.

###### The Path to More Customers How long do you follow up with someone who inquires about your product or service after the initial inquiry? If you’re like most businesses, it’s not long.
 The following stories illustrate the importance of the follow-up.

 FIRST STORY My company, The Newsletter Pro, is a print newsletter company that specializes in custom content and design. Our average clients range from $1 million to $100 million in annual revenue. One of the many ways we generate new leads is by exhibiting at trade shows, but it’s not always easy to find a trade show that fits in with our average client. On the rare occasion that I do come across the perfect show, I usually do anything I can to get us in.
 Most recently, I discovered one of those rare gems and immediately inquired about exhibiting. I had a good conversation with a salesperson and even received a follow-up email, promising more information to come, but that was over six weeks ago. I haven’t heard anything since. If it was like any other trade show, they probably had an exhibiting fee between $5,000 to $10,000—a fee we would have willingly paid. How much is the lack of follow-up costing this company?

 SECOND STORY I recently visited Disneyland with my oldest son, Brandon. I had Brandon when I was 16 years old, but at 18, he’s now the oldest of five boys. We were there for the first leg of a high school graduation trip I had promised him last spring, and in between riding Splash Mountain 20 times and eating a ton of Dole Whip, I convinced him to join me for a timeshare presentation put on by Disney Parks. I had sat in on one years ago and remember being blown away by the presentation. It was a really great learning experience, plus my wife and I had been considering buying a Disney timeshare (with four little guys running around, we spend a lot of time in Disney parks).
 From the moment the salesperson walked in the door, I knew this was not going to be the same presentation I had seen before. At 35 years old and accompanied by an 18-year-old kid, the salesperson immediately judged my
