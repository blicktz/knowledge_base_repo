###### classes, the workouts, even the media were all deliverables. The real business we were in was transformation.
 If you put this book down right now, travel to your closest Iron Tribe, and start talking to member athletes, I am confident you’ll consistently hear about their personal transformations, which have gone far beyond the physical fitness results they signed up for in the first place.
 Instead, these transformations are filled with feel-good stories about improved marriages, fatherhoods, friendships, careers, and so many other tales of what I tagged as “LIFE. Changed.”
 At Iron Tribe, we are continuously transforming lives, and the social proof of this lies inside these real stories of “LIFE. Changed.” that our direct-response formula has continuously leveraged to generate leads. Meanwhile, our brand-based marketing utilizes this social proof to build the allegiance that each member athlete has toward the Iron Tribe logo.
 Don’t get confused. The experiments of incorporating “LIFE. Changed.” into our direct-response lead-generation marketing has not so much increased external prospect response as much as it’s “puffed up the chests” of our internal member athletes. It’s cost us time and money, with months of lower ROI success at the beginning, but in the end it’s expedited our brand-building aspirations.
 We have learned several ways to cage this brand-centric marketing beast, which can truly be a blessing and a curse.
 First, we tell our franchise owners that it’s only something to roll out after they’ve reached membership capacity at a minimum of one of the Iron Tribe gyms in their market, since they’ll have no member athletes to highlight or make proud of the advertising when they first open up.
 You HAVE to HAVE clients before you ever think of marketing the brand. Earn your logo some respect! This applies, in my mind, to any and every business. It can be quick, but there is a sequential process required before you get to full-on, simultaneous use of brand with direct-response everywhere, all the time. If you are already there but struggling, you may need to stop, back up, go back to the beginning, and restart your business just as we started the first Iron Tribe and still start each new geographic area.
 Second, you have to be willing to allot the cost of this message as something that will just pay for itself (i.e., at least a 100% ROI) versus a


-----

###### direct-response message that could return as much as 300%. You’re not doing it to directly build membership, but more as an initiative that will maintain it. However, when you revisit the stat of 1.3 referrals and more than one contract renewal per member athlete, it’s safe to tell yourself that this test has been an overall success. Similar benchmark statistics or numbers are needed in your business.
 Change your goals a bit, and understand that while your black-and- white objective ROI goals are still important, you also need to gauge the subjective feelings of your clientele with these brand-centric campaigns. Having conversations with them and even running surveys are ways to quantify this aspect a bit further.
 The neatest part of the campaign is the systematized capability to customize it to each respective member athlete’s story in a way each can have their very own “LIFE. Changed.” tale that lives not only in external advertising but also in our segmented prospect mail and email nurturing sequences. And, of course, these stories now have their own section in our online medias on the iPhone app and website.
 One of my favorite stories is of a female member athlete named Erin, who came into our second-ever Iron Tribe gym as a cancer patient looking for more energy and confidence while deep in her battle with chemotherapy. During her initial year of athlete membership at Iron Tribe, Erin’s attitude was fearless in her eventual victory over cancer, which she tells in her “LIFE. Changed.” story entitled “LIFE. Conquered.” Each story has a customized “LIFE. Changed.” sub-tagline word, describing each personal transformation. (See Figure 8.1 on page 74.)
 This has become a powerful testimonial portal that can be leveraged in all forms of online and offline media.
 We’ve even built a customized prospect segmenting system that allows us to customize the types of mail and email content prospects receive, including which “LIFE. Changed.” stories they can read, watch, and connect to our brand even more because of the personal alignment they’ll feel with the story they’re reading. You can see it online at www.IronTribeFranchise.com/NoBS.
 Externally, we’ve began to tell these stories of “LIFE. Changed.” in print and digital SEM medias, amongst others, and then utilize detailed calls to action allowing people to continue on to a specific URL where they can

###### watch Erin tell an expanded version of her story. This allows us to track response and conversion, ensuring that this branded campaign still has direct-response quantification fundamentals embedded inside its DNA.

Figure 8.1: **DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: This approach worked out by Jim for**
Iron Tribe is frankly fraught with peril but is just about the best you could do when merging
and integrating and cross-breeding direct response with a brand message in external, public
advertising. Breeding these two advertising disciplines is like porcupines breeding—they do it
very carefully. You will see that they have removed the hard-core A or B direct-response offer
(i.e., call for appointment now or download or ask for this free report now) with a softer, less
urgent invitation to go see the testimonial’s story online—and there they return to specific
offers. Candidly, this makes me nervous. But I congratulate them on stopping short of too far,
of too much sacrifice. Just do not miss Jim’s point that this has to occur at the right time in a
business’s development. It is essentially a luxury affordable only at a certain level of sales and
profits.


-----

###### While the lead-generation results of “LIFE. Changed.” are not as high as the pure direct-response content that we continue to pump out externally at an average of 300% or better, the pride factor established amongst our clients has been priceless.

##### A Different Kind of Lead Generation

###### Lead generation or prospect attraction by paid advertising is one thing, and has its own measurements and ROI. But there’s rarely a better customer than a referred customer. By accepting less impressive ROI from this brand- oriented campaign than other direct-response campaigns, we invested in a different kind of lead generation: referrals.
 The pride factor became a referral tool that has taken our already sky- high referral rate to another level. It was actually a product of conversation on a private client day with Dan Kennedy, where we all had a realization that even though our clients are evangelists, they don’t really have a bible or tracts to hand out to their friends that they want to recruit to their local tribe.
 Think about it. We do these high-intensity workouts and charge an average of more than $250.00 per month for membership in this tribe. So our clients’ average descriptions end up unintentionally sounding something like “Hey, you need to really consider joining Iron Tribe, where the workouts are so extremely difficult that I’m always sore, and it costs about $300.00 per month.”
 Not such a good elevator pitch! However, when we started putting the “LIFE. Changed.” stories in their hands, it eased the effort of getting their friends to come to one of our Bring-A-Friend Day events, where they can do a partner workout with their friend, and then sign ‘em up to join the tribe.
 The private client meeting led us to provide our member athletes with better tools for referrals and better training for them to do so. Dan also made sure he emphasized the fact that we should “reward them for the behavior,” meaning that whether or not the referral they give us actually converts into a new member athlete, the referrer should be rewarded for trying in the first place.


-----

###### And reward them with something outside of the brand, not free product or membership. This led us to providing referrers with VIP experiences such as dinners at the finest restaurants in town and gear from their favorite clothing brands.
 The idea of equipping and training our member athletes to refer actually led to an entire box, engineered with an Apple-like look and feel and composed of “LIFE. Changed.” resources for them to give to their friends, free sample nutritional products for them to taste, free merchandise for them to wear in their workouts, a protein shaker bottle, bumper stickers, and a even a blank slate for them to begin writing their “LIFE. Changed.” story as well.
 Of course, all of these things are branded with our colors, logos, and overall look, knowing that we are literally teaching our clients from Day One to help us grow the tribe.

 Dan likes to refer to these strategies, and the referral results that come with them, as having created a “cult following.” But as Forrest mentioned earlier, we prefer to use the word “tribe,” as it fits so perfectly within the context of our name and what we really are.
 Just recently, the ultimate branding validation occurred when one of our franchisees had the Iron Tribe logo tattooed on his shoulder. (See Figure 8.2 on page 78.)
 When we saw his picture posted and spread all over Facebook, I looked at Forrest and said, “I think it’s safe to say that this branding ROI is the equivalent to our 300% direct-response ROI!”

#### CHAPTER 9


## A Powerful Brand Needs
 the Power to Implement

###### by Jim Cavale


###### great brand is built, sustained, and supported by communication, marketing, and direct-response marketing. That’s the most fundamental premise of Iron Tribe. We have to be able to

# A

###### communicate our brand massage to our members and to the world in ways that can be efficiently managed and accurately tracked and evaluated for ROI.
 We were at our first ever GKIC SuperConference in Chicago (2011), when Forrest and I heard about this CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software called Infusionsoft. Already frustrated with our CRM system and the client scheduling and billings software we were using to run our then two gyms, we knew we needed a technological solution that


-----

###### was more congruent with the high-level client experience we were planning to scale.
 Our desire was to build an entire platform that I named The Bay Door (since we have a signature roll-up bay door in just about every Iron Tribe gym), which I was hoping to provide each franchisee as a “soup-to-nuts” platform with two user interfaces (UI). The vision was for one set of client UI’s (website, in-store iPad app for product purchasing, and an iPhone app) and one UI for staff (to run their Iron Tribe gym in all capacities). The goal was to automate as many activities as possible while making anything done manually much easier.
 My previous business was a 2008 tech startup where I was constantly overseeing developers, and I had learned enough to know that you can build anything you want—if you have detailed specifications mapped out, lots of cash, and some serious patience. However, without these things, you’re in for a run you may not be able to sustain or outlast. Many have tried. Most have failed.
 As we “spec’d out” the project, several development firms were quoting the project to cost as much as seven figures! There wasn’t one firm who thought the project would cost less than six figures.
 However, there was a group of Iron Tribe member athletes who saw the same potential that I did, and we came together to produce something pretty special for a brand as young as ours, for a much lower front-end investment with invaluable back-end prosperity opportunities for everyone involved.
 The big idea for The Bay Door was simple. Create an Iron Tribe- specific Application Program Interface (API) hub that could leverage pre- built intranet (Google Apps and Yammer) and CRM (Infusionsoft) technologies to integrate with a custom-built client experience engine.
 All that means is that cloud-based “software as a service” (SaaS) platforms like Google Apps, Yammer, and Infusionsoft have created API plug-ins that allow you to “pipe it in” to your own custom software and essentially leverage their functionalities to look and feel like your brand.
 As simple as it sounds, it can become very complex. As this build began, I also began to test and integrate Infusionsoft into our then two gyms. The process of integrating it into those gyms was an amazing education process for Forrest and me. It forced us to look at the entire sales, marketing, and operations life cycle that each client experiences on the


-----

###### front end, and then systematize it in a way for our staff to monitor and act on in the back end, unless that action can be automated, in which case you just DO NOTHING!
 I coined the sales, marketing, and operations life cycle as The Perfect Athlete Life Cycle, and to this day, we are continuing to develop it more and more with automated and manual, external and internal marketing strategies. (See Figures 9.1A and B.)

**FIGURE 9.1A: Iron Tribe Fitness Client Management**

**FIGURE 9.1B: Iron Tribe Perfect Athlete Life Cycle**


-----

###### While our developers began working away at the first version of The Bay Door technology, our Infusionsoft experiment was bearing a great deal of fruit. Our gym-specific Infusionsoft dashboards were keeping management much more organized about where each contact from their list was in respect to The Perfect Athlete Life Cycle stages, which was cuing gym staff to utilize specific systems that encourage acquisition and retention of member athletes.
 In addition to this, a great deal of prospect nurturing and client on-ramp automation was in place to take the onus off of each gym’s staff, but still ensure that Iron Tribe engagement was being established and maintained for each contact in our database, no matter which stage of The Perfect Athlete Life Cycle they were in.
 However, as helpful as these two preceding results were, the biggest result was the fact that we went from 83% of our leads “raising their hands of interest” offline in 2011 (phone calls and walk-ins) to 78% of them coming in through the internet (Infusionsoft web forms) in 2012!
 This is the ultimate story of marketing becoming “sales in print.” Infusionsoft changed our entire conversion system and the rate at which we were converting prospects into new member athletes.
 Because the majority of our prospects were being sent to the web, whether it was a direct-response ad or a referral, they were becoming educated with the “LIFE. Changed.” stories both on the website itself and,


-----

###### once they filled out a web form, via automated follow-up mail and email sequences.

### Dan Kennedy endorses Infusionsoft, and GKIC and many of

##### his clients’ business’s direct marketing, “no-fail” follow-up marketing, and CRM functions are powered by Infusionsoft. You can learn more and get an online demo of Infusionsoft at www.Infusionsoft.com. Many, many businesses, incidentally,
 utilize Infusionsoft “off the shelf” with no customization or
 integration into other platforms. Infusionsoft also provides marketing templates created by Dan Kennedy. A convenient place to meet with Infusionsoft representatives, learn about it,
 and meet and talk with users is the annual GKIC SuperConference[SM] or annual GKIC Info-SUMMIT[SM], to
 which you will automatically receive invitations if taking advantage of the FREE OFFER FROM DAN on page 261.


###### So instead of hearing about Iron Tribe and then calling or walking in to speak to a salesperson, prospects were getting educated about us on demand and on their terms, before the person-to-person sales process ever began.
 Once they were convinced of Iron Tribe’s validity to transform them from the marketing process, they were cued to call and set up a consultation at the gym closest to them.
 The result was a whopping 96% close rate at the consultation table because they come in presold to join the tribe!
