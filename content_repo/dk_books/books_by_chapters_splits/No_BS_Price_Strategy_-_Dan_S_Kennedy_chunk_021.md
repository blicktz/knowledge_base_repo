And so it is in the overwhelming majority of situations. Of course, I’m not suggesting that you
are the equal of a lady of the evening plying your trade at the bar, although, with Sydney Biddle
Barrows, once the infamous “Mayflower Madam,” I did co-author a sales book, Uncensored Sales
_Strategies, which I suggest as an eye-opening read. But don’t take offense. Take the very valuable_
lesson. In the above situation, price matters little. If we moved the example out onto a street corner,
with street hooker and guy in a car, price might very well govern the sale. Thus, place and buyer
**have an impact on both price and its impact on buying decision, so you want to present**
**yourself in a good place to good buyers. Then, price’s importance is dwarfed by proposition.**
And here’s the biggie: you probably can’t actually control all your competition, restrict all your
costs, and muster sufficient efficiencies in order to always, profitably offer the cheapest price. But
you are in total control of the strength of your proposition.

## Five Kinds of Propositions

There are five kinds of propositions to concern yourself with:

1. Unique Selling Proposition (USP). Your Unique Selling Proposition can be found in the
answer to my copyright-protected question: _why should I, your prospect, choose to do_
_business with you vs. any and every other option available? You need a continuing USP_
for your business and, often, additional USPs for different products, services, offers. In a
sense, this is a concise summary of your positioning. It’s best if it telegraphs benefits. You
can review a detailed presentation about USP in my book, The Ultimate Marketing Plan.
Implicit in your USP, from a price strategy standpoint, should be the answer to a second
question: why should I, your prospect, choose you regardless of price, be unconcerned
_about price, and never consider comparison shopping based on price?_

## 5 Propositions

1. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
2. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
3. Irresistible Offer
4. Unique Safety Proposition (USP)
5. Unique Experience Proposition (UEP)

If you have solid answers to both those questions baked in to your primary sales
message, you have the foundation for aggressive pricing.
2. _Unique Value Proposition (UVP). This includes presentation of price, and_
justification/minimization of price by various means, including, when bundling, the higher
value of components if purchased separately; the value of the benefits to the user; money
to be made or saved through ownership of the product or use of the service. The best
value propositions find ways to make price a non-issue or to make the product pay for
itself. An example of the latter is the new, energy-efficient windows that pay for
themselves through lower electricity bills. The task is to make a believable case for value
far in excess of price.

Remember that value encompasses intangibles as well as tangibles. If you hire a
private VIP guide to escort you around at Disney World in Orlando, you still ride the
same rides, see the same shows, eat in the same restaurants, buy souvenirs in the
same shops as you would without the guide. There aren’t two different parks. The
core tangible remains the same. But the $195.00 an hour VIP guide delivers different
value to different customers. There’s status, showing off, and bragging rights; there’s
speed and convenience, so it’s less tiring and stressful, thus making the whole
excursion more enjoyable; there’s being able to do more in the time you’re there,
thus making the whole vacation more valuable. And so on. Don’t leave out all the
intangibles when you build your value proposition—or when you price.
3. _Irresistible Offer. Never forget: you_ _aren’t doing direct-response advertising or direct_
marketing unless you extend a specific offer. But a bland, vanilla, ordinary offer isn’t
much better than no offer at all. You have to ask yourself what your customers will find
irresistible. For example, we know from split tests that, when selling conferences to
doctors, free airfare and lodging is much more persuasive than a discount of equal value.
You have to know your own customers’ psyche. A complete I.O. will often include
discount, premiums/bonuses (plural), incentive for fast response, penalty for response
after a deadline.
4. _Unique Safety Proposition (USP). This usually revolves around a guarantee or_
guarantees, warranties, providing risk reversal or risk reversal-plus (e.g., _double your_
money back), and can be supported statistically—years in business, numbers served—and
with social or peer proof—testimonials, client lists. The greater the skepticism, the stakes,

-----

and/or the present resistance to spending, the stronger and more reassuring the Safety
Proposition needs to be. Sometimes, this can be the basis of its own profit center. I
recently bought a modestly priced piece of jewelry from a catalog. The catalog copy
included a 60-day “She’ll Love It Or Your Money Back” guarantee. When ordering on the
phone, I was also given a one-year replacement warranty—if the item got damaged, the
chain broke, the jewel dislodged, the surface scarred—they would replace it free. I was
upsold a two-year extension of the replacement warranty for “just $49.00 a year.” I’m
confident selling these $98.00 pieces of paper is more profitable than selling the $395.00
pieces of jewelry.

A lot of people are subconsciously if not consciously looking for safety, security,
and certainty in an unsafe, insecure, and uncertain world. The recent years’ chaos in
all major institutions—government, banking, rock-of-Gibraltar companies like
General Motors, the Catholic Church, etc., and in the economy, has left a lot of
people feeling very anxious. Just about everybody has also had plenty of experiences
where service after the sale is hard to come by, promises made before the sale
forgotten. Into this environment you come with your proposition. Making it feel very,
very safe to buy can be very compelling, and can support premium pricing.

I rack up some fat Fed-Ex bills, since I send most of my work for clients and a lot
of correspondence that way. I could save tens of thousands of dollars every year by
using UPS, USPS Priority Mail, and other alternate carriers. Why don’t I? Because
the security of knowing FedEx will get it there on time is worth more to me than the
difference in cost between them and lower priced competitors. Every time I fill out a
FedEx airbill, I’m buying a Safety Proposition.
5. _Unique Experience Proposition (UEP). This is the newest proposition on this list,_
acknowledging the reality of The New Economy as an Experience Economy, where
people most willingly buy and pay premiums for complete, total, enjoyable, and unusual
experiences. People want to be assured of a good experience when buying and from the
deliverable. Pay attention to the Experience Proposition put forth in TV commercials for
Norwegian and Carnival Cruise Lines, dining at Outback Steakhouse, or marketing I’ve
assisted with at [KennedysBarberClubs.com. None of these are restricted to or even put](http://kennedysbarberclubs.com/)
primary emphasis on the core products or services: the cruise, the steak, the shave ’n
haircut.

In the seminar and conference business, where I do a lot of work as a consultant, a copywriter,
and occasionally as a speaker, excellent, high-value educational content has gone from the thing
being sold to the minimum ante to even be in the game. To motivate attendance, a complete
experience has to be offered—which may include book signings with authors, meet’n greets and
photo opportunities with celebrities, field trips to interesting sites, contests and competitions, award
ceremonies, car and vacation giveaways, and more. At recent years’ Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s
Circle[™] annual Marketing and Moneymaking SuperConferences, we’ve featured celebrity speakers
including Gene Simmons of KISS, Ivanka Trump, and Joan Rivers; actors in super-hero costumes
roaming the exhibit area, taking posed photos with attendees; chair-massage therapists on duty; and
a VIP Lounge for a certain level of Members. A special seminar I did in conjunction with my No
_B.S. Wealth Attraction in The New Economy featured a pirate theme—pirate décor, pirate ship_
backdrop for photos, pirate hats and toys for attendees, plus an opportunity to be photographed with
Dean Martin’s Rolls-Royce (which I own), and a Night at the Races.

Ultimately, you will build a hybrid proposition, incorporating some or all of these five. For
clarity’s sake, you’ll want to lead with the one you think serves you and fits your target market best,
with the others hooked to it.

Maybe the most important thing about this for anyone inexperienced with direct marketing is that
**you begin thinking in terms of making propositions. Most business owners do not. Most merely**
advertise the existence of their business or products or services. Or its existence plus
features/benefits. Or existence plus products/prices, like car dealers’ or electronics stores’
advertisements do. These types of marketing messages are so common they encourage
commoditization and either focus on price, suggest price shopping, or fail altogether. There are very
few people who care that your business exists—beyond your spouse, ex-spouse getting alimony,
creditors, and possibly somebody who awakes that day with an emergent need for what you do and
is in hot pursuit of it. Likewise, for the features and benefits of your products. It takes more than
that to stir up interest. The making of a good proposition goes a long way.

-----

Even in hard core, down ’n dirty direct response advertising—the sale of a product in a twominute TV commercial ending with “call now”—there has to be a composite of factors properly
assembled for success. If you didn’t see or don’t remember the lessons from the TV show Pitchmen
that ran on the Discovery Channel, featuring behind-the-scenes making of the famous Billy Mays
commercials, I suggest obtaining and watching the DVDs. In the first episode, you are there when
the inventor of a new shoe insole arrives, a commercial is planned, script written, commercial
filmed and tested. You will see Billy and his partner figure out dramatic demonstrations for the
insole’s shock absorption: Billy pounding his hand, protected by the insole, with a hammer; a car
being driven over his hand, protected by the insole. The price is decided on, in part based on an
impromptu focus group of car mechanics trying out the product and being asked what they’d pay for
it, as well as competitive pricing in retail, and Billy May’s experience with products on TV. The
proposition is then built, to stack value far in excess of the price. All that is then combined into a
powerful, persuasive two-minute commercial that grabs attention, interests you in gel insoles even if
you had zero interest in them before the commercial began, delivers a USP, suggests a UEP, and
presents a UVP. A home run it is. Hundreds of thousands of pairs of the insoles have been sold
since, with that commercial.

Depending on what business you _think you are in—tax preparation or taxidermy, dentistry or_
detailing of autos, industrial chemicals or investments—you will quickly conclude the gel insoles
example has nothing to do with you. If you had a conversion here and realized you are actually in
the business of making compelling propositions, then you would find the gel insoles example
fascinating. And if you took that conversion seriously, and committed to learning all you can about
making propositions, and brought that to your business, you would find that selling at higher prices
and profit margins becomes infinitely easier.

## Avoiding Apples-Apples Comparisons

 Dan Kennedy

Two roadside vendors are situated right next to each other, both selling fresh-picked
apples from their orchards. Each has good parking under shade trees. Each has good,
visible signs. Each has several people there working so service is fast. Who will win the
day? Sadly, probably, the one who lowers his price below wherever the other stops.

**If you choose to conduct business in this kind of situation, frankly, there’s little Jason**
**or I can do to help you. Neither of us carries psychiatrist credentials.**

One year, I ordered a Valentine’s gift for my wife from a catalog sent to me by Calyx
Flowers. Even though, at the time, I owned stock in 1-800-Flowers and have, several
times, been a speaker on the same programs with 1-800-Flowers’ CEO, Jim McCann, I

-----

purchased a $199.95 gift from their competitor. My reasons are very instructive. First,
they sent me a catalog in the mail, while 1-800-Flowers relied on e-mail. I do not use email and I wasn’t planning to send flowers as that year’s gift, so I would not have proactively gone back to 1-800-Flowers to shop. The unsolicited catalog had a chance
because it arrived and snagged my attention. As Woody Allen famously said, a third of all
success is showing up. Of course, e-mail is a lot cheaper to send than full-color printed
catalogs (my thoughts about the handicap of bad economics are in Chapter 16).

## Unique Value Proposition in Action

The gift I bought from Calyx was a “bundle” of three gifts in matching red silk boxes,
delivered one per day, over three days, February 12, 13, and 14. Absent this creative offer,
I might have bought one gift, and spent less. They sold three. Many might have balked at
the bundle of three for $199.95 if delivered as one, but the delivery of the three gifts over
three days, building up to the finale on the 14th was unique—thus a distraction from price
and an added value. Ultimately, they took themselves out of clump of flowers to clump of
flowers, apples to apples comparison territory altogether by changing one little element:
delivery. The “bundling” of multiple items is a common way to try and boost transaction
size and make direct comparison difficult, and it alone should always be considered. But
Calyx went a clever step further.

Their marketing and price strategies wizards deserve applause. Unfortunately, their
implementation folks got demerits. The person taking my order over the phone was illinformed and inept, making me wish within minutes that I’d stuck with good old, reliable
1-800-Flowers. He actually said: “Gee, they just threw me on the phones and I’m not
really sure of what I’m doing.” It took a l-o-n-g 20 minutes to get this order done and, yes,
I should have bailed out but by then, dammit, I wanted this thing. Also, no attempt at an
upsell. No query about a second gift for daughter, sister, mother, mistress. Sad thing is, the
$199.95 thing could just as easily be $229.00, and the extra money invested in better
phone scripts, personnel, training, coaching, and supervision.
(Again, see Chapter 16.) My advice: Don’t strive to sell your stuff as cheaply as you can;
strive to sell it as effectively as you can, and price to support whatever is required to do
that.

By the way, I’ve never ordered from Calyx again—despite receiving countless catalogs. I
have returned to 1-800-Flowers.

Nevertheless, Calyx’s marketing and price strategy is brilliant. It perfectly illustrates the
power of One Little Thing Changed, in getting you out of the apples to apples comparison
territory. This must be your goal: escape apples to apples. Searching for your One Little
Thing is a very big thing.

## CHAPTER 14

 The Place Strategy That Easily and Automatically Supports Premium Prices

 Dan Kennedy

**America divides into niches and subcultures. Every individual belongs to at least one of each, but**
most belong to several of each. Understanding how that niche or subculture membership and
affinity stretches the price elasticity of just about all goods and services can put a great deal of
otherwise lost money into your bank account. With bravado but no reluctance, I’ll promise that this
chapter alone can be worth millions of dollars to you over the remainder of your time in business,
and could provide a dramatic, fast income improvement.

Simplistically, niches are occupational and vocational; subcultures are by interest, belief, activity.
So, insurance salespeople a niche, deer hunters a subculture. Most divide into sub-niches and subsubcultures, as do these. There are life insurance salespeople, property and casualty insurance
salespeople, specialized property and casualty—such as those serving only farmers or only
construction companies, or those insuring collector cars and rare art works. There are deer hunters
who use only bow and arrow, who hunt only in the Midwest. Most people have very strong
identification with and affinity to whatever niches, sub-niches, subcultures, and sub-subcultures they
belong to. They tend to buy a lot of things somehow linked to those niches and subcultures. In fact,
it rarely takes a Sherlock Holmes to wander around someone’s office or home and, by the objects on
display, detect what niches and subcultures the person is part of. In my large home office and
library, for example, you will find a plethora of Disney books, collectibles, and memorabilia;
advertising books, collectibles, antiques; harness racing photographs, paintings, objects; more than
50 clocks, many unusual; a small collection of rare or first edition books all in the success
philosophy genre. In my garages, three classic cars. This provides hints of four subcultures and one
niche to which I belong or self-identify. And to all that you say: so what?
