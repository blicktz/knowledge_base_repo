and your clients won't tolerate it. Pfui. It's not like I'm the president or the pope or J-Lo or anybody like that. I'm basically a selfglorified salesman. I've simply done the following three things
anyone can do:

1. Decided.
2. Deliberately positioned and marketed myself in a manner
conducive to controlling and limiting access.
3. Trained clientele. And they are trainable. When I was a
kid, I had litter-box trained pet rabbits that hopped back to
their cage to go to the bathroom. I once had a racehorse
trained to walk down the barn aisle and turn off the light
switches with his mouth. If you can teach a bunny rabbit
to go back to his cage to drop doody or a horse to flip light
switches, you can train humans to respect you and your
time and operate within a few simple rules.

You may or may not want to be as tough as I am. You may
not even want to be as tough as many of my clients and Inner
Circle Members who've adopted modified versions of my
approach. But I will bet you the biggest steak in Texas that you
_can benefit from a tougher screening process than you have now._
Think about it.

###### Fix the Fax
Next, we've got to gain control over and productively use the fax
machine. Now let me start by telling you that I'm not the world's
greatest fan of technology. But I really love the fax machine. I
think the fax machine is terrific. It's just about my favorite "appliance." (I have no earthly idea how the darned thing works, by
the way. It's amazing to me: I stick in a document in Phoenix,

push a button, and a fax machine in New Zealand spits it out
minutes later. And I thought the self-stick tab on the FedEx envelope was high tech!) Anyway, there are two really good ways to
use this magic box to enhance your personal productivity. But, before

I tell you about those, let's tackle "the dark side" of this thing—and

yes, the fax machine definitely has a "dark side,"
which I hate.

**_The Dark Side of Instant Communication_**
Here's the problem. People who send you faxes think that they've
instantly communicated with you and that they should get an immediate

response from you. Incredibly, they have this illusion
that faxing a document is exactly the same as plunking it into your
hands. I guess you're supposed to be sitting there, right next to the
fax, watching and waiting. Or that when a fax arrives, everybody's
supposed to drop what they are doing, snatch up that fax, burst into

your office, interrupt your meeting with the president or the
pope, and make you read that fax right now. This attitude was at
its worst when faxes were new, but it's still prevalent.

This was and occasionally still is a big problem for me. On a
typical day, there will be 20 to 30 to 50 "overnight faxes" waiting,
and, during the day, another 20,30, or more will come zipping in.
And remember, I'm not there anyway. So, my beleaguered staff
person takes care of the ones she can. The rest get separated into
those she judges to be urgent, which get forwarded to me by fax,
and those she believes can wait to go in with my week's mail.
Even when I was around, I refused to let people pressure me by
faxing, I refused to have my day's plan disrupted by faxes, I
refused to be controlled by someone else's priorities. So, we have
to educate clients about all this.

Since I first penned those above paragraphs about fax, we've
added e-mail. Well, I haven't; I won't use that any more than I'll
use a cell phone. But you've added e-mail. Everything I just said
about faxes goes quadruple for e-mail. Listen up: you are not
obligated to respond to inbound e-mail instantly, quickly, or
ever. I don't need to tell you that if you don't stick a cork in this
widening hole, you'll drown trying to handle e-mail. Get tough
or die.

With each easier, faster means of communicating, the quantity
of dumb, junk communication has multiplied. Because sending
an e-mail is so easy and doesn't even require the labor of walking over to the fax machine, people send e-mails any time they
have a brain fart. One consultant friend of mine was getting 8 to
20 different, separate e-mails each day from one of his clients—
each time the client had a thought or question, zap went the e-mail.

In the corporate environment, the individual e-mails have
become another Time Vampire trick, a less laborious equivalent
of just popping in, standing in the doorway, saying "Got just a
minute?"

Again, you may or may not want or need to mirror me. But
if you're like many people, and you jump up every time the fax
machine beeps, you can't possibly be productive. If somebody
runs in to your office every time a fax arrives for you, you're destined for low productivity. If you're checking your e-mail constantly, compulsively, or worse, if you're responding to messages
as they arrive—you're headed for an early grave.
For somebody in an office, I think a good system is to take the
hour after lunch to look at the morning's faxes, e-mails, and
phone calls, deal ONLY with those that are genuinely urgent, and
set the others aside. Then, take the last hour of the day to look at

**NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs ®** 33

the afternoon's accumulated incoming messages, quickly deal with

these most urgent and integrate all the rest into your next day's

plan. For road warriors, a strategy more like mine may be
appropriate.

For far too many people, the phone, the fax machine, e-mail, FedEx—heck,

for some people, the mail—invokes a Pavlovian, jump
up and instantly respond reaction. If it has never occurred
to you before, you ought to look at this now as weird behavior.
Who's in charge here anyway? Get a grip.

**_Finding Power in the Fax Mow,_**
back to ways to use the fax to enhance your productivity.
First of all, if you can train your clients, customers, associates,
vendors, and others to communicate with you by fax rather
than phone, that's a huge productivity advantage. It stops
phone tag. It reduces your return call burden. It gets information to you in a more organized way. Often, as people jot out
faxes they clarify their own thinking, even answer their own
questions. You can deal with these inbounds at your convenience, after hours, while traveling, whatever. When I come home—or

if traveling, when I arrive at my hotel—I'd much
rather have a stack of faxes than a stack of phone messages.
Have you ever gotten a phone message—"Call Bill as soon as
you can"—then not been able to reach him and had indigestion
after dinner and a sleepless night worrying about what Bill
wanted? If Bill had been trained to communicate with you
properly by fax, that just wouldn't happen.

Forcing faxes rather than e-mail will also be more productive
for you. I've looked at the e-mails people get and compared them
to the faxes I get. More thought goes into the faxes. People tend

to cluster multiple items into one fax vs. a stream of single item
e-mails. They are more inclined to resolve some things themselves when they must put them into a memo to be faxed than
when they can e-mail. The e-mail is more casual, and you really
don't want people feeling too casual about consuming your
time.

Come to your own conclusions about it all—fax, e-mail, cell.
But be the master, not the slave.

###### Set the Timer on the Bomb
If you do take an incoming call, when you get on the phone with
someone, it's a smart idea to set up the exit time first. For example, I'll often say:

_Tom, I have a conference call starting in just 15 minutes,_
_but I wanted to take your call—I_ _hope that will be enough time_
_for our discussion. Do you agree—or_ _should we set up another_
_telephone appointment?_

Tick, tick, tick.
When someone "drops in," and you decide to go ahead and
see them, then, when you bring them into your office, it's a smart
idea to set up the exit time first.

_Bob, it's difficult_ _these days for me to see drop-in visitors,_
_but it's good to see you. We'll only have half an hour, though,_
_but no longer, as I have an important conference call set for_
_4:00 P.M. That's OK, isn't it?_

Tick, tick, tick.
You may not win any awards for being sociable, but you'll
have shorter, more purposeful telephone conversations and
meetings. Drop-ins will gradually get the message. Callers will
gradually learn to call ahead and set up a phone appointment, or
at least, to prepare and be efficient when calling. I call this "setting the timer on the bomb." I even have a clock that looks just
like six sticks of dynamite wired together, with a timer on it, and
the timer has a flashing red light. This gets a lot of attention
plunked down in the center of the conference table. If you're not
going to do this physically, you at least want to do it verbally.

You see, most people will suck up about as much time as you let
_them. Salespeople feel productive and satisfied as long as they're_
talking with customers, and will even extend conversations with
a friendly customer as a means of avoiding the risk of confronting new prospects. Employees will dawdle in conversation;
it beats working! Conversations have a way of stretching to fill
whatever amount of time is available for them.

###### Be Busy and Be Obvious About It
Obviously busy people are interrupted less than unbusy people.
Just like burglars pass up some homes in favor of others, looking
for the easiest, safest targets, those who steal and suck up time by
interrupting others tend to cruise the office looking for the best
opportunity and the easiest target. If you are sitting at your desk,

comfortably, appearing relaxed, you're it. Of course, you might
be contemplating a formula for disarming a nuclear warhead,
but that won't matter, because it's not obvious.

When you are visible to others, it's best to be visibly busy.
