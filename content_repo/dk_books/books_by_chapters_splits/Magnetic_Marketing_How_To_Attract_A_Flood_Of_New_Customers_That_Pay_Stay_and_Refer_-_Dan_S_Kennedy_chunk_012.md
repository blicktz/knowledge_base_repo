Now you face a Decision that is entirely yours to make. The legendary attorney Gerry Spence almost always closed his ending speech to juries by telling an old, old parable about the wise man and the smart-aleck boy. The wise elder made himself available every Saturday for the villagers to line up and ask for his advice. The boy resented his authority, and developed a plan to humiliate “Mr. Know It All.” The boy captured a small bird and concealed it in his hands, and stood before the wise man and asked if the bird in his hands was alive? Or was it dead? If the wise man said “Alive,” the boy intended to quickly crush it to death and let it fall to the ground. If the wise man said “Dead,” the boy would open his hands and let it fly free. But the wise man proved truly wise with his answer: “Son, that bird is in
your
hands.”
