      When Should You Put Your
          Best Foot Forward?
  One day, an elderly woman came in to a small furniture
    store, apparently to escape the rainstorm outside. Several
    of the salesmen on the showroom floor ignored her, telling
   each other that she was not there to shop — just to get in
   out of the rain while waiting for the bus to come along.
   Talking to her would be a waste of time. So she was left
    to the newest, "greenesf salesman, a kid really, to take

   Carnegie, a Scottish immigrant, was America's first
    billionaire. As a major player in our Industrial Revolution,
   Carnegie made his fortune in steel and railroads.

   furnish the Camegie family castle back in Scotland, Mr.
   Carnegie's mother insisted that everything be purchased

  The point of the story, of course, is that you just never

  Some little job you do extremely well may bring you to the
   attention of a company president. A person you talk with,
   on or off the job, may surprise you and be someone
   important in your company or community. And on and on.
   So, when should you put your best foot fonA/ard? When
   should you present yourself in a way most likely to gain
   favorable attention? Every Wme. All the time.

          as a poor deprived ghetto
           girl who made good.
             I think of myself as
       somebody who, from
        an early age, knew I was
         responsible for myself,
       and I had to make good."

     (THE GUY IN THE MIRROR)
   When you get what you want in your struggle for self
     And the world makes you king for a day.
      Then go to the mirror and look at yourself
       And see what the guy has to say.
      For it isn't your mother, your father or wife
      Whose judgment on you must pass.
   The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life
         Is the guy staring back from the glass.
     He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest.
         For he's with you clean to the end;
     And you've passed your most dangerous
            and difficult test
            If the guy in the glass is your friend.
     You may be like Jack Homer and chisel a plum
      And think you are a wonderful guy.
      But the guy in the glass says you are a bum
           If you can't look him straight in the eye.
       You may fool the whole world [—]
        down the pathway of years
      And get pats on the back as you pass;
    But the final reward will be heartaches and tears
    IF YOU'VE CHEATED THE GUY IN THE GLASS.
                       - Anonymous.
