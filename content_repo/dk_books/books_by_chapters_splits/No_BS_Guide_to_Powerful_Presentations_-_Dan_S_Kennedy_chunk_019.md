###### To rise above the noise, you need to first know what noise exists. To do that, you need to get a clear understanding of communication history and how it plays into all interactions you have as a business owner, manager, and leader.

###### In Chapter 4 we’ll talk about how you can better understand the knowledge gap and how it impacts your sales conversations by looking at how others are listening to you. And in Chapters 7 and 8 we’ll look at some different education and empowerment strategies that you can use to rise above the noise.


##### Communication History

###### With each and every person with whom you interact, or with whom you may never interact, you have a communication history. Your communication history consists of all impressions, interactions, messages, information, applications, interactions, and perceptions that someone has or has seen or has experienced of you, your company, or your product/service. A communication history is already established before you get an email, phone call, or meeting—sometimes before you even get a hit on your website.
 Consumers are coming to your door armed with an arsenal of information. Likely, someone calling you for a sales discussion or product demo has already done multiple levels of research. In fact, more than 80 percent of consumers do online research prior to any purchase. What this means is that consumers are mining for information, and whatever they find becomes part of your communication history.
 The research that makes up the communication history between the potential consumer and the company is largely based on your digital footprint. Your website, social media channels, appearances and media outlets, consumer reviews, and mentions of your company all compose your digital footprint and your brand.
 Based on how you appear in all these channels, an expectation is already set in the potential customer’s mind. It’s important to understand what this impression is so you can adapt your communication appropriately and proactively take any steps you need to clean up any communication history they might have found (see Figure 1–1 on page 8).
 Think of these questions:


-----

###### What impressions, information, or experiences have other consumers
 had with your company? What digital footprint (your website, social media, review sites,
 blogs, media mentions, non-owned information) does your company and/or product have? What similar companies or services exist, and what perception does
 your desired consumer audience have of these?

###### Sources of Communication History for Your Potential Customer

 Communication is a two-way street. But not all communication is intentional. Your potential customers can be establishing a communication history with you that you really do not want. A negative online review, for example, will be weighing on the customer’s mind from the beginning of any conversation you have. That’s why it’s important to understand the communication history so you can address those concerns and alleviate any fears right off the bat.

###### Another way to address the elephant in the room (the negative review) is discussed in Chapter 19, when we dive into effective and efficient meetings.


###### Likewise, potential consumers will search for your employees prior to sales conversations or support conversations. Your employees’ social media presences and profiles, then, also form part of the communication history. How your employees portray themselves and their relationship to your company online also goes into the communication history, your company’s digital footprint, and the impression that potential customers have about your business, your people, your products, and your services.
 Here are some questions to ask so that you know what communication history patterns you’ve already established with a potential client before you get into the heart of a conversation:

 Is there something about our business that made you call us over a
 competitor? What have you heard about our business prior to this conversation? What do you feel we will be able to help you with? What products are you most interested in learning about? What goals do you have for our conversation today? How may I best be of assistance? Have you done any research on other options? Did you see any case studies on our website? If so, what interested
 you the most?

 All these questions will help you establish the communication history the prospective customer brings to the table. Knowing this, you can eliminate potential problems and get down to business.
 Turning a negative communication history around can take some time. And with each conversation, each consumer interaction, and each time the consumer interacts with your online brand identity, pieces are added to the big puzzle that is your communication history. This is one reason it is so important to take copious notes on your customer conversations, as it keeps

###### a track record of your communication history. This also makes a customer feel more loyal to the company and helps retain clients.
 This is also why customer relationship management (CRM) software is so popular. Aside from tracking the customer’s lifestyle, it allows you to keep a full record of the communication history in a database that can be accessible by anyone, so that when you’re unavailable the customer still remains top priority. Communication history is more than birthdays and spouse names. It’s more than product and order and support history. It’s the whole picture that allows you or anyone in your company to serve the customer at the best and highest possible level.
 Knowing as much of the communication history puzzle as you can will help you better serve the customer, meet their needs and expectations, and retain clients. It also impacts your greater communication strategy and allows you to be more proactive in all your consumer interactions. It allows you to rise above the noise and figure out how you may best empower and educate your potential consumer base, provide value, and leave dynamic impressions.

 In the next chapter we’ll talk about how you can manage a negative communication history and put people at ease by reducing any uncertainty that exists and being clearer in your messaging.
