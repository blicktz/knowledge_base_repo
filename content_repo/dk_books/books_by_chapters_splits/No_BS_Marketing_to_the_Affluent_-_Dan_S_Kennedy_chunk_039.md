Gatsby was amazing. He even managed to see to it that the book about him was regarded as a novel, fiction, as though he didn’t exist. Even Fitzgerald, by the time he was through writing it, believed he’d made the whole thing up. There were those who knew the truth all along, of course; knew everything except where all that money came from. (Even by today’s standards, when millions mean nothing, only billions matter, Gatsby was incomprehensibly rich.) Gatsby walked into rooms wearing a shirt with no collar. Even a little thing like that made people talk. And probably will still make them talk. The Gatsby shirt, of course, has no collar. Only a simple collar band. The placket is simpler also: narrower. (Gatsby had them made in France, originally.) The cotton we have used in our uncompromising replica of Gatsby’s shirt is so luminous, in and of itself, that even a person who notices nothing will notice something. Gatsby, of course, could afford stacks of these shirts;

##### rooms of them. Never mind. All that matters is that you have one, just one. A piece of how things were.

 An aspiration is being sold here, not a product. The overall aspiration is to be like Gatsby. To be different, iconic, and interesting, even a bit mysterious. The more specific aspiration is to be noticed and talked about. And in case you hadn’t noticed, affluent people like being noticed, and most go about that deliberately, whether very consciously or unconsciously.
 This copy also uses language that would usually be dumbed down for advertising purposes. These high-brow words are strategically chosen and used to convey a sense of superiority to the buyer. By involvement in dialogue at this level, the reader is being recognized as a more sophisticated, intellectual individual. To say it in a very unclassy way, its meaning is: You’re a classy fellow and we know it and this is for the classes, not the masses. They won’t even appreciate its description. With that in mind, I’ve boldfaced some more key words:

##### Finally, the end—all that matters is that you have one, just one— defies selling logic. The first impulse of most marketers is to encourage buying one of each of the four available colors, probably with a buy three, get one free offer. I confess it instantly occurred to me when I read the catalog page. Instead, this line dares to discourage buying more than one. In doing so, an air of exclusivity is conferred on the product, as might ordinarily be attached to a unique piece of jewelry, a classic car, or some collectible.
 Sample 2 sells a rather odd tweed vest for $199.00. Or does it? The entire scenario described here speaks to two aspirations of the affluent: importance and legacy. The thought of having fans and well-wishers and photos snapped of you is a very appealing fantasy for a great many people. I know it for fact; I have that experience, and I am constantly asked what it is like. Further, the idea of being the author of a book has strong importance and legacy appeal. My Members Bill and Steve Harrison, who conduct the Publicity Summit, publish Book Marketing Up-Date, and provide a range of services to authors very effectively use a story about people coming in large numbers from far away to a person’s funeral because they were influenced by his book. Again, as a much-published author, I can assure you, every successful person believes he has a profoundly interesting and important story to tell, a book within. All this to sell a vest! This is how your thinking about whatever you sell and do must change if you are to be effective with affluent clientele and rise to the top price or fee levels in your business category.
 As an aside, this copy reveals something about the age of the Peterman customers. The references to documentaries and to Churchill will be meaningful to those 50 and over, most meaningful to those 60 and over, and pretty much a disconnect for anyone under 40. For those in the last category, documentaries or news reels were shown in the movie theaters before every movie throughout the World War II era, and were very popular in early TV. Winston Churchill is, of course, famous, but you probably don’t know about the photo referred to unless you are of a certain age.
 Sample 3 sells a turtleneck sweater for $250.00, or $185.00 on sale. We can certainly find nice turtleneck sweaters for half that price in many stores and catalogs, But we can’t find copy like this anywhere else!


-----

##### First, there is aspirational identification. Here I’ve boldfaced the key references:

 New York Subway strike of the late ’70s. Bank presidents start wearing sneakers to work. JFK goes hatless at his inauguration. Good-bye hats. Steve McQueen, Sean Connery, Bill Holden discard ties in favor of turtlenecks. Some of it is progress. Now, marooned for a week in Paris or Osaka, this turtleneck sweater will keep you or me well dressed. Relaxed, but just a little dressy. (Both at the same time.) 55% silk, 45% cashmere. Pretty seductive stuff. Warm, but not heavy, not bulky. Beautifully detailed and finished. Sleek 7" high ribbed turtleneck. Set in sleeves. Good with blazers, old tweedy jackets, slacks, jeans. People expect to see a Walther PPK strapped over it, so you don’t even need to bother.

 As noted earlier, you need to be of a certain age. If you are, not only are the five iconic figures (the fifth is James Bond—not named, but we know his gun of choice) familiar to you, but they instantly conjure mental pictures, maybe even mental movies. They are the men women swooned over but men admired, not resented. Countless products and services are bought by consumers because of the “I Want to Be Like ________” factor, and even the most affluent consumers respond to such appeals.
 This copy also puts us into mental movies:

 New York Subway strike of the late ‘70s. Bank presidents start wearing sneakers to work. JFK goes hatless at his inauguration. Good-bye hats. Steve McQueen, Sean Connery, Bill Holden discard ties in favor of turtlenecks. Some of it is progress.

##### The reader can visualize himself in his turtleneck, at a Paris café … then catching the attention of a beautiful and mysterious woman. As a stand-in for James Bond, a dashing, romantic, fascinating figure. And who doesn’t want that?
 The temptation will be to presume none of this applies to you, because you do not sell shirts and sweaters; you are a dentist or financial planner or you own a landscaping company or even manufacture safety devices sold to and installed in food-processing plants. Resist this temptation! Commitment to talking about what you do or sell in factual, logical, straightforward, and thus dull and uninteresting language leaves you vulnerable to commoditization and price-based competition and bars you from ever becoming a subject of fascination among a target audience of affluent clients. Being boring and ordinary is a choice, not something forced on you by your particular business.
 This also goes far beyond your advertising. As a professional direct- response copywriter routinely commanding project fees for ads, direct-mail campaigns, websites, and the like upwards of $100,000.00 plus royalties, I have enormous appreciation and admiration for copy like the Peterman catalog examples dissected here. I spend many hours of every week surrounded by thesauri, swipe files, even novels, agonizing in search of precisely the perfect word or phrase or story to get a persuasive point across in print. But to confine this to print misses a greater opportunity and a more critical need.

 Out of the Mouths of … This approach does NOT apply just to words put into print. It applies equally to what you and your salespeople say verbally. Here, frankly, a toxic waste dump of sloppiness has occurred in most businesses. What comes out of the mouths of most people about their products and services is, bluntly, trash and slop. It is thoughtless. Uncrafted. Inconsistent. When captured via recording and transcribed and reviewed in print, it is humiliating. The affluent consumer is as repulsed by this as if the sales professional reeked of garlic, alcohol, sweat, and uncontrolled gas.
 I am consistently appalled at what I hear professionals, business owners, and sales professionals saying.

##### This gets to a view of selling as performance art. As such it is to be planned, scripted, physically choreographed, rehearsed, and ultimately performed. Most sales professionals unfortunately view the presentation as something that they should just be able to do.
 This also gets to the sales management and management decisions, if you employ salespeople or nonsalespeople who still have sales job functions, such as front-desk staff in a professional office. The question is whether you are going to tolerate sloppy, inconsistent, ineffective communication or you are going to design the most effective language and choreography possible and insist on its implementation. To help you make this important decision correctly, and act on it successfully, I suggest reading my book No B.S. Guide to Ruthless Management of People and Profits.

#### CHAPTER 28

### You Need to Choose Your Prices Carefully

##### “If you can actually count your money, you are not really a rich
 man.”

—J. PAUL GETTY

# One of the most interesting lines of copy I’ve seen aimed at the affluent
##### is: “Reassuringly Expensive.”
 Price Strategy is critical in successfully marketing to the affluent. In the first edition of this book, I devoted three chapters just to the subject of price, but even that was woefully inadequate, given the many opportunities to be had with thorough understanding of Price Strategy. Subsequently, I wrote an entire book on the subject, No B.S. Price Strategy, with a terrific


-----

##### co-author, Jason Marrs, a super-hero of sorts: The Man Who Competes at Premium Prices with Free! I strongly recommend you get a copy and study it. It is a perfect companion to this one.
 Before leaving the subject, I will make six important points: First, most marketers, service providers, merchants, and professionals horribly underestimate the amount of Price Elasticity that exists in their category of goods or services. That misunderstanding inflicts a myriad of evils. For one thing, it leaves a lot of money on the table unnecessarily, to no good end. Second, it sometimes raises skepticism or doubt in the minds of affluent customers who are not so eager for “a steal” that they don’t worry over a seemingly too-low price. Third, it creates timidity and weakness without cause.
 Second, when selling to customers more affluent than themselves, many marketers erroneously impose their own value judgments and price sensitivity on others who think very differently than they do. I frequently hear, “Well, I would never pay so much for that!” from clients objecting to the price strategies I recommend for them—and from skeptical clients stunned when they see how easily I raised their prices and profits without losing or repelling customers.
 Third, price is a complex matter containing many opportunities. Sometimes an income boost is as simple as just raising prices. All that was needed was courage. More often, though, there are less bald and overt ways to boost income by increasing average transaction size and average, overall customer value. This is why you need a complete course in Price Strategy, in the No B.S. Price Strategy book.
 Fourth, with affluent consumers, who you are selling to and who you are (perceived to be) to them has more to do with acceptance of prices than does what you are selling. This is a very difficult reality to grasp, then profit from, because most marketers are product-centric, and stuck there by deeply ingrained habit of thought. Adam Witty’s chapter on authority addresses this, as does, in depth, the book No B.S. Guide to Trust- Based Marketing.
 Fifth, how you sell—process—has as much or more to do with price acceptance as does what you are selling.
 These fourth and fifth points can both be seen in the case history included in the final section of this book, about Jones And Co. Styling


-----

##### Opticians.
 Finally, sixth, where you sell—place—has as much or more to do with price acceptance than does what you are selling. There is a different expectation of price and different sensitivity to price if standing in the meat section looking at steaks in Walmart, in an upscale supermarket, in a butcher shop, or in a catalog requested from a company like La Cense Beef.
 In short, price does not exist in a vacuum. It exists in context. You can control that context. Price Strategy does not operate separately either. It comingles with the context you create and control.

 Price, Profit, Power Survival of the fittest in exceptionally competitive market conditions or in difficult economic environments as well as maximum prosperity and greatest growth in good conditions reflects power—or weakness.
 There are many important kinds of business power. For example, the power to outspend competitors in acquiring new customers, even to the point of killing competitors off entirely, without going broke yourself. The power to use virtually every media, not just a few, with such frequency and perseverance that you are omnipresent and known to one and all as the leader. The power to so favorably impress, inspire, and richly satisfy a customer he wouldn’t leave you for love nor money, and can’t help but spread your legend to the world. All such power is directly related to and dependent on one thing …

 Profit The lower your profit margins, profit per transaction, and profit per customer factors are, the less power you have. And maximum profitability comes from one thing …

 Price Poor price strategies yield poor profits, which produces weakness and fragility.
 Fortunately, marketing to the affluent is a great empowerment for premium prices and excellent profits—but not automatically.

#### Book Three Summation

### There is a certain way to approach each different audience,
##### constituency, and market. There is no such thing as one-size-fits-all in effective marketing. You’ll see big, dumb companies pushing out big, broad, generic messages, but you should not emulate it. Even if it works —which, mostly, it doesn’t—it is entirely based on who will spend oceans of money to be known, a competition you can’t possibly win. You have to be much cleverer. In the just-concluded Book Three, a certain approach to making headway specifically with affluent consumers was laid out. It includes advantages you can make your own, that giant corporations can’t or won’t use.

 Six times a year, I continue this discussion of the certain approach in a newsletter, The No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent Letter, and the No B.S. Inner Circle team does so the alternating months with extension of Adam Witty’s chapter in The No B.S. Authority Marketing Letter, both included in Diamond-level Membership, at NoBSInnerCircle.com.

## Examples


### Book Four Preface: You Have to See It to
 Believe It

 I have often said that the instructions for assembling a kid’s bicycle are
##### important, but without the picture of what it’s supposed to look like on the box, you can get into a lot of trouble, or looking at all the pieces spread out on the floor along with a 48-step instruction booklet can make you feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness and despair!

 So I want you to see everything I and my co-authors have presented, implemented, and used, successfully, in actual businesses. What it looks like, not just instructions.
