## Preface

##### Hey, don’t skip the preface!! There’s important information here!

 This is the twentieth anniversary edition of this book, first published in 1991. It is updated and expanded—but it has stood the test of time, launched or greatly improved tens of thousands of businesses, made quite a few business owners rich, and is every bit as relevant and useful as when I first wrote it.

 For the record, I’m not an academic theorist. I’ve started, built, bought, and sold a handful of companies of my own, in vastly different fields, and I’m always up to something entrepreneurial. As I write this, I’m in the midst of an admittedly experimental foray into, of all things, the mail-order ice cream business, shipping direct from the cows and dairy in Idaho to your home or gift recipient’s home or office anywhere in the United States. I have been using everything that’s in this book personally for more than its twenty years. Further, I consult with owners of businesses small and large, and am intimately involved in their marketing almost as if it were my own. My larger clients include companies such as the billion-dollar infomercial giant Guthy-Renker, best known at present for its Proactiv brand (acne treatments), and Advisors Excel, a dynamic, progressive, fast-growth financial advisor organization of thousands in the annuities field. I’ve helped launch a number of companies that have found their way onto Inc. 500 Fastest- Growing Companies and Entrepreneur magazine’s lists of leading franchisors, in fields ranging from tech to health care.

 I tell you all this for one purpose: so you know what is in this book is thoroughly grounded in real-life experience and repetitive success, so you can confidently invest your time, energy, effort, and money in implementation of The Ultimate Marketing Plan.

 Quickly, I’ll also mention that I make my ongoing ideas, information, experiences, and advice accessible to business owners, entrepreneurs, and sales professionals via a membership program that is affordable even to the owner of the smallest enterprise, and it can be sampled free of fee—see the back of the book for more information.

 So, two things before getting into the meat of this book—one, what the heck is “marketing” anyway? Two, what are the objectives in developing your own Ultimate Marketing Plan?

 I’m not going to give you a university textbook definition of marketing

-----

##### —nor, by the way, is the plan presented here conforming to academic business plan or marketing plan standards, or the sort of thing you put in a fancy binder to show the banker. We’re working on your business here, not trying to impress anybody or get a passing grade from some professor who has never created a customer relationship in his tenured life. So, a workmanlike definition of marketing is:

 Getting the right message to the right people via the right media and methods—effectively, efficiently, and profitably.

 I used to use the word “affordably”—but I’ve replaced it now with “profitably.” The first supported most businesspeople’s poor thinking about marketing investments. Most try to reach out and get customers as cheaply as possible—and, with that cheapskate thinking, rule out a lot of the best opportunities. The very first thing to understand is that the comparative costs of different ways of marketing are irrelevant. They mean nothing. It is the comparative return on investment translated into net profit that matters. So I now say “profitably” rather than “affordably.” (For a comprehensive exploration of the numbers by which marketing should be managed and a business run, don’t ask your accountant. He’s a historian. Consult Chapter 43 of my book No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits.)

 This definition is, itself, worth the price of admission to this book a few thousand times over. It dissects questions about your marketing.

 Is your marketing built around the most powerful,
 persuasive, intriguing, compelling, fascinating message possible? (Or is your message ordinary, me-too-ish, dull, mundane, unexciting, plain vanilla, just-the-facts-ma’am, easily ignored, very forgettable? Or, worse, just about a commodity? Or worse still, just about cheap or lowest price?)

 Have you determined precisely who your message should be
 for and figured out how to put it in front of them—quite possibly at exclusion of all others, or at least with disregard for all others? (Or are you a vague generality, for anybody— and thus for nobody? Are you dissipating rather than concentrating your marketing firepower, trying to be noticed and heard by a population far greater in size than your resources match?)

-----

##### Are you wisely investing in the most appropriate media for
 delivery of your message to the prospects in your chosen target market? (Or are you using media because everybody else seems to be or it is popular or a salesperson arrived and pushed you into it or because it’s the way you’ve always operated? Note: different media are best for different businesses and different target markets at different times.)

 Are you both effective and efficient? (Or are you choosing the
 easiest or the simplest or the most efficient means out of laziness or ignorance or “too busyness” or in surrender to recalcitrant employees or poverty consciousness and cheapskate behavior?)

 Are you accurately measuring the true, net return on
 investment from each marketing investment? (Or not? Or guessing? Or carrying around opinions not verified by fact?)

 If all that sounds too complex for you and your very small business, think again. When income is small, every good opportunity missed and every bad move made have big consequences. You need to be a lot better at all this than the marketing team at some big, dumb Wall Street– financed corporation. A company with 1,000 stores can—and must—do things differently than the proprietor of one, two, or a half-dozen stores. You have to micromanage your marketing. They can macromanage. They can also reach out to the best, highest-paid experts, like me, for assistance. I am routinely paid from $100,000.00 to $1 million for a marketing consulting project. That’s simply beyond the reach of the small business owner, unless he is en-route to being a big business. But you must do this for yourself, and you must do it well.

 If you happen to commandeer a big company, though, you should study this book most carefully and use it to challenge the marketing practices and investments being made by your minions. Big companies’ marketing teams tend to be made up of people who’ve never had to squeeze every drop of profit from every dollar spent, who came to their jobs from the college campus rather than the street, and who are indulged rather than held ruthlessly accountable.

 My objective is to equip you here with many of the basic, fundamental, most reliable marketing success factors that I use as a consultant in helping clients craft or recraft the most powerful message possible for their products, services, or businesses; choose the most appropriate media and use it in the most appropriate way; and get their message to their most valuable market. Your objective should be to put the success factors together into a plan for moving your business forward.

 Personally, I detest planning, although I do a great deal of it. The entrepreneur naturally tends to prefer “Ready? FIRE! Aim.” If you start

### Ultimate Marketing Plan Success
 Factor #1

## Right Message

##### In 1978, when I started working as a professional speaker and seminar leader, one of the venerable deans of public speaking, Cavett Robert, sagely cautioned: “Don’t be in too much of a hurry to promote, until you get good. Otherwise you just speed up the rate at which the world finds out you’re no good.” Harsh but good advice. It’s been my observation since that large numbers of businesspeople in all fields rush to promote without stopping long enough to be sure they have something really worth promoting.

 In today’s incredibly cluttered, competitive environment, you need a truly great marketing message more than at any time in my thirty-five years in marketing—but it better truthfully represent what follows behind it: the prospective and actual customer’s experiences.

 A different expression of this same idea is this anonymous poem for advertisers:

 A lion met a tiger
 As they drank beside a pool
 Said the tiger, “Tell me why
 You’re roaring like a fool.”

 “That’s not foolish,” said the lion
 With a twinkle in his eyes
 “They call me king of all the beasts
 Because I advertise!”

 A rabbit heard them talking
 And ran home like a streak
 He thought he’d try the lion’s plan,
 But his roar was just a squeak.

 A fox came to investigate –
 Had luncheon in the woods.

-----

##### Moral: when you advertise, my friends,
 Be sure you’ve got the goods!

 Marketing—and The Ultimate Marketing Plan—begins not with any particular media or strategy; it starts with putting together the best, most promotable message possible that truthfully represents “the goods” you’ve got.

 Understanding What You’re Up Against, Winning the Fight with All Foes When You Must, Circumventing Competition When You Can

 As you set out to construct a superpowered marketing message, you have to take a thorough survey of all you are up against—everyone else of significance who may be presenting their messages to your targeted consumer. You need to develop a message that somehow trumps all others and places you in a category of one, for the times you do butt heads. But, later in this book, we will also talk about the road less traveled—about circumventing all the clutter and competition and operating in a protected selling environment of your own making.

 I’m going to suggest a little exercise to you. Stop reading here long enough to get your Yellow Pages telephone directory—if it still exists in your area—and open it up to the business category your present or planned business best fits in. You could also hop on the Internet, use search engines, and visit lots and lots of competitors’ websites. Start with the first ad/first site and a thick pad of paper. Write down each promise, feature, benefit, and statement in the first advertiser’s ad. When you find one of these same statements in the next advertiser’s ad, just put a mark next to it, and keep stick-counting the number of times the same basic statement appears in all the ads. If you find a new or different statement in any of the ads, add it to your list, then stick-count the number of times it reoccurs in other ads.

 This exercise is instructive for two reasons. First, the Yellow Pages is historically the most competitive, toughest advertising arena there is. Today, the Internet offers comparable clutter. There are ways to try and pick off searchers and direct them to looking only at your site, but as a practical matter, most who search online are sorely tempted to shop around. In both places, you are literally surrounded by competitors’ advertising. With other types of media, particularly direct mail, you can get and hold one-on-one attention, deliver a complete message, with no instant opportunity and little temptation to check out what twenty or 200 others in your category have to offer. My phrase for this is “selling in a vacuum,” and it is a very desirable thing to engineer.

 But in the Yellow Pages, your ad is next to, above, below, and/or grouped with all your competitors’ ads. On the Internet, your competitors are a millisecond’s click away. You are all presenting your messages simultaneously to the same prospective customer. Here, only the strong survive; only the strongest prosper.

-----

##### This is what you are up against.

 Still, despite this obvious, extreme competitiveness, your stick- counted list will glaringly reveal one astounding fact: everybody is saying the same thing. Everybody is delivering the same message. And, with very rare exception, they are unfocused messages. They are big and broad and not really for anyone in particular.

 While this seems to be the way to do things, because that’s the way everybody is doing things, it is definitely the wrong approach if you seek exceptional success, even dominance, in your marketplace.

 Contrary to all this me-tooism, the key to the vault in marketing in general and in these toughest media in particular is a message that differentiates you from all your competitors in a positive, appealing, preferably compelling way. Many marketing pros call this a “Unique Selling Proposition.” Without this, you are merely a choice. With it, you can be the choice.

#### ULTIMATE MARKETING SECRET WEAPON #1:
 The Great USP

##### A Unique Selling Proposition (USP) is a way of explaining your position against your competition and against all other choices, actual or even imagined.

 When a supermarket chain or big-box retailer like Wal-Mart labels itself as “THE Low Price Leader,” they’ve made a positioning promise. (I do not recommend this lowest-price approach unless you are a giant with giant buying power. For more on price, see my book No B.S. Price Strategy, coauthored with Jason Marrs. Nonetheless, this is an example of a clear, forthright, definitive USP.)

 A USP is also a way of summarizing and telegraphing one of the chief benefits of the business, product, or service being marketed.

 When I wrote the first edition of this book in the early 1990s, Chrysler was making much out of being the only American carmaker to include driver’s-side airbags as standard equipment. That briefly worked for them as a USP, but competition quickly caught up. More recently, and I think humorously, the Subway chain enjoyed great success repositioning itself as a weight-loss business with Jared’s story. How long they can sustain this is open to question. Taco Bell briefly tried copying this idea, but it seems people are unwilling to see burritos and tacos as a weight-loss diet. Anyway, historically, and contemporarily, most great businesses put forward Unique Selling Propositions—or at least try to.

 Your USP may express the theme of your business, product, or service.

 Think: Which coffee is “mountain grown”? Which beer is made with “the clear, cold water of the Rockies”? Where is “THE Happiest Place on Earth”?

 We dubbed Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ THE Place for Prosperity™, in keeping with the fact that entrepreneurs often feel odd- man-out, isolated, misunderstood and underappreciated, and are encouraged by having a place of their own, where leaders and peers truly understand them and support their endeavors. That’s half the theme of our membership. The other half is unapologetically about making money, making more money, developing wealth. Actually, all the above USPs reference “place”.

 These examples show that a USP can be based on just about anything: price, product positioning, place. There are USPs based on color, size,

##### scent, celebrity endorsement, location, hours of operation, and on and on. The most obvious is, I suppose, being number one. When you are number one, though, as with all marketing messages, care must be given to match the message with the audience. As an example, here is a number-one-position/trust USP that I developed for my client Guthy- Renker for its Proactiv acne-treatment products. But recognize that it is for the parent customer, not the actual teen user. To teens, at their age, credibility is a nonstarter. It has little or no persuasive value. But for moms, it is enormously persuasive.

 Doctor Developed. Teen Proven. Mom Approved. Acne Treatment that works. The only acne treatment that prevents new break-outs. Guaranteed.

 As you concentrate on developing a new USP for your enterprise, you’ll be newly aware of the USPs of other businesses, and you can learn from their examples. To hone your marketing mind, you need to become USP-sensitive and ask these questions about every business, product, and service you encounter in your daily activities:

 1. Does this business have a USP?

 2. If not, can I think of one for it?

 3. If so, is there a way I can think of to improve it?

 4. Is there any idea here I can borrow for my use?
