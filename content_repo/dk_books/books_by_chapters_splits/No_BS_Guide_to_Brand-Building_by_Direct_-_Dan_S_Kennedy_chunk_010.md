###### game-changer that would lift your business from ordinary worth to stratospheric value, this book will transform your thinking and put you on a more practical path.

###### will transform your thinking and empower you to win even if you’re a David up against Goliaths.
 One of the core marketing principles developed by Dan Kennedy, which we teach GKIC Members, is that brand-building should be a happy by- product of direct marketing—not purchased outright. This book is a fountain of how-to information and great case history examples drawn from that core principle. GKIC, incidentally, if you don’t already know, is an amazing organization of and for marketing-oriented entrepreneurs, small- business owners, private practice professionals, and sales professionals throughout the United States and more than 20 other countries, providing unique information, training, coaching, networking, and support. You can learn more and take advantage of a free offer on page 261.

##### A Practical Footing

###### There are two questions we ask entrepreneurs and small-business owners to answer:

 1. What is the chief objective of your advertising and marketing? 2. Can you actually afford that chief objective?

 A lot of business owners get sold on the idea of getting their name out there. Visibility. Name recognition. Community or marketplace awareness. It’s an idea that dates back a very, very long way, to a time when there were lots of towns with only one or even no hardware store, clothing store, dentist, car repair shop, so when one opened up, announcing its presence created quite a stir. Today’s marketplace is obviously a lot different. It’s hard today to think of a shortage of just about anything in just about any place. Paying for advertising and marketing so you can announce your existence and get your name out there can now be a costly exercise!
 If you say that your chief objective in advertising and marketing is to get your name out there and let everybody know who you are, what you do, and where you are and to create name or brand identity and recognition, I may agree, depending on your business, that it’s a wonderful objective—if you can afford it.


-----

###### A lot of traditional brand-building you see and might be tempted to copy is done by very well-financed entities with very deep pockets and lots of patience. These examples are dangerous to you, if you copy their strategies without also having their money.
 Once they come to grips with the kind of capital investment needed to build a brand from scratch, most businesspeople throw up their hands in surrender. Many who stubbornly or ignorantly plow forward with brand- building on a limited budget find their pockets pretty quickly emptied without having made the impact they’d hoped for and needed to make their business profitable going forward. The blunt truth is that most new business startups and most small businesses that their owners want to grow and expand do not need brand identity or recognition, at least not yet. It’s a bit like the person who starts a new company and blows his money on fancy offices in a prime location, stuffed with new furniture, then has no money left for advertising. He didn’t need all that to start with. He could have begun in a dowdy office with used furniture, or in no office at all. What he needed most and needed immediately is what businesses need most: paying customers, to create profits.
 Maybe that seems obvious. If it does, maybe you’d be surprised by how many people pour money and energy into becoming known instead of making money. It happens a lot.
 I’m a magician, mostly retired now in favor of my work in marketing. But let me tell you about the most famous magician and the most famous brand ever built in magic: Houdini. It’s so well known that there’s even a wine cork remover product named The Houdini, and the brand also deconstructed into a generic reference, i.e., pulling a houdini. Houdini originally made himself known town by town, city by city at a time of very limited media. But what he didn’t do was make becoming famous his chief objective. He needed to make money. Into each market he went, where he put on a publicity stunt—early on, getting handcuffed and jailed by the local police in the local jail and escaping, and at the same time that story made news, he plastered the town with handbills advertising a show for which tickets could be purchased. As his reputation grew and his brand name become known, he did bigger stunts and even more advertising to promote bigger and more profitable shows. This process built his brand with zero direct capital investment—as a by-product of making money.

##### How to Think about This and How NOT to Think about This

###### When you think about your brand, you think about you and your product or business and all your virtues and benefits. You stand in front of the mirror, look at yourself, and say, “Hey, I’m smart and valuable and good-looking, too!” You think about what you want to be known for and what you want your brand to symbolize.
 When you want to make money, you think about who has money they might be willing to spend—a target market, and what they would be interested in buying with it—which guides a message.
 One of the biggest and deadliest marketing mistakes, especially by people with brand on their minds, is trying to appeal to everybody. “Everybody” is a whole lot of people. It’s a huge ocean with big waves, not very nice to small rowboats. Few business owners have big enough boats. The best answer is not waiting endlessly until you can build a bigger boat or being held back forever because you can’t. Successful people never let their available resources control them—they work with strategies that can be used with the resources they have.

##### For Money Now, Focus on the Best, Most Obtainable
 Customer, Not the Idealized Brand

###### It’s cool to want to build a famous and dynamic brand that people respect, care about, buzz about. It’s a grand ambition. And you can create it. But you need to pay the light bill.
 At the GKIC Fast Start Implementation Boot Camps (www.DanKennedy.com/bootcamp) we spend a lot of time on what you can do right now. Almost every business owner can identify a small, manageably sized target market or prospect group for which his products or services are ideally matched, and then he can figure out—often with our help—how to directly reach out just to them. He can get response from them, make profitable sales to them, and in the process, build his brand 10, 50, 100 people at a time, in much the same way Houdini did it, one town at a time. We have a lot of technology and tools today to speed and expand that process that Houdini didn’t have and would undoubtedly have kid-in-a

###### candy store enthusiasm for, but I’m confident he’d still want to make money as his chief objective.

##### Target Market Thinking

###### Again, at those Fast Start Implementation Boot Camps, we tackle key questions about your best prospective customers. Who are they and what might they have in common? Gender, age, geographic area, income, politics, interests? What motivates them? What is a big frustration of theirs your product or service solves, a secret or stated fear you can ease, a great desire you can help them achieve? The more complete and exact this picture you have of your ideal or avatar customer, the better able you are to develop a very persuasive message for them and attract them to you. If you would like help with developing your Customer Avatar, there is training from the Implementation Boot Camps available free at www.DanKennedy.com. It will only take you about 30 minutes online to develop your Avatar.

##### I Know, You’d RATHER Think about Your Brand

###### Obviously you bought this book because it promised to be about brand- building. It is, and we’ll get there, but we are going to get there by a different road than you probably imagined!
 Here’s a brand you know—Snapple®. You may very well know at least one of its slogans: the best-tasting stuff on earth. You’ve seen TV commercials. You see it on your grocery store shelves. Maybe you drink it and enjoy it. It’s certainly a big brand in the soft drink category, where it is very, very difficult to go up against the well-established major brand names and win some space on the shelf and support from customers.
 What you may not know is that Snapple® was not launched or built with the kind of brand advertising you see for it now. The makers of Snapple® were barely crawling around, not even toddling upright, when a very strange and lucky thing happened. The radio commentator Rush Limbaugh was relatively early in his rise, and having a lot of trouble convincing any brand-name companies to advertise with him. The big brand


-----

###### boys feared negative backlash because of Limbaugh’s outspoken conservative opinions and doubted that his kind of talk show could drive retail sales. Rush noticed Snapple®, determined it was a very young, small, regional brand with very limited distribution, and thought it would be a great test of his ability to spark widespread interest in a new and unknown brand. So he did a crazy thing. Without selling them advertising or even telling them he was giving them advertising, he began advertising Snapple® on his program as if they were an advertiser!
 Suddenly supermarket managers were awash in people demanding Snapple®. Sales soared where it was available, and requests from supermarket and convenience store chains and operators from all over the country, including areas they’d never yet tried getting distribution, poured into Snapple’s offices. The executives scratched their heads at their mysterious good fortune, until they discovered “the Limbaugh experiment” being conducted for them. They then became a real, regular advertiser and built their brand and national distribution rapidly. Limbaugh started and they, for a time, stuck with very simple direct-response style advertising: talking about a problem—being bored with ordinary sodas and beverages, promising a new and different product, and telling people to go to their local store to get it, and if it wasn’t there, to demand it.
 Don’t miss the point here of a target market. For Snapple® to make itself a famous and exciting brand for everybody, known as Coca-Cola® or Pepsi® are known, would have required an ocean of money and a cat’s supply of lifetimes. But to become a famous brand just amongst loyal Limbaugh listeners could be achieved in a short time with limited, narrowly focused resources—in this case, one audience reached directly with one media. This is why Dan Kennedy says: Audience is everything!

##### How I Raised Myself to Success by Thinking about Customers,
 Not about Brand

###### As I said, in my prior career, I was a professional magician. I didn’t mention that I was a struggling, almost starving magician when I first heard Dan Kennedy speak and offer his Magnetic Marketing System®, now GKIC’s flagship product. At the time, I was trying to become known, and I


-----

###### was struggling to book three shows a month. After switching to a direct marketing approach, I quickly leapt to 30 shows a month. Within one year, I had totally turned my income and career around. That’s when I began to package up, sell, and teach what I had learned about effectively marketing myself to other magicians. (The packaging and selling of know-how is called “information marketing.” You can learn more about it at www.dankennedy/infomarketing.) Now, here’s what’s important about my target market then, other magicians.
 On the surface, these magicians I wanted to sell my business course to wanted to learn how to book more shows and make more money. But what they secretly, more deeply desired most was to show all the people telling them they’d never make a living as a professional magician that they were wrong.
 This business grew fast and was very profitable and successful, and it made me a well-known figure and brand name in the magic field. It’s from there that I went on to a bigger business in training and coaching entrepreneurs. I did not worry about building my brand; I set about creating products and sales messages that interested a target audience, to make money. The brand-building just tagged along. Were I doing it all over again today, I’d probably be more conscious of the brand-building, but I would still ask it to ride in the back seat while up front I focused on driving profits.

##### By the End of this Book . . .

###### If you bought this book because you know the Dan Kennedy brand, the No B.S. brand, the GKIC brand, or the Entrepreneur brand, or all of them, you probably have a high trust in them and have entered these pages confident of having a valuable experience and of having profitable actions to take afterward. In case you don’t have that kind of familiarity with us, you may find it helpful to read the abbreviated descriptions of Dan’s experience, the other contributors, and GKIC on pages 251 to 254 before beginning.
 By the end of this book, you will know what it takes to use our core principle: brand-building should be a happy by-product of direct marketing —not purchased outright. You will have met great entrepreneurs and gotten


-----

###### an insider’s look at case histories to understand how they have used this principle in practical ways.
 Now, at the start of this book, all you need is a reasonably open and curious mind.
