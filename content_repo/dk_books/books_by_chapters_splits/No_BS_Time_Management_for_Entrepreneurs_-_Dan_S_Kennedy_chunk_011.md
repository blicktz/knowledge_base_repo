###### Stopping "Productivus Interruptus" Once and for All

_My life is one long obstacle course, with me_ _being the chief obstacle. —JACK_

**PAAR Interruptions**

destroy many office- or desls-bound individuals'
productivity.
Put a stop to interruptions: multiply your productivity. It
is that simple.

After reading a study claiming that the average business
owner is interrupted once every eight minutes, I had three of my
clients who spend all day on their business premises put a watch
on it for a day. One reported a better average: once per ten. The
other two, six, and the third hollered, "Hey, I need a stopwatch."
When I used to go to my offices in a place where I was under
the same roof with my staff, I found that to be about par—if _I let_

_happen._ And, as a big thumb rule, the more employees or asso-ciates
you've got, the more you get interrupted. Some years back, I
suddenly wound up with a staff of 42 people thrust upon me. I'or

a while, I was interrupted every eight seconds, not every eight minutes.

It was embarrassing to ultimately realize that this was ill
my fault. I permitted, even invited the interruptions. And I learned

to stop them.
There are many reasons for these interruptions, and almost
none of them have to do with necessity! If you're going to
achieve peak personal productivity in such an environment, here,ire

the five self-defense, time-defense tactics you'll have to use:

1. Get lost
2. Don't answer the phone
3. Fix the fax
4. Set the timer on the bomb
5. Be busy and be obvious about it

###### Get Lost

Your first tactic—simple inaccessibility. When I was in the office
I got asked lots of questions that I knew the people figured out
for themselves when I wasn't there, so my being there, and being
accessible, actually diminished their productivity as well as mine.
The answer is not to be there at all. Some entrepreneurs think
they have to set a leadership example by being the first person
there, to turn on the lights, and the last person to leave, to turn
off the lights. I made this mistake, and it IS a huge mistake.
Leadership is not about outworking everybody.

I learned by traveling that my people functioned just as well
or better with me as an absentee leader as they did with me

onsite. When I was on the road and inaccessible, they handled
80% of everything on their own, most of it satisfactorily, some
with excellence, and a little bit unsatisfactorily but almost always
repairable. And they asked me about the other 20% quickly and
efficiently, in brief phone conversations or via fax. Since that
worked okay when it had to, there's no reason it couldn't work
all the time. So, I stopped going in to the office, period. I had a
fax at home and at the office, so when I was in town, I stayed at
home and worked there largely interrupted. When necessary, I
faxed or phoned in; they phoned or faxed me.

Today, I live and work at my Ohio home more than anywhere
else. I have only one staff person, and she is in the office—in
Phoenix. About as far from underfoot as can be. Almost without
exception, we talk by phone once a day, usually for less than 20
minutes; I get truly urgent faxes once a day; and once a week I
get a nicely organized box of other faxes, mail, and a list of questions. She is far better organized in dealing with me than she'd be
were I there or more accessible. I am far better organized in dealing with her. I'm certain it equates to at least two hours of productivity saved per day for both of us, and in my world, that's a
whole pile of money. A lot more than the weekly FedEx bill.

Dozens of my clients have mimicked these practices, with
very good result. In fact, I can name more than 30—some running
small businesses like mine with only one or two staff, others running businesses doing as much as $30 million a year—who have
offices they seldom visit—from no more than once a week to as
seldom as once a month. Chet Rowland, who owns one of the
largest and most profitable pest control companies in Florida, as
well as a marketing, training and coaching company serving the
entire pest control industry, has sales, administrative, technical,

in-the-field, on-the-truck employees. He goes to the office no
more than twice a month. His right-hand person comes to his
home for a meeting once a week. He gets daily statistics and
information electronically. He works in a home office at his
sprawling lakeside home or at his beachfront condo. He travels
often with no anxiety about being away from the office, because
he's always away from the office. He gets so much more accomplished than he would if in that office eight hours a day, it can't
even be measured.

I have a friend, a CEO of a $4 or $5 million-a-year business,
who can't work at home; he has six kids, two dogs, one spouse.
So he has a small $200-a-month office in town, about halfway
between his home and his manufacturing facility. It has no phone
and no fax. And he spends most of his time there.

He and I agree:

If they can't find you, they can't interrupt you.

Another business owner I know has been weaning his staff
from him and weaning himself from being in his office every
minute, poking his nose in everything, second-guessing everybody. To his shock and surprise, things have been going well. A
few people in his organization have risen to the occasion. A few
have proven unable to adjust and been fired. Overall, sales and

profits are up. He is finding time to invent and work on "special
projects" he's been thinking about for years. And for the first
time ever, he's taking an entire month of vacation, at a rented
beach cottage, several states away from his business. For the first
time in 30 years, he's really becoming a business owner instead
of being owned by a business.

If you are going to be in your office with the rest of your staff,
then, contrary to my dumb open door management experiment,
it is very important that you have a CLOSED DOOR POLICY.
You need some times when everybody knows—because of the
closed door, red light, stuffed purple dragon in the hallway, whatever—that

you are 100% uninterruptible. And if you want
to sit in there and take a nap, you go right ahead. It's none of
their damned business.

###### Don't Answer the Phone

Next, you've got to get control over the telephone. I think the
phone is Peak Productivity Enemy Number One, and your people will be in cahoots with it until you break them of the habit.
People somehow get conditioned that they must respond to the
phone when it rings, and believe you should too. At home, on
their own time, people will run dripping from the bathtub, jump
up from the dinner table, even "coitus interruptus" to answer the
phone. It's incredible how cowed by Mr. Bell's invention most
people are. Ring. Run. Respond. Nuts.

So, first, let me offer a bit of philosophy: you have absolutely
no legal, moral, or other responsibility to answer the phone or
take a call unless you want to. At home, I routinely take the
phone off the hook to take a shower, eat a meal, take a nap, watch

knows—because

_a favorite TV program or, well, for other things too. There's noth-ing—and_

I mean nothing—happening on earth that can't or
won't wait an hour. Or two. You should carry that attitude into
your work too. Different people need different levels of control
over telephone interruptions, but I do not believe anybody ought
to be wide open to in-bound calls. This is like walking around
with a "Kick Me" sign tacked to your back. If you take inbound
calls as they come, you are constantly stopping work on a task of
known priority in favor of something or someone of unknown
priority. You are turning control of your day over to the
unknown. And at the end of most days, you'll be worn out, but
you won't have gotten to do most of the things you wanted to do.

Personally, I have very rarely encountered an inbound call
damaged by a day's delay in response. Most of my important
calls are forwarded to me while traveling, and I start trying to
return them the next day. A lot of the calls wait three, four, even
five days before I take time to return them. Guess what?
Occasionally, somebody's aggravated—which is their problem,
not mine—but I have yet to notice this approach costing me any
money. Not a nickel. In fact, ironically, in my business (and in
many), being somewhat difficult to get to actually helps rather
than hinders securing new clients and having those clients
appreciate and respect your time and assistance. Rightly or
wrongly, most folks don't put a lot of value on getting to the wise
man at the bottom of the mountain. (I talk about this, in the context of "Takeaway Selling," in my book No B.S. Sales Success.)

**_The Take-with-You_** **_Phone_**
Now, the cell phone—an evil invention if there ever was one.
People really feel compelled to answer these things 24/7. It is the

CHAPTER 3 / STOPPING "PRODUCTIVUS INTERRUPTUS" ONCE AND FOR ALL

ultimate interruption welcome mat, and it has amazing, mysterious powers over its owner.

As comedian Dennis Miller says, I don't want to get off on a
rant here, but. . . increasingly, I am noticing men standing at urinals in public restrooms taking care of business while talking on
the phone simultaneously. Look, if you can't even pee in peace,
you are not Mr. Super-Important. You are Mr. Super-Stupid.

Personally, I refuse to own or use one at all. I had one for two
weeks once. Wound down the car window one day and threw it
as far as I could. Never been tempted again.

If you insist on carrying one of these miserable things, have
the good sense to turn it off. A lot. Like to walk to lunch with
coworkers or friends, eat, and actually digest what you eat. Or
pee. Or, say, navigate your SUV down the side of a mountain, on
an icy, curvy road. And have the common decency to turn it off
and shut up when you are seated next to me on an airplane
before I ram it down your throat.

In my seminars, by the way, we assess a $100.00 fine anytime
a cell phone erupts. And confiscate the offending phone for the
duration.

Often, the offenders have paid $2,000.00 to $5,000.00 to be in
the room. Many are also very good clients. I don't care. I will not
tolerate it. I warn everybody, I put some big, beefy bruiser in
charge of collecting, and I take the money. If you can't have your
life sufficiently in order to pay uninterrupted attention and be
courteous to others, I'd prefer you stay home and annoy someone else. I think restaurants and theaters ought to collect them
when you come in and give them back when you leave, like civilized saloons did with gunslingers' weapons.
The pay phone in a booth with a folding door on it was a
wonderfully civilized thing.

And a word to business owners, salespeople, and my pathetically desperate and paranoid speaking colleagues who devoutly
believe they must be instantly accessible at any and every
moment to every client and prospective client to prevent that
client from dialing the next number and doing business with
whomever answers instantly: if you are that interchangeable,
that mundane and ordinary a commodity, you've got big, big
problems, far bigger than you can solve by answering your cell
while you're on the can. Turn off the thing long enough to read
my No B.S. Sales Success book. That's urgent.

Maybe this will help: picture the poor fellow walking around
with cell phone in hand or on belt, or worse, with headphones
on, is like a big, dumb dog with collar and leash. Tug, tug, tug.
Yap, yap, yap. Pant, pant, pant.

If you walk upright, you ought to behave better than this.
And resent the leash.

**_Your "Steel_** **_Curtain" Telephone Defense_**
If you buy into this tactic at all, you will obviously need a good
screening system. What will protect you from the telephone? If
you have a live person, a receptionist or secretary or a receptionist plus a secretary, that's probably best. (If not, you'll have to use
voice mail or an answering machine.) Your receptionist or secretary needs a continually updated "VIP list" of people from whom
you will almost always take an incoming call, regardless of what
else you may be doing. This prevents you from missing calls you
really want, and it allows your assistant to screen all the other
calls with great confidence.

Keeping this VIP list up to date helps prevent screening faux
pas, however, even when a faux pas occurs, you must never sacrifice your assistant to the cause. You must support the person

doing your screening 100% of the time. A screener can only do
the job if she has complete confidence in what she's doing.

If you want staff to consistently put up a "Steel Curtain
Defense" comparable in strength and reliability to the famous
Pittsburgh Steelers' steel curtain defense of their glory years, you
have to give them the right tools, equipment, and support. ^ou

might wonder who's on my VIP List. I'll

appease your curiosity. At any one given time, there

are a dozen or so key private clients on that list—peo­

ple paying me sizable sums of money. I have several

very close associates on the list. A few very close

friends. And that's it. I'd say that a VIP list with more

than two dozen people on it is not a VIP list at all. In

my case, even the VIPs can't get through to me imme
diately, because I'm not there, but they will typically

get a return call the same day or the next day. On a

given day, a client might be given a direct line to where

I'm working, under extreme circumstances, but for

one-time use only. Oh, and even at the office, my staff

person only answers "live" one afternoon a week,

which is published and known to clients. Otherwise,

they get my voice mail. I really do have a steel curtain

defense.

You have to decide on the severity of the screening to be *
li ME. In my case, on any given day, I'll get a few VIP calls and up u>
I wo dozen calls from other people of unknown priority, Including

prospective new clients, book reviewers, media con-I.KTS,
and salespeople. If I were in my office for the whole day .MD
took these calls as they occurred, and each one averaged
only three minutes, I would have let loose of an hour. But much MORE

importantly, I would have been interrupted 24 times! The IHREE
minutes given each call would have cost me another ten minutes

added, required to get back in gear after each interrup-TION;
13 minutes times 24 calls equals FIVE HOURS of lost time.
However, because I travel and am rarely in my office, most of each

D A Y ' s non-VIP calls accumulate, so after a W E E K, I M A Y have .is
many as 220 calls to supposedly return. Considering all this, I
have a very tough-minded policy. First, all callers ARE asked FOR
their reason FOR calling. People refusing to provide G O O D information about their reason FOR calling NEVER gets a return CALL; in
fact, they never E V E N get entered on my CALL LOG. My staff person
IS asked to throw them into the trash; this eliminates a lot of junk.

Second, prospective clients ARE asked to send information in
writing, by mail or FAX, so that I C A N look at it at my convenience
A N D have the flexibility of responding as I judge best: calling, writI N G, sending information before calling, delegating, or referring
elsewhere. If they W O N ' t do that, they NEVER get to me.
Salespeople ARE told pretty much the same thing. If they W O N ' t play
by my rules, they NEVER get through. The "tone' is polite but firm.
I tend to return calls only once or twice a week, more often than not
V I A pre-arranged, back-to-back, time-limited phone appointments.
