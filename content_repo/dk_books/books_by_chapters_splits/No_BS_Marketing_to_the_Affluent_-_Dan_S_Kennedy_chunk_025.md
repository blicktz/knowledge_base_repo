Raising your aim to more affluent clientele makes perfect sense in good economic times when there is robust spending from top to bottom of the money pyramid. Even when spending is flowing from the middle class and even lower earners, there’s still more price and profit elasticity with affluent customers. But the case for going there now not later is also founded on sensible, responsible prudence. When an economic “adjustment” comes—not if; when—it is always too late for most to abruptly move up to higher, safer ground. Desperate need may be motivational, but it is rarely helpful in practical terms. Falling off a high cliff is, I imagine, motivational, but it’s a tick late as motivation for erecting a safety fence at cliff’s edge or donning a parachute or putting a safety net at the bottom.

 By all means, profit from and enjoy a boom like the one we’ve been experiencing as I’ve been updating this book. Celebration is fine. But the business owner and leader must be creatively schizophrenic. Simultaneously enjoying dancing in the summer sun and readying for fall and winter. The best time to buy insulation, a new furnace, and firewood is before there is even a chill wind foretelling of winter.

# There was a time when coffee was coffee. Ice cream was ice cream. A
##### phone was a phone. Even a pair of shoes was, well, just a pair of shoes.
 At one level, at the lowest price and profit level, there are still merchants stuck in this time warp, continuing to conduct business as if people still bought products.
 Today, that cup of coffee comes with more options than a Lexus®. Would you care to add … vanilla or caramel syrup? A double shot? Foam?


-----

##### Cinnamon sprinkles? Thus, the $5.00 price for the $.50 cup of coffee. But even that is only half the story. Ordinary products morphing into complex arrays of choices, options, add-ons, brands, and luxury brands is one way prices have been inflated and margins inflated even more. The profit margin of the double shot of extra something or other far exceeds the profit margin of the cup of coffee itself. The designer-name bag selling for $4,000.00 does not cost 100 times more to make than the similar-appearing bag sold at Target® for $40.00. This is a path to profit—and to greater acceptance by affluent consumers. But, as I said, it is only half the story.
 Starbucks® does not define itself as a coffee shop or even more elegantly as a coffeehouse. The company describes itself as being in the “third-place business”—home, office, Starbucks® in between. It is not a merchant just of jazzed-up coffee drinks. It is a merchant of place, of feelings, of status, and maybe most of all, of experience. Its inspirations are more Disney® than Denny’s®. One of the many students of the Starbucks® phenomenon, Ken Herbst, assistant professor of marketing at Wake Forest University’s Babcock Graduate School of Management, makes the obvious point: “If you walked up to someone about to buy a pound of coffee at the grocery store (at about $4.00 a pound) and tried selling them just a cup for $5.00 they would tell you that is too expensive. But if you are at the coffeehouse, you are going to pay for the experience.”

##### much greater success appealing to affluent customers or clients. To be redundant for emphasis, most business owners are severely handicapped by keeping price and product linked in their own minds. What I call the price- product link is as restrictive and antiquated as the Work-Money Link that I take apart in my book No B.S. Wealth Attraction in the New Economy. These links are imaginary. They exist only in your mind, not in the marketplace, yet they are ties that bind as if real, physical, 1,000-pound chains.
 The price-product link becomes ingrained religious belief in most business owners, beginning with textbook formulas for setting price. Retailers are taught the doctrine of keystone pricing meaning double their own cost. If you buy it for $1.00, it should be priced at $2.00, then, at times, discounted from there. In my line of work, direct marketing—what was once called mail order—we’re also taught formulaic markup as doctrine, although ours is eight times rather than two times. In businesses where raw materials are converted to finished products, like printing, there is a plethora of price-calculating software to do the thinking for you, using standardized markup formulas. In every case, the price is chained to the product. There is the fundament that a particular product is worth only a certain multiple of its cost and not a penny more, period, end of story. Unfortunately, this widely and deeply held belief is completely and utterly stupid.
 The two biggest chain cutters that de-link price from product are 1) who is buying the product and 2) the context in which the product is presented, priced, and delivered.
 The who is what this book is all about. The simple act of selling whatever you sell to more affluent consumers may allow its price to rise, with no other modifications.
 Price for the same product also varies by context. This is easy to see with commodity items like food, even though many restaurant owners still never grasp it. When is a third pound of peanuts not a third pound of peanuts? In a jar, on the shelf, that’s all they are, unless dusted with Starbucks® mocha latte powder and packaged in a fancy tin. But when served hot, from a vendor’s cart in the park, scooped into the bag and sprinkled with cinnamon by a handlebar-mustached man in red-and-white striped jacket and straw hat, with calliope music playing from the CD


-----

##### player in the cart, they are not peanuts at all. They are an experience that evokes emotional feelings. Even as you read my words, your mind may have flashed to Mary Poppins in the park or a trip to the circus as a child. While it is not so easy for most to transfer this idea to other businesses, it does, in fact, transfer to any business. Context alters or liberates price. Move the exact same product from one context to another and its price can easily be altered.

 What It Is Needn’t Determine What It Is A visit to the dentist can be just a visit to the dentist. Cleaning and checkup, a routine experience and a routine price. Or it can mean being picked up at your home by the dental office’s gleaming white limousine, brought to the elegantly appointed office with a grand piano playing itself in the lobby, neatly uniformed staff rising to greet you at the door and escort you to a comfortable chair, get you a fresh-brewed latte, offer you a choice of magazines (just like what stewardesses used to do for first-class passengers on airlines a decade ago) … then, only a few minutes later, escort you to the spa room for your complimentary manicure and hand massage … then to the dental hygienist for your regular cleaning, plus a whitening treatment while you relax in a dental chair with a full-body massage pad and gentle heat and listen to your favorite music, not piped-in elevator music or, worse, the radio … then back to the spa for some anti-aging skin treatments … and back to the limo, carrying a complimentary gift basket of little soaps and skin lotions along with your tote bag containing your next three months’ supply of specially formulated toothpaste, whitener, and breath freshener. The charges for the cleaning, whitening treatment, and products are all evened out during the year as a monthly membership fee automatically charged to your credit card, so there is no plebian act of standing at the front desk at the end of your visit, reviewing charges and writing out a check, nor any such bill arriving in the mail.
 We can give just about anything a comparable makeover. A meeting with the financial advisor or tax accountant, a visit to the sporting goods store, a stay at a hotel, even a true business-to-business experience, like buying and receiving printing from the printer or industrial parts from a manufacturer. Somewhere in the process there is opportunity to alter the

##### experience and the way the buyer feels about it. It begins with determining the feelings you want to create for the buyer: security and peace of mind. Being pampered like a queen or king. Nostalgia. Whatever. It is this that unties price from the anchor of product and allows it to float upward like a helium-filled balloon on a slightly breezy day.
 Different buyers want different experiences and the feelings they invoke in different circumstances.
 I choose to fly private rather than commercial, at substantial expense, with practical rationalization tied to the extremely high value of my time and the urgency with which I need to get where I’m going or to get home and get to work. But, as confession, it is at least as much about being and feeling special. For one person using private aviation, that might mean status lorded over others. That’s not it for me. For some, it might be about the pampering. Not for me. For me it is—after 20 years of suffering the ever-worsening indignities, inconveniences, and stresses of ordinary air travel—about escape from the way ordinary folk must travel, to a better experience. The feeling to me is similar to the one I get going downstairs to my basement office and being at my chosen work in minutes, in comfortable clothes, knowing that outside, thousands of ordinary people are slogging through snow, waiting for cars to warm, enduring bumper-to- bumper traffic in hour-long commutes. In short, it is about a feeling of superiority.
 Yet I get my hair cut at a walk-in, no-appointment hair cutting place. There’s nothing about it that makes me feel special. To the contrary, I prize the in-and-out speed and simplicity more than anything else. But someone else my very same age and income might profoundly prefer a trip to a very upscale men’s salon with mahogany paneling, plasma TVs playing sporting events, and relative quiet that takes four times as long and costs ten times the price. Not necessarily because the haircut is any different. Because the feeling he gets from the experience is meaningful and therefore valuable to him.
 Affluent consumers do not simply choose the priciest option of everything in every category. Different affluent consumers value different experiences differently. It’s up to you, the marketer, to find the group of affluent consumers you can match up with an experience you design and can deliver, that disconnects price from product.

#### CHAPTER 13

### Value in the Eye of the Beholder

##### In a 60 Minutes story broadcast in 1973, an astonished Morley Safer was told that a Saudi prince and his three bodyguards were traveling
 to Syria aboard the Orient Express “to shoot swans with a
 chromium-plated submachine gun.”

# In response to an article of mine in my No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent
##### Letter, a No B.S. Inner Circle Member sent me this note:

I have to confess, we **worry a lot at our company about**

pricing. So I was astonished to find out about Williams

-----

Sonoma’s prices: for Halloween Caramel Apples …

miniapples, no nuts, set of four, “only” (!) $29.50 plus

$7.50 shipping and handling. Or a larger single apple,

with or without nuts, $19.50. For ONE apple! Plus $6.50

s/h. Or your own personalized Halloween cookies, three

cookies, $24.00. You could combine the apple and cookies

at $43.50. For a discount on shipping, buy $150.00 worth.

Though **I am appalled, it appears that there is a large**

enough set of people for and to whom these things appeal,

as Williams-Sonoma does a very good business. Reaffirms

the adage that “you are not your customer,” or perhaps

more accurately, “you are not necessarily your customer.”

##### That you are not your customer is an astute observation and brings me impetus for a very important discussion.
 First, note that Williams-Sonoma® is a cataloger focusing on the mass-affluent, not ultra- or super-affluent. Its products are routinely purchased by hundreds of thousands of households with an annual income in the $100,000.00 neighborhood. The $19.00 apples are NOT being nibbled on by only a few eccentric multimillionaires who also clean their eyeglasses with hundreddollar bills. It is VITAL that, through this book, from catalogs like Williams-Sonoma’s, and as many other sources as possible, you get, accept, embrace, fully internalize that the mass-affluent class of consumers in America is spending like crazy on premium-priced luxury goods and services, buying all manner of things that will shock you. (I recently reserved a suite at a Disney® hotel—where families go on vacation—at $1,800.00 a night, and it was the last of two remaining rooms in the entire hotel in January.)
 Second, of all possible reactions to discoveries like these, being appalled is least appropriate. Let’s consider the reasons somebody might be appalled (my subscriber didn’t enunciate his). One would be the “children are starving somewhere” idea, that if people didn’t pay $19.00 for caramel apples, somehow starving urchins somewhere would be fed and cared for. Gee, if it really were that simple to solve poverty and world hunger, I’d give up my $19.00 apples and my luxury SUV and my $800.00


-----

##### cowboy boots tomorrow. But that’s just not how money really moves around, how wealth or poverty is caused or affected, and I’d refer anybody wrestling with that idea to my No B.S. Wealth Attraction book. Until you come to grips with the truth about prosperity NEVER being a zero-sum game, where one person’s wealth or, by your judgment, waste deprives someone else, you are hamstrung, handcuffed, hog-tied mentally, emotionally, and practically in your own attraction of wealth. The supply of wealth to which all have ready access based exclusively on their own chosen behaviors is not a debit-credit system at all. This is contrary to what 95% believe to be true about money, but it is not coincidental that 95% have comparatively little while 5% have most of it.
 Or somebody might be appalled at the wretched excess, the foolish spending. I’ve been broke; I have a gut-level, visceral reaction to what I judge as waste. But that imposes your value judgments or mine on others. A devout atheist opposed to all religion might very well view your $20.00 put into the church collection plate en route to the Vatican with just as jaundiced an opinion as your critical view of his purchase and enjoyment of a $20.00 apple. One man’s wretched excess is another’s highest and best value.
 There are better (more profitable) reactions than being appalled. One is to use this information as fodder for your own continuing inner thoughts, dialogue, and (probably, hopefully) reorientation of your understanding of price, value, consumer behavior. Another is to be inspired and motivated, to re-examine your beliefs about your own customers’ or clients’ attitudes, spending, interests, and passions, and to search for opportunities to 1) design and offer premium-priced goods and services (options or levels) to your present clientele and/or 2) seek out a clientele that places price very low in its list of Buying Decision Factors. (As an example of that, imagine how many restaurant owners, grocers, gift shop owners, and so on will read this chapter but will never bother to go to www.SRDS.com, find the Williams-Sonoma mailing lists, contact the list manager, and rent the best Williams-Sonoma buyers they can in their area to promote their businesses to!”
 Back to understanding value: No, a $19.00 apple a day won’t keep doctors at bay any better than a $1.00 apple, at least as a result of its nutritional properties. (It might, based on its effect on the consumer’s
