several different audiocassette adaptations have been sold via
the famous Nightingale-Conant catalog, the Sybervision catalog,
and a television program, and published and distributed through
bookstores by Audio Renaissance. The mental training techniques
created by Dr. Maxwell Maltz that make up Psycho-Cybernetics
have been endorsed and used by famous pro athletes and coaches,
leading corporate executives, star salespeople, entertainment
personalities, and by me. Salvador Dali gave Dr. Maltz an original painting as thanks for Psycho-Cybernetics' influence on his
career.

When Dr. Maltz first began putting his techniques down on
paper in the 1960s, he was far ahead of his time, so far ahead that
people first discovering his material right now are amazed by
and profit enormously from them.

What does all that have to do with you and peak productivity?
_There is a certain state of mind that best facilitates achieving peak_
_productivity. You can best create that state of mind as needed,_
when needed, at will, by mastering certain Psycho-Cybernetics
techniques.

For example, Dr. Maltz talked about "clearing the calculator."
If you have a simple calculator laying around, get it, and take a
look at it. You'll find that you have to hit the "clear" button and
either store in memory or completely clear away one problem
before you employ the calculator to solve another. In his studies
of human behavior, Dr. Maltz observed that all too often we're
trying to use our minds to work on several problems at once,
without ever stopping to hit the "clear" button.

Achieving maximum personal productivity requires that you
become extraordinarily facile at stopping, storing, and clearing,
so as to direct 100% of your mental powers to one matter at a
time, to the matter at hand. One client of mine, the CEO of a $20

corporation, is a compulsive, obsessive worrier.
He admittedly lets a dozen worries loose to run around in his
mind at the same time, while he is trying to do something else
and says he is constantly interrupted by his own thoughts. He
marvels at me and tells others that "it is amazing how Kennedy
can just box up a problem, put it away on a shelf in his mind,
focus totally on some task, and only go back to work on the problem when he wants to." This is because I have practiced and
practiced and practiced the technique of "clearing the calculator"
until it is second nature to me.

A big reason for my prolific output as a writer is that I never
have to "get in the mood' to write. Many people go through great
physical and mental gyrations just getting ready to get ready to
write. I don't. I can sit down, put my fingers on the keys, clear my
calculator in 60 seconds or less, and write.

This is just one of a number of simple but very powerful
Psycho-Cybernetic techniques, but it illustrates a very important
point: if you can't control your thoughts and manage your mind, you
_can't control or manage your time._

###### Creating a Peak Productivity Environment
You can do a number of things to make certain that your environment works for you instead of against you. The following are
some key ideas to consider and experiment with.

 - Psychological triggers

 - Organization vs. clutter

 - Feng shui

###### B.s. Time Management for Entrepreneurs # 129 "A

As I said, I am a big believer in populating my work environment with "psychological triggers"—objects that remind me to
think a certain way. I work at mentally attracting wealth, for
example, so my primary work environment is full of things that
represent wealth; at last count, 27 such pictures, objects, and artifacts were within view. Because I am very concerned with time, I
have eight clocks around me. I have a wooden hangman's noose
to remind me of deadlines. A painting on my wall of a black tiger
devouring a man in the jungle reminds me of the quote "Tigers
starve last in the jungle," and reminds me to be tough and
aggressive.

A good friend of mine who is very successful at his endeavors has a little plaque on his car dashboard that says: "People Are
Good, Business Is Great, Life Is Terrific!" He wants to see it every
time he makes or takes a call on his car phone or gets out of the
car to go on an appointment.

I think you can "surround yourself" three possible ways: 1.

By accident and happenstance, with no purpose in mind
and no purpose served
2. Consciously or unconsciously, with things that trigger
negative responses, frustration, anger, resentment, depression
3. Deliberately with things selected to reinforce positive—productive—responses.

Let's not be dogmatic about this. I suspect that a person with a
constantly, pristinely clean and neat desk and work environ-ment—a
"Felix"—may very well be neurotic. Certainly I prefer to

believe that. On the other hand, the person immersed in clutti'i
and a chaotic environment—an "Oscar"—MUST waste time by
hunting and searching, must be distracted. There is a broad band
of acceptable style between the two extremes.

Personally, fortunately, largely by "clearing the calculator," I
can sit down and work effectively surrounded by clutter or in
chaos. However, I will tell you that I am most productive in what
I have come to call a "semi-organized environment." As a writer,
for example, I think it's unavoidable to have stacks of papers, reference materials, and other documents around, but I find it very
helpful to have those piles organized by topic or project.

Really creative, innovative thinking seems to come out of
chaos more often than out of neatnik organization. But the successful implementation of innovative ideas seems to come about
in a most organized, disciplined way.

It's worth noting, to paraphrase management guru Peter Drucker,

that what we are after is effectiveness, not necessarily effi_ciency. Put a time-and-motion_ analyst on the typical entrepreneur
and he will come up empty; how do you analyze the guy who sits
on the floor of his office watching daytime TV talk shows and
thumbing through magazines for hours on end, then suddenly hits
upon the right "pitch" for his company's new fitness product?

The most important thing here is to be honest with yourself.
Is the level of clutter and disorganization around you helping or
hindering? Out of control or just about right?

One big time-saving tip I can give you is:

when in doubt, throw it out.

Many people are compulsive keepers. I find a bit of ruthless-ness

toward paper is beneficial. If you seriously doubt you will
need or use it again, go ahead and throw it out immediately. If it
becomes really important, it will be provided to you again. At
least once a year, usually in December, I conduct a violent purge
of my correspondence files, client records, desk drawers, etc., <ind

throw out as much of it as I dare. In all these years, I've had
that come back to haunt me only a couple of times. JNot

too long ago, I moved much of my home **_*GeWl_**

office, files, records, and library from one home to

another. More than 100 boxes. Because I'm busy,

some of those boxes have yet to be opened, two years

later, and that's because no need has sent me into

them, looking for anything. Undoubtedly, by the time I

get around to opening them, I'll be able to throw out

what's in them. Which probably means it didn't need to

be kept in the first place. I'm making a note to myself:

be even MORE ruthless.

It's also important for your "workspace" to make it easy for
you to work. My own, in my home office, is not unlike a pilot's
cockpit; without getting out of my swivel chair, I can operate my
computers, my word processor, my TV and VCR, my audiocassette recorder, and my calculator. I can reach my most important
reference books, and I have two "surfaces" for paperwork. Once
you get to work, you ought to be able to stay at work without

having to jump up and down every minute or two to fetch something or put something else away.

The cordless phone is a marvelous invention. If you talk on
the phone a lot, as I do, this enables you to roam, stretch, relax in
a recliner, go find a file, even go outdoors while talking.

###### Now What the Heck Is Feng Shui?
Never let it be said that I don't bring my readers the new and different. Feng shui is the latest Eastern philosophy to be grabbed by
businesses and individuals in the West. Literally translated, it
means "wind and water," and more broadly translated, it is the
art of improving your productivity, creativity, and good fortune
by making the relationships between objects in your environment and yourself more harmonious. You might think of it as
acupuncture for the office—blocked energy can be made to move
more freely.

Just for example, rearranging furniture or replacing a solid
wall with a see-through fish tank might create good feng shui.
William Spear, the author of a book on this subject, Feng Shui
_Made Easy: Designing Your Life with the Ancient Art of Placement,_
likes to tell of being called in to consult with the owners of a failing hotel, the Kings Cross Hyatt in Sydney. By relocating an escalator in the main lobby, money was "attracted" instead of
"repelled," and the hotel zoomed to a high occupancy rate with
no other changes made.

Feng shui experts believe that you can create a "wealth corner" in a room and that you can create a "feeling" in a room conducive to exceptionally productive work. They also believe, as in
the case of hotels and restaurants, that feng shui can make a
property more inviting and comfortable to visitors and guests.

Maybe you find all this a bit "woo-woo-ey." But IORII VifJ
serious business leaders don't. In Hong Kong, big, blue i hip
companies such as Jardines and The Hong Kong B.mk spend,i
fortune on feng shui. Architects routinely consult wilh feng ihul
experts. And it's reported that gambling casino designers uso
feng shui to create "bad luck areas" for the customers.
Short of hiring your own feng shui consultant, how can all
this help you? Well, when I first read about it, I was struck by its
conceptual compatibility with my long-held belief that environment matters and matters differently to different people. This
means that, just like you have a time of day when you are at your
best (and a time of day when you are at your worst), you probably have an "environment" that helps you be your best, too. You
may feel different when surrounded by one color scheme vs.
another, one style of furniture vs. another, in a room with or without a big window, with living things like plants or birds in the
room, and so on. I don't think most people give this much
thought at all but probably should.

If you feel like getting very specific with feng shui, here's one
application: assume that the door to your office is always at 7
o'clock. Look at 11 o'clock; that area represents wealth; 12 o'clock
represents fame; 1 o'clock represents relationships. Let's say there's
an old, maybe chipped or broken bookend holding up a dusty pile
of books and magazines in "wealth." Cleaning that up, dusting off
the books, keeping only some magazines, getting a new bookend,
could release "wealth energy" and improve your fortunes.

Here, I think, is the bottom-line: the space we work in, the
way that space is organized, the tools we use, the objects and
colors we see, the noises we hear, the smells we smell all combine to have an impact on our productivity, and on our ability to
be productive. Much of this is common sense. Some is just slowing

down long enough to think about yourself and your reactions to
different stimuli. If you want to get in deeper with disciplines
like feng shui, you can. Why not give yourself the advantage of
a high productivity, success environment? Finally—the

###### Militant Attitude
I have come to really, deeply, vehemently, violently resent having
my time wasted. I place a very, very high value on my time, and
I believe that the value you really, honestly place on your time
will control the way others value it and you.

I have talked about this elsewhere in this book and do not
want to redundantly beat up on any one single point, yet this
self-determination is so important. You set your own price. And
you determine whether or not people "get it" and respect it.
When I was in direct sales, managing, motivating, and trying
to help others build their businesses, I was constantly amazed
and often depressed at how little value people placed on their
time and how pitifully unwilling they were to protect it and
wisely invest it. I heard "I didn't because . . . my mother-in-law
decided to surprise us with a visit... my buddy Bob dropped by
and took up the whole evening . .. the roof started to leak and I
had to work on that. . . ." Etc. Etc. But if you already had something very important to do, that you were committed to doing,
mother-in-law would have to sit home alone and watch TV,
buddy Bob would be bounced out, a bucket would be put under
the leak, and you'd stay focused.

How tough are you on those who would undervalue your
time? How tough are you on yourself?
