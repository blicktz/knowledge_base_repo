# WHAT KIND OF RESULTS CAN YOU EXPECT
 FROM DAN’S NO B.S. SALES SUCCESS
 STRATEGIES?

## “In 1978, I went to work as a sales rep for a company that sold hand-held
 pricing equipment to retailers. By1981, I was promoted to General
 Manager, but saw with the advent of bar codes our business was endangered. Although we continued to add products and I bought the company, it wasn’t until 1991, when I discovered Dan Kennedy, that I really discovered how to make my business the leader in its industry. Using
 Dan’s methods—including many in this book—my business grew from
 $3.5-million in sales in 1991 to $13.4-million in 2006, and, while our
 sales increased 4-fold, our profits multiplied 8-fold.”

 —Keith Lee, American Retail Supply

 “I’ve had your No B.S. Sales Success book in my possession for only three
 days. I have set up eight presentations, closed two deals . . . the first presentation ‘the Kennedy way’ went off without a hitch—they were
 pre-sold before I arrived, and that order put $13,475.00 profit in my
 pocket.”

 —Tom Halloran, Medical Supplies

 “I have just returned from a trade show that was almost cancelled because
 of low registration. As I prepared, I re-adjusted and remembered your admonition that it is the quality of the prospects, not the quantity. As I left
 the show having written five large orders, reaching our goal, the

## organizer of the show—who had struggled to satisfy the other exhibitors—
 said ‘You’re my success story.’ My success is related to what you say in
 your book about selling in difficult conditions, when others can’t. ”

 —Lisa Wilgus

 “I am writing with a long overdue ‘thank you’ for everything you have done
 for my business and personal life. I have read all your books repeatedly . . .
 I have used your strategies to triple the size of my family’s insurance agency in the past 36 months . . . from $3.4-million to $10.5-million. We
 are now able to dominate our target markets regardless of the economy or
 competition.

 —Michael McLean, McLeanInsuranceLive.com

 “I have lived and worked in Australia, slugged it out, on the street selling,
 to make a living. I knew there had to be an easier way, and I looked and looked for 25 years. When I found Dan Kennedy and adapted his unique way, my business took off like a cat on a hot tin roof in the outback. This
 year alone, Dan Kennedy was responsible for adding more than one
 million dollars to my income—and I never spoke to him!”

 —Ed Burton, Financial/Investment/Asset Protection Advisor, Sydney,
 Australia

 “My current success is entirely YOUR fault. I thank you so much. Changed
 my life. I’m not exaggerating. Your No B.S. Sales Success book is the #1 reason behind my success. I was born a big baby, 11.5 pounds, to a petite
 woman, my legs and feet grew crookedly insider her womb, and I had to
 wear special braces from birth to age 3 to straighten them out. My

## perfectionist father viewed me as a failure, according to the family, began
 drinking heavily after my birth, so I grew up with an alcoholic father. I
 feared rejection immensely, and practically lived inside my bedroom, hidden away from my father and the rest of the world as much as possible. I
 actually forced myself into sales to try and conquer my fears but I failed miserably, even declaring bankruptcy at age 21. I tried selling everything:
 cars, vacuum cleaners, insurance, you name it. One day I came across
 your book. One statement made in it changed my whole career:
 ‘positioning, not prospecting.’

 “With guidance from your book, I specialized in a niche, I became an
 expert, I used my writing skills to create lead generation ads and free reports, and began attracting pre-qualified prospects to me so I no longer
 had to prospect or ever feel rejected. I subsequently became THE top selling representative at a Fortune 500 company. Today, I’ve become a highly paid copywriter, selling via ads and sales letters. Thank you Dan, for
 everything.”

# The old economy is shattered and gone
 forever.

## It’s never coming back as it was.

## While some time-honored, reliable business strategies and skills continue to have their place—are even more important than ever—they

## must be combined with new, more sophisticated, more disciplined
 methods in sync with the realities of the New Economy and the
 psychology of its consumers and clients.

# Welcome to The New Economy

## Well, it’s not like we shouldn’t have seen this coming.

 Problem: We are monstrously over-stored. The same stores every few miles. The joke about Starbucks was it had reached the point they were opening new Starbucks in the Men’s Rooms in existing Starbucks. Me- too, same-as, indistinguishable chain stores, chain restaurants with zero differentiation right across the parking lot from one another. Simply, much, much more than the market could support. Implosion certain destiny.

 Problem: There are far too many over-lapping brands. Should there ever have been Cadillac pick-up trucks when GM also has Chevy and GMC trucks? Other than to perpetuate jobs locked in by union

-----

## contract, could the existence of Pontiac and Buick and Chevy and Cadillac and GMC possibly be justified? Not unique to GM, though. Many other companies sinned similarly. And it seems everybody wanted to play in everybody else’s sandbox, sacrificing their very identities to their detriment. Starbucks added egg, cheese, and meat breakfast sandwiches (that ruined the coffee aroma in their stores) while McDonalds hurried to add lattes and gourmet coffee while Subway added pizza while Dominos Pizza added sub sandwiches, your pharmacy added clothes and lawn furniture, Wal-Mart added iPhones. It’s a damn mess. That must be cleaned up.

 Problem: Everybody already owns too much stuff. How many cars, TVs, computers, games, remodeled kitchens, backyard decks can consumers consume before they need a break? Above all else, the recession was made and extended by demand problems.

 Problem: Worst of all, salesmanship perished and service went to hell in a handbasket, as free-flowing, easy, excess credit and the latest in a series of fools’ bubbles (this one with theoretically never-ending multiplying of property values so homes became ATM’s, not investments) enabled countless companies with poor sales practices, lazy and inept salespeople, sloppy over-staffing, casual management and abysmal customer service to prosper, or at least seem to prosper. Truth is, consumers welcomed a good excuse to stay home and stop buying and punish.

 Imagine a very loosely held together, giant ball of yarn with dozens of loose ends poking out all over the place. It wouldn’t matter much which of the loose ends you gave a good tug; the entire ball, really just a pile of yarn, would implode and collapse and unravel. So it has been with the economy. It really wouldn’t have mattered if it had been too many sub-prime mortgages issued to poorly qualified and irresponsible borrowers, based on inflated equity with no regard to the borrowers’ ability to pay, then bundled together in inventive investment packages or if it had been sudden skyrocketing of gas prices or if it had been the weight of mass-multiplied, poorly regulated hedge funds or accelerating disappearance of old-style manufacturing jobs sent

## overseas or just about any other loose end you might name—any one given a good yank would have been enough. Of course, when several got pulled hard in different directions at the same time . . . .

 Incidentally, the real estate bubble was visible far, far in advance of its bursting. In 2003, an outstanding book on the subject, The Coming Crash in the Housing Market by John Talbott, a former vice president at Goldman Sachs and real estate economist, very accurately predicted both the mortgage meltdown and real estate crash we’ve recently experienced—and reading it saved me some money. Authoritative articles began appearing pretty frequently from 2004 on, like the one on July 26, 2004, in the Financial Times, headlined “Party Over—Turn Off the Housing Boom Lights,” that stated that “the end is near in use of exotic type mortgage money.” We should have seen this coming. Some of us did. I began foretelling in earnest of 2007–2008 in my No B.S. Marketing Letter and other publications in 2004.

 What has been painfully revealed are extreme, systemic weaknesses and flaws and vulnerabilities—and gross excesses—throughout our socio-economic, financial, and political systems, papered over for a while, but worsening like undiagnosed disease all the while until, finally, we got slapped in the face with a monster recession. It’s not my first rodeo. I built my first businesses during the Jimmy Carter recession, with tight credit, double-digit interest and inflation and unemployment rates, and gas shortages and gas lines. These things may very well be avoidable, but these things happen. For people seeing it firsthand for the first time it is terrifying and can be paralyzing. But it’s not the first time and it won’t be the last time traumatic change has replaced an old economy with a New Economy.

# From Monster Recession to New Economy

## For people who respond boldly, creatively, intelligently, and responsibly, grand and glorious new opportunities, greater in scope, more powerful for rapid wealth creation, and more accessible to all are being presented by the emerging New Economy. With honest Darwinism, the herds are being thinned, the weakest eaten, and the strongest stepping over carcasses in the street en-route to bigger and better things. You choose whether to lie down and be stepped on or to move forward—quickly—because moving forward is the only way not to be stepped on. The once generous and cheery economy is going through a very irritable and unforgiving mood. Conditions are harsh. There are new opportunities. They have new requirements. There are also evergreen, time-honored, wholly reliable success principles most business owners and entrepreneurs have drifted from, neglected, or forgotten that must be restored as governing priorities. This book, No B.S. Sales Success for the New Economy, and its brother No B.S. Business Success for the New Economy are about all of those things: new opportunities, new requirements, neglected principles to be restored.
 Let me briefly describe the emerging New Economy as it directly affects sales professionals. Here are the new realities:
 1. All the power has returned to the customer and he knows he has it.
 2. The customer’s tolerance for anything ordinary—ordinary products, services, expertise, experiences, for the banal and commonplace, and certainly for incompetence—is zero.
 3. Money will be spent more judiciously, so it will be available only to sales pros with a much higher level of knowledge, skill, preparation, discipline, and sophistication. A more cautious consumer, striving to be sensible and responsible, will be judging you and trying

-----

## to determine if you are worthy of his trust before he buys from you. You will be under greater scrutiny.
 4. You must genuinely earn your right to your customers’ interest and support by providing well-matched, specialized, even customized product, service, and value propositions. People now have the opportunity, power, and awareness to demand what is specifically for them and precisely matched to their needs, interests, and desires. They are not going to be on buying sprees, buying whatever is in your wagon that you want to sell.

# FOREWORD

 from the previous edition By America’s #1 Sales
 Trainer,

 TOM HOPKINS

## Every person who has chosen selling as a career must focus on getting the brass ring with every new contact they make. The brass ring for a salesperson is the closed sale. It’s hearing the words “yes,” “we’ll take it,” or “how soon can it be delivered/installed/set up?” Those words, and a check, credit card, or purchase order to go with them, validate the salesperson. They demonstrate in both physical actions and words that the salesperson is representing something of value to the client—so much value that the client is willing to exchange their security (spelled M-O-N-E-Y) for it. It also demonstrates that the salesperson did a good job, using their skills and talents in presenting the product in such a way that the client saw how the benefits it would provide fulfilled a need. Having a client say, “thank you” tells you they’re happy the salesperson brought it their way. That “thank you” is like getting a standing ovation.
 There’s a lot of psychology behind what works and doesn’t work in selling. It has to do with mind-sets (both yours and the client’s), attitude, fears, perception, body language, voice, vocabulary, style, grooming, expectations, preparation, and too many other aspects to list here. An entire encyclopedia of selling could be written if every little nuance of selling was to be taught. It might take you a few years to read such a series of books.
 My questions to you is, do you want to take the course in psychology to understand what’s behind the sales process, or do you just want to hear what works? If you’re like most salespeople, you’re looking for the shortest route between where you are now and increased sales. That’s the benefit of this book. Dan has literally eliminated the B.S. in explaining great ways to make more sales.

-----

## We can learn many things simply by reading, but we only benefit if we invest time in thinking about what we’ve read and how it applies to what we’re doing. We excel when we put the knowledge gained to use. This is a relatively short book. Invest your time wisely in reading it with thoughtfulness of how you can apply the strategies it contains. You’ll be glad you did.

# PREFACE

## There are basically four types of salespeople: sales professionals with strong ambition who are eager to strengthen and fine-tune their skills; sales professionals who are jaded, close-minded, cynical, and stuck; nonsalespeople who realize they need to be salespeople, such as doctors, auto repair shop owners, carpet cleaners; nonsalespeople who either do not recognize they need to be or are resistant to the idea.
 In The NEW ECONOMY, only the most self-aware, selfdisciplined, and highly skilled salespeople who view their selling as art and science, as a professional skill, and as a sophisticated process will prosper. During the purge beginning in earnest in 2008, some sales professions quickly lost from 25% to 50% of their entire populations, and many will never return to their peak sizes. Some business categories mirrored this shrinkage. You would think this ratio of fewer providers and sellers to the growing consumer population might permit less skillful and diligent salespeople to prosper, but the opposite is true; the consumer knows the power has shifted to him and has no intention of returning it to undeserving hands. Placing yourself in the proper mind-set space here is predictive of your future prosperity in or forced exit from your business.

 Historically, this book has resonated with those in the first and third quadrant. Wasted on the others. I’ve spent more than one-quarter of an entire lifetime, over 30 years, working with people in both the first and third quadrant. And doing my level best to avoid the folks in the second and fourth. In The New Economy, it’s easier to avoid them because their populations are thinning rapidly. The first and third categories are dominating and will dominate, and all the income is going to move to them.

-----

## In the old economy, the income divided, in a sales field, roughly 20% to the 80% of the population I’d define as Stuck Salespeople, 80% to the 20% of the group working as Ambitious Salespeople. Same in business: 80% of the money to business owners who might never define themselves as sales professionals but who were nevertheless eager to learn and use smart selling strategies—about 20% of the population. That looked like this:

 In The New Economy, 95% of the money gravitates to the Ambitious and Eager-to-Learn, and will separate and be shared disproportionately by the most ambitious and most eager. It is now essential to be smarter, sharper, more progressive, more aggressive, more organized . . . more “everything” in order to get to the top of this new pyramid, which looks like this.

 80/20 Pyramid #2

 Incidentally, I’m cheered by all this. I detest salespeople and businesspeople who coast, who are intellectually lazy, who perform half- heartedly, who expect high rewards for low effort, and hope to see them starved out altogether. Rather than redistributing success to a broader swath of the business owner and sales professional populations in some socialist- leaning ideal of equality, I’m happy to see the success concentrated into the hands of a smaller-than-ever minority of people who choose to make
