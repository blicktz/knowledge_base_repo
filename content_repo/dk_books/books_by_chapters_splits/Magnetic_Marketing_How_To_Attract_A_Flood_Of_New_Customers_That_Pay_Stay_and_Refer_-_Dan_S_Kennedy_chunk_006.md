# PRINCIPLES OF MAGNETIC
 MARKETING

-----

###### CHAPTER 5
#### THE MAGNETIC MARKETING TRIANGLE

-----

###### Now let’s get to building your Magnetic Marketing system.
It has three big building blocks, each of which you

 can imagine as one side of a triangle:

 Message
: A truly compelling,
preferably irresistible,

 marketing message.

 Market:
High-probability target marketing that

 identifies only those most likely to respond.

 Media:
The most appropriate, effective combination

 of media used to deliver your message to your

 market.

 These three can’t be placed in any kind of sequential order,

 because no single one is more important than the other and

 none of them can function without the others. It is a closed

 triangle. Each feeds the others and when they work together it gives you enormous marketing power.

 BUT
you can render the triangle powerless if you get any

 one or more of them wrong.

 For example, you can deliver the right message to the right

 market, but if you use the wrong media, they will never get

-----

###### the message nor have a chance to act on it.

 Or, if you get the media and market right, but fall down

 when it comes to message—the right people will get what

 you have to say, it’s just not going to connect in the way it

 should.
 Finally, the right message via the right media goes out to

 the world loud and clear—but there’s nobody out there to

 listen.

 You must get ALL three right.

 This is why it’s so important that you really understand each and how they must work.

 MARKET

 In the previous chapter, I talked about the need to find your “starving crowd” of slam-dunk customers. The idea of NOT

 going after every human who still has a pulse is probably a

 somewhat newer concept for many small businesses. In fact,

 most are probably guilty of “throw mud against the wall”

 marketing where you are just putting a marketing message out there and hoping that somehow the right people are

 going to see it or hear it.

 With Magnetic Marketing
, we use a very different

 approach. Our approach is designed to do one very important

 thing, and that is eliminate waste to the greatest degree possible. And to eliminate waste, we must narrow our

 marketing focus to only the people most likely to buy what we

 have to offer.

 The basic way that most people choose their target market is GEOGRAPHIC. If you have a local business, you may say

-----

###### your customers, patients or clients come from a ten-mile

 radius around your business. Some people don’t get any more

 sophisticated in targeting than that.

 Targeting with only geographic information is like getting in a plane and dropping flyers and hoping one hits the right

 person. That may be an exaggeration, but the truth is that,

 with just some simple tweaks, you can make your geographic

 target marketing much more effective.
 DEMOGRAPHIC information is about how old people are,

 how much money they have, whether they are married or

 single, liberal or conservative, what religion they are and so

 forth.

 That’s another way to define further who your ideal customer is—and you need to do this—but again it’s very

 surface level. Geographic and demographic information is

 important, but we want to go even deeper than that.

 PSYCHOGRAPHICS delves even deeper because it explains

 “why” people buy. It includes information like habits, hobbies, spending habits and values.

 Demographics and psychographics will allow you to create

 your ideal customer profile—a detailed picture of people you

 would like to work with now and in the future. So how do you

 determine psychographics of your target market? Here are some questions to ask yourself:

 What keeps them awake at night, staring at the

 ceiling, unable to fall asleep as it relates to your

 product or service?

 What are they frustrated about?

-----

###### What is causing them pain, right now, as it relates to

 your product or service?

 What is the single biggest problem that you can

 solve for them?

 What do they secretly, privately desire most?

 The last question is very important. For example, most people who sell marketing courses always talk about making more

 money and getting more customers, clients, and patients—

 they think THAT is the core desire for many people. But

 there’s a deeper reason—for them and for everyone.

 How do you determine your market’s secret and private desires? If you’ve been in your business for a while and you

 think about it, you are going to come up with what it is,

 because you know them. It helps if you think about a current

 or past customer, client or patient you would love to “clone”

 if possible.
 If not, if you are just getting into a target market, one of the

 easiest things that you can do is go to online discussion

 groups and forums. Start reading what people are posting.

 You will be able to figure out what pain they have just by going. You will be able to see what they secretly, privately

 desire most.

 Immerse yourself in their world. Get their trade magazines

 and read them. Go to their trade shows. Talk with them. Ask

 questions. Watch, listen, and read what they say to their peers, how they talk about their lives and what brings

 meaning and what causes pain. Do what you can to get inside

-----

###### their heads until their deepest needs and dreams become evident to you.

 If you’ve been in their business, walked in their shoes,

 laughed and cried with them, then you’ll begin to understand

 what they secretly, privately desire most.

 And once you’ve done all this, you’ll know your WHO.

##### MESSAGE

###### The
next building block then is the right message, as in:

 What do you say to your marketplace, to your past, present

 and future prospects, clients and customers that is compelling, that is magnetic, that cannot be ignored, that

 must be responded to, that draws them to you like a bright

 porch light on a dark night draws moths?

 Do you have a great marketing message? Most businesses don’t. A person opens a restaurant, a flower shop, a dental or

 law practice, a service business, etc. and the message is,

 “We’re open for business.”

 A marketing message is a way of concisely and clearly

 saying to the right market, “Here’s what I’m all about and here’s why you should choose me.”

 So you need to ask yourself, “What am I going to say to the

 marketplace and why is what I say going to be interesting and

 appealing to the marketplace?”

 Back in Chapter 1, we talked about the need to identify and create your business’s
Unique Selling Proposition
or
USP
. The

 example I gave was Domino’s Pizza, who built their empire

 based on this USP:
“Fresh hot pizza delivered in thirty minutes

 or less, guaranteed.”

-----

###### You can go out to the market with a USP like this and you’ll

 almost certainly do far better than most of your competitors,

 who are probably relying on clichés stating “the best” or

 “number one” or something equally meaningless.

 But I’m going to take you a step deeper regarding promotional messaging—into the creation of special
, highly

 appealing offers that I call “
Widgets
.”

 WHAT’S A WIDGET?

 We call these very special offers
“Widgets
” and
the best way to think of it is an offer on steroids.

 Let’s say, you own a hotel. A common offer might be: “Get

 10 percent off your hotel room rate.”

 A widget
, however, ups the ante by tossing in extra elements to make it even more attractive, hard to resist, and

 impossible to compare against competitors. You can think of

 widgets as packages of services and goods and premiums

 and experiences bundled together, given a clever name, and

 promoted as a special, one-of-a-kind buying opportunity. So now, instead of creating an offer like:

 “Get 10 percent off your hotel room rate.”

 Which is frankly pretty boring and easy to ignore, you’ll see:

 Your Ultimate Weekend of Food and Fun for only $xxx!

**10 percent savings on regular two-night room rate**
**Free gourmet dinner for two, both nights**
**Complimentary bottle of champagne when you arrive**
**Limo Service from and to the airport—no charge**
**Eighteen holes of golf for two plus cart**
**Movie tickets for two, plus popcorn to boot**

-----

**Limited availability, reserve your spot before midnight**
**tomorrow**

###### Now that’s hard to ignore, especially when presented to the

 right person at the right time with the right media.
 Widget-making
is an important marketing skill. Once you’ve

 got it, you’ll use it regularly and every day in your business. T

 hat’s why it’s so critical to understand the concept.

 On a simple level, if we go back to the pizza business as an example, their widget of the week may be themed for the

 NBA Playoffs. It could include two pizzas plus a liter of Coke

 and four side salads—all for a special, one-time only low

 price.

 They’re not just saying, “Come and buy pizza from us.” They’re saying,
 “Come in now to get the
 NBA Playoffs

 Party Dinner Deal
.”

 THAT special deal is their widget
, which so long as the

 playoffs continue they can promote via email, flyers, TV ads,

 newspapers, phone scripts, on and on.
 One of the best examples that I’ve seen and that I know

 quite a bit about, comes from Las Vegas in the hotel and

 casino business, where pretty much everybody offers the

 same thing, a place to come and lose a lot of money and

 have a good time doing it with a lot of lights and pretty girls. For decades, that was the business in Las Vegas.

 Years ago, an amazing entrepreneur, Bob Stupak, took over

 the worst and last hotel on the strip. He had to find a very

 different way to get people to come and stay at that hotel and gamble in that casino.

-----

###### He didn’t have a tremendous amount of money at the time

 to do advertising and marketing with, so the conventional

 ways that Las Vegas hotels market themselves was pretty much out for him.

 Bob sat down and he turned the hotel business and the

 casino business in Las Vegas into a very specific widget that

 he could hold up and people could see and get a grip on and understand and be attracted by and buy in advance of use.

 Let me describe his widget. Ask yourself if you would

 respond to it presuming you were convinced it was real.

“Give me $396 and I’ll give you two nights, three days in my hotel in one of
the deluxe suites. There will be a bottle of champagne waiting for you when
you arrive. You can have unlimited drinks the entire time you’re here whether
you’re gambling or not. Even if you’re sitting in one of the lounges and
enjoying the entertainment, you pay nothing more for your drinks. More
importantly, for your $396, I’m going to give you $600 of my dollars to
gamble with in my casino.”

###### His widget included the room, it included the drinks, it

 included some extras like the champagne and souvenir dice

 and show tickets. It included $600 to gamble with while you

 were at his casino.

 This widget turned that little hotel, which at the time that this started was on a Motel 6 level, into one of the largest and

 fastest-growing hotels on the Las Vegas Strip in its time called

 Bob Stupak’s Vegas World
 . It eventually became
 The

 Stratosphere
.

 If you’re old enough, you may recall seeing Bob’s full-page ads for this widget in
Parade
,
Sports Illustrated
,
 Playboy
,

 and in dozens and dozens of magazines and newspapers all

 across the country.

-----

###### Bob filled his rooms by selling that widget and that was really the business that he was in, the business of selling that

 widget. He didn’t advertise any other type of

 accommodations. He didn’t bother advertising his hotel as a

 hotel. He concentrated all his efforts and all his energy and all

 his resources on
selling that widget
.
 These packages were prepaid. You bought your $396

 package today but you might not actually make reservations

 and go to the hotel until a month later, six months later, even

 a year later. In the interim, Bob exchanged your $396 for a

 certificate, a piece of paper which entitled you to all the benefits that I described. He had your $396 in a bank account

 earning interest or funding construction and remodeling

 during that time that it was not redeemed.

 If you study that example closely, you see that a fairly

 mundane and ordinary business, the hotel business and the hotel casino business was turned into a totally different

 business.

 A different business was invented within the business and

 that new and different business became the widget that was sold to the public.

 That’s exactly the thinking process that you need to go

 through.

##### CREATING IRRESISTIBLE OFFERS

###### Bob Stupak’s “widget” created an empire for him because at

 the time, it was irresistible and original.

 With this widget, he managed to create a Godfather-level

 kind of offer—the kind of offer you simply cannot refuse.

-----

###### Think about it—this offer, this deal
, it just sounded too

 good to be true—room, champagne, unlimited booze, even

 $600 in gambling money (which had to played at the casino,

 it couldn’t be redeemed for cash). The total package just

 seemed amazing.
 THAT is the kind of thinking you need to put into place

 when creating your offers. Too many business owners come

 up with an offer that’s practically invisible—“Save 5 percent!”

 or something else that involved zero imagination and barely

 moves the needle.
 An irresistible offer (again, think “widget” because that’s

 what you’ll be promoting) bundles together a variety of

 elements—price, bonuses, guarantee, speed, security, etc.—

 into something unique and compelling. Frankly, if the widget you create doesn’t cause you to pause and reflect to yourself

 “Am I giving away the farm here?” for at least a moment,

 then the offer isn’t good enough.

 To be truly irresistible, it should literally overwhelm the

 customer with value.
 Now, that doesn’t mean you have to take a bath on the

 deals you make. Quite the opposite. Stupak watched his

 numbers and he knew exactly what kind of ROI he got from

 every room key handed out. He also factored into the mix

 things like food, house winnings, return visits, referrals, and much more.

 So the widget didn’t stand alone—it was just one piece of a

 much larger play he had going involving his business and how

 he could maximize the lifetime value of every customer.

-----

###### When creating your offer widgets, in the Magnetic

 Marketing System
there are basically three types of offers.

 Lead Generation Offers

 Consultation Offers

 Direct Purchase or Final Offers

 Each type of offer serves a specific purpose in building a

 positive relationship with your prospective customer, client, or patient—establishing credibility and trust—all leading to

 the end goal of making the sale. Let’s talk about each in a bit

 more detail.

 LEAD GENERATION OFFERS

 This is an offer whose only purpose is to, in effect, entice a

 prospect to raise their hand to identify and register

 themselves as having interest in certain subject matter, and

 information or goods or services, and to invite further communication with you. Often, although not always, the lead

 generation offer is free.

 You see lead generation done by direct marketers routinely

 and regularly. You may not have given them much thought

 before, but now that you’re aware of this kind of offer, you will.

 For example, a national company may offer walk-in

 bathtubs for the elderly, advertising on cable and in national

 print, offering their “lead gen widget,” which is a free

 information kit and DVD. Once someone raises their hand and requests this “kit,” the company now recognizes them as “
a

-----

###### lead” and they can follow up with focused marketing looking

 to make the sale.

 This model is widespread across all kinds of industries, including pharmaceuticals, finance, home improvements, and

 many more.

 Oddly enough, you rarely find a local company doing this

 same strategy. Instead, they immediately try to get the prospect to commit to a “free in
 -home estimate” or “free

 consultation.”

 This can quite often
be a mistake, as it’s asking too much

 too soon.

 “Why?” you wonder… well, Arnold Taubman, one of America’s most successful mall developers, coined the term

 “Threshold Resistance” in regards to the entrances to retail

 stores. I find it applies even more broadly to direct marketing.

 Again, remember that your prospect doesn’t want to pull

 out their credit card. They don’t want to get off the couch. They don’t want to even pick up their cell phone and punch in

 a number. At a mall, it’s hard enough to get them to enter a

 retail store where God forbid they face the very real

 possibility of some stranger walking up and trying to sell

 them something.
 So jumping right into “Sign up for a free consultation”—

 whether from chiropractor, financial advisor, remodeler, or

 what-have-you is a BIG threshold to get them to cross.

 That’s why starting with something that has a very low barrier to entry—like “call this number and get my free report

 and DVD”—is much easier
to convert and provides a higher

 response. There’s less perceived risk. So
those interested are

-----

###### more likely to respond. And by getting them to agree to that

 first step, albeit tiny, you increase the chances that further down the road
they will become a customer, client or patient.

 This is a key to magnetically attracting customers.
The

 addition of lead generation to your marketing system allows

 you to create a pool of ideal customers to directly market to.
 Therefore, if your business DOES in fact require some sort
