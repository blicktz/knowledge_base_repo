## Welcome to The New Economy

#### Well, it’s not like we shouldn’t have seen this coming.

 Problem : We are monstrously over-stored. The same stores every few miles. The joke about Starbucks was it had reached the point where they were opening new Starbucks in the men’s rooms in existing Starbucks. Me-too, same-as, indistinguishable chain stores and chain restaurants with zero differentiation right across the parking lot from one another. Simply much, much more than the market could support; implosion certain destiny.

 Problem : There are far too many overlapping brands. Should there ever have been Cadillac pick-up trucks when GM also has Chevy and GMC trucks? Other than to perpetuate jobs locked in by union contract, could the existence of Pontiac and Buick and Chevy and Cadillac and GMC possibly be justified? This was not unique to GM, though—many other companies sinned similarly. And it seems everybody wanted to play in everybody else’s sandbox, sacrificing their very identities to their detriment. Starbucks added egg, cheese, and meat breakfast sandwiches (that ruined the coffee aroma in their stores) while McDonalds hurried to add lattes and gourmet coffee while Subway added pizza while Dominos Pizza added sub sandwiches, your pharmacy added clothes and lawn furniture, Wal- Mart added iPhones. It’s a damn mess that must be cleaned up.

 Problem : Everybody already owns too much stuff. How many cars, TVs, computers, games, remodeled kitchens, and backyard decks can consumers consume before they need a break? Above all else, the recession was made and extended by demand problems.

 Problem : Worst of all, salesmanship perished and service went to hell in a handbasket as free-flowing, easy, excess credit and the latest in a series of fools’ bubbles (this one with theoretically never- ending multiplying of property values so homes became ATMs, not

 Imagine a very loosely held together, giant ball of yarn with dozens of loose ends poking out all over the place. It wouldn’t matter much which of the loose ends you gave a good tug; the entire ball, really just a pile of yarn, would implode and collapse and unravel. So it has been with the economy. It really wouldn’t have mattered if it had been too many sub-prime mortgages issued to poorly qualified and irresponsible borrowers, based on inflated equity with no regard to the borrowers’ ability to pay, then bundled together in inventive investment packages, or the sudden skyrocketing of gas prices, or the weight of mass-multiplied, poorly regulated hedge funds, or the accelerating disappearance of old-style manufacturing jobs sent overseas or just about any other loose end you might name—any one given a good yank would have been enough. Of course, what we witnessed were several getting pulled hard in different directions at the same time.

 Incidentally, the real estate bubble was visible far, far in advance of its bursting. In 2003, an outstanding book on the subject, The Coming Crash in the Housing Market by John Talbott, a former vice-president at Goldman Sachs and real estate economist, very accurately predicted both the mortgage meltdown and real estate crash we’ve recently experienced. Reading it saved me some money. Authoritative articles began appearing pretty frequently from 2004 on, like the one on July 26, 2004, in the Financial Times, headlined “Party Over—Turn Off the Housing Boom Lights,” which stated that “the end is near in use of exotic type mortgage money.” We should have seen this coming. Some of us did. I began foretelling in earnest of 2007–08 in my No B.S. Marketing Letter and other publications in 2004.

 What has been painfully revealed are extreme, systemic weaknesses and flaws and vulnerabilities—and gross excesses—throughout our

#### socio-economic, financial, and political systems, papered over for a while, but worsening like undiagnosed disease all the while until, finally, we got slapped in the face with a monster recession. It’s not my first rodeo. I built my first businesses during the Jimmy Carter recession, with tight credit, double-digit interest, inflation, and unemployment rates, gas shortages, and gas lines. These things may very well be avoidable, but they happen. For people seeing it firsthand for the first time, it is terrifying and can be paralyzing. But it’s not the first time and it won’t be the last time traumatic change has replaced an old economy with a New Economy.

 In The New Economy, it may very well be harder to attract wealth than it has been in recent years.

 There has been a great deal of talk by economists, futurists, financial analysts, politicians, and the media about the need to lower our expectations and shrink our lifestyles as the only rational response to all that has occurred, in the United States and globally, in 2008, 2009. An article in USA Today, for example, warned of the need to “brace for a lower standard of living.” The President has suggested this as well. Unfortunately, I suppose it may very well be valid advice for those who accept it, for those who routinely accept governance by circumstances. But for you and I, lowering expectations is the least rational response I can think of. It only makes sense if you wish to cede control of your life to circumstances. That is a fundamental choice that belongs exclusively to you.

 There are, of course, changed and changing facts and realities in the business and financial landscape, but a good way to think about them is as a pro football team’s coaches and players must think about games played on natural turf, artificial turf, outdoors, indoors, in heat, in cold, in rain, in snow—regardless, they play to win. And somebody does, every time. I drive harness racing horses and we race in good and foul weather, outdoors, year-round. In the last ten years, a night of racing at the track where I drive has been postponed and re-scheduled only twice, due to violent ice storms and blizzards. Given the differing weather and track conditions, you

#### plan your race strategy differently, you may condition your horse differently during the week, you may equip him differently on race night, you may dress differently, and you may need to steel yourself mentally for bitter cold or pouring rain and mud. But you do not set aside your intentions of winning.

 Whatever the realities are, one is that there is wealth. As long as it exists, it is yours to attract, by combining the right thinking, strategies, actions, and behaviors.
