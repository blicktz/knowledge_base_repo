# CHAPTER 2

STRATEGY 2 THE POSITIVE POWER OF
 NEGATIVE PREPARATION

## I’ve been involved in what I’ve labeled “the success education business” since 1976. For decades, I was an active member of the National Speakers Association—fraternizing and consulting with hundreds of people who earn their livings as professional lecturers and seminar leaders, including some whose names you know. I helped create the Information Marketing Association, the more encompassing trade-professional association inclusive of speakers, trainers, coaches, consultants, authors, and publishers (www.info-marketing.org). Throughout these years, I’ve spoken to nearly 7,000,000 people from the platform, maybe more, about success-oriented topics. I’ve delivered as many as 100 “live” speaking presentations a year, for major corporations, associations, and at large public events, plus countless teleseminars and webinars, and only in the last couple of years have I deliberately cut back that pace.
 For that purpose, for my own use, and for the many speakers and information marketers I’ve had as clients, I’ve become exceptionally adept at and very well-known for structuring and writing “platform sales presentations”—sort of a combination of speech writing and sales presentation or script development. I’ve been paid upwards from $100,000.00 to craft such presentations. I have also been highly paid to create sales presentations delivered via television infomercials, complex direct-mail packages incorporating “long form” sales letters from 16 to 64 pages in length, and via other media. It has all made me a proponent of “negative preparation.”
 I have frequently been mislabeled and misintroduced as a “motivational speaker,” from the platform, in meetings, at cocktail parties. As a result, I’ve had more conversations than I care to count with my students, clients, customers, peers, and friends about “positive thinking.” Through it all, I’ve come to the conclusion that at least 95% of the people who think they’re

## positive thinkers actually have no idea what positive thinking is really all about.
 Too many people think it’s some kind of mystical, magical shield from the real world. They believe that if they just think positive, bad things cannot happen to them. If something bad happens to somebody, they say: “See, you weren’t thinking positively.” But it just doesn’t work that way. You can think positive until you are turning blue from the effort, but you’ll still run into obstacles from time to time. People who believe that positive thinking is supposed to keep the bogeyman away eventually wind up frustrated, discouraged critics of positive thinking.
 Being a positive thinker does not mean that you should refuse to acknowledge the way things are. In fact, people succeed in business, sales, and marketing by dealing with “what is” not with “what ought to be.” The true positive thinker acknowledges potential and existing negative circumstances and reactions, and engineers a plan to overcome them, to achieve positive results. In selling or negotiating, I call this the positive power of negative preparation.

# How General Patton Used the Positive Power of
 Negative Preparation

## There’s a great sequence in the movie Patton where General Patton is dozing the night before a battle. He has a book in his lap: Field Marshal Rommel’s book on tactics. The next day Patton’s troops drive Rommel’s troops off the battlefield into retreat. As the gunfire and other noise ends, Patton is standing alone, leaning forward, stage whispering across the battlefield:
 “Rommel—I read your book.” Some people would say that acknowledging Rommel’s expertise as a tactician and preparing to counter any possible successful moves was being negative. They’re wrong. It was positively brilliant.
 In several of the most successful, profitable, complex negotiations I’ve been involved in—buying and selling businesses, assembling capital, developing relationships with celebrities, manufacturers, and producers in the TV infomercial business—I’ve prepared by anticipating and writing down every possible question, concern, and objection the other party could raise, and then formulating my responses in advance. I carefully analyzed every weakness in my position that might be attacked and thought of ways to respond effectively. I thought of every possible thing that could screw up the deal and then thought of some preventive measure to take in each case. I was thoroughly prepared, from a negative perspective.
 WARNING: If your prime selling years have been the 1980s into the mid 2000s, you’ve been selling to relatively noncritical customers. Their incomes and net worth were increasing, in many cases, multiplying; real estate values and other investments’ values all steadily escalating or, in some cases, leaping in big bounds; credit was cheap and plentiful; and there was a heady mix of aspiration, ambition, and unbridled optimism, sometimes called “irrational exuberance,” in the air. Customers entered the buying environment and the activity of buying predisposed to buy, and

## absent tendency to be skeptical or critical. If you think you’ve been overcoming buying resistance, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet! What felt like gale force wind to you, given no frame of reference from selling during prior, serious recessions, wasn’t even a stiff breeze.
 Now, in the post-recession, emerging New Economy, you will be selling to customers conditioned to be critical. To be critical thinkers about value, quality, service after the sale, comparable alternatives, and more. Other good words to describe these New Economy Customers are: cautious, circumspect, guarded, discerning, judicial. And one of the most cautionary synonyms of “critical” is: fault-finding. To work successfully with these New Economy Customers, it is more vital than ever to thoroughly prepare, from a negative perspective.
 One of the times I sold one of my companies—that entire process, from first approaching my chosen buyer to cashing the check took only 6 days. In another instance, I sold another of my businesses in fewer than 20 days. These are typically complex sales situations fraught with peril, from deal- killing lawyers to hidden agendas to misunderstandings, and on and on. The speed with which I completed these sales is testament in large part to careful negative preparation. Business-to-business sales professionals often ask about strategies for abbreviating normally long sales cycles, and this is one of the best: negative preparation, disclosure and resolution early and all at once, rather than hoping the buyer does not think of “x,” and subsequently having negatives drip out, trickle out, to be handled one by one.

# Who Else Uses the Positive Power of Negative
 Preparation?

## I’m a bit of a sports freak, and as a speaker, I’ve had the terrific opportunity of spending time backstage in ‘the green room’ with champion athletes like Troy Aikman, Joe Montana, Peyton Manning, George Foreman, and with top coaches including the late Tom Landry, Lou Holtz, and Jimmy Johnson. My friends in the world of sports have included Brendan Suhr, who has been an assistant head coach of three NBA teams. Another is Bill Foster, former head basketball coach at Northwestern University and one of the “winningest” coaches in college basketball history.
 I have talked about this subject with all of them, and found consensus. These champions have super-strength positive attitudes, but they also wisely use the positive power of negative preparation.
 Most successful coaches go into each game with more than one prepared game plan. They have a plan to follow if their team gets ahead early in the game. They have a different plan to follow if their team falls behind. They have alternate plans ready to use different combinations of players in case one key player is injured during the game. That’s not negative thinking; that’s the positive power of negative preparation at work.
 As I said at the top of this chapter, I’ve done a lot of work in planning, scripting, and implementing group sales presentations, and training others to do the same. What I call “group presentation marketing” applies to everything from a Tupperware party to a seminar designed to sell $50,000.00 real estate partnerships. There are a lot of special techniques for this type of selling, but one of the most important is the anticipation and removal of the reasons for refusal or procrastination on the audience’s part. Sometimes this is done with subtlety, weaving the objections and responses into the presentation. Other times it’s done quite openly. One very successful presentation I designed ended with the presenter listing the four

## main reasons why people don’t join—and then answering every one of them.
 You also have to do this when you are selling in print. I am paid from a low of $50,000.00 to $150,000.00 plus royalties as a direct-response copywriter, to write full page newspaper and magazine ads, sales letters, infomercials, and other marketing documents, and over 85% of all clients who use me once do so repeatedly—despite my fees. Why? One reason is my very thorough negative preparation. When I’m creating an advertisement, brochure, or direct-mail piece, I make a list of every reason I can think of why the reader would not respond to the offer. I use that list of “negatives” as a guide in writing the copy. This approach produces some of the most powerful selling in print in the world.
 If this strategy is important to us, the people behind the scenes, who get paid as much to write one sales letter as many professionals earn in six months, then it is important to you, too!

# Six Steps for Using the Positive Power of
 Negative Preparation

## 1. Forget preconceived labels of “positive” or negative.” 2. Make a list of every question, concern, or objection that the other person could possibly come up with.
 3. Make a list of everything that could go wrong. 4. Develop positive responses to all the negatives you’ve thought of.
 5. Have your information, ideas, and documentation well organized so that you can lay your hands on the appropriate notes and materials at a moment’s notice.
 6. Take great confidence from your thorough preparation.
