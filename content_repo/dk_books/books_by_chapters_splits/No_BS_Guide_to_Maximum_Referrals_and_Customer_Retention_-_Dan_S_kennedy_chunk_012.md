##### making sure people invited the right prospects to her group presentations. Dr. Burleson also talks about it, a bit differently, in relationship to his event strategy. Check every person’s chapter or chapters. You’ll find this “secret” in subtext and context, if not overtly taught. The reason is simple: Really smart marketers learn that they can’t multiply zeroes. To be coarse, you can’t make tasty chicken salad out of noxious chicken shit. Those of us who prosper figure this out and then ruthlessly and aggressively (if quietly) apply it. We work hard at not bringing home sickly, sick fish for our ponds. The majority of dumb marketers who stay dumb reject this mandate. They sell like salesmen in the 1940s, before anybody knew the first thing about demographics, psychographics, and data—with the “anybody with a pulse and a wallet” method. This is the equivalent of farming by walking with a tiller behind a team of mules. It works. But there are better ways. The Amish continue with it for religious reasons. You are probably not restrained by religion when it comes to target marketing or prospect selection. Say Hallelujah! And, as long as we’re on the subjects of religion and target marketing, I have a book to recommend that is not one of my own (!). It’s a marketing book written for pastors and church leaders by the famous Pastor Rick Warren, titled The Purpose-Driven Church. What’s revealed inside the book may not strike you as angelic as the title. Get it, and learn about “Saddleback Sam,” their target. There is more to be learned about super smart marketing from this slim book than a Harvard MBA. I promise. You will see how it mates with the above vital statement.
 Everything in this book that you have in you hands now is multiplied in value many times over if coupled with laser-focused application of this one strategy: Do not bring home sickly, sick fish.

## The Number-One Best Retention Strategy

##### by Dan Kennedy

 he best retention is ascension.
 When you figure out how to structure your business with “membership concept” and then levels, so customers move from one level upward to the next, and then to the next, you will have

# Tconstructed a way to automatically improve retention. As their level of

##### commitment increases, their longevity automatically increases. Or, when they have an ascension aim they are working toward, their retention also automatically increases. If I’m only two months away from my next award, “belt,” pin, plaque; my next reward or reward level, rebate or gift, I’m much more likely to stay for two more months than if I’m just there, with no target within reach.
 At GKIC, there are a number of membership levels, but it is the step up from the lowest to the next, from what we call Gold to Diamond, that is most important. The retention rate for Diamond Members is the inverse of the retention rate for Gold. The best way to prevent losses of Gold Members is to upgrade them to Diamond. Diamond Members’ dues are about 450% higher than Gold Members’ dues, by the way, so don’t ever think retention is facilitated with lowest possible prices. Often, as it is for GKIC, the opposite is true. Of course, you’ll be tempted to say that the

##### GKIC business naturally lends itself to all this and your business doesn’t so easily do so, and you may or may not be right about that. It doesn’t matter. You can create it in most businesses. GKIC Members have done it with barber shops, pizza shops, car washes, accounting practices, chiropractic practices, clothing stores, and any number of other businesses. In every case, as soon as a member is ascended to a next level, the length of time they stay is extended, as well as, in many businesses, their frequency of purchase.

 Let’s take a car wash, and create membership. I’ll pick price points out of the air, just to make the example. A VIP Member gets up to three Deluxe Washes and Waxes a month, and is charged $29.00 on the first of each month. A Gold-VIP Member gets unlimited Deluxe Washes every month plus a full winterizing and anti-rust undercoating every October and a full detailing every April, and is charged $59.00 on the first of each month. A Diamond-VIP Member gets unlimited washes, the winterizing, and up to three detail jobs a year and is charged $89.00 a month. The Platinum-VIP has unlimited washes plus up to six times a year, they come, pick up his car, give him a luxury car as a loaner, clean and detail the car, and return it all spit-shined, plus the winterizing—and the car wash operator is proactive, not reactive, and makes sure the Member uses all the service he’s entitled to. They also pay for a Triple-A Auto Club Membership for him (which they get at a negotiated discount), and he gets four seats in a luxury skybox sometime during the year for the local team’s baseball games. For this, the Member is autocharged $469.00 a month. Which level of Member do you think stays the longest? Further, which level of Member do you think tells the most other people, i.e., brags to the most number of other people, about the amazing Car Care Club that he’s a Member of?
 I have been teaching “membership concept marketing” to businesses of varied breeds for over 25 years. It seems others are finally catching up, and acting as if they’ve invented something new! As I write this, there are several new business books about this, much lauded in media, the best of which is The Membership Economy by Robbie Bexter. I say: Welcome to the revolution. Too bad you got here so late, but it’s nice to have you anyway. Of course, if you did your homework and were transparent, you

##### would not only have given full credit to me and to GKIC for promulgating this throughout the small-business universe before you, but you also would have mentioned originators, like the Book of the Month Club, established in 1926. But that’s okay. Go ahead and pretend you’re radicals. And, despite all that, I recommend reading this book for the fullest understanding of “membership concept” you can get. But don’t miss the main point of leverage for retention: ascension and membership levels.

#### Why Do Members Ascend?
##### There are four reasons.

 • First, value propositions. It simply makes good sense to upgrade and
 be a higher level member, in financial terms. Usually this means getting more for less per unit. That might be more access, more use of facilities, more quantity of product.
 • Second, exclusive benefits and perks. Years ago, a very popular
 restaurant and night club in Phoenix converted to a Members First system. Out front, two rope lines: one for Members, the other for the nonmember public. Members were admitted first, and if there was capacity left over, nonmembers were admitted. VIP Members carrying Gold Cards checked in at the front but were then sent to the back door, where they were always guaranteed immediate admittance. As I recall, it was $100.00 a year for a regular Membership Card, but $500.00 a year for the VIP Card that got you recognized in front, then ushered in the back door, no waiting. They had to stop selling the VIP Cards for months at a time because of capacity issues.
 • Third, peer influence, “being seen,” recognition, and status. You’ll
 see smart charities publishing the names of their donors grouped into levels: Chairman’s Circle ($15,000.00 A Year), President’s Club ($9,000.00 a Year), Inner Circle ($3,500.00 a Year)—then just Supporters, with no dollar amount. This is both recognition and peer pressure.
 • Fourth, the nature and behavior of the person. This is the driver of
 ascension many business operators are clueless about, yet it is very significant. There is a percentage of people in every customer


-----

##### population who typically buy the most expensive option or level offered, or ascend to it as it is repeatedly shown to them, because that’s how they see themselves and how they want to be seen by others. By their purchases, they affirm their status to themselves. This is explored in more detail in my book, No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent, Second Edition.

 When you incorporate all four of these drivers into an organized ascension ladder put in front of your customers, many will move right on up! And those moving up are exponentially more likely to stay with you longer, split their business in your category with others less, i.e., be more loyal, spend more overall, be less price sensitive, and refer more and better customers.

## Oh, Him Again (No Referrals for You!)

##### by Shaun Buck

 e all have a friend or family member I like to call “that guy.” You know who I’m talking about—he’s the guy who, anytime you see his number on the caller ID, you know he is only calling to hit you up for a favor or for money. He is the

# Wguy who, no matter how many times you dodge him, always somehow finds

##### you. “That guy” is an annoying pest, but usually, because he is family to you in some way, shape, or form, you don’t end the relationship despite your secret desire to never have him ask you for another favor or “loan” again. Because of the relationship you have, you are willing to tolerate this annoyance in your life.
 When you see his number on caller ID, see his car pull up in the driveway, you say to yourself, “Oh, him again.”
 You know he only calls or comes by if and when he needs or wants something from you. He may act like you are his friend, but you know you are his friend only when he is a friend in need.
 When you look at most businesses and how they treat their customers, they act a lot like “that guy.”
 The average business only communicates with its customers when it wants or needs something. The average business owner may act friendly,


-----

##### yet he only appears when he is ready to ask for something.

 • “Buy my new product or service.”
 • “Pay your bill.”
 • “Can you give me a referral?”
 • “Will you write a good review for me?”
 • “Here is my ad with what’s on sale.”
 • “Can I have your email address so I can send you promotions?”
 • “Give me your cell phone number—I’ll text you coupons.”

 This is nearly every business. Does it remind you of someone? As business owners, many of us are “that guy” to our customers. They see our mail, see our message, hear our voice, and say to themselves, “Oh, him again.”
 Being perceived as an annoying pest isn’t how any business owner wants his customers to feel about him or his business. You don’t really want to be “Oh, him again.” But if you think about your customers as numbers or statistics, or think of your business in terms of sales and revenue and income (but not equity), think of your interaction with customers as transactional instead of relationship, you will very likely be that guy who only shows up when he wants something. You won’t think about it. It will just happen naturally, based on the way you think.
 If you continue down the path of the annoying pest, you open the door for your competitors to poach your customers as your customers look for greener, less-annoying pastures. It’s easy to tempt customers away, despite their satisfaction with your core goods and services, if they feel ignored, taken for granted, or abused.
 The good news is there is a simple solution—all you have to do is build relationships and add value to the lives of your customers. If you think that is what you already do with your product or service (so you can skip this step), think again. Simply being good at your craft is no longer good enough. People want to do business with people they know, like, and trust. Customers may never enunciate it, but they are hopeful of acknowledgement and appreciation. They may never tell you what to do for added value, but they’d like some. They don’t really want to be


-----

##### “consumers” or “customers.” They want to be in good relationships. They want to be remembered, thought of, informed, educated, entertained.
 Dan Kennedy often asks seminar audiences to raise their hands if they received a personal, handwritten thank-you note from anybody they spend money with in the past six months. Year? Longer? The raised hands are few. Then he asks how many, in just the past weeks, have received email more than once from at least ten merchants or service providers who they’ve spent money with before but have not gotten a direct thank you from in months, if ever. All the hands go up. He says this reveals how business owners think about their customers, and goes a long way to explaining the fast declining open-rate of emails even from merchants and providers known by and patronized by the people deleting the email. The way I’d put it is they see the email and think, “Oh, him again.”
 Dan correctly points out, too, that there are generational and demographic differences in how customers feel about being communicated with by different kinds of media, and he includes discussion of this in two books, No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent, Second Edition and No B.S. Guide to Marketing to Leading-Edge Boomers and Seniors. But he and I wholeheartedly agree that there are no differences in how customers want to feel about their relationship with a private practice professional, merchant, or service provider. Nor does this change with passage of time. Dale Carnegie’s basic truism about human nature is as true now as it was in the 1950s, when he popularized himself and his teaching with the book How To Win Friends and Influence People. Summarized, Dale advised seeing a tattoo on each and every person’s forehead: “Please Make Me FEEL IMPORTANT.” That tattoo does not say make me feel like an important source of money for your business. An important ATM for your use. It doesn’t even ask that you make me feel like an important customer. It begs: Make me feel important, period.
 So, here’s a really big suggestion: Before you get too deep into the methods and mechanics and minutiae of boosting retention, stopping losses, reactivating sleeping or lost customers, cross-selling and upselling, or stimulating referrals, stop and think about what kind of relationship you want to have with your customer as perceived by the customer. How you want him to think and feel about you. How you want him to react when you somehow show up.

#### A Step Back in Time
##### There is a lot of nostalgia. There are good reasons.
 A hundred years ago, almost all business was done locally. If you needed a loan, a banker or loan company didn’t check your credit history and use an algorithm to determine if you were creditworthy. You didn’t have a computer-assigned credit score. You weren’t a number. There’s a TV ad campaign for a loan company aimed at military veterans that uses this— the voice says, “At New Day, you aren’t a number. You’re a veteran.” It’s a very appealing idea. Back when all business was local, no banker treated you as a number. There was no application you filled out that got transferred to the home office for some unknown and unknowing pencil pusher to review. You simply walked into the bank and spoke with Jim, the president. As a regular at the bank, you already knew Jim. Jim knew you. Your kids went to the same school and you often ran into Jim and his family around town on the weekend. You knew his wife’s name and all three of his kids’ names—and roughly how old they were. When it was time to get a loan for a new house, you sat across from Jim in his office and spent the first part catching up. Then, you both got down to business, where you told Jim about the new house you were looking to buy. You talked about how beautiful it was and how the backyard was big enough to play baseball in. You didn’t need to tell Jim about the new promotion you got ten months ago because he already knew about it. Although you had been in Jim’s office for the better part of an hour, you were only a few short minutes into the business side of the conversation, and just like that, Jim agreed to lend you the money for the new house.
 Jim didn’t need to check your credit or talk to references. Jim didn’t need to look at your debt-to-income ratio or ask the local grocery if you were current on your weekly line of credit, because Jim already knew you. Although you and Jim were not best friends, he knew enough to know he could trust you.
 I suppose everybody knows it can’t be this way now. To some extent, it still works this way, sort of, in some small and rural towns, in the American heartland. But, by and large, local is an illusion. The local bank has been gobbled up and that bigger bank gobbled up, and may well be owned in part or whole by Canadians, Japanese, or Chinese investors and institutions.
