**There is a big difference between knowing what a problem is and stopping the behavior.**
**Selling on price is no different. Selling on price is like an addiction. Knowing the cold hard truth**
about profit may not be enough to prevent a relapse. You’re going to have to break the negotiating
habit cold turkey. You are not going to be able to allow deviation from your set prices. You can have
different prices that represent different levels of value; however there is absolutely no reason to strip
away profit. In short, price strategy as well as sales strategy must be strictly enforced.

It is not enough to say that you are the only person who can approve a discount. If you do this
then what do you think will happen? You will quickly become acquainted with the law of
unintended consequences. While you may have a brief reprieve from negotiating or unauthorized
discounting, you will ultimately end up with a constant barrage of requests for discounts. Your job
title will suddenly need to be changed from “boss” to “discounter-in-chief.”

This is why you should start by getting rid of negotiating altogether. It is one thing if you want to
have specific rules for how different customers secure different prices; it is altogether different to
allow random discounts through negotiating. The only way to break the negotiating habit is to go
cold-turkey. This is the only way you can force your staff to sell on value. If they have the option to
discount they will, always.

This is going to be tough, if you’ve been “loose” about it. In fact, if you have a sales staff there
are good odds there will be crying and complaining on a level that will remind you of watching a
middle aged meth addict on an episode of the reality show _Intervention telling his family all the_
reasons why they should continue enabling him. Still you must be strong if you want to get your
profitability back and want to protect it. This is not a time to be weak. It does not matter how good
your pricing strategy is if your staff undermines what you are doing.

While you’re breaking the negotiating habit another step you need to take is shifting the
commissions or bonuses you pay from gross to net. I bet you’ve never thought about that have you?
That’s okay, most businesses don’t. In fact I’ve yet to talk to a business owner that did before
consulting with me. Yet it’s such a common sense move if you think about it. When would you
expect an employee to have more incentive to protect your profit, when they get paid on the gross,
or on the net?

When you pay them on gross it is possible for you to take a loss while they still profit. Don’t
laugh, you’d be surprised how often this happens. I did it myself at one point. It happened because
costs crept up and I wasn’t paying enough attention to the net on components of a bundled offering.
There it was being pushed as part of a package and, concealed within the bundled price, it was being
sold for less than cost. Of course, commission was being paid on the gross sales, and they looked
very good.

If you have any salesperson who, after being educated about price and profit, and trained on
value-based selling rather than selling on price, continues to negotiate away your profit or continues
whining, complaining, blaming poor performance on your price strategy, badgering you about your
strategy, or poisoning the attitudes of others on your team—they’ve got to go.

## The Easiest Way to Protect Price and Profit Strategy Is …

That said, the easiest way to keep staff from screwing up prices and profits is to take it out of their
hands. This can even be true about you, the owner. If you are making all the sales, you may be the
staff person who needs to be removed from the process! The problem with you doing the selling is
that if you have already been discounting, then you will have a hard time saying no, especially with
spoiled clients. The human variable is a big one, because we have empathy and compassion, fear
and anxiety, bad habits. Process has none of these foibles, so the more of your selling is done by
process, the better.

**What does process in place of people actually mean? Some businesses can convert altogether,**
with customers buying online or from marketing materials with fixed prices presented and no
opportunity of attempting to negotiate. Some businesses do a better job of convincing people that
prices are fixed than others: people generally accept menu prices in restaurants but nobody gives
any credence to a car dealer’s posted or advertised price. For a time, GM’s separate brand, Saturn,
seemed to be making some headway in restoring belief in a sticker price, but they lacked the will to
stick with it and enforce it with dealers and their salespeople. At bare minimum, you can design a
marketing process that weeds out tire-kickers and committed price buyers before they even get face
to face with you or your salespeople, moving much of the selling forward into the advertising,
websites, online video, and literature they go through before arriving at a sales event, and that builds
value, exclusivity, scarcity, expertise, and authority for you and your product in the buyer’s mind
before that sales event. This is the kind of marketing methods that my friends at Glazer-Kennedy
Insider’s Circle[™] are so ingenious and effective at guiding people to, in hundreds of different kinds
of businesses, which is good reason to accept their invitation on page 234.

Although moving toward process in place of people is an admirable aspiration, I’m sorry to say
that most businesses will never fully escape the human variable; the owner, sales representative,
sales clerk, waitperson, service technician being face to face with a customer or prospective
customer and presenting price and responding to push-back.

## Get on Board or Get Out

**Ultimately, you cannot protect your price strategy or your profits without training, ongoing**
**coaching, smart incentives,** **_and firing._**

As a result of reading this book, you are going to want to make changes throughout your
business, but particularly with respect to price strategy. When change happens there is usually
someone who refuses to get on board. There is only one answer to this person, and it is simple. Get
on board or get out. If you have staff that won’t get on board with the program, they have to go
NOW. I am a firm believer in this. The old saying is true: one bad apple will spoil the whole damn
bunch. You cannot afford to be unduly tolerant or patient.

How do you know who the rotten apple is? The most likely candidate will be someone who has
depended heavily on discounting in order to make sales. It could even be the person you thought
was your rockstar salesperson. He represents a real danger to you when you take away or rein in use
of the tool he has been relying on to eat. You’ll have to be out on the floor, on the alert. Where,
when, and from whom are you hearing or over-hearing grumbling? Who is having the most
difficulty making the transition? Who is blatantly disobeying your orders or pushing customer
complaints up to you?

Some people just don’t have the right mindset to sell at premium prices, or even at fixed prices.
Some people resent affluent customers, some do not believe customers who buy based on factors
other than price even exist, some are not willing to work harder to make sales at higher, fixed prices,
even if it benefits them financially to do so. There are lots of reasons that someone may be a happy
staffperson or productive salesperson in one place but a constant complainer, trouble-maker, or
failure in another. You have to keep an eye out for problem people in your place and deal with them
as quickly as possible.

## NO B.S. Price Strategy Warning #7

Any idiot can come up with a long list of reasons why he can’t implement and enforce the

best possible strategies in his business. That kind of thinking isn’t even worth paying

minimum wage for. “But MY Business Is Different!” is the rallying cry of the poor.
Creative adaptation is the behavior of the rich. If your reaction to the Chapters to this
point has been to quickly invalidate much as things YOU can’t do in YOUR business,
stop here, return to the beginning, and start over. This is especially true of Price Strategy.

The business owner who clings to past Strategy FOR ANY REASON lets his past

determine his future.

I once had a woman who came highly recommended to our company. Her background and her
references looked fantastic. We let her get into a position that was important to one of our programs.
Unfortunately she was shocked by the price we were selling a certain service for. She could not get
her head around the idea that it was actually a good thing. We tried everything. We talked about the
costs to run the program. We talked about the income level of the clientele. We talked in-depth
about the fact that high prices are a good thing because they support exceptional service and
actually help to develop newer and better products and services. We even tried having her read highend magazines such as ROBB Report in an effort to expand her mind to the reality of just how much
money exists. After a period of time she play-acted like she got it. Still, my better judgment told me
she was not committed. She wasn’t. Aside from the damage she caused while with us, she
eventually walked out on the company without notice, leaving us scrambling to fill the void. Better I
should have sent her packing earlier. When a member of your staff is a problem, they have to get on
board or get out. If not, it will cost you much more to keep them than it will to let them go. It’s
better to cut your losses than to let them magnify.

Price integrity and profitability in a business are very fragile assets. They are unable to protect
themselves. They need a big, strong, resolute defender. That defender has to be you.

## CHAPTER 21

 A Jury of Four But Only One Decides Fate

 Dan Kennedy

**There are four jurors of your prices and price strategy:**

1. You
2. Your Staff, Associates, Family, and Friends
3. Your Peers
4. Your Customers

Only one of these jurors has any right to rule your fate.

#2. _Your staff, associates, family, and friends all have many reactions, thoughts, feelings, and_
opinions about your prices. Most think they are too high—or worse, unfair, unreasonable, predatory,
or stupid—regardless of how low they may be. Lowering them to curry favorable opinions from
these folks is futile and foolish. These negative and critical opinions link to four things you should
live so long as to alter: one, a generally held negative opinion of all business owners and sellers;
two, a generally held negative opinion, resentment, and envy of the self-employed, the successful,
and the rich; three, a generally held negative opinion of the prices of anything and everything; and
four, a complete ignorance or misunderstanding of economics, free enterprise, business, costs of
doing business, and virtually everything in this book.

[Cartoon reprinted from advertising for Dan’s book No B.S. Wealth Attraction in The New Economy.](http://www.amazon.com/B-S-Wealth-Attraction-Economy-ebook/dp/B004RUGVWU/)

I can assure you, if you hand the pricing gun and supply of blank price stickers over to anybody
on this list, they will set your prices lower than even you would have set them before reading this
book. For that reason, you dare not hand over the _emotional pricing gun either. They cannot be_
permitted influence on your price strategy, prices, or your own thoughts and feelings about them.
Whatever “stuff” of theirs that you invite or allow into your thoughts will pollute or poison, not
enrich and nourish.

There may be instances where you feel it’s advisable to pretend to welcome and consider their
input on these matters. But never take any of it seriously.

-----

#3. _Your competitors, your business neighbors, your peers in your industry, peers who are_
members of the same trade association, and maybe some grand pooh-bahs of your industry or its
association also have many reactions, thoughts, feelings, and opinions about your prices. Most think
they are too high—or worse, unfair, unreasonable, predatory, or stupid—regardless of how low they
may be. Lowering them to curry favorable opinions from these folks is futile and foolish. You might
mitigate envy and resentment with acquiescence, but then again you might not, and anyway, really,
is the approval of people who make no actual contribution to your success or security so important?
Some of these critics can be very vocal, some can be bullies. Know that the louder they screech or
the more they bully, the more envious and resentful they are. Their secret disappointment with their
own finances is acted out in disapproval of you, your business practices, and your success. I can
assure you that Jason and his wife are, to their faces and behind their backs, talked about as pirates,
by all those working for wages in government bureaucracies and all the other therapists in private
practices barely making a living. I have been characterized this way by peers in every profession
and business I’ve been or am involved in—professional speaking, consulting, direct-response
copywriting, and with my information products, trainings, and seminars. I fly the pirate flag happily.
Tongue in cheek, I even used the pirate theme for a seminar of mine called Wealth Days—we
showed pirate movies, gave everybody skulland-cross bones goodie bags and pirate hats, had a big
cardboard pirate ship in the room for photos, and decorated with pirate flags.

The only real way to be well-accepted and popular with peers is to be pitiable, to be poorer than
they are.

#1. You. Your thoughts and feeling about your price strategy and, in broader sense, about money,
prosperity, and wealth matter a great deal. Since you are writing your own paycheck as you price,
your thoughts _are essentially your bank balance. This is why philosophy matters and can’t be_
separated from the practical aspects of business success. But even you don’t have real power here.

#4. The only juror with real power over your destiny. The customer. It is how he reacts, thinks,
and feels about your pricing that determines whether the paycheck you wrote for yourself clears the
bank or bounces back, marked NSF in nasty red letters. If he reacts positively and every friend and
relative and peer and staff-person you have reacts negatively, you will be financially victorious. If
friends, family, peers, and employees were ever to react positively to your pricing (and your
success)—an unlikely miracle—but the customer reacts negatively, you will be poor.

There is, of course, great responsibility on you to present self and products and services and
prices in the best manner possible, to the best qualified customers obtainable, in order to
successfully sell at the highest prices and profits possible. That’s not the customer’s responsibility at
all. It’s all yours. But then he is the lone juror with legitimate clout.

Too much attention given to the judgments of the jurors with no legitimate clout is how people
undermine their own ambition and achievement.

## CHAPTER 22

 Price in Recessions

 Dan Kennedy

**The fear-based, panic-driven, wimp—embraced price strategy of the recent recession has been to**
drop prices as far as they could be dropped, and by necessity, drop quality, service, and customer
experience right along with it.

This flies in the face of one of the great, universal truths about price: that the overwhelming
majority of buyers of any product(s) or service(s) prefer making their choices based on criteria other
than lower price, and will do so, and spend more than the cheapest available price and/or more than
originally intended when given a good reason/value proposition and sufficient emotional motivation
_to do so. This changes only slightly during tough economic times. If the combination of chronic,_
cyclical, and incidental unemployment runs 4% in good times and hits 12% in bad times, that’s still
only another 8% of consumers who may be so severely challenged financially that they deviate from
their normal buying behaviors. Walmart reported getting customers through their doors in very
recent years for the first time who have been “trading down” in response to the recession, loss of
one of the two incomes in the household, investment losses or, absent need, a frugality impulse
prompted by daily bombardment by the news media about the horrors of the recession. However, to
Walmart’s frustration, most of these customers are picking up savings on basics—paper towels and
cleaning supplies, big bags of chips, and pet food—but still buying most everything else somewhere
else. Of course, Walmart is already in the lowest-prices, high-volume business. Other merchants,
service providers, and B2B vendors who stampeded in fear toward cheapest price territory did not
necessarily find it to be higher, safer ground. Many left their profit margins behind without gaining
volume or even maintaining accustomed volume, and actually made their circumstances worse.
