     What Holds You Back?
    What Moves You Forward?
  We often think about "external forces" holding us back or
   moving us fonA^ard. Things outside ourselves and, to
    varying degrees, outside our control. Some of these
    "external forces" include:
              - "I grew up in a bad neighborhood"
               - "I don't have a car to get to w^ork"
                   - "My boss doesn't like me"
           - 'The economy's very bad here in my town"
   What we'd like to explore a bit in this Chapter are Internal
    forces" that hold us back or move us forward. Often, the
    external forces are not as influential and powerful in reality
   as they are in our own minds. After all, ifs comfortable to
   blame other people or circumstances beyond our control for
    things we're not happy or proud about. Unfortunately,
    people learn 'The Blanrie Game" early in life — as kids, 'tie
    started it!". . ."Bobby made me do it." etc. — and then carry
    that into adult life, even though it is nriore of a handicap than
   a help. Only by honestly examining the internal forces can
   you begin to really control your present and your future.
   One such internal force is a thing psychologists call "Self-
    Image." This literally means the image or picture you hold
     in your mind about yourself. Lots of things contribute to
    the self-image. Things your parents or other family
   members said repeatedly about you and to you as you
   were growing up. Things your friends or co-workers now
                          make

      It is said that you cannot out-perform your self-image.
   Your self-image serves sort of like a thermostat in your
  house — the thennostat limits how hot it gets in the
  summer or how cold it gets in the winter; the self-image
    limits what you might attempt and what you might
   accomplish, even what you might earn. Consider the
   person who sees herself as "shy". . ."not good at
   persuading people". . ."can't sell". . ."the quiet type." She
  may never even attempt speaking out and presenting her
   ideas at work or leading a committee or task force at work
   or in her church. But is she really so limited?
   Probably only by her self-image. You see, there really is no
   such thing as a 'tK)m" leader or 'lDom" salesperson or 't)om"
   communicator There really is no such thing as a genetically shy
   person. These are all acquired beliefs and learned behaviors.
    In her childhood, she may have had strict and protective
   parents, and constantly heard such things as "speak only
  when spoken to" and "don't talk to strangers." Maybe one
   of her close childhood playmates was very outgoing and
   aggressive, so that friend always "led" and she always
   'lollowed." Through this "programming," she built a self-
  image early, as a "shy person." Then she begins choosing
  what she will do and won't do based on this idea, so her
   experience reinforces her self-image. Before long, she
  has drawn a line in the sand across which she tries never
   to cross. If no one or no thing ever shoves her across that
    line, she may never discover what is often true: As an
   adult, she has abilities and talents unknown to her.

    HOW TO DISCOVER YOUR HIDDEN
     TALENTS AND NEW INTERESTS
  When a person says "I'm not much of a reader" or "I don't
     like to read," often the truth is that he never learned to
   read well and, since school, has let what reading skills he
    did have get rusty. Further, he was always forced to read,
   so he naturally resists it.
   Most adults share this experience: There is some food,
   maybe a vegetable, you hated as a kid, haven't eaten in
   a long time, and absolutely believe you don't like. For one
   reason or another, you taste it for the first time in years
   and discover that, now, it tastes good to you!
   This same kind of experience can happen with anything,
    including this example: reading. j
   When a person says something like "I'm no good with J
   computers. Its just too complicated for me," often the truth ^
     is that they simply lack information, knowledge, training
   and assistance about that particular subject or skill.

  sports. Thafs just the way I am." (By saying these things,
  he was verbalizing part of his self-image, describing the
  picture he canied in his mind about himself.)
  One day, somebody pointed out to him how much playing
  pool has to do with — geometry! This caused him to look
  at the game of pool in an entirely new way. Then he got
  interested in it. He tried playing, with this new knowledge.
  And, to his surprise, he discovered that his understanding
  of the angles made up for less-than-terrific physical
  dexterity. He could play well and he enjoyed it. Then, by
  playing regularly, his physical skills naturally improved
  too. After a year, he was routinely beating his friends and
  started entering tournaments.
  The way to uncover your own hidden talents and interests
   is simply to experiment. Instead of saying 'Thafs just the
  way I am," say "I'll try that."
 HOW TO STRENGTHEN SKILLS OR ABILITIES
 When you decide to develop some skill or ability,
  especially one that may be new and relatively unfamiliar
  or uncomfortable, you may benefit from some or all of the
  five ways top athletes and businesspeople alike
  strengthen their skills:
                 1. Visualization
                2. Affirmation
                3. Education
                4. Association
                5. Action
  VISUALIZATION means forming and holding pictures in

```

     practice. And, in mental practice, athletes practice perfectly.
    Basketball players, for example, have proven they can
    improve their success at shooting baskets from the foul line
     just by sitting in a quiet room for an hour, "imagining"
    themselves standing on the foul line and shooting one perfect
    basket after another. The imagination IS a powerful thing.
     Ironically, as a kid, you may have been accused of being
    a "day-dreamer." Yet the truth is that "day-dreaming" has
   a place and serves a constructive purpose.
     Let's say that you feel weak in communication skills and
    dread going on job interviews. You might build a "mental
    movie" of you going on a job interview, getting along very
    well with the interviewer, being calm and relaxed,
    answering the questions brilliantly, and getting hired
     instantly. Dr. Maxwell Maltz, an early pioneer in self-image
    psychology*, called this using 'The Theater In Your Mind."
    To make this "mental movie" realistic, you would consult a
    couple books on interviewing skills, to learn techniques,
    and you would make up or get a list of questions most
    interviewers would ask, and use those questions in your
    "mental movie." Once built and run, your "mental movie"
      is stored in memory and can be recalled at will.
     Visualization, then, is simply the re-running of this "mental
    movie" over and over and over again.
    Another term for all this is "synthetic experience."
    Synthetic means imitation or substitute — for example,
    cotton is "real" fabric, a polyester-cotton blend is called a
     "synthetic" fabric because it perfectly imitates the real
     thing. Now here's a very interesting thing about how your

```

```
   real experience. For example, your blood pressure might
  go up and you might get a severe headache from
  worrying about taking a big test, just as your blood
  pressure would go up and you would get a headache
  whenever you actually had to take the test. That's
  because the subconscious mind can't tell the difference
  between the synthetic experience (worry) or the real one
  (taking the test), so it tells the body to react the same way
  both times. Once you understand all that, you can make
     it wori< to your benefit.
  Go back to the job interview. If you've had that interview
  as synthetic experience enough times, over and over, and
  remained perfectly calm, relaxed, confident and had
  success each time, when the real thing starts — the
  actual job interview — your subconscious mind says to
   itself: "Hey, I remember this. Been here. Done this. I know
  exactly what I'm supposed to do and how this guy's body
   is supposed to react." Then the subconscious mind sends
  out its directives to the rest of you: "Relax," it tells the
  nervous system. It triggers the memory for the best
  responses to the questions. It re-creates the already
  rehearsed event.
  AFFIRMATION is another means of "programming" the
  subconscious mind. Sometimes this is called "self-talk."
  Most people talk to themselves all the time, constantly,
  though usually silently. And most such self-talk
  unfortunately reinforces negative self-image beliefs. Here's
  an example: John locks his keys in the car. To himself, he
  says: "You idiot!" Then: "I can't seem to remember
  anything. I'm such a screw-up." John has translated the
  incident into an indictment, a criticism of himself. Its

```

```
    things everyday, yet, in self-talk, you probably do not praise
    yourself for doing those things. But make a mistake, and
    you're all over yourself, like your worst enemy!
   The reason that is so harmful is that your subconscious
   mind accepts cumulative affirmations (the same
    affirmation heard and said repeatedly) as a "command,"
    then it does everything in its power to fulfill the command.
        If you tell it that you are clumsy over and over again, it will
    exert its control over your physical body to literally make
   you even clumsier.
   The good news is that you can tell it something you want
    to be over and over again, and it will work on making that
   command a reality. Now this is not "magic." It won't do
   much by itself. But as a reinforcement tool, it can be very
    powerful. Let's say you're always late and have decided
    to change that about yourself. You have chosen a new
    direction; you are going to be a punctual person. Your
    affirmations might be:
             1. I am the kind of person who
         always shows up on time.
            2. Being on time and reliable is
          very important tome.
            3. I value and respect my own
          time and others' time, so
                 I honor my commitments.
   You might want to write these down on a 3x5 [card] until
   you memorize them. Then you should say them[ out][ loud]
    at least several times a day. Repeat them[ out][ loud][ or]

```

```
   But, just saying these affirmations and doing nothing else
   will have a very limited effect. But saying these affirmations
  while also DOING certain things to improve your on time
   behavior; setting all your clocks and watch 15 minutes
  ahead, starting to use an appointment calendar, picking
  out the day's clothes the night before; the combination of
   Affirmations and Actions can be very dramatic.
   Incidentally, today's "sports psychologists," relied on by
   virtually every pro team, individual pro athletes, and Olympic
   athletes all use "affirmations" as one of their tools. Athletes
  who get in a slump — the baseball player who stops hitting,
   the football player who starts fumbling the ball, the golfer
  who starts slicing — all tend to "get down on themselves"
   with negative, critical self-talk. And the more of that they do,
   the worse the problem gets. The kind of constructive
   affirmations we just discussed have been proven helpful in
   turning such situations around and getting these athletes out
   of their slumps. If ifs good enough for multi-million dollar a
  year pro athletes, maybe its something you should learn
  more about and experiment with too.
    (*lf visualization, affirmation and similar techniques interest you,
  a good place to begin leaming more is with Dr. Maxwell Maltz'
   original book, Psycho-Cybemetics,' which you can easily obtain
   at the public library or almost any bookstore.
  EDUCATION or INFORMATION is the next important
   tool. Simply put, the more you know about something, the
   less intimidating or difficult it is to deal with.
  Think about skydiving, for example. To someone who
  has never done it, and knows nothing about it except

```

-----

```
                         let's say you to do it, for
   one reason or another — maybe you lost a bet! — and
   you had time to prepare. How could you reduce the
    fear and improve your chances, not only of survival,
    but of doing it well and enjoying it?
   One thing that would help would be seeing how the
    parachutes themselves are "rigged" or assembled.
    This is a painstaking process with many checks and
    double-checks. Then you could read a book, maybe
   watch a video about skydiving. Then you could go to a
    "skydiving school" — required in almost every place
    before you are allowed to jump. At the "school," you
    learn how to properly exit the plane, position your body,
    count, pull the cord, navigate and land. You practice
   each of these things over and over, with the help of a
    very experienced instructor. Finally, on your first jump,
    there's a safety cord from your chute to the instructor,
     in the plane, so even if you should 'freeze up' and not
     pull your cord on time, he'll pull it for you. As you went
    through all of this, chances are excellent that your
    fears and worries were diminished and your interests
    increased. That's the way the human mind works.
    Of course, you may have NO interest whatsoever in
    skydiving. But you can benefit from this same "process"
    with any skill you want to learn, improve or master. By
    exposing yourself to as much information about it as
    possible, your confidence and your competence will
    automatically get stronger.

    in two ways, one skill. We talked about
   by reading, and association in the previous
    the other by Chapter, too. If you want to
    association with get good (or better) at
    smarter people." something, then it just
         - Will Rogers makes sense to hang out
    Famous American with people who are good
     "cowboy humorist"
                     or better than you are at
                     that thing. If you bowl, for
  example, you'll never get better if the only people you
  bowl with are less skilled than you are. To get better as a
  bowler, you'd bowl with people slightly better than you are,
  who would challenge you, from whom you could learn by
  observing.
  ACTION is the fifth tool. None of the above tools are of
  much value unless and until you take action on your
  thoughts and ideas. And, incidentally, most people drop
  the ball right here, over and over again, throughout their
   entire lives. The world is full of people who will tell you
  about the "great idea" they had, did nothing about, then
  saw someone else turn it into a successful product or
  business. Procrastination — the putting off of doing
  something — is the universal language of the POOR!
     If you study successful people in any field, but especially
   in the business world, in terms of careers, you'll quickly
  notice that they have a tendency to quickly follow
  decisions with actions. You become what you DO, not
  what you think or say, and not what others think or say
  about you.

   Run this mental movie at least once a day, every day for
   30 days — you'll probably be surprised by related events
    that occur in your life!
