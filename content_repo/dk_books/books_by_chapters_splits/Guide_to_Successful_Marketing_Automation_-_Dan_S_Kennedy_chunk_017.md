###### haystack is your needle. But time is money, and every tick of the clock is a reminder of the opportunity cost mounting with every passing second. The hours spent scouring through data, analyzing consumer behavior, and trying to decode the cryptic language of the market often feel like trying to draw blood from a stone. It’s a Sisyphean task, pushing the boulder of research uphill, only to watch it roll back down in an endless, maddening cycle.
 Many business owners just give up. With their marketing, they fly by the seat of their pants. They have a mountain of data, but can’t mine it. So they just move on.
 Imagine the agony of crafting what seems like a perfect piece of copy, only to watch it flop, lifeless and unresponsive, in the real world. The pain of this failure is not just a bruise to the ego; it’s a direct hit to the wallet. Every misstep, every miscalculated message, is money down the drain, opportunities slipping like sand through fingers.
 Whatever you put out to your customers or potential customers in emails, in videos, in all media has to get the right prospect’s attention and really connect with his motivations—but how can you be sure of doing that? The quest to understand the customer, to speak their language, and to tap into their deepest desires—not just push out bland, uninteresting content and sales copy. You’re not just writing words; you’re a miner, digging deep into the psyche of your market. But here’s the brutal truth: Most of you are digging with spoons when you need shovels. You scrape the surface, but never strike gold. The real desires, the raw, unspoken needs of your audience, remain buried, untouched.
 Worse still, there’s the looming specter of irrelevance. The stakes are sky-high. The market is unforgiving. Miss the mark with your copy, and it’s not just a campaign that fails; it’s a piece of your business dying. It’s not just lost sales; it’s a slow fade into obscurity. Imagine the pain of watching customers flock to your competitors, seduced by words you could have written, by secrets you could have uncovered.
 What if your competitor cracks the code? What if they speak to your audience’s deepest desires while you’re still guessing? Can you afford to watch as they capture the hearts, minds, and wallets of the very people

###### you’re trying to reach? How will you feel when you realize the market has moved on without you?
 So ask yourself, business owner, are you really digging deep enough? Are you truly understanding the fears, desires, and dreams of your audience? Or are you just skimming the surface, playing it safe? What will it cost you if you don’t find the key to unlock the true potential of your words? What are you willing to do to ensure that it’s your voice that resonates, your message that converts, and your business that thrives?

#### Frameworks Exist for Crafting Prospect Based Messaging

###### Enter Eugene Schwartz and his groundbreaking frameworks from Breakthrough Advertising.
 Schwartz’s methods—famous to most pro copywriters— aren’t just theories; they are time-tested, efficient solutions to the very problem you’re facing. His approach simplifies the chaos of market research, transforming it into a structured, manageable process. By following his steps, you can save time, reduce frustration, and, most importantly, find the key insights to connect deeply with your customers. You can sort the information obtained for you by Marketing Automation into usable material.
 One of the core elements of Schwartz’s teachings is the concept of the 5 Stages of Customer Awareness. This framework is crucial because it recognizes that not all customers are the same. They are at different stages in their journey:

1. Unaware
2. Problem-Aware
3. Solution-Aware
4. Product-Aware
5. Most Aware (2+3+4)

###### Each stage requires a different approach in your copywriting, a tailored message that resonates with where the customer is in their journey. Why is this important? Because a message that hits the mark can mean the difference between a passing glance and a lasting engagement. For instance,

-----

###### a Problem-Aware customer knows they have a problem, but might not know solutions exist, or at least may not have looked for them. Your copy needs to empathize with their pain and introduce your product as a solution. Conversely, a Product-Aware customer already knows what options are out there from your competition and knows (or thinks he knows) what you offer, but has not acted on what he knows to make a purchase.
 Using Schwartz’s frameworks is not just about making your life easier; it’s about being effective and efficient in your marketing efforts. It’s about understanding your customers on a deeper level and crafting messages that not only resonate with them but also compel them to take action.

#### How to Do Meaningful Research to Categorize Your Prospects by the Schwartz
 Frameworks

###### Conducting market research for effective copywriting, as outlined by Eugene Schwartz in Breakthrough Advertising, involves a systematic and thorough approach that encompasses understanding both the market and the product in-depth. Here are the steps in the process.

##### Thorough Analysis of the Market

###### This initial step involves an in-depth exploration of the market for the specific product. The aim is to understand the market’s breadth and depth comprehensively. This includes identifying the key emotional forces that drive the market and defining these forces in terms of a singular image, desire, or need. This step is crucial in understanding what motivates the market, what it seeks, and how it behaves. WHY do the people you intend selling to respond to certain analogical companies and their advertising? WHY do they buy comparable products and services—and not buy others? Whether you are a start-up or you have been in business for years, looking

###### for answers to these questions is important to do well repeatedly, not just once.

##### Meticulous Study of the Product

###### After analyzing the market, the next step is a detailed examination of the product itself. This involves understanding what the product is, its functionalities, and the benefits it offers. The focus here is on identifying all the satisfactions and performances the product can deliver. The goal is to distill these into a single compelling claim that effectively taps into the strongest emotional force within the market. You aren’t just presenting a product and its virtues. You are connecting certain virtues of the product with what you know about the market’s motivations; its collective psyche.

##### Synthesis of Market and Product Insights

###### Combining the insights from the first two steps leads to the formulation of the core theme of the advertising effort. This theme encompasses the desire the market demands and how the product satisfies it, the need the market feels and the solution the product offers, and the identification the market seeks and how the product expresses it.

##### Expressing the Theme

###### With the theme identified, the process moves into expressing it effectively. This involves exploring the market’s maturity level and understanding how much the market knows about the product, what they have been informed about similar products, and their overall interest and care in these aspects.

##### Identifying the Point of Entry for the Headline

###### From the comprehensive analysis comes the crucial point of entry for the advertising headline. This is the point that garners the greatest interest and

###### acceptance from the target audience. It could be centered around the product’s unique features, its price, performance, the satisfaction it promises, the need it fulfills, or a unique aspect of the market itself.

##### Commencement of Copywriting

###### Finally, with the point of entry identified, the actual process of writing the copy begins. This marks the transition from research and planning to the creative expression of the core message in a way that resonates with the target audience.
 In summary, the process is about deeply understanding both the market and the product, synthesizing these insights to form a compelling advertising theme, and then effectively expressing this theme to resonate with the target audience.

#### How to Get Them to Tell You Where They Are
 in the Framework and What They Really
 Want

###### There are a lot of information-gathering tactics and tools usable in online media, easily automated. An innocent-looking survey can automatically put everybody saying Yes to Question #3 into one group, to automatically get a specifically relevant email sequence and put everybody saying No into a different group to get a different email sequence. A choice of a particular Special Report out of a dozen offered can reveal a specific interest and trigger its own automated marketing. From the chiropractor, John Prospect picks “How to Stop Backache and Increase Mobility for a Better Golf Game” and Jim Prospect picks “How to Look & Feel 10 Years Younger— Without Surgery or Drugs.” Neither should get a generic presentation about chiropractic. Both shouldn’t get the same presentation. These are simple tricks you can build into your marketing.

###### For prospect and customer information gathering, organizing data, classifying customers, and writing copy, I’ve learned to love “chat.” Enter “Chatvatars”—using ChatGPT to create avatars for each of Schwartz’s 5 Stages of Customer Awareness.
 Are you ready to see what leveraging a tool like chat could look like for your business? Here’s the prompt I gave chat for this illustrative example:

Call the process “Chatvatars.” And list 17 unique and compelling reasons why the small business owner should use ChatGPT to create the “Chatvatars” that focus on the functional, dimensional, and emotional benefits of saving time, increasing the likelihood of success, saving frustration, saving money, and writing better copy.

 Now, notice how much stronger the copy is when I enhance it with a prompt derived from two titans of direct response, the late great Clayton Makepeace and the inimitable Todd Brown:
 According to Todd Brown’s definitions of functional, dimensional, and emotional benefits, give me a functional, dimensional, and emotional benefit for each of these [number of features] features for my [type] brand:

-----

###### [number of features] Features: [list your features]

 First, let me give you clear and detailed explanations of terms according to Todd Brown…
 We’ll start with a clear explanation of the term “feature” according to Todd Brown:
 A “feature”: Simply a fact about the products As a reminder, here are all the features of our products I need unique functional, dimensional, and emotional benefits for:

 [list your features] Next, let’s clearly define the term “functional benefit”: A “functional benefit”: What a given feature does for the prospect. How a given feature improves the prospect’s life. The impact the feature has on the prospect.
 State the functional benefit in comparative terms. For example, Feature: EVA Antimicrobial Foam Functional Benefit: Effectively kills 50 percent more bacteria and fungi to keep your shoes hygienic and fresh.
 “Keep your shoes hygienic and fresh” is a benefit of the way the “EVA Antimicrobial Foam” feature functions or performs.
 Now, let’s clearly define the term “dimensional benefit”: The “dimensional benefit,” originated by renowned copywriter Clayton Makepeace, describes what the functional benefit looks like in the real life of the prospect. How the functional benefit plays out in their lives.
 According to Todd Brown… The dimensional benefit: Paints a vivid picture of how the prospect experiences the functional benefit in his or her life.
 Start the sentence of your dimensional benefit with the phrase “So you can…”
 For example, Functional Benefit: Effectively kills 99.9 percent of bacteria and fungi to keep your shoes hygienic and fresh.

-----

###### Dimensional Benefit: So you can wear your shoes without worrying about any foul odors or stains caused by bacteria and fungi.
 Finally, let’s clearly define the term “emotional benefit”: An “emotional benefit”: The emotional impact of the dimensional benefit. How the prospect will feel emotionally when they experience that dimensional benefit.
 Start the sentence of your functional benefit with the phrase “You will feel…”
 For example, Dimensional Benefit: So you can wear your shoes without worrying about any foul odors or stains caused by bacteria and fungi.
 Emotional Benefit: You will feel confident and self-assured knowing that your shoes are always hygienic and fresh, no matter how much you wear them.
 Make sense? So again, I need you to give me a different functional, dimensional, and emotional benefit for each one of the following features of my brand: [list your features]
 Now watch how much better that list of 17 reasons gets when written as functional, dimensional, and emotional benefit statements. Here’s my prompt:
 Now write functional, dimensional, and emotional benefits for each of the 17 compelling reasons listed above.
 And here’s the output:
