Another, related price strategy is membership with pre-purchased services, that may not be fully
utilized, thus giving you the extra profit of “breakage” or non-redemption. You’re most familiar
with this in the fitness club industry. But if you’ll visit [KennedysBarberClubs.com you’ll find an](http://kennedysbarberclubs.com/)
outstanding example of tiered levels of membership incorporating pre-purchased services, with a set
monthly fee charged to the member’s credit card on file. Some percentage of members do not utilize
all they’ve paid for every month, and the non-fulfillment pushes the overall business’ profit up. Of
course, the members fully utilizing their pre-paid benefits are most likely to remain members for
life, ascend from lower to higher level, and refer, so the breakage is a double-sided coin. But on one
side, there is heightened profit. Keep in mind this concept is being done with barber shops. Not a
country club with a golf course, bar, restaurant, or card room. A barber shop. Also, these members
have access to buying proprietary products at the stores not included in monthly membership, so,
they are paying for the privilege of buying.

There will be growing controversy over closed-door, membership based medical practices if
anything close to the “Obamacare” legislation hustled through a see-no-evil Congress in 2010
actually gets implemented, because more and more MD’s will convert from open-door to this
model, freezing out Medicare and Medicaid patients and other insureds with poor coverage—to the
point that you may have a little card that says you have health insurance, but you may find it
damnably difficult to get health care. More like trying to redeem frequent flier miles than the current
system. This trend has already been taking hold, but it may accelerate. The AMA and the federal
government are both “critical” of concierge and closed-door, membership practices because they
can see the writing on the wall of the trouble brewing, but unless and until the government passes
law to tell doctors they must practice with doors open to all, more and more practices will be
converted to these models.

The typical closed-door practice conversion looks like this: a letter goes out to, say, 4,000 patients
who get care there, from frequently to periodically, telling them a switch to preferred, members’
only care is occurring; describing benefits to members; and playing the scarcity card—that only 400
members will be accepted out of the 4,000 current patients. This the equal of having 10 people
standing 50 feet from the stage, dragging but one stool on stage, and telling the 10 only one can get
to sit on stage in the magic seat and have a chance to win a car. The 400 members may pay from
$1,000.00 to as much as $5,000.00 per year for “exclusive” access to the doctor(s) and a collection
of included services, such as regular exams, treatment of run-of-the-mill problems like colds, flu,
etc., supervision of hospital care any time it is needed (but many other tests and treatment are extra,
on a cafeteria menu—so the member-patients are paying for right to buy). At an average fee of just
$2,000.00 times 400, the doctor has locked in $800,000.00 in revenue, a large portion paid in
advance of any utilization, with none of that money subject to insurer interference, discounting or
delayed reimbursement. The net profit in it, after costs of delivery of included services, will be
substantially higher than the normal net profit from pay as you go and insurance billed services.
Generally speaking, the doctor will have better, more compliant patients and a less stressful
practice. As of this writing, there are approximately 5,000 concierge or membership medicine
doctors in the United States, including those in the Pinnacle Care Health Advisory network. The
number is expected to increase as much as 10-times in just two years, spurred, as I said, by doctors’
disgust with Obamacare. I expect similar models to gain traction with dental, chiropractic, and other
practices. (Source: Wikipedia, Concierge Medicine, 7/2010.)

This, incidentally, is not as new or unorthodox in other types of professional practices, notably
accounting, financial services, and investment management, where retainers and annual fees have
been around for quite some time.

So, let’s assume you own a popular, always busy, and, on weekends, crazy-busy restaurant. You
could offer a VIP Membership including guaranteed reservations on weekends requested as late as
Thursday evenings, seating in a velvet-roped or glass-walled VIP section with service by the waiter
of your choice guaranteed, and special members’ only events—like wine tastings—for X-dollars a
year, let’s say $495.00, or with one pre-paid, all-inclusive dinner for two per month bundled in, at
$2,000.00, available only to 100 people. At $495.00: $49,500.00 At $2,000.00: $200,000.00. Some
or all, 100% net profit. Many years ago, when I lived in Phoenix, a popular night club and restaurant
sold VIP cards for $500.00 that entitled you to bypass the line at the front door on weeknights and
go right in, or go to the shorter line at the back door on weekends. I’m told they sold over 500 VIP
cards—that’s $250,000.00—and by the length of the shorter line some weekends, I don’t doubt it. (I

bought a VIP card.) Now let’s translate that into price. Assume the customer comes twice a week, so
104 times a year. Sometimes just has a couple drinks, other times has dinner, averaging out to
$50.00 per visit or $5,200.00 for the year—a very good customer, by the way. By charging him
$500.00 for his entry, we essentially raised prices on him by 10%. If he comes less often and spends
less, we may have raised prices on him by 20% or 30%. Without him ever thinking about it in that
way. Price is seen every time a purchase made; membership fee seen only once a year or every two
years if sold that way, or mostly unnoticed as an automatically recurring monthly charge to a credit
card.

As you can now see, this is a price strategy—although neither merchants or consumers think of it
as such.

## CHAPTER 19

 When Is Abusive Pricing Smart?

 Dan Kennedy

**You might think the answer to that question—when is abusive pricing smart?—is never, but times**
**are a’changin. It seems to me that people are getting dumber and, in sync, much more easily**
abused. Everybody’s pretty much accepted working without wages—pumping your own gas,
making your own salad, checking out your own groceries. I fought the gas thing to the bitter end. I
may grow my own food before doing self-checkout at the supermarket. Doing minimum wage jobs
never appealed to me. Doing them free, as slave labor, appeals even less. Morons have let this be
popularized as “convenience.” Nonetheless, the concept has been popularized and is accepted in
more and more venues. It is a price strategy, charging people for service not given.

One of the most amazing examples of this is at the car wash. The vacuuming out of the car used
to be a service included with the wash ’n wax. Now it is not. Instead, you go to a vending machine
with a vacuum cleaner attached, feed it dollar bills to buy minutes, and play beat the clock while
doing your own vacuuming. The last place I was at, the automated wash ‘n wax was $19.00. The
vacuum cleaner, $1.00 for, I think, 4 minutes of suction. There are a couple dirty jokes there, but
this is a business book for polite company, so I’ll skip it. They’re obvious, so entertain yourself
without me. Be clear about it: the customer is paying for air and the privilege of providing his own
service. At the other end of the wash tunnel, there are wipe guys, who dry the car off by hand. Will
they soon be replaced by a paper towel vending machine?

Everybody’s resigned themselves to extra charges on their hotel bills for drinking water (!) and
newspapers. As I was writing this, American Airlines announced an $8.00 rental fee for blanket and
pillow and a European airline installed pay toilets. Why not follow Lewis Black’s idea? Rip out all
the seats, hand each passenger a stick to jam up their butts and balance on … fit a lot more in the
plane, save gas, reduce that nasty carbon footprint. Eventually, they could charge extra for the
sticks. Or for lube.

Here’s a new, cute gambit: I just filled out an order form from a catalog company that included
this extra, check-off item: “Health Services Fee: voluntary contribution to help defray the cost of
_medical insurance for our employees. Add $1.00.” I’ll bet a lot of dummies contribute. I also, while_
writing this, got the first of, I imagine, many letters to come from several of my banks notifying of a
new FDIC insurance fee to be paid, in response to their increased costs for FDIC insurance
(something we are supposed to be getting from the government as taxpayers), and other new fees
birthed by the banks’ new compliance costs imbedded in President Obama’s financial industry
reform. Maybe you’ve noticed: whenever he says “reform,” he means “taxes.”

This kind of nickel-and-diming and sneaky thievery used to annoy people, so it once was very
bad business policy. Now I’m not so sure. Yes, it annoys _me, but not enough to go through the_
hassle of closing those bank accounts and moving that money, and to where? Not enough _not to_
drink a bottle of water, and I don’t remember to punish that hotel chain on next trip, and, anyway,
where would I stay where this rip-off hasn’t been replicated?

I consider it abusive and you probably do too. But, to the extent customers will accept it and not
hold a grudge, not doing it leaves money on the table.

This can be a clever way to reduce the price people focus on, and it’s not new. The advertised
price of the car doesn’t include added tax, title, dealer prep, and delivery charges; shipping and
handling gets added to the total catalog order after you’ve picked out your items—not to each item
as you go.

## Pregnant Question 1

_To what extent can YOU get away with this, without damage—or with acceptable level of damage?_

It has to be worth doing and aggravating some folks. An extra $3.25 from 10 customers a month,
no. From 10,000, you betcha. I have a client who switched delivery of a very elaborate home study
course to PDF, online without lowering its $495.00 price, added a “deluxe option” including a
printed copy. i.e.. “library edition” delivered in a box for $200.00 more, and in 3 months testing,
over 65% of the 300 or so buyers bit on the deluxe upsell, and overall conversions barely dipped a
smidgen. Sheesh. He’s charging a $200.00 premium for delivering what was standard as a deluxe
option and nobody’s batting an eyelash.

-----

## Question 2

**_Alternatively, can you make something of not doing this?_**

Southwest Airlines tried doing this in 2010, with its “bags fly free” campaign. All-inclusive resorts
and cruise ships have this, but, in my opinion, don’t promote it enough. As I discussed in the
previous chapter, MD practices are excluding all Medicare and Medicaid patients (in skyrocketing
numbers; average wait for Medicare patient to get an appointment has gone from 9 days in 2007 to
21 days in 2009, and I predict 60 days by 2012) and either going “concierge” (fee for access + fee
for service) or “all-inclusive” (one set monthly fee covers anything + everything needed within a
menu). Walt Disney originally re-invented the amusement park by eliminating tickets for each ride
in favor of one admission = unlimited access to everything, then, in more recent years, brought forth
the Express Pass (access to shorter lines) and the VIP Guides (to skip the lines) at premium prices,
added attractions and extra park hours available only to its (pricey) resort guests, some only to
concierge-floor guests. These are all examples of bucking the trend, and offering customers a
simple, single price rather than a low price for something minimalist, then tacking on fees for this,
that, and the other thing until the list of add-ons is as long as your arm. Is there any caché or
competitive advantage in doing this and promoting that you are “all-inclusive” in your business?

-----

## Question 3

**_Can you get away with Disney’s deal of being able to brag about an all-inclusive price, no nickel-_**

**_and-diming, sneaky charges AND still pile on extra charges?_**

Yes, all the rides and attractions in the park are covered by the one price admission, but then the
Express Pass or Guide and extra hours are, well, extra. It’s an all-inclusive deal that isn’t allinclusive.

Abuse, of course, is strictly in the mind of the customer. Whether you view your own price
strategy as abusive or not doesn’t matter a lick. It’s only the customer’s attitude about it that matters.

In the direct marketing world, the little devil called “shipping and handling” is much
manipulated. One legendary promoter of various kitchen gadgets via TV infomercials I’m not going
to name has long lived by this price strategy: hard product cost plus actual shipping costs equals the
shipping and handling fee charged the customer. So the entire selling price of the product goes only
to the media cost of airing the show and his profit. This has been adopted with a slight twist by a
number of gadget sellers using one-minute commercials, who offer an extra one free, then a third
one or a related item free—you, quote, just pay _separate shipping and handling. In truth, you’re_
paying costs of goods and shipping and handling plus a profit to the advertiser. At minimum,
virtually every advertiser, catalog house, or other marketer does mark up actual shipping and labor
costs a little, to squeeze an extra buck or two out of each sale. If they’re selling an item for $29.95,
sales might fall at $33.95, but nobody balks at $9.00 vs. $5.00 shipping and handling, so the sought
after $4.00 is plugged in there. A lot of mail-order companies also offer options on order forms or
order pages at websites, such as Express Processing for an extra $1.00 or $2.00, and Insurance
guaranteeing replacement of any goods damaged in shipment for another dollar or two or three.
Almost all companies are actually self-insuring; damaged goods have to be replaced. And, in most
cases, all orders are processed the same or next day, whether extra money is paid for express service
or not.

Very recently, I called to re-order checks for one of my bank accounts. It was all done without
speaking to a human, by punching in numbers. The last question requiring a response offered to ship
the checks using Check-Protect Delivery for an additional fee. Of course, there is no such thing as
Check-Protect Delivery. All orders are shipped the same way. The only difference is a decal that
says “Check-Protect Delivery.” Further, losses due to stolen checks are already covered by my
account agreement at the bank, and again by my homeowner’s insurance. This is an entirely bogus
service I’m very sure a lot of people are saying yes to.

These added fees are pure profit. Is all of that or any of that abuse of the customer?

In the case of the bank, it seems so. But I don’t have a firm opinion about it. And my opinion
doesn’t really matter. If the customer’s okay with it, and happier paying a lower price for the
product, and a higher price for shipping, and that sells the most product, then that’s what we should
present. Remember, it is your RESPONSIBILITY at the helm of a business to squeeze maximum
profits from it. That’s your job. To reinforce that, at the end of this chapter, I’ve reprinted pages 34–
[38 from my book No B.S. Wealth Attraction in The New Economy (which I urge reading in full, as](http://www.amazon.com/B-S-Wealth-Attraction-Economy-ebook/dp/B004RUGVWU/)
companion to this one).

There are variations of this theme in other businesses. When I order theater tickets at the
advertised per-seat price, I may discover there’s also a ticket processing fee. A lawyer may quote an
hourly fee, but not mention he rounds up when billing you for time on the phone, so a 12-minute
call is billed at a quarter hour, a 46 minute call billed as an hour. If you begin scrutinizing your
every purchase, bill, statement, and credit card statement like a sharp-eyed Scrooge, you may be
amazed at how much of this stealth profiteering has crept into your life as a consumer.

Again, abuse is in the experience of the buyer. I am not going to go so far as to suggest you
outright steal from customers by charging for nothing at all, although this is clearly a reality even
with major, trusted institutions. But things like shipping and handling including profit mark-up are
very grey and murky areas. There’s room for debate about what is and isn’t abuse. You must make
the call. But you should at least consciously consider each and every opportunity to boost
transaction value and profit without affecting what is perceived as “the price” or appearing to raise
prices.

I recently had a conversation with the owner of several optometry practices, who had
experimented with raising his fees for office visits and his prices for glasses, and gotten quite a bit
