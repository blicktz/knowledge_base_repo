## Excuses for Not Doing Well in Business

#### • “Everybody in my city buys by price.”
 • “Nobody in my town uses credit cards.”

#### • “Everybody in my town is cheap.”
 • “There’s a giant advertiser in my town.”
 • “I never get the good leads.”
 • “It’s the time of year.”
 • “There’s already too many doohickeys in my town.”
 • “What I do is so unique, nobody understands it.”
 • “It’s the economy, it’s my spouse, my staff ...”

## Individuals’ ACTUAL Stated Reasons for Not
 Getting to Work On Time

#### Woody Allen said that half of success is showing up. The other half is showing up on time. These are people’s excuses for being unable to show up on time.

 • “Sometimes my car won’t start.”
 • “The damned bus driver comes early.”
 • “I can’t hear the alarm clock.”
 • “The dog hides my shoes.”
 • “I just can’t get going. I’m not a morning person.”
 • “My mother was never a morning person.” (It’s mom’s fault I
 can’t get to work on time.)
 • “It’s unfair to ask somebody to be there at exactly the same
 time every morning. ”

#### In the world of the entrepreneur, there is even clearer correlation between the taking on of responsibility and risk and the attraction of opportunity and wealth. If, as the saying goes, you aren’t up for the heat, you’d best stay out of the kitchen. But if you opt to stay somewhere cool and comfortable, you ought not begrudge the goodies gobbled up by the big lads willing to stand in the fire.
 Take a look at any year’s Forbes 400 list of the richest men and women, and ask yourself how many of those people have enjoyed “cool and comfortable.” This truth needs to be told, often and vigorously, to the public, to counter the voices that demonize the rich and decry the giant incomes and wealth attracted and achieved by a minority in society. It needs to be thoroughly and deeply understood by anyone with serious ambition for wealth. You just can’t go through life refusing to pay more than $3.00 for a meal and bitterly complain about only being able to dine out at McDonalds and resenting and vilifying those eating steak and drinking fine wine down the street at Morton’s. They choose to pay Morton’s prices. It’s equally unreasonable for someone to go through life unwilling to meet the requirements for attracting wealth but being bitterly unhappy with the lack of it, and resentful and enraged at others who are willing to meet those requirements.
 I, for example, have routinely earned over a million dollars a year as a freelance advertising copywriter, commanding perproject fees from $25,000.00 plus royalties for a single ad or sales letter up to $150,000.00 to even $1-million for complex, multistep, multi-media project work. I’m often asked by other, much less wealthy copywriters what they need to do to get such fees. When I tell them what they must do to be worth such fees and make themselves attractive to the clients who can and will pay such fees, the blood visibly drains from their faces, they shake their heads, they walk away. For example, I tell them how extremely well-read legendary ad man David Ogilvy was, the hours he worked, the amount of self-promotion he engaged in. I tell them the advice I got from famous copywriter Gary Halbert—which I followed—about rewriting in longhand at least 500 long- running, successful direct-response ads and sales letters in order to train your subconscious mind. I tell them about the need to be a marketing strategist, not just a copywriter accepting assignments. I tell them about the attractant power of becoming a dynamic professional speaker and presenting speeches and seminars that showcase your expertise; becoming a

-----

#### persuasive author and getting articles and books published that also showcase your expertise and develop reputation. And on and on and on. I find few want to hear any of this. They just want to hear how to “get my kind of fees.” They are unwilling to understand that it is impossible to “get” such fees, period. You must attract them, and that is a much more complicated thing.
 I also often work under intense deadline pressure, work long hours, occasionally pull an all-nighter. My family makes great sacrifices as I disappear into my basement cave even on sunny Sunday mornings, not to be seen until dinner, while other families spend the day at the park or zoo or baseball game. I tell those asking how to get my kind of fees that there is a lifestyle sacrifice and discipline and unique responsibility required.
 It’s also worth noting that, just as with the high-paid CEO of the manufacturing company discussed above, in my copywriterstrategist role, I am in a very hot place. Under enormous pressure and stress and scrutiny, with great responsibility. Not only is my client paying me a hefty fee, he is then risking much larger sums on implementing what I provide. At times, the life or death of a new product’s launch or the success or failure of his entire business may hang in the balance. With regard to my own career, my reputation for delivering exceptional results, reliably, is my only asset, and it can easily be destroyed by just one spectacular failure—much as a movie producer’s or actor’s bankability may be destroyed by one box office bomb, regardless of the previous string of blockbuster successes. Ultimately, I am held responsible not just for those things I have very direct control over, such as the ideas I choose to use and the words I choose to put on paper conveying those ideas, but I am also held responsible for things over which I have little or no control—from news events occurring the week the magazine my ad is run or the client’s staff’s handling of inbound phone calls from prospects responding to my ads. Is that fair? I guess not, but it is what it is. And it is one of the reasons why some people attract wealth and others do not—their willingness to take on responsibility even extending to things over which they do not have control.

## Pressure–Prosperity Link

#### As an entrepreneur, you are going to screw up. And you are going to have bad things happen on your watch that you actually had no hand in, or feel you couldn’t possibly prevent. That’s a given. What’s important to understand is that the world watches and responds to the way you handle

-----

#### these situations. If you blame others, blame circumstances, offer up excuses, you telegraph weakness. If you step up, accept responsibility, offer no excuses, roll up your sleeves and work, you telegraph strength and command respect. With excuse-making, you may obtain some sympathy and pity but at the price of respect. And wealth is never transferred based on pity. It moves based on respect. Wealth attraction power has a great deal to do with self-respect and respect of others, and that has a great deal to do with your acceptance, even your embrace of responsibility.
 Bill Rancic spoke at one of our Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™]
 Member conferences. Bill was the first season winner on Donald Trump’s TV show The Apprentice. He was a very successful entrepreneur pre- Trump, and had many valuable insights and experiences to share from his other businesses as well as his year with The Donald. One such story was about one of his earliest businesses, as a kid, cleaning and readying boats in a resort area for the seasonal arrival of their owners. Things went horribly awry, and, as he said, most kids would have cut and run or blamed the circumstances involved. He did not. He took an arguably unjustified 100% of the responsibility for himself, with the direct result of impressing and keeping all his customers, but also the more important indirect result of strengthening his overall wealth attraction power. It paid off in the short- term in customers retained and renewed the next season, and in referrals. It paid off even bigger in the long-term in strengthening Bill’s overall wealth attraction power.

 L osers are wealthy with excuses, moth-eaten, empty wallets, heads full of excuses. This is not an enviable wealth. An abundance of excuses guarantees a paucity of money. If excuses roll willingly from a person’s tongue, it’s certain money does not flow easily into his pockets. I’ve often said I can estimate a person’s bank balance if

-----

#### he’ll tell me about the books he reads and the people he hangs out with. But it’s even easier to accurately estimate his bank balance if I hear the excuses he makes. The habit of excuse making is the worst of all habits.

 If you remember the wonderful Pink Panther movies with Peter Sellers, you’ll remember his Asian houseboy, whom he paid to attack him without warning, to keep him on his toes. I’ve been told by good authority that the boxer Mike Tyson once hired a man to walk behind him saying, “You the man, Mike, you the man.” (There’s a clue how Tyson could zip through a hundred million dollars and be broke.) A fine investment would be hiring a big, strong guy to walk around with you for a month carrying a stout baseball bat and every time you voiced an excuse, hauling off and knocking you into next week. I imagine you’ll be unwilling to make that investment, so, instead, you might try keeping a little notebook in your pocket, to keep a diary of every excuse you catch yourself making for the next month, as well as every excuse you get from anyone else. Awareness automatically improves performance, so just the act of keeping the diary, and stopping whatever you’re doing each time you proffer an excuse will have positive impact. Getting whacked silly by the strong man with the Louisville Slugger would have more impact but admittedly the side effects are problematic.
 If you recall the cartoon character Popeye, you’ll remember that he pumped up his strength and power when needed by gulping down a can or two of spinach. I think of that as a visual analogy; for the entrepreneur, responsibility is spinach. If you want to turn on wealth attraction power, gulp down some more.

 “Well, I guess I’m not sure.”

 “Have you ever blamed anyone for any circumstance in your life?
 Have you ever complained about anything?”

 “Uh ... yeah ... I guess I have.”

 “Don’t guess. Think.”

 “Yes, I have.”

 “OK then. That means you don’t take 100% responsibility for your life. Taking 100% responsibility means you acknowledge that you create everything that happens to you. It means you understand that you are the cause of all your experience. If you want to be truly

 Speak Money

#### M ost people speak lack, poverty, inadequacy, doubt, and fear.
 You have to be careful about the vocabulary you use because every word thought, spoken, or written, if innerdirected, constitutes programming, instructions to your subconscious mind. It is overly simplistic to believe that what you say in your head (think) and speak out loud manifests. The title of Napoleon Hill’s most famous book Think and Grow Rich is slightly misleading; more accurately it should be How To Think to Grow Rich. Thought alone will not override behavior or certain physical realities and circumstances. However, it is accurate to say that the way you think about money and the language you use about money matters a great deal. How you speak about money reveals the programming your subconscious is actually being directed by; and your subconscious is accumulating programming to which it is trying to respond. Further, your spoken words convey to others your relative comfort and confidence or discomfort and fear about money. Any sales professional can tell you that prospects “smell

-----

#### fear” like animals. This is not superstition on their part. Experienced sales pros know it is infinitely harder to make the sale you desperately feel you must make than the sale that doesn’t matter much one way or the other. Professional negotiators all know that the person who wants it least has the power. Money is naturally attracted to the person most confident and comfortable about it.
 People tend to transfer their money to these same people. When you are talking to others, there’s text and subtext, heard by others’ conscious and subconscious minds. When you say that you just don’t “feel good” about somebody or that your “intuition” tells you not to trust or do business with somebody, it’s your subconscious processing impressions from sight, sound, the other senses, searching its files for past information and experiences. You can’t actually enunciate why you feel as you do. You just do. So you might not consciously realize that when you’re around Joe he often talks in terms of lack, poverty, failure, and fear, so you do not want to buy from him, invest with him, or otherwise be involved with him. But that may very well be what has occurred within your subconscious.
 For all these reasons, what you speak about money matters. As an example, consider the term: “Hard-earned dollars.” You all recognize the term, don’t you? Hard-earned dollars. You probably heard your parents say it. Your friends may say it. You may say it, or some variation of it, without ever considering its true meaning. If you translate it to programming, it is: money is very hard to get. You get money only through difficult and unpleasant work. If money somehow arrives without being connected to hard work, there’s something wrong with it. It’s tainted or toxic. It’s incorrect and dishonorable to get it easily .
 Now consider the phrase “easy money.” For most people, this is “bad.” The perception is that “easy money” is somehow tainted, dirty, undeserved. The perception is that the person seeking “easy money” is a lazy bum or a fool.
 What a barrier! This is a tall, wide, thick wall that prevents entrepreneurs from looking for or seeing many great opportunities in their own businesses, lying there within easy reach. I think this explains why a pair of fresh, expert eyes like mine can so easily and frequently see unexploited opportunities in others’ businesses. It’s not just that the owner of the business is too close to the trees to see the forest. There’s a wall he can’t see through at all.
