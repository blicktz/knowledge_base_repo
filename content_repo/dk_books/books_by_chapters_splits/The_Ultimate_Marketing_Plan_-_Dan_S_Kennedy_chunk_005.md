##### One of the worst presentation mistakes is confusion. That’s what happens when what seems clear to you isn’t clear to others. It wasn’t clear to the grocery shoppers that the fresh fish was really fresh; the grocer thought saying so made it so. It wasn’t clear to the women receiving the high-priced personal care product that it was of elite, luxury quality and its ingredients superior to all others because it didn’t look right based on their preconceived ideas of how such a product should be presented to them. Many advertising campaigns and marketing materials and even face-to-face selling scripts err in the same way. They fail to clearly communicate.

 Presentation Key #1: Be Well Organized

 The customer has to be led up five steps to a buying or action decision —to return an order form, redeem a coupon, call for an appointment, come into a store, or buy a product or service—and the five steps are the same for any and every product or service, for marketing to consumers or business-to-business:

 Step 1: Awareness of need and/or desire

 Step 2: Picking the “thing” that fulfills the need/desire

 Step 3: Picking the source for the thing

 Step 4: Accepting the source’s price/value argument

 Step 5: Finding reasons to act now

 Sometimes you have to start your presentation at step 1; other times you get to start on step 2. A company selling dog food gets to start on step 2; a company selling dog vitamins has to start on step 1. This decision about where to start your presentation is an important one.

 Go back to the Yellow Pages and again turn to the ads in your section (or visit the websites you visited before) and, of course, examine your own marketing materials. Ask yourself whether or not, from the headline on down, the ads present their messages according to the organized structure above.

 I think you’ll agree with me—most do not. Believe me, this is a big mistake. Every presentation of a marketing message via any and every medium should adhere to a safe, proven, effective structure.

-----

##### Let me give you a couple of great examples of this structure in action.

 Example #1

 For many years, as I said, I did a considerable amount of consulting work within the chiropractic profession, helping practitioners learn to market their services effectively. I consider the members of this profession my friends, but I must tell you that they remain stubbornly lousy at marketing. Most of them deviate from this organized structure in most of the media they use, yet they need to follow these five steps as precisely as any marketer I can think of.

 For them, step 1 has to be creating awareness of the need or the desire: reminding people that they suffer chronically from, say, headaches or low back pain or neck stiffness, that they consume frightening quantities of pills, drugs, and alcohol to mute the symptoms, and that deep down inside they desire optimum health and fitness. Chiropractors cannot afford to assume that the public is instantly, automatically interested in this.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #3:
 Carefully and Thoroughly Eliminate All Assumptions

##### Step 2, then, and only then, is to present chiropractic as a viable, effective, accepted, credible, safe, gentle, nonsurgical, nondrug alternative treatment for various problems and ailments. Step 3, only after completing steps 1 and 2, is the individual chiropractor presenting his USP-empowered marketing message and offer.

 Much of chiropractic advertising and marketing sabotages itself by beginning with step 3.

 Example #2

 A client I mentioned earlier in this book, a group of financial advisors specializing in working with trailing-edge boomers and seniors, has to carefully follow these five steps to achieve the best results. In getting a prospective new client to step forward and ask (i.e., grant permission) for the agent to begin discussions about this person’s private financial affairs and needs, that agent must first (step 1) make the senior very aware (and anxious about) hazards and potential losses he may face because of information he does not know and is not being given by the government or his regular accountant. “Shocking” and upsetting facts are used to create this awareness. Here are samples of the bullet points in the marketing messages used by these advisors when offering a free seminar or a free book.

 9. EXTRA WARNING: If you have over $250,000.00 of
 invested/investable assets OR are currently invested in MUTUAL FUNDS, there is CRITICAL INFORMATION you need to know!
 Tax traps, hidden charges, hidden fees—mutual funds are a “minefield”! YOUR MONEY COULD DO BETTER & BE BETTER PROTECTED FROM THE VOLATILE, DANGEROUS STOCK MARKET—for which many experts including Rubini and Dent are predicting a COMING CRASH to a Dow of 5,000.

 10. THE TRUTH ABOUT GOLD: You see the TV ads, hear the
 radio ads … on Beck, Limbaugh, FOX, CNBC, etc.—what MUST you know BEFORE you buy gold or if you already own it … that “They” won’t tell you!

 Many advisors who advertise, offer seminars, or use direct mail to solicit appointments skip to step 2 or, worse, step 3. They begin by talking about financial products and services or, even worse, about themselves
 —but in doing so, they’re often talking to deaf ears, because their prospects are not aware there’s anything to be worried about with the way they have their affairs arranged now or think they’ve “heard all this before.” These prospects are besieged by insurance salespeople, financial planners, investment advisors, banks, etc., trying to sell them insurance, annuities, living trusts, and estate plans. More of that pushing of product is just clutter. With the advisors I develop marketing for and coach, I back them up to step 1 each and every time they advertise, market, promote, present, or sell.

 Presentation Key #2: Ignite Interest

 I don’t care if you are marketing Hostess Twinkies, garden hoses, industrial widgets, or any one of a zillion commodities or services that you and everyone you know has accepted as dull and ordinary and mundane, maybe even trivial. There is a way, and you must find it, to present that message in a truly interesting manner.

#### Ultimate Marketing Sin #1:
 Being Boring

##### Some years back, I did some consulting work for a manufacturer of security cameras and video monitoring devices for retail stores. I’m here to tell you that there’s nothing inherently fascinating about this. Still, I knew that I had to ignite interest in the store owner’s mind and heart, intellectually and emotionally. I invented a giveaway booklet with this obviously provocative title:

-----

#### HOW TO STEAL YOUR BOSS BLIND!
 AN EMPLOYEE’S GUIDE TO GETTING WHAT’S COMING TO YOU

##### Believe me, when a store owner saw this book, his interest was ignited. He eagerly, passionately wanted to know what was in the book.

 The Power of Secrets

 The word “secret” evokes a powerful emotional response in most people. It instantly hits our curiosity button. For some reason, just as cats are bothered by closed doors, we are driven nuts by secrets. We want to know. You can ignite interest easily if you have secrets to divulge. Consider this: Would you be interested, or do you know somebody who would be interested, in knowing a medical doctor’s secret for absolutely, 100 percent suppressing hunger so you can diet, even skip meals or fast with no hunger pains, no desire for food? If I told you that this doctor’s secret had been tested and proven on 1,000 patients, would that make it even more interesting to you? What if this secret had, up until now, been kept for only the doctors themselves and privileged patients like movie stars, but finally, someone was going public with this incredible discovery? You can see the power of secrets.

 When marketing this retail theft-control service, we had a very dramatic story to tell. My client was a reformed deliveryman-thief who conspired with store employees and stole merchandise and money from virtually every store on his delivery route. To store owners’ surprise, he was the norm, not the exception. In the supermarket, convenience store, and drug store industry, employee and deliveryman theft is triple the amount of losses to shoplifting, and it is epidemic. Those are facts, but facts alone are surprisingly uninteresting even where there is money or health or hazard involved. But in my client, we had a real villain with true confessions to reveal. We had an opportunity for a dramatic presentation.

 You may or may not have an inherently as dramatic a story, but you need to wrack your brain for the germ of one that can be embellished. I find many clients have such assets that they do not consider important. One client, a health care products company selling to seniors at over 1,000 offices, had, as its still-living founder, a bona fide World War II hero—a fighter pilot shot down and escaped from behind enemy lines, an Audie Murphy/John Wayne figure. Buying their product required a

-----

##### senior man to set ego aside and do something he felt “unmanly” doing. Someone had to speak for this company in a marketing message that made it okay for a tough guy to buy the product, even make buying it a courageous and heroic thing to do. They had the perfect spokesperson for this message and weren’t using him!

 If at all possible, you should find ways to add drama to your presentations. I’ve done a lot of script writing and consulting work in the TV infomercial business—those thirty-minute-long commercials that look like TV shows—and I admire the kind I’ve had little to do with: those that feature dramatic demonstrations. Maybe you remember one of the classics in the Amazing Discoveries series of infomercials, selling car polish, where they set fire to the hood of the car and poured acid on it! Or Ron Popeil’s Food Dehydrator. Or the vacuum cleaner with suction so strong it can pick up a bowling ball. I’ve had to work on much more difficult infomercials, often featuring interviews and conversations. When the product can be the star, it’s an advantage.

 You can make the presentation of your marketing message more interesting in many different ways, some depending on the medium being used, including:

 1. Dramatic first-person story—the person behind the product

 2. Before/after photographs

 3. Dramatic stories of satisfied customers

 4. Shocking statistics and revelations (if you can show any
 controversy, all the better)

 5. Dramatic slogans, headlines, statements

 6. Physical demonstrations

 Presentation Key #3: Ask for Action

 Most marketing-message presentations are too wimpy. They stop short of demanding any action. They may communicate “Here’s our beautiful new car,” but they stop short of saying “Get into a showroom this weekend, take a test drive, and take home a free case of Coca-Cola just for test-driving it.” Or they may say “Here’s our wonderful new shampoo,” but they stop short of saying “Now go to your phone, dial our toll-free number, or go to our website and we’ll rush you a free sample and $5.00 in discount coupons.”

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #4:
 The Guts to Ask for Action Every Time, in Every
 Presentation

##### Very early in my selling career, I heard the great sales and motivation speaker Zig Ziglar say that the difference between being a professional salesperson and a professional visitor is asking for the order. Zig also said: “Timid salespeople have skinny kids.” I, fortunately, accepted this idea and have never, ever been shy about asking for the action. However, most salespeople, even otherwise very good ones, are held back by this hesitancy, hobbled by some strange love of subtlety. This same timidity carries over into dumb, non-direct- response advertising and feckless marketing. Why be shy about purpose?

 Later in life, I had the privilege of appearing on the same seminar tour with Zig over 200 times. I never once saw him speak without asking for the order.

 Once I spent a full week touring one company’s real-estate developments, pretending to be a prospective buyer and putting the salespeople through their paces. Almost without exception, all the salespeople did a fine job of establishing rapport, being courteous and friendly, asking smart questions, and showing me the communities and the houses. And, almost unanimously, they all stopped way short of asking me to buy.

 Four chiropractors joined together and manned a very attractive, professional-appearing booth at a health fair in a busy shopping mall over Labor Day weekend but wound up with no new patients from their efforts. Care to know why? They never asked anybody to book an exam appointment. They smiled, greeted, handed out literature, gave scoliosis exams, checked blood pressure, and answered questions, but they never asked anybody to take any action.

Following, you’ll see the last page of a multipage mailer sent to his retail stores’ customers. Note how many times he asks for action—I’ve numbered them by hand for you. Six times on one page! This is the way to do it.

 Touch Base Every Time

 You don’t have to be a baseball fan to know this rule: Even when the hitter whacks the ball out of the ballpark, it’s not a home run on the scoreboard until he goes around the bases—and touches every one. In gym class baseball I was tagged out after hitting a home run and walking the bases because I carelessly stepped over second base instead of on it. I’ve never forgotten that.

 The right presentation of the right marketing message touches every base, every time. It assumes nothing. It takes nothing for

## Targets

##### There is an old joke about a wife insisting on joining her husband for the first time on his annual deer hunting trip. He stations her at the bottom of the hill, instructs her to fire her gun in the air if she sees any deer—which is very unlikely at that location—and he and his buddy stomp off into the woods. Shortly thereafter, they hear shots and run back through the woods and down the hill to find the wife holding a gun on a very unhappy looking fellow. “Okay, lady,” he says, “it’s your deer. Can I at least get my saddle off of it?”

 Obviously, no matter how well equipped you are with the best gun, bullets, and other hunting equipment, you still won’t do very well aiming at the wrong targets.
