 Napoleon Hill
 You probably are already very familiar with Napoleon Hill. For
 the uninitiated: As a young man, Napoleon Hill was sent on a
 twenty-year mission by Andrew Carnegie, America’s first billion-
 aire, to personally interview and spend time with hundreds of the
 greatest achievers of their time in search of the unanimously
 shared secrets of success. The report of his findings, Think and
 Grow Richt, first published in 1937, has been a perennial best-
 selling book entirely through word-of-mouth recommendation.
You must read Think and Grow Rich!, which is available in
 bookstores.
 Tony Robbins
 If you’ve watched late-night television anytime in the past five
 years, you have undoubtedly seen Tony with Fran Tarkenton,
 Martin Sheen, and many celebrities discussing the benefits of his
 Personal Power Program. Well over $50 million worth of Per-
 sonal Power Programs have been sold through these TV infomer-
 cials alone. You can get information on Personal Power from the
 Guthy-Renker Corporation. Tony’s books Unlimited Power and
 Awaken the Giant Within are available in bookstores.
