###### and practical ways but also in creating a deeper emotional connection and understanding between your brand and your customers.
 So now you can see how powerful of a tool Chat can be at simply writing benefit statements with little training on the audience. You want to train your AI writer on your audience before assigning it writing prompts, like headlines, so that the generative AI tool understands exactly who you want to speak to. This is the difference between average and good or better than good copy. Here’s an example prompt you can use for what I call the “Chatvatars.”
 Give me five customer avatars for (offer) teaching (target) whose company (describe company) how to (insert outcome).
 Create one avatar for each Stage of Awareness as described in Breakthrough Advertising.
 These are:

Unaware
Problem-Aware
Solution-Aware
Product-Aware
Most Aware

###### The target market is [market]. The offer’s website is [website]. It’s a
 [price positioning] [type of offer] in the [niche] that helps [target market] to

###### Make sure each avatar is at least 900 words. Start with the problem-aware avatar. Then, in part two, you have it write a “Dear Diary” entry as the problem stage, for example, the avatar using emotionally laden diction for two reasons. First, it helps train the generative AI on successive prompts so that you have better copy. Secondly, it helps you as the writer construct arguments with more empathy and insight so your copywriting converts, which is the goal, bucko! So use this prompt next:
 Dear Diary: Imagine you are the problem-aware avatar. Taking the psychographics, pain profile, desire profile, wants, and three-dimensional profile into account, write me a diary entry of at least 1,000 words. Use

 Here’s an example of just how powerful these tools can be for the aspiring entrepreneur who wants leverage. It’s an example of Chatvatar I developed for a client of Parthiv Shah, Ray Miller, who sells into a small Total Addressable Market. Therefore he must increase average transaction size and lifetime value since there’s an upward limitation to the number of new clients he can acquire. The point being, his marketing must be very dialed in. It needs to hit. To resonate.

###### Richard is keenly aware of the problems in his industry and is always looking for efficient, reliable solutions that can enhance the value and functionality of the corporate real estate he manages. He’s well connected and respected in his field, driven by a desire to succeed and be recognized for his innovative approaches to traditional challenges.
 And here’s what the “Dear Diary” entry looked like:

#### Diary Entry: Richard Evans—March 29, 2024

###### Dear Diary,
 It’s late, and the city’s lights are just blurs beneath my office window, a reminder of the restless energy that drives me. Today was another marathon, a relentless pursuit of excellence that I both revere and dread. My mind is a battlefield, a tumultuous mix of ambition and frustration, and tonight, the silence is almost too loud.
 I am haunted by a profound sense of urgency, a gnawing feeling that the ground beneath me is shifting faster than I can adapt. The world of corporate real estate is evolving at a dizzying pace, and my fear of becoming obsolete is a shadow that looms over every decision I make. I am Richard Evans, a man atop a mountain who fears the erosion that could send him tumbling.
 As I sit here, the weight of my role as VP of Corporate Real Estate at a Fortune 500 company is a constant companion. My decisions shape the landscape of our corporate environment, and the pressure to innovate, to lead, and to succeed is a relentless force. The industry whispers about efficiency and innovation, but I’m screaming inside for a solution that truly understands the complexity of what we need.
 The inefficiency of our current workplace installation solutions is a thorn in my side, a source of continuous irritation. I am tired of the time-consuming processes, the poor communication, the unexpected delays, and the budget overruns. Each project feels like a gamble, a dice roll where the odds are never in my favor. I crave a streamlined

-----

###### process, a symphony of coordination where every piece moves in perfect harmony.
 But beyond the irritation and the frustration lies a deeper, more visceral fear. I am haunted by the possibility of failure, the idea that I might choose a path for my company that leads to a dead end. My position demands innovation, but innovation carries the risk of the unknown. The thought of implementing a solution that falls short of our dynamic needs is a nightmare that wakes me in the cold, early hours of the morning.
 Yet, for all the fears and frustrations, there burns an unquenchable fire within me, a desire to carve my name into the annals of industry leaders. I long to be the visionary, the trailblazer who revolutionizes the corporate real estate world. I envision spaces that aren’t just built, but are birthed from ingenuity and foresight, environments that breathe productivity and inspire creativity.
 I dream of streamlined processes and cutting-edge office spaces that reflect the prestige of our company. I want to build legacies, not just buildings. I want to be the one who brings the future into the present, who sees beyond the horizon and brings that vision to life. This isn’t just about constructing spaces; it’s about crafting the future of how our company and industry operate.
 But my desires go beyond the professional. I yearn for a life where my professional success does not come at the cost of personal time, where I can stand at the pinnacle of my career and still enjoy the view. I want to be recognized not just for the spaces I create, but for the innovation and foresight I bring to every aspect of my work.
 My emotions are a whirlwind, a mix of frustration and ambition, anxiety and pride. I am driven by a relentless determination to succeed, to prove that my vision is not just a dream, but a blueprint for the future. I am fueled by the belief in the importance of well- designed workspaces, the value of time, and the power of a strong corporate culture.

-----

###### As I look to the future, I see a path lined with decisions, each a stepping stone toward my ultimate goal. My shopping behavior reflects this journey, with every purchase a careful calculation toward efficiency and innovation. I seek testimonials from industry peers, evidence of success that can guide my way.
 I want to gain recognition as an industry leader, to be the pioneer of innovative workplace solutions. I want to implement turnkey solutions that change the game, that make the stress and inefficiency of traditional installation processes a thing of the past. I want to save time and money, not just for my company but for myself, to find that elusive balance between success and serenity.
 As I sit here, alone in the quiet, I see my vision for the future. I think about the logistics, the potential ROI, and the impact of every decision. I hear the whispers of industry trends and the feedback from my peers, the collective voice that guides my way. I feel the pressure to deliver, the excitement of potential success, and the satisfaction of a job well done.
 I am saying that change is necessary, that we must advocate for improvement and innovation. And tomorrow, I will do what I have always done: research new solutions, negotiate with vendors, and plan for the future. I am Richard Evans, a man aware of the problems that plague us, but more importantly, a man who is seeking, striving, and never yielding in the pursuit of solutions.

#### Three Reasons to Make AI Your Hardest Working Marketing Researcher and Writer,
 Right Now

###### Hopefully you can see how powerful this is for anyone harried to produce results and who can’t be bothered to invest years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to become a great copywriter, as I have invested. In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, small business owners are constantly seeking tools to streamline their marketing efforts. The integration of AI

-----

###### driven solutions like ChatGPT can revolutionize how small businesses approach market research and copywriting.
 For the overwhelmed entrepreneur, here are the top three reasons why adopting ChatGPT is a game-changer for making research faster, easier, more efficient, and for producing copy that converts:

##### 1. Accelerated and Streamlined Market Research

###### ChatGPT significantly speeds up the market research process by quickly analyzing and synthesizing vast amounts of data, providing actionable insights in a fraction of the time it would take manually. This accelerated research process means you can respond rapidly to market changes and customer needs. Adopted, you can stay consistently ahead of market trends and customer preferences, enabling you to make swift and informed decisions about your product development and marketing strategies. This agility in adapting to market dynamics is crucial for small businesses that need to optimize their resources efficiently.

##### 2. Enhanced Quality and Relevance of Marketing Copy

###### The better and more robust your Marketing Automation is, the more content and sales copy it has to be fed. ChatGPT’s advanced algorithms help create highly relevant and engaging marketing copy, tailored to the specific needs and stages of your target audience. This ensures that your marketing messages resonate more deeply with potential customers, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.
 Your marketing campaigns can effectively address the unique concerns and desires of different customer segments, creating a more personalized experience for your audience. This tailored approach helps in building stronger relationships with customers, enhancing brand loyalty and advocacy.

##### 3. Cost-Effectiveness and Resource Optimization

-----

###### By automating and optimizing the research and copywriting process, ChatGPT helps in significantly reducing the costs and resources typically required for these tasks. This is especially beneficial for small businesses with limited budgets and manpower.

 Preston Bates is a Scottsdale, Arizona–based entrepreneur and copywriter who owes no small debt of gratitude to Dan Kennedy for rapidly accelerating his direct response chops and to whom he can reasonably attribute hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue. You can connect with him at @prestonsbates.

#### Dan Kennedy Says

###### At minimum, the ChatGPT’s work provides raw material, rough drafts, and outlines to make your writing output faster and easier. The whining I often hear from business owners shown how to use all media and automated communication, weekly memos, monthly newsletters, mini-books, etc. is (a) I can’ write, (b) I don’ have time— I’ve got teeth to drill, cars to repair, shelves to stock. Well, now you can, fast. At maximum, at some competitive levels, this “robot’s” work is good enough, although I do NOT share Preston’s enthusiasm for AI as a substitute for the human writer or copywriter. My friend and colleague the late Zig Ziglar said, “If two of us agree on everything, one of us is unnecessary.” At optimum, if you are able to hire high-skill professional copywriters, in-house or freelance, this can help you provide them with a lot more information to work with.

 It can be a struggle to “feed the beast.” When you set up a complex, sophisticated, complete media platform of your own, to act as a fence around customers and prospects, by communicating frequently and consistently in multiple media, you create a hungry beast that needs a lot of content relevant to your

-----

###### audience. This can’ be allowed to stop you from creating such a beast. You must find ways to empower your beast. I designed my own company to have no less than 262 communication touches in a year. Although I no longer own or manage it, I do continue contributing to it, and it operates at a similar level of frequency of contact with its Members, customers, and interested potential Members. If you take advantage of the Special Offer on Page 178, you’ll experience this.

 I’ll add: There are a lot of sources of content: things to comment on, news of the day specifically relevant to your market, holidays (there are hundreds during the year), your own experiences, books you read. From any of this, you can get the jumping-off- point for an email, a post, a blog, a new sales letter. There is also a lot of material in the public domain that you can use, free. To do this, start with the book The Public Domain: Find and Use Free Content for Your Website, Book, Newsletter and More published by Nolo Press. Parthiv did an outstanding job using the famous Russell Conwell speech Acres of Diamonds, from public domain, as content in his own mini-books, promoting himself as a data scientist finding your acres of diamonds. If you would like a copy, email Parthiv at pshah@eLaunchers.com.
