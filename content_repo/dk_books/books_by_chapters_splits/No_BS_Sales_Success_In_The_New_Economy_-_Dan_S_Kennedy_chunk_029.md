# Proving the Theory of Supply and Demand

## In many ways, Takeaway Selling contradicts classic wisdom about selling. One of the most important underlying principles behind Takeaway Selling is the law of supply and demand and how it affects people’s desires. As a rule of thumb, the less accessible something is, the greater the value that gets placed on it and the more people who want it. And my whole approach to selling is to sell what the customer wants and spend my time only selling to customers who want what I sell. Tilting the reality or at least their perception of supply-demand in my favor is key.
 I spent too many years of my adult life dead broke, and that was a mystery to me for quite awhile. I had my dog-eared copy of Think and Grow Rich, kept a car seat full of motivational tapes, went to seminars, faced the mirror and said my positive affirmations out loud every morning, tried hypnosis, subliminals, and every other darned thing, and I had some pretty sharp skills. And I was still walking around with a big, blustery smile on my face with nothing but hungry moths in my wallet. Finally, I determined that the missing link to success is mastering supply and demand because as soon as there is, consistently, a greater demand for your services than there is supply of your time, it’s ridiculously easy to be successful.
 There is no more powerful force than supply and demand. It is behind virtually every war. It controls and regulates price of virtually every commodity, from the corn you buy at the supermarket to the gasoline you put into your car, as well as to commodities cleverly decommoditized, like diamonds, Beanie Babies[®], and limited edition this or that. It emboldens or weakens every provider of any service, permitting some to selectively choose their clientele and charge top fees, while causing others providing that very same service to accept anybody with a pulse as a client—even when convinced in advance the relationship will go badly—and to grovel when quoting their low prices. About this, you’ll find an interview with “the $250,000.00 portrait photographer” at the end of this chapter, reprinted

## from my No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent Letter, one of the Glazer- Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ newsletters. Lifting the lid from your earnings and earning your income much more pleasantly is directly connected to your mastery of supply and demand.
 In my businesses, as a consultant, copywriter, and speaker, I’ve learned that demand definitely breeds demand. The busier I am, the more people want my services; the less accessible I am, the more I’m appreciated; the less the supply of me, the greater the demand—and the virtual absence of fee resistance. That’s one of the reasons I sometimes publish a frequently updated, detailed copy of my schedule. I send it to clients and prospective clients, and when they see the supply-demand ratio, they act.
 These days, this technique is 100% legitimate; I really am overbooked and it is a struggle to fit in new clients, projects, and engagements. But I’ll frankly tell you that I did my best to create this appearance and foster this image before it was a total reality. For example, even when I’m in the office, I very, very rarely take an incoming call from anybody and that’s been my policy for years—years before it was a time management necessity. Often to even have a phone conversation with me, it has to be scheduled as an appointment a week to several weeks in advance.
 I also haven’t used business cards in years. At speaking engagements, there are always a few people who do not rush to purchase the materials I offer but instead come to me asking for my business card. I tell them that I don’t believe in them, and I tell them why: if they aren’t interested enough in what I’ve talked about there to invest a couple of hundred dollars, why would I want them calling me at my office? When new prospects call my office, they’re usually advised to send a brief memo to my attention, describing what they wish to discuss with me, then my assistant will get back to them and arrange a telephone appointment for them to speak with me. Again, these are now time management necessities. But I implemented them for their sales impact before they became unavoidable.
 I describe all this in detail in my No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs book. Typically, sales professionals of almost every stripe at first insist they can’t follow my model in their business, that their clients would never sit still for such limited and rationed access, and that making prospects wait and “jump through hoops” for access will send them to competitors. But I can prove—and do prove—that the exact opposite is true. Over years, countless initially skeptical and nervous sales

# How a Starving Dog Trainer Rid Her Finances of
 Fleas, Once and For All

## At a seminar I was speaking at, Elizabeth R. cornered me on a break to tell me her troubles. She was a very talented, very capable dog obedience trainer. Her credentials, references, and testimonials were pretty impressive. She had a jazzy brochure. She resided in a high-income area. But she was having a devil of a time making ends meet. “What do you charge?” I asked. “$20.00 an hour,” she answered—and she went to the customers’ homes to train their dogs.
 I told her, “You are a professional—a dog therapist. Triple your fee, make the client bring the dog to you, and do not even agree to accept a new client’s dog until the dog takes your special IQ test for dogs. Charge a fee for the initial client consultation and test the dog to be sure it has enough basic intelligence and the proper attitude to respond to training. And make each new client wait at least a week before you fit him or her in.”
 “Immediately send a letter to all your past clients, thanking them for all their past referrals but advising them that, because of the overwhelming demand, you have no choice but to impose new restrictions on accepting new clients. Send a similar letter to present clients, but offer them services at your old fees for six more months. Stop answering your own phone. Dress better.”
 This kind of move takes guts. When you are sitting there, twiddling your thumbs and worrying about the checkbook balance, it requires a lot of nerve not to grab that phone yourself on the first ring, jump in, and sell, sell, sell. I know, I’ve been there.
 A few months after the seminar Elizabeth dropped me a note, letting me know she’d had her first $10,000.00 month, and felt certain she’d make more than $100,000.00 in the next year.
 Interestingly, the Barkley Pet Hotel and Spa, where we now board our “Million Dollar Dog”—her title, not her name; that’s Lady—requires new

## dogs to have a psychological and behavioral assessment before being permitted to participate in group play and doggie day camp while staying there. The Million Dollar Dog flunked, by the way; influenced by me, she is too territorial and does not play well with others, so she must have private play times (at added cost). The Barkley also provides dog training if desired, walks and limo rides, belly rub time, even bedtime stories. Three different size suites, dining options, grooming, and more. A new client must attend a tour and orientation offered only at certain times before being accepted and being able to board a dog there. I was way ahead of them in dispensing my advice to Elizabeth back in 1994. Now I’m a “victim” of my own advice!

# A Real Estate Agent to Learn From

## Real estate agent Peggy B. gets 70% of her listings from referrals, 30% from advertising. Either way, when someone interested in listing a home with Peggy calls her office, the receptionist transfers the call to one of Peggy’s three assistants. The assistant explains that, because Peggy’s services are so much in demand, she employs three client service specialists to, among other things, screen her calls and make certain that the caller’s property meets the strict criteria Peggy has for her listings—otherwise the caller will be referred to another agent.
 The assistant then asks the caller a dozen questions, completing a form as she goes. Ultimately, an appointment is set for Peggy to visit the client’s home several days later.
 Next, a DVD “documentary” about Peggy, her unusual success, and the thorough services she provides is delivered by messenger to the caller’s home. The assistant calls the day of the appointment to be certain that both husband and wife have watched the DVD. In the rare instance where they have not, the assistant postpones or cancels the appointment.
 At the appointment time, the assistant, not Peggy, arrives at the home. She bears a gift of a little package of cookies from a local, upscale bakery, and the bad news that Peggy will be delayed by no more than 20 minutes at a closing. In the meantime, the assistant provides information on the recent selling prices of comparable nearby homes, the length of times they’ve been on the market, related data, and how that is used to calculate a reasonable range from which Peggy will determine their best listing price. Peggy tells me it’s better to have this “dirty work” done by the assistant before she arrives, giving the client time to think about those numbers versus their all- too-often unrealistic expectations concerning the price.
 About 15 minutes later, Peggy calls from her cell phone to announce her imminent arrival. Minutes later, in one of her bright-colored, gold ornament-trimmed Cadillacs, Peggy arrives.

## After apologies and pleasantries, she listens as her assistant quickly “briefs” her, summarizing what’s been discussed so far and setting up the price range. Next, Peggy asks if, while they talk, it’s okay if her assistant goes through the house and takes photographs for potential use in advertising, brochures, websites, and displays at the office. (This, in case you don’t recognize it, is a trial close. Why would they let her go ahead with photography if they weren’t going to list the house with Peggy?)
 The assistant takes her top-quality camera and goes about her business, while Peggy uses her “flip book” to explain the ten steps they’ll use together to get the best possible price for the home in the shortest possible time. At the end, there’s a listing agreement, already partially completed by the assistant from the information obtained over the phone.
 Last year, Peggy listed 92% of the homes where she made this listing presentation immediately, without delay. In almost every one of those cases, Peggy charged an “advertising cost” to the client and collected that from the new client on the spot, too—something most agents do not do. And, of the 8% she did not get immediately, half came to her later.
 “What happens,” I asked Peggy, “when the client objects to that charge, or the price you want them to set, or they question whether or not you’ll be able to give their property’s sale enough attention, considering how busy you are?”
 She replied: “It rarely happens because of the way our relationship is set up from the beginning. But when it does, I TAKE IT AWAY from them. I’ll say something like ‘Well, different approaches are right for different people. You may be more comfortable with a more conventional agent, somebody who will sit here day after day on open houses, be around the office whenever you call, and not be so selective about taking clients.’ Then I’ll pull out my address book and start to recommend a couple of ‘those kinds’ of agents. The client invariably back pedals.”
 I first met Peggy years ago, and included her in prior editions of this book; I checked, and she’s still doing business pretty much the same way. And other leaders in this field—notably a client of mine, Craig Proctor, consistently one of the top ten RE/MAX agents in the world, and a top business coach to more than 3,000 other agents—conducts his business in much the same way. And yes, even in a “tough market.” Actually, Takeaway Selling was even more important in down markets.

# The Power of “Disqualification”

## Most salespeople complain about having too few leads, and struggle mightily to get the ones they get. The sales professionals using all my “Magnetic Marketing” methods attract more leads than they can handle. This supports a radical shift in thinking, to disqualifying prospects as quickly as possible. When you have plenty of choices about who to invest time in, you only want to invest it in what I call Highest Probability Prospects, getting rid of the others, fast. Ruthlessly.
 A number of years back, through a sequence of unusual circumstances, I wound up majority stockholder in and CEO of a custom manufacturing company in a tiny niche. This company was losing money at a breakneck pace, had every business problem imaginable and few unimaginable ones, and as it had no cash, I was not only CEO, but also Vice-Presidents, plural, of everything, and National Sales Manager. After about a month as Sales Manager, I made an astounding discovery: we were manufacturing a lot more quotes than anything else. Our two sales reps were spending half their time doing quotes. We were a quote machine. Unfortunately, only 20% of the clients getting quotes provided were converting, and of those, it was taking an average of five different quotes to wind up with one order. There was a lot of “quote it again with blue boxes instead of four-color” sort of activity.
 To the screaming anguish of the sales reps, I instituted a new policy: $500.00 charged any new, prospective client for quotes on a project, $200.00 to all but a few “Grade AAA” established clients, applied to the order but otherwise non-refundable, paid in advance, credit card or check. For about two weeks, the reps alternated the death march in and out of my office, weeping, wailing, and gnashing their teeth over all the prospects who were outraged and going elsewhere for quotes. However, at the end of 60 days, the results told a different story. We now issued about one-third fewer new project quotes, and had driven off only 18 of about 300 past accounts,

## all 18 high in the pain-in-rear quotient, low in profit. Conversions on the two-thirds new project quotes done doubled. The speed of the process, quote to conversion, went from an average of 40 days to 15, thanks to another of my new policies: quote fee refundable only for 21 days. Further, overall sales were up because the reps had more time to sell, to follow-up (only) on really viable leads, had less activity swirling around them thus a clearer, more harshly accurate picture of what might close in the immediate future. One of the two, who actually “got it,” tripled her commissions over the next three months. By forcing her to disqualify, I multiplied her income.
 Being aggressive about disqualifying a prospect takes courage. Being a sales wimp, though, carries its own high price in pain.

# How Do New Economy Customers Respond to
 Takeaway Selling?

## When it’s done right—better than ever.
 The New Economy Customer are, as I’ve repeatedly emphasized, more discerning, more circumspect, more critically analytical. They are in search of trustworthy expertise, not just products and services, in virtually every category. They want the best value for their money, not necessarily the lowest price or fee. Consequently, they are assessing and judging the sales professionals they encounter, they sift and sort and choose in new and different ways. They are willing to wait, even to qualify for the opportunity to work with the best, the most competent, the most expert real estate agent, financial advisor, pest control operator, even dog trainer.
 For you, there’s a second incentive to master and convert to Takeaway Selling: power. In The New Economy, the power shifted back to the customers and they’re well aware of it. In order to recapture power in the buying-selling equation, you need to be dealing with prospects and customers especially eager and predisposed to be doing business only with you. It may be counterintuitive, but the reality is that you can’t get into that position with traditional selling approaches. You can’t get into that positioning by being more accessible, more instantly and continuously accessible, overly eager, too “easy” to every and any suitor. Once a relationship is in place, of course, providing exceptional service as agreed to by you and your customers is crucial. At the very first point of entry, such as via your lead generation advertising, walking through a door and identifying themselves as valid prospects needs to be easy. But in between that first step and an actual relationship, you can only gain and own power by making the customer earn the opportunity to be accepted as your customer or client.
