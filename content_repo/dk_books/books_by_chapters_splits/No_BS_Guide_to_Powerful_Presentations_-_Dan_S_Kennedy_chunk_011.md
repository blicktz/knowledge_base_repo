###### There are two ways to get this effect. The obvious one is deep discounting against a real or artificially inflated price. The trouble with this is that it can cost you serious money or, if artificial, it can compromise your credibility. Some presenters also feel badly about the tactic, and any negative feelings you hold about what you are doing will be smelled by an audience. You can use this, but use it cautiously.
 The other one I like better is Perpetual Contrast. For example, my real estate training course is $1,000.00 but it will help you become a real estate millionaire in 36 months or less, and it is as complete and systematic as a McDonald’s® franchise that would cost you $250,000.00. The contrast is $1,000.00 vs. $1 million, and $1,000.00 vs. $250,000.00. You can also contrast to trivial items: That same $1,000.00 system making you a millionaire in three years costs you just 91 cents a day, and you can’t make a Starbucks stop once a day for that.
 For a presentation used by orthodontists providing top-level treatment at premium fees, Dan Kennedy used references to other purchase decisions that affluent and discerning people make when they choose to buy higher


-----

###### quality, higher priced goods or services than they have to—home furnishings, automobiles, vacation travel and accommodations. These are compared to and contrasted with $7,000.00 to $9,000.00 Invisalign® braces and treatment, which has the added benefit of gently shaming the parent who thinks that $7,000.00 is a lot to pay for their kid’s braces, when they spend that much flying first class and staying at a top resort for a few days, when coach and cheaper hotels were options.
 In our field, with seminars, we can often make a case tied to nominal income increase. If, for example, a seminar carries a price tag of $5,000.00, and you earn—or intend to earn—$200,000.00 a year, the fee is only a measly 2.5%. We say: Do you really think you can go through this entire seminar and not go home empowered to increase your income by at least 2.5%?

##### Triangle 3: Reassurance

###### Dave said that the number-one reason why somebody in your audience doesn’t accept your offer is that they remember a time or times when they believed somebody like you about some comparable promises and feel they were let down or deceived. This can explain why 100 people go to the trouble of coming to watch your presentation as a webinar, and stay all the way to the end, but only 20 purchase your product.
 People can get reassurance several different ways. See Figure 6.4. One is by your guarantee or guarantees, which Dave discussed.

 FIGURE 6.4: Triangle 3: Reassurance


-----

###### Another is a bigger reason they identify with. An example is the business donating a percentage of sales to a charity or worthy cause the audience has affinity for—like The Wounded Warrior Project, to which boomers and seniors have affinity, or as Dan Kennedy does, to animal and animal rescue charities. Or if the business has a mission, or a movement— as Trump characterized his campaign, so people are supporting and are part of something bigger and more important than just the transaction. This can provide a good story, halo-effect credibility, pictures, and video for your presentations.
 Another way people get reassurance is by identifying with a bigger reason (for doing business with you). This works so well it is illegal in certain fields. In the seminar world where Dave and I do a lot of work, it is not uncommon for the seminar promoter to let certain people attend an event free if they get two or three of their “tribe” to pay the fee to attend. The technicalities of this are beyond this book, but know it is a possibility. An audience can be motivated by some secondary opportunity they must first own and use the offered product or service to get.


-----

###### As shown in Figure 6.5 on page 50, these Triangles connect with each other, and when you can use all three, you make it very hard for people to say no to your offer, which is the goal!

##### CHAPTER 7

### The Structure of Promises

###### by Dan Kennedy

 he Irresistible Offer—the one those in your audience would crawl across broken glass on naked knees to get—is the heart and soul of a great presentation. Creating and delivering anything less is a squandering of some of the opportunity you obtained by being

# Table to make a presentation, and squandering opportunity is a sin!

###### One way to think about your Irresistible Offer is as the means of fulfilling a magnificent, desired promise. Great presentations make great promises.
 My famous Magnetic Marketing System® presentation, responsible for selling tens of millions of dollars of that System and bringing tens of thousands of customers into my businesses, was usually delivered to audiences comprised of independent, small-business owners and sales professionals. Very early in it, I made each group an irresistible promise . . .

 If you are a small-business owner, you are an advertising victim. After today, you will never again spend even one dollar on advertising without knowing it directly brings you customers, sales, and profits.


-----

###### If you are a sales professional, after today, you will never again need to do “cold” prospecting.

 Later, my Irresistible Offer provided the means—in this case the take- home tool kit—of fulfilling those promises.

##### Four Ways to Structure a Great Promise

###### There are different kinds of promises and structures for promises. Most people do put them into presentations, but most people put in weak and poorly designed ones. Here are the four ways to structure a great promise.

 #1: BIG Stated Promises versus Small, Implied Promises

 Examples of ordinary, small promises are:

 1. Learn how to boost your immune system 2. 50 tips for a more bountiful garden 3. The five best hiding places in your home for your valuables 4. Amazing home remedies that heal without drugs or doctors 5. There is a new frontier in America—making some who are “in the
 know” rich

 All five of these have two flaws in common. First, they share implication. The direct, personal benefit to you is not boldly stated, but left for you to get for yourself from the statement. Second, they are small and rather timid. They’re all “good,” but not “great.”
 Here they are, re-crafted as big, stated promises:

 #1

 DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF PEOPLE WHO NEVER GET SICK!

 #2


-----

###### GET 50 TIPS FROM MASTER GARDENERS AND GROW TWICE THE
 GARDEN FOR HALF THE COST—AND MAKE YOUR NEIGHBORS
 GREEN WITH ENVY!

 #3

 FOIL EVEN PROFESSIONAL BURGLARS AND THIEVES SO THEY
 CAN NEVER FIND YOUR VALUABLES HIDDEN IN YOUR OWN
 HOME.

 #4

 LIVE AT LEAST 15 YEARS LONGER THAN YOUR “LIFE EXPECTANCY”—AND STAY OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, AND RARELY NEED A DOCTOR, EVEN STAY OFF OF PRESCRIPTION
 DRUGS!

 #5

 YOU CAN GET VERY RICH, VERY FAST—IF YOU’LL JOIN THOSE
 “IN THE KNOW” ABOUT “THE NEW FRONTIER” IN AMERICA.

 You can see that the stated, big-promise rewrites lend themselves much better to Irresistible Offers.

 #2: Promises Framed as Questions

 In some situations, for various reasons, you may not want to make a direct, stated, big promise. In these cases, you can frame the promise as a question or even a series of questions, still setting up an Irresistible Offer. Here are several actual examples from different presentations:

 A


-----

###### YOU—A Millionaire? Did you know there’s a new millionaire explosion going on in America right now? More ordinary men and women rose to the ranks of millionaires this year than any prior year. How can this be? Do they share a secret? If you knew their secret, could you and would you be willing to follow simple 1–2–3, A–B–C directions, and invest as little as one hour a day?

 B

 Have you ever noticed there seem to be some people who can eat whatever they want, as much as they want—but never gain weight? What if everything you’ve been told about dieting is wrong? If you could actually reset your metabolism to burn more body fat without starving or exercising, would you be . . .?

 C

 If you could be guaranteed financial gains but fully protected against losses, if you could share in the upside of a rising stock market but never risk more than 20% of your principal, would you want to know about this special investment strategy? What if you could be “in the market” but never again have a worried, sleepless night? Is it possible to double your retirement income without any risk?
 The beauty of these questions in presentations is that people hear the promises and don’t really hear the question marks punctuating them. The promise is what “sticks,” so you can loop back to it with your Irresistible Offer.

 #3: Primary Promises and Secondary Promises

 You more than double the impact of a primary promise by following it with several reinforcing, secondary promises. As an example, for my Magnetic Marketing System®, for salespeople, my primary promise is: put an end to “cold” prospecting once and for all. That produces a number of secondary benefits that can also be promised:


-----

###### • Now you can invest 100% of your time in actually selling—not
 hunting for someone to sell to.
 • You can double or triple your income easily and automatically, when
 you’re able to stop wasting time on prospecting.
 • You’ll be the envy of everybody else in the office—when they watch
 good, quality prospects literally line up to talk to you, without you ever making a cold call or suffering through another networking event to get them.
 • With the stress of never quite knowing where your next prospect is
 coming from—or when—erased, you can relax and enjoy selling again.
 • You’ll be home on time for dinner! Your spouse, kids, and friends
 will notice the difference in you.

 A good rule of thumb is three to five secondary promises for each primary promise.
 If you prefer, these three can all be reframed as questions, per #4. Either way, again, your Irresistible Offer loops back to them.

 #4: Complex, Stacked Promises

 Dale Carnegie’s and Napoleon Hill’s famous bestselling books’ titles delivered two-part, stacked promises:

 (1) Win Friends and (2) Influence People

 (1) Grow Rich with (2) Peace of Mind

 Arguably, either one would be a good enough promise, but stacked the sum has more impact than 1 + 1 = 2.
 A promise for my training is complex. It stacks three promises:

 You get a (1) Marketing Message that is magnetically attractive plus (2) the ability to target the right Market certain to be responsive plus (3) the ability to choose and use the best Media to deliver your Message to the Market.


-----

###### A very successful presentation for a luxury time-share vacation club stacked its promises this way:

 (1) You stay in magnificent, multi-million-dollar mansions, lakefront and beachfront homes, and ski and golf resort homes— never hotels or condos, with (2) complete privacy, (3) made ready for your stay to your liking, by your instructions, (4) all-inclusive, with no hidden or surprise charges and (5) your satisfaction completely guaranteed.

 Such complex promises might not be practical in advertising given impatient and fleeting attention, but in a presentation delivered to a captive audience in a physical location, or to a deliberately tuned-in audience at a webcast or online video, a multi-item, stacked promise can work well. It can be repeated. It can be said and shown on slide or screen graphically. It can be dissected and re-assembled. When looped back to the Irresistible Offer, there’s a higher level of support for the offer than by any single, simple promise.
 Once you decide on and craft your presentation’s promise or promises, and decide on the Irresistible Offer that fulfills or facilitates fulfillment of the promises, you have the foundation of and the bookends for your presentation. In a sense, everything between the promise and the fulfillment by Irresistible Offer is a bridge the audience is guided across. You are literally leading them to The Promised Land!

##### CHAPTER 8

### Presentainer® Secrets of
 Mass Persuasion

###### by Dave VanHoose

 here’s not much real certainty in business or in life.
 I’ve been involved in selling by presentations for a very long time, and I believe I know a number of things about it, but I am also always still learning and, hopefully, improving. I was asked at

# Ta seminar if I could talk about any one thing about creating and

###### delivering presentations that was a rock-solid certainty. There is.
 The more experience I got with developing presentations and with delivering them as a speaker, the more certain I became that . . .

 The more you teach,
 the less you sell.

 In the beginning, I fell into the trap that catches most speakers and presenters: being a professor. I learned that it is much more useful to be a Presentainer®—our word at Speaking Empire for somebody who can move an audience emotionally, connect with them personally, and entertain them on some level. This is the only way to hold attention and grow interest. It


-----

###### makes you more memorable and your presentation more influential. It involves the audience as they like to be involved. The TV they watch, the movies they see twice, the games they play, and the novels they read all do this, and so should you.
 Here’s what being a Presentainer® looks like: Figure 8.1 shows that if you have a powerful presentation, as we’ve been discussing, and you have the right mindset about it, yourself, and your audience, and you have the right delivery, you win every time. Let’s talk about delivery.

 FIGURE 8.1: Presentation/Delivery/Mindset Triangle

##### 1: Leading and Ending

###### The classic, textbook speaking formula applies: tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them. This lets you first create a sense of anticipation, getting the audience sitting on the edge of their seats and hanging on every word. Most of the great stage magicians of the golden era, Houdini included, always told the audience about the illusion they would next see, in very dramatic terms—they didn’t just go out on stage and perform the trick. At the other end, you summarize


-----

###### what you have told and shown them, because people tend to very quickly forget key points of any complex presentation.

##### 2: The Yes State

###### Small commitments lead to more substantial commitments. Resistance is better erased a little bit at a time. As a presenter, your goal is to have people say yes to you, mentally and physically, a number of times during your presentation. You can involve people by getting them to raise their hands, yell a word or phrase of agreement—“Yes” will do, even getting “all those who . . .” to stand up. With most audiences, there is limited response to the first attempt at this, and you have to joke with them and cajole them to get more of them to play.
 At Speaking Empire, we usually build some Yes State questions, requests for agreement, and moments into every presentation.
 A lot of things can affect the audience’s state: who they are, how they came into the audience—willingly or “sent” by an employer—time of day and fatigue, what they know in advance about you and your presentation, and location. This hands you two responsibilities: first, to do what you can to help get them into a positive mental attitude about you and your presentation’s benefits and benefits of benefits before they are actually with you. Second, to be able to “take the temperature” of a group and make some adjustments on the fly if it is cold, to warm it up. The first of these is really all about marketing, and I suggest reading Dan Kennedy’s book No B.S. Guide to Trust-Based Marketing for a lot of good guidance.
 The one thing never to do is to leave an audience’s mental and emotional state to random chance and try to deal with it in a single leap over a tall wall toward the end of your presentation.

##### 3: The Seven-Minute Rule

###### Have you ever seen a speaker start strong but lose his audience sometime during his presentation? The audience starts slumping, fidgeting, and even looking at their phones—at worst, getting up and leaving—one after


-----

###### another. In making Speaking Empire the go-to company for developing powerful presentations, we’ve done a lot of research, as well as drawn from our own experience. One of the areas where there is a lot of research to be had is in the neurosciences. One fact for which there is consensus is that the human brain can only maintain focus for seven minutes. It basically fades, stops, and restarts in seven-minute cycles. That’s why you need to get your audience to re-engage with you every seven minutes. You can do this with a quick request or direction, like:

 • Raise your hand if _________
 • You’ll want to write this down.
 • Stand up if—or—stand up and do ____________
 • Turn to your neighbor and _______
 • Repeat after me . . .
