STRATEGY 11ALWAYS COMPARE APPLES
 TO ORANGES

## “You can’t compare apples to oranges.”
 I’m sure you’ve heard that; I encourage you to get it completely out of your mind! The secret to eliminating price resistance is to compare apples to oranges! Let me give you a personal example:
 During one four-year period, I built the largest integrated publishing and seminar business exclusively serving chiropractors and dentists in North America. In my seminars for SuccessTrak Inc., I sold a 12-month “trak” (subscription) of audio programs on practice promotion and success subjects. Counting the bonus items, there were 18 audio programs in the one-year program—sold then for $499.00.
 At the time, most audio programs, available on a variety of topics, sold for an average of $10.00 each. On that basis, these 18 audio programs would have sold for only $180.00. My price was 275% above par. The economics of marketing via free seminars required that we sell for the considerably higher price. Also, due to the specialized, valuable nature of the information in these programs, we felt justified in commanding the higher price. But how do you clearly and successfully justify that price to the consumer? Obviously, if you compare other apples to apples, the commodity to the commodity, you’re dead.
 In this case, we compared audio programs to seminars. If the participants obtained the same basic information that was in the audio programs by attending the seminars on which they were based, the doctors would have spent thousands of dollars on enrollment fees alone, not to mention time away from their practices during the week (which is very costly) or away from family on weekends, travel and lodging costs, and other expenses. All things considered, by buying the audio programs, people could save much more than $3,000.00!

## By switching to an apples-to-oranges comparison, I presented a compelling argument of savings to the consumer. (This also relates to Strategy 10: Sell Money at a Discount.)

# Most of the Advice You Get About Dealing with
 Price Resistance Is Wrong

## If you deal with price resistance by arguing in favor of your higher quality, your better service, etc., you will find your sales work difficult most of the time. People do want superior quality goods and services, but they still don’t enjoy paying premium prices for them. Many marketers fight that battle unnecessarily.
 It is much easier and much more effective to switch the standards of comparison. Win by comparing apples to oranges and then “throw in” the superior quality at “no extra cost.”
 If you are in a selling situation where there is heads-on competition, even competitive bidding, this technique can still be used. There was a situation in which I was consulting with a manufacturing company in direct competitive bid warfare with a lower-price opponent, losing bid after bid. I said: “Something has to change here.” They said: “It can’t. We can’t cut our prices any lower.” I said: “If we can’t come in with the lower bid, we might as well come in with an even higher bid—but let’s change the rules of the game when we do it.” They began changing the specifications for the bids, adding value, bundling goods and services together, extending warranties and including delivery and completion guarantees. Then we built a “HOW TO COMPARE OUR BID WITH OTHERS” Checklist. When it was all said and done, they started getting projects they’d been losing to low bidders before.
 The savvy sales pro learns to alter the “rules of the games” to give himself or herself an overwhelming advantage. Forget all about “playing fair.” Forget all about competing on a “level playing field.” These are clichés that are best lasered out of your consciousness. All your life, you’ve been told to “play fair,” and that conditioning of your subconscious may be holding you back now. Selling in competitive situations is all about finding or inventing an unfair advantage for yourself.

## That’s exactly the approach I took with this client. I analyzed their operations and discovered that they were in a position to include warehousing and fulfillment at a much lower cost than their competitor could possibly do. By adding that service to their specifications, their higher quote became the most attractive quote.

# Specialization and Customization Prevent Apples
 to Apples Comparisons

## In one of the issues of my No B.S. Marketing Letter, I featured the ads of a company selling a nutritional supplement to improve eyesight, labeled for and advertised in magazines read by hunters. Unbeknownst to those reading the magazines for outdoorsmen, the same company advertised the same product, labeled differently, in magazines for private pilots. In truth, the nutrients with potential of improving eyesight are limited, and eyesight improvement is eyesight improvement, so you could buy these exact same supplements from any health food store shelf for significantly less money. But the fact that this product was for a very particular customer precludes price shopping by most, and the fact that it’s being advertised and sold in specialized media read only by those particular customers creates a competition and comparison free zone in which to make the sale. The exact same principles apply to selling in person, face to face, to customers or clients; consumers or B2B. You want to be perceived and presented as a specialist for a particular type of customer, with products or services specifically for them, and you want to use that positioning to create a competition and comparison free zone to sell in. For more depth on this, I urge reading Chapters 36 and 37 of my book, No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent.
 In concert, the strategy of customization. To stay in the same product category, if I decide on a vitamin, mineral, and herbal supplement regimen by myself and go to the health food store, a catalog, or a website to buy products, I’ll have some pre-conceived thoughts about what I might be willing to spend—and if one of the products I want is Omega-3 Fish Oil, I may very well price shop it or otherwise compare one brand to another, and weigh its source, potency, and price. But if I go to my doctor and get a battery of blood tests, hair analysis and other assessments, then a personal prescription for exactly what I need to take, specifying the precise number

## of milligrams of this and ounces of that, and that exact product combination is then offered to me by that doctor, will I take the list of components and ingredients and go search for different, cheaper alternatives to assemble my own package? 99% won’t. They will not question or consider price at all. They will take the prescription. Why? Three reasons—and you want to replicate all three in your own selling:
 1. The prescription came from an authority figure, not perceived as “a salesman.”
 2. The customer sought out the expert and his advice including his specific prescription.
 3. The seller provided a customized, personalized product. If you’d like to permanently escape the world of apples to apples comparisons, there’s your prescription.
