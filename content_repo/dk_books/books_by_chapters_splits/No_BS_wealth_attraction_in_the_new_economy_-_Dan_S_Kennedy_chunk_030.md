## No Waiting

#### Walt Disney started the company that became Disney as we know it today just as the Great Depression was about to start — after a previous bankruptcy. W.

#### long; of successful companies birthed in sour times, with remarkably poor timing.

 Timing definitely matters. The difference between salad and garbage is timing. The market is often ripe for a particular thing after some have tried bringing it forward too early, and before some arrive too late. It is also true that there are times when it is easier to do a thing than at other times. In 2008, for example, merger and acquisition activity was at a five-year low and both capital and financing for deals was held in tight fists; however, the giant Imbev/Anheuser-Busch deal did get done, and at breakneck speed, from start to finish in just 90 days, with the M&A attorneys sleeping on couches at the office and working seven-day weeks. Would it have been easier to do a year or two earlier? Probably. But the players weren’t ready then. I suppose it’s better to have timing as an ally when and if possible, but that still doesn’t often justify waiting for it. Because trying to correctly time timing is as close to impossible as we can get. There is nonsense sold to casino gamblers about trying to time their entry into table games just as they are getting “hot” or to snag a slot machine that has been primed; but every spin and every deal is random and its own event. Investors and speculators who try timing markets and predicting bottoms and tops are invariably slaughtered.

 In marketing, timing is often blamed for other sins. Countless products, from pantyhose to weight loss products and skin care for men to pet vitamins were brought to the market and failed dismally and all but disappeared only to re-surface and become immensely popular. Were they at first “before their time” and only later an “idea whose time has come”—thus victims and beneficiaries of timing—or were they at first improperly positioned, poorly marketed, or otherwise handicapped? The trouble with timing is that it is so hard to control. You could put the same product or proposition before me one week and get a “no” and a week earlier or later get a “yes.” But how could you know the right week in advance? (This is why the smartest marketers identify a target prospect group in which everyone will be ripe at some point, and there is sufficient value to justify being omnipresent.)

#### “The Only Time Is NOW Time”

 —DR. EDWARD KRAMER

 Ultimately, most who attract wealth seem to plow ahead regardless of the conditions and circumstances they must plow through, helped at times by fortuitous timing but refusing to be hindered by disadvantageous timing. Had Disney or Stone or Gates or Bezos heeded wise counsel, erred on the side of caution, and waited for better times, would we still have the empire of the Mouse on which the sun never sets? Would Stone have ever built his company and still become a billionaire? Would we still be enslaved by Microsoft? Would we still all be buying from Amazon? I don’t know, I can’t guess, and there’s no way for anyone else to know either. But for the most part, it’s not what wealth attractors usually do, so it’s not the kind of question they ever ponder. They are busy doing, while others are pondering.

 In many ways, timing has recently seemed unfavorable for so many things, yet I’m certain that a decade from now, there’ll be a Disney and a Stone and a Gates with stories to tell of starting something when everyone advised them not to, when every hill seemed steep, when every door seemed closed, at this time, right now. Because it’s never the person who catalogs all the reasons not to who winds up in front or at the top or glorified in the media or getting a suntan on the deck of his yacht. It’s really quite difficult to tell the difference between brazen and reckless and reasonably prudent and cautious and over-timid and intimidated. That’s why getting it right pays so well. Because it’s difficult. Reprinted from The No B.S. MARKETING GOLD LETTER, supplement to No B.S. MARKETING LETTER published by Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™], www.DanKennedy.com .
