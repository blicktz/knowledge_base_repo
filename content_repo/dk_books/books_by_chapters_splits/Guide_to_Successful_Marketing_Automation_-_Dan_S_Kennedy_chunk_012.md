###### American-looking young man can’t be tomorrow’s keynote speaker. He looked like he belonged on a high school baseball team. Nick leads me straight to him. “Russell, there’s someone here I’d like you to meet.” He proceeded to introduce me as a premier sponsor of the event. The three of us shared a bit of small talk, and then Nick says his goodbyes and left us for the night.
 Now imagine… There I am, it’s 9:30 at night, and I’ve just met Russell Brunson. At that time, I had no idea what a big deal this was or the impact it would have on my career in the coming years. “So, what do you do?” I asked, hoping for a preview of what tomorrow’s presentation might be about. He smiled. He grabbed a pen out of his pocket. He reached for a napkin out of the plastic holder on the bar. And he started drawing stick figures. If I had only known what I was witnessing then, I would have kept that napkin. Russell’s stick figure drawing would be worth a fortune today.
 He started to tell me about a thing he had named “click funnels.” He was illustrating with his stick figures while he spoke. He told me that the funnels he had invented were like digital roads that move your dream customers to your website with credit cards in hand. Once someone enters, they are “funneled” along whatever sales journey you design, contained, unable to roam free—like water poured into the top of a metal funnel.
 He talked about how it was a one-stop marketing shop. A shop that gives you everything you need to market, sell, and deliver online products or promote any kind of offline business online. He said his slogan was: You Are Only One Funnel Away from Your Fortune.
 I remember my excitement building as he talked. In part because he was so passionate about what he was saying. And in part because I was already realizing how I could use his funnels to serve my clients.
 We talked on. Ten minutes’ and two napkins’ worth of drawing later, he asked, “What about you, Parthiv? What do you do?” I told him I design and build landing pages and personalized URLs. He shook his head and chuckled. “Aren’t you afraid my software will make you obsolete in a few years?” I grinned. “Nope, not in the least. And here’s why. From our 10 minutes together here and your stick figures, I can see this is powerful. A game changer. Tomorrow, you’re going to walk onstage. You’ll tell the

###### audience all about the power of ClickFunnels and how they’ll make a lot of money once they buy your software. They will buy it.” Russell looked at me, puzzled. “I don’t see how this works in your favor, then.” I smiled. “My prediction is everyone who buys your software tomorrow night will hire me in the next three to six months. Most of the people in the audience are busy. They are busy being dentists. They are busy being doctors. Lawyers. Real estate developers. Many are thrilled that they can turn on a computer and access their email without tech support. They will see the potential of your software. Recognize it as the innovative next step they must take to be successful. Then promptly feel overwhelmed when they have to read the owner’s manual—even though you make it simple. They are simply too busy. And that’s where I come in.”
 Russell smiled, giving me a knowing look. “I see your point.” I pointed to his stick figures. “I get what you’re talking about. I think I’ll be one of your biggest fans. Tomorrow, I may be the only guy in the room who really understands what ClickFunnels can do. Your software will help me go faster. It will help me serve my clients better. It will help me make more money. And that’s why I’m not worried. Because ClickFunnels will help me achieve my goal—helping my clients build an online presence that makes them a lot of money.”
 My business has become much more complex and multifaceted since then, just as the digital world has. The secret to success then and now and for the foreseeable future is being able to fully organize and control the thoughts, interests, movement, and maturation of a potential customer, from the very first sight of you they have, wherever that is, forward all the way to the sale. You might want to pull that sentence out and write it down somewhere. Next, the secret is to be able to actually implement the scheme you architect to do that. That is what my business does for businesses now, and ClickFunnels is a big tool in our tool kit.
 The next day, I attended Russell’s session. He was on fire. The audience loved him. His passion and engaging manner were infectious. I was among the first in a long line to buy ClickFunnels. It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. And my life has been changed ever since.

###### Russell, if you aren’t familiar, has become a major business celebrity in the online marketing space. Maybe, arguably, the Steve Jobs of the field. His company has tens of thousands of users, an army of consultants using ClickFunnels for their clients, and a complete ecosystem for support of his users. His annual ClickFunnels Live is attended by over 5,000 people.
 Today, I have over 450 Click Funnels. I build more all the time. Five of my funnels have generated well over 9 million dollars. directly, and much more over the long term of the customers’ lives. As I write this, I’ve been a ClickFunnels Certified Partner for almost 9 years. I’ve won Two Comma Club awards—the award granted by Russell Brunson to those who have generated over a million dollars in revenue with a single Click Funnel. I’ve done this twice. And I have also won the prestigious 2CCX award, granted solely to entrepreneurs with a single Click Funnel that generates over $10 million in revenue. You can see my journey with ClickFunnels from 2016 through 2019, including how I earned these awards at eLaunchers.com/journey.

#### Is It Really True—Can You Be Just One Great
 Funnel Away from Your Fortune?

###### What took me over the top…what got me where I am today with ClickFunnels—award winner, record breaker, moneymaker— was when I took a book funnel from Russell’s book DOTCOM Secrets. (By “book funnel,” I mean a Click Funnel that promotes a book, which, in turn, promotes a business. Something any marketer of anything, from a local dental or financial advisory practice to a global marketer of nutritional supplements, can use. It is completely automated.) I studied it. Went over every nuance. Implemented it. And started driving traffic to it in 2016. I’ve

-----

###### been growing rich off it ever since. In 2019, this funnel made its first one- millionth dollar. This won me my first Two Comma Club award with ClickFunnels. I was excited. And I wanted more. I could see the potential. I could see that I’d barely touched the tip of this iceberg. I knew that if anyone could help me capitalize on this idea, it would be the man with whom I’m writing this book. I went to Dan Kennedy. He augmented my book funnel. With his guidance and advice, I made it better. I made more money. The cash rolled in. I attached my “Business Kamasutra” marketing automation campaign to the back of the funnels and created an end-to-end implementation of Magnetic Marketing. Things were going great…better than I’d predicted. Then the world fell apart.
 I think this story is important because there are occasional black swan events. It’s part of business and part of life. You can best survive them financially if you have good, productive systems in place.
 Do you remember what was happening in April of 2019? Neither do I. But I bet you do remember April 2020. Glued to the television. Listening to the talking heads in Washington and our local government. Stay inside. Wear masks. Avoid everyone. You likely remember the rush at the supermarkets. The rationing of essential items like toilet paper and cough medicine. How every time someone coughed, it started a panic. Did you lose a loved one? Did you lose your ability to earn a living? Did you lose your business? 2020 was the year business as usual stopped.
 You are not alone. In 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris noted that over ⅓ of small businesses closed permanently due to the pandemic. As I write these words, the numbers are improving, but the hit was brutal nonetheless. COVID sent me scrambling. After all, I am a small business owner. During one of Russell Brunson’s seminars, I remember he posed the question, “What will you do if everything is taken away from you?” COVID tested this. My revenue dried up like the African Nile during a drought. What was I to do? I had a team to feed. A family to feed. A business my wife and I had put our hearts and souls into.
 I remember Russell’s question swimming through my head every day. “What do I do now that everything has been taken away?”

-----

###### I made a set of promises to myself and my team. No one gets fired. No one has their hours cut. No one’s hourly rate is reduced. Vendors get paid on time.
 Spoiler alert: I made it through. How? I called in the big guns. I called Dan Kennedy. I called my chief copywriter, Russell Martino. I made a wish. “Make it rain, guys! The sky has fallen. It’s time for the battle of our lives. It’s the day we’ve been preparing for.”
 They delivered. And out of the darkness came the light. My new Prism Campaign, with its subsequent funnels, was born through the collaboration and genius of Russell Martino, Dan Kennedy, and myself.
 The Prism Campaign saved eLaunchers from going the way of so many unfortunate businesses during the height of the pandemic. My promises were kept. Not only was I able to pay and retain my staff and pay vendors on time, but by August 2020, Prism had generated enough revenue to get us out of the red, and by the close of 2020, we ended in the black. Despite the struggle, heartache, and anxiety, we ended 2020 as a profitable year. Without having systems and automated systems, we’d have died.
 But the story doesn’t end there. The Prism Campaign made its one- millionth dollar in early 2021, earning me my second Two Comma Club award with ClickFunnels. This campaign pulled us through the most challenging year in my professional career. It then surpassed my expectations and set a new precedent for how we do business at eLaunchers.
 The Prism Campaign was all about “sharing—not selling.” I told business owners how my funnels worked and then gave them away for free. This worked for the same reasons I discussed with Russell Brunson at our first meeting long ago at a lonely bar counter far, far away. The funnels work. Anyone with a brain can see that. Giving them away for free shows I am willing to offer something of value. In a time of trauma for most business owners, I chose not to ask for up-front fees or sell goods or services at the start of new relationships.
 Still, my clients are primarily doctors, dentists and lawyers, real estate developers, and some peers in what we call the information marketing industry. These businesspeople are busy. They can tell my funnels will

###### make them money. But they don’t have the time to implement them. So, they called me. Mr. Implementation. That started many conversations that led to profitable, long-lasting relationships. Relationships from which my clients and I still profit today. So here’s the moral of the story. ClickFunnels works.

##### CHAPTER 6

# Your CRM System, Your Essential Automation to Sell
 More to More Satisfied Customers Who Will Stay, Pay,
 and Refer

##### By Parthiv Shah

###### Seducing a single person is a lot of work, but it is doable. However, enticing hundreds or thousands of people to choose you, sign on with you as a repeat or recurring customer, set aside lowest price interest, and stay in love can be overwhelming! Trying to do everything needed for such strong relationships by yourself or manually by your staff is impossible. From time to time, there won’t be enough hours in the day to send those thank-you notes or recognize those birthdays or get out a commentary on news important to your customers or promptly acknowledge a question or problem. Decided on relationship enhancers, things, people will slip through the cracks.

-----

###### This is where technology comes in. Specifically, a customer relationship manager (CRM). There are many CRMs available to business owners, but they all have one thing in common—their entire purpose is to help you establish a long, fruitful, strong bond with your customers, clients, or patients. It is not just to manage lists and data or provide a necessary evil of customer service. It is to build relationships.
 Over the next few minutes, I am going to share some generalized information about how you can use CRMs to massively increase your interaction, sales, and customer value. Before we get started in earnest, let me share the role of data in your client, customer, and patient relationships.

#### Why and How to Get Data for Your
 Relationships

###### Data in relationships is information and feedback. What you don’t know about people you have relationships with can get you into a lot of trouble. What you do know can be extremely useful. In an individual relationship, things like her attitude about Valentine’s Day, favorite color, meaningful childhood experiences, food allergies, love of (or dislike of) old movies, etc., are all useful. You collect this without thinking about it as data. But it is. With large groups of customers, this same kind of data is hard to come by and more difficult to use, although list segmentation by our CRM and/or with your Keap, HubSpot, Mailchimp, or other software is doable. But with big customer populations, you will probably want other useful data. Do these customers only respond to “big sale” promotions, while these other customers aren’t nearly as responsive to such promotions as they are to V.I.P., By Invitation Only Exclusive Trunk Sales? Do these customers have kids, but these customers do not? And so on. This data can facilitate both list segmentation and on-target messaging. So, we want to:

1. Capture, catalog, analyze, and display data that builds a relationship.
2. Use data to manage friction in relationships. If you know they think about “x” in a certain

way or have a particular set of references related to “x” (by their age, occupations, incomes),
you can avoid innocently irritating, and you can leverage agreement. For example, if you
know and can segment which of your customers served in the military and which didn’t, you
have a good opportunity for a Veterans Day promotion delivered only to veterans.

3. When you are able to talk to different groups within your customers differently, at different

times, you can be more effective.
4. Whenever you default to mass, generic communication, you reduce the feeling of a

relationship. The more you communicate to Mary Customer in a way that shows you know
her, about her, and care about her concerns, the more you have a relationship.

###### The good news is that we can use a CRM to automate those systems. That way we can easily build trust with our prospects— as long as we are attracting the right prospects to begin with.

#### The First Date Is Just the Beginning

###### A lot of businesses foolishly, lazily, or ineptly treat their first transaction as the victory at the end of a certain amount of work and investment. Oh boy, we made five sales today! Really smart, industrious, and capable business owners think of that same sale as the start of something.
 Let’s assume you had your first transaction with your client. Congratulations. I hope it was as enjoyable for the customer as it was for you! I hope it was profitable. I hope it is the beginning of a brand-new relationship. The first transaction is important because it can put you in a role, with status, where the customer is getting accustomed to trusting you and willing to pay attention to you whenever you show up, however you show up. That will be cemented or it will dissolve depending on everything you do next—not what you did with the first sale.
 If you scheme out everything you can to convert that first date into a situation where the customer is just as eager to see more of you as you are eager to see more of them, you then have the challenge of no-fail, consistent implementation. Even if you have a system in your head, if that system isn’t being executed with the same dogged reliability as a robot tightening a bolt on an assembly line—exactly to X torque on every piece, every time— you might as well not have a system at all. Business owners have a lot of good ideas and plans and schemes in their head that don’t happen. That’s where a CRM comes in. With a CRM you can set up automation that will make sure every customer is handled the right way every time.
