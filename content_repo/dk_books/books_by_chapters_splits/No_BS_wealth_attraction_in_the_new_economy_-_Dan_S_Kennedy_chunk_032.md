 Since then, the unimaginable transformation touches every aspect of the University—an educational, physical, and environmental metamorphosis. The results garnered national acclaim—U.S. News and World Report’s “America’s Best Colleges” 2009 edition ranks HPU at No. 1 among “Up- and-Coming Schools” and No. 5 among all comprehensive colleges in the Southern United States. Current and prospective students and parents and the University’s family rallied in support of their University, now considered by many an educational model.
 Alumni, friends, and supporters have donated more than $112 million without a formal capital campaign. The HPU family captured President Qubein’s confidence and vision, and support has been widespread. In June 2008, HPU received a standalone credit rating of A–from Standard & Poor’s based on “headcount, solid student demand characteristics, strong financial operations, impressive short-term fund raising, and strong leadership and management. ”

#### President Qubein was a celebrity in the speaking world and in the community of High Point. A nationalized United States citizen from Lebanon, Dr. Qubein came to the country with only $50.00 and spoke very little English yet has written 15 books and consistently been ranked as a top

#### speaker in the world. Everyone admired Nido not only for his success but for continuing to make his adopted city of High Point his permanent home.
 Soon the University began having some of our nation’s stars visit campus for commencement ceremonies, visits, and lectures: Rudy Giuliani, Her Majesty Queen Noor, Bill Cosby, Justice Clarence Thomas, Steve Forbes, Buzz Aldrin, President Bill Clinton, Lee Greenwood, and many others. In many instances, they were, in fact, personal friends of Dr. Qubein, which validated the relationship and purpose of their visits. These nationally known individuals were soon blown away by the renaissance of High Point University under President Qubein’s leadership.

### Wealth Magnet 17: See What Isn’t There

#### When President Qubein started he found an enrollment of 1,492 undergraduate students. Over and over again, he told faculty, friends, supporters, everybody, “We have thrown the box out of the window of the train that has already left the station!” Every decision process was given the freedom to reach for new horizons to recommend only the best alternative. In four academic years, 2,700 (+81%) undergraduate students (2,450
 [+61%] residential students) attend with an average SAT score increase of over 70 points. Freshman enrollment alone has grown from 2005’s 370 students to 1040 in August 2009—an increase of 181%. Current students come from more than 50 countries and 40 states. By 2011, HPU’s enrollment will approach 5,000 students—3,400 undergraduates (2,800 residential) and 1,500 graduate and evening students .
 The University employs a Director of WOW!—developing “WOWs” while eliminating “unWOWs.” The campus concierge is a one-stop service center—wake-up calls, maintenance issues, dinner reservations, dry cleaning, and more. The cafeteria has live music daily, kiosks dispense snacks each morning, an ice cream truck roams the campus, and nightly valet parking is provided. Student birthdays are a big event—a card and a Starbucks giftcard from President Qubein, balloons, a special meal prepared by the campus chef. Even faculty and staff members receive birthday calls from the president. These personal touches undergird HPU’s caring campus community.

#### HPU’s transformation under President Qubein’s guidance is now driven by a $300-million investment in capital improvements: 7 buildings demolished, 27 other structures renovated completely, 18 new ones built, and 2 buildings currently under construction or design. By August 2009, five new residence halls will have added 1,500 beds. In total, over 1-million square feet of building space has been added to the campus. The $62- million University Center (277,000 square feet), opened August 2009, containing student housing, movie theater, study areas, entertainment venues, and multiple dining options (including a steakhouse!). The campus has grown by 60 acres to the current 180 acres [+200%].

### Wealth Magnet 23: Superentrepreneurs Are Unabashed,
 Unashamed, Irrepressible Promoters

#### The University did not turn to some outside/unknown marketing company; it turned to the administrative staff. They personally took charge of telling the HPU story. These leaders understood that the “family” needed a clear understanding of the University before they could convince others. Initially, the marketing reached out to the entire community of High Point’s students, faculty, friends, staff, trustees, etc. who may have been a part of the University for most of their lives but were not able to tell a central story. So, a picture began to be painted that everyone understood of a treasure that most had always taken for granted. Soon, everywhere you looked on campus you saw “HPU” or “High Point University”—High Point University window stickers soon appeared on every employee’s automobile. For the local community, the University has now become known as “High Point’s University.” What emerged was a wide range of individuals who could describe the University in very similar terms no matter who was telling the story, which created an authenticity that had never before existed.
 From the campus, the marketing campaigns moved to the Triad of North Carolina (High Point, Greensboro, and Winston-Salem) and then across the State of North Carolina. One story was told to me by a parent of a prospective student who was visiting the campus for a weekend with hundreds of others competing in a major academic scholarship program. The mother told me that their flight from Maine had been delayed, and they

#### were afraid that they were going to be late arriving at the University. Once they arrived at the Greensboro Airport, the mother started frantically trying to find out how she was going to find her way to High Point University. Then, her daughter tapped her on the shoulder and told her mom to just calm down and relax. The daughter said, “Mom, don’t worry. I think they own the airport!” As she lifted her head going down the escalator to pick up her bags, she found herself totally surrounded by High Point University’s campus. “I thought that I was already on the University’s International Promenade!”

 Dr. Qubein then altered the focus of his professional speaking presentations where business and decision makers came together for him to be their teacher. He continued to speak about serious marketing and business practices that are essential for businesses around the country. However, he demonstrated the positive impact achieved by these principles by the successes realized on the HPU campus. Immediately the attendees were so enthralled that they began sending their sons and daughters from across the country to HPU as students. Soon, the media took note and the University began receiving time on nationally syndicated radio talk shows; the national television networks took notice, too. ABC, CBS, and NBC have

ABC’s Good Morning America Weekend edition featured HPU’s unique approach to customer service with the students and their families. Now, these types of local, regional, and national exposures occur frequently.
 Dr. Qubein and his staff intimately knew the HPU campus, its history, its clients, its opportunities, and their own experiences quickly translated them into a successful market strategy that resonated with others.

 “At High Point University, Every Student Receives an Extraordinary Education, in a Fun Environment,
 with Caring People”

 Slane Student Activity and Fitness Center: 90,000 square feet of space, which is a definitive center of activity for HPU students. Originally built in 1972 and renovated in 2007, some of the amenities include a 450-seat cafeteria, post office, bookstore, study lounges, recreation areas, meeting rooms, basketball courts, aerobics room, lockers, and a food court, which includes a Starbucks.

#### The social environment compliments the total development of the HPU student, yet a strong academic environment remains the core of any outstanding University. As the University’s motto acclaims, HPU centers on an extraordinary academic and social environment. A 14:1 student-to- faculty ratio highlights the University’s focus on providing the optimum educational environment. The faculty has grown by 27% since 2005, adding a total of 58 new members in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 academic years. Along with classroom technology, each academic building houses designated study areas. Since the library (open 24/7) renovation, student usage has increased 25 percent. Likewise, residence halls contain dedicated study areas and business centers .
 “HPU is no ordinary University, and that’s why I love it so much,” said sophomore Chelsea Johnson. “When you’re here, you realize that there is so much more making you go ‘Wow!’” “That’s the point,” says President Qubein. “When you focus on the total student experience, they love it. And, when they love it, they reward us in the classroom. My message to students is very balanced. There’s a time to play and a time to study. There is a time to be in the classroom and be attentive.” At High Point University, much has occurred during the past four academic years. The transformation continues at lightning speed—an unending process.
