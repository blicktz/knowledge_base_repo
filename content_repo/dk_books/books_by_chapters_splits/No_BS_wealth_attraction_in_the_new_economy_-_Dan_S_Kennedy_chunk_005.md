## How To Get a Collection of Wealth

Attraction Tools—Free

#### I am eager for the ideas in this book to work for you, for you to put them to work for you. For that reason, I have assembled an entire “Wealth Attraction Tool Kit,” which includes an “Action Guide” for this book, checklists, forms, Psychological Trigger Cards, a teleseminar, and an e-mail Course. To get your collection, you need to go online to www.NoBSBooks.com, to the section linked to this book. All these resources are free. Beyond that, there is also a free trial membership available that includes my newsletter, audio programs, webinars, and more—details on page 250 of this book. You can accept membership immediately.

#### Ideally, our work on wealth attraction won’t stop with this book.

## Book Roadmap

#### Section 1 has 28 Wealth Magnets—including two that are entirely new to this otherwise revised and updated New Economy edition of this book originally published in 2006 and, I’m pleased to say, popular since then. These Magnets are not in sequential order because there is no sequential order to put them in. They are to be used simultaneously. You might think of them as puzzle pieces laid out on the tabletop, waiting for you to fit them together in a way that works best for you. You can also treat it as a cafeteria line, choosing and working with only the one or two or three that seem most important to you at the moment, but I would emphasize that the great wealth attractors use them all.
 Section 2 provides two bonus chapters written by individuals who are applying many of the Magnets to their respective businesses in extraordinary ways.
 Section 3, Wealth Resources, includes contact information or other references for interesting people mentioned throughout the book, a recommended reading list, and other support information. Here you will also find a FREE OFFER from me, so that you can experience the benefits of ongoing association as a Member of the Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] . You will also find instructions for accessing audio highlights of my live-recorded Wealth Attraction Seminar and my Renegade Millionaire System, which is online, on-demand, and also free of charge.
 I recommend immediately taking advantage of your free Membership— there’s no reason to wait until you’ve completed the book.

“Our brains become magnetized with the dominating thoughts which
we hold in our minds, and, by means with which no man is familiar,
these ‘magnets’ attract to us the forces, the people, the circumstances
of life which harmonize with the nature of our dominating thoughts.”
