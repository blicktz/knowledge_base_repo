8. ASK THE EXPERT EXPERTS COURSE In our program, GURU Academy, we gave a bonus of expert content. I simply interviewed industry experts about blogging, YouTube advertising, Twitter, and more, and included them in the program.
 So, if you “don’t want to come up with another course,” or “I’m not sure that I am the expert,” you don’t have to be. You can interview experts, and people will pay for access to that program.
 You could generate between $1,000 to $10,000 a month doing this.

 9. PROMOTE A PRODUCT, PROGRAM, OR SERVICE ON INSTAGRAM There are a gazillion ways (official count) to do it. If you’ve grown your audience inside of Instagram, you can get paid to post. Simply promote the products, programs, and services you’re using anyway, and you’ll get paid between $50 to $500 per post.

 10. DO A FACEBOOK LIVE ABOUT A PRODUCT, PROGRAM, OR SERVICE You can get paid $50 to $500 per post. Or you could do an affiliate promotion, where you’re promoting a product and share your affiliate link and get paid for resulting sales.

 11. YOUTUBE AD REVENUE If YouTube is your jam, then YouTube will pay you to allow ads inside your video. You can pick and choose the type of videos you want to have, excluding certain videos you don’t, and you’ll get paid between $1,000 to $5,000 per month for that ad revenue.

 12. RUN A BOUTIQUE EVENT


-----

###### Invite five to ten people to an event, either in your house, a retreat center, or rented space like WeWork, or Regis, or a hotel or Airbnb. Teach your content in a small setting.
 It’s a great first way to kick off events, and they can be incredibly profitable. For our events, we charge between $2,500 to $5,000 per person, so we generate anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 per event. Plus, I just love them because I get to work in a small setting with great folks, getting a lot of work done for them.

 13. MASTERMIND PROGRAM This is when a group of people sign up to meet on a regular basis, either virtually or in person, or a combination of both. Our Inner Circle meets in person for two days, three times a year, and then we have a monthly online class on the other months. You can generate $10,000 to $100,000 per month with your Mastermind program.

 14. LARGER-SCALE SUMMIT EVENTS This is when you’re charging per person, usually in a hotel venue or somewhere you can have a lot of people come.
 I do not suggest this as your first event. Although it is an expensive strategy, it can be incredibly profitable. But start with a boutique event until you’re ready to grow … unless you already have a huge list.
 At a summit you can, again, generate between $10,000 and $50,000 per event. Of course, there are people who generate millions of dollars of sales at their events—but that’s usually not the first time out.

 15. VIP COACHING DAYS This is how I started my coaching business. Many of those who hired us for VIP Coaching Days ended up joining our Mastermind program. With a VIP Coaching Day, you promise a specific outcome for the day.
 For example, you might work on a marketing campaign, give strategy help, coach a fitness session—whatever it is, you’re spending a day with them doing this.
 VIP days will bring you between $2,500 to $18,000 per day. So, they actually could be a lot more profitable than the summit event, right? And they’re a lot less work. I love these days. Of course, you’re only working

###### with one person, so you can’t do this all the time, but usually huge things come out of them. They’re one of my favorite things to do.

 16. ONLINE LIVE WORKSHOP Inner Circle Mastermind Members Sabrina and Tristan Truscott ran one with their “Happy Back” program, teaching what they discovered over the years in helping to heal Tristan’s back pain. They created a course and taught it live, selling the program, which you can also do from your workshops.
 Two hundred and thirty people enrolled right away. Not only are Sabrina and Tristan saving lives, but they have generated $22,000 in revenue, and they haven’t even officially launched yet. Got to love serving others and getting paid to do what you love.

 17. KINDLE BOOK This strategy is so good because you are getting paid to generate leads. They’re built on a platform that people can click on. You can place any link you want in a Kindle book—any offer you want—and they’re all clickable. Plus, you get paid for people to read your books. So, unlike any other kind of advertising, you’re getting paid to generate leads.
 For example, for a self-published book I published in 2016, I am still getting paid, as well as generating leads still to this day.
 You can generate between $10 to $500 per day having a Kindle book and get leads the entire time.

 18. PAID PUBLISHING DEALS If you create Kindle books and generate good sales, you can leverage other publishing deals. I publish under Entrepreneur Press and receive not only advances and royalties on titles, but I also get amazing readers and leads just like you, oh fabulous reader.
 When you’re just starting, your advances won’t be much, but when you grow your list you can get up to $50,000 in advances. That’s another way to monetize your audience. Publishers care about list size more than writing criteria. They want to know you have a list and engagements.

 19. AFFILIATE PROMOTIONS


-----

###### You are simply sharing with your audience the incredible products, programs, and services of others out there with your list, and you will get paid to do it.
 We did a promotion for Andrew Warner on Chatbot, and we earned around $20,000 to promote him. He later flipped and promoted us, and we earned another $20,000 from that. When you have good partners and a list, you can generate sales while introducing your tribe to products, programs, and services you know they’re going to love.
 Our audience thanks us when we bring them affiliate deals, because they know we have checked it ahead of time. You can earn between $2,000 and $50,000 a month.

 20. LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER This is when you share with your list the things you’re doing to be successful. We’ve promoted our “Best Emails of 2018,” and sold our sales letters of 2018 for between $1 and $7, with the highest level upsell for $27.
 We generated over $4,000 by selling $1, $7, and $27 products, delivering something we already created anyway. If you’re doing something your tribe would like to have a copy of, you can charge them to deliver it. And they will thank you with cash.
 You could generate between $3,000 and $30,000 per month doing that. The thing is to grow your list and monetize it in just a few minutes a day. Pick one or two techniques to start, and then keep adding until you hit your monetary goal.

 21. WRITE AN EBOOK FOR DIGITAL DOWNLOAD The thought of writing a book may seem daunting. I get it. Writing a book is no walk in the park. (I do not drink nearly as much coffee when walking in the park as I have while writing my books.) But writing an ebook does not need to be daunting. If you have a collection of blogs, you could simply hook them together, add in an opening and closing chapter, and—voila!—your ebook is complete. Or if you want to start from scratch, there is a simple process to follow that can get your book done in one day.


-----

###### 1. Come up with a book theme. For example, for an accounting firm,
 the book might be called “How to Increase Your Profit Without Increasing Your Sales.” 2. Write ten questions to answer as part of that theme. Questions might
 include: What are the hidden business deductions I am probably missing? What company structure is most profitable? What employee classifications benefit my bottom line the most? 3. List three bullet points answering each question. 4. Record yourself answering each question, using your bullet points as
 your guide. 5. Send your recording to a transcriber. (We use www.InternetTranscribers.com, but there are many out there that will work for you.) 6. Edit the final transcript. 7. Hire a freelancer on Upwork or HireMyMom.com to design the book
 for you. 8.  Lift your hand, reach over your shoulder, and pat yourself on the
 back because you have your product and you are officially a published author. 9. You can either sell the book directly on your site or sell it through
 Amazon’s Kindle publishing program, KDP. If you want to add in a bonus, include an audio version of the book as well.

 22. OFFER GIFT CERTIFICATES If you sell products or services, a gift certificate can be an effective entry point to help pay for your marketing and get customers in the door. This is really a coupon with a higher perceived value. You are giving a time- sensitive reason for the recipient to act now in order to receive something of value. We used to run a campaign for a bath remodeler using this strategy.

 23. PACKAGE THE HOLIDAYS We all know we should wish our social media fans well on the big holidays, but have you ever thought how you could turn those holidays into a promotion? More creative than a 20% MERRYXMAS20 code, you can use the holidays as an opportunity for a unique offering.

###### A lot of the messaging for The Fertility Center is centered around women because they found that the female partner does the majority of the research in family planning. But that doesn’t mean they couldn’t focus a bit on the dad-to-be as well. For a Father’s Day short-term promotion we developed an exclusive package that none of its competitors were even coming close to. The Quick Start Paternity Planner included a mini- consultation, a semen analysis, and weekly fertility-boosting tips (see Figure 14.6). (It was an email that the company was already doing, so it wasn’t any extra work.) For very minimal effort and costs, we got four couples to sign up and buy the package, equaling about $100,000 in potential revenue for a promotion that cost only $150. As an added community-relations bonus, this promotion also connected with couples who were struggling. Instead of being sad or frustrated on Father’s Day, we wanted to give them an outlet to help reach their goal of starting a family.

###### 24. CREATE A BONUS GIFT The founder of DigitalMarketer, Ryan Deiss, has a lot more going on than this online membership organization. Ryan’s holding company, Idea Incubator LP, employs more than 80 people all over the world and owns dozens of companies, both online and offline, ranging from survival blogs to industrial water filter manufacturers. One of the companies he owns is RAW, Really Amazing Women, which describes itself as “A community for women, by women. Our goal is to nurture an environment where we can be the best version of ourselves. Where we can grow, connect, engage, but most of all be free to express ourselves and learn more about embracing our world and loving this life.”


-----

###### In a promotion for RAW, Really Amazing Women, its sales funnel does not start with a promotion about RAW. Instead, it starts with a free gift that pulls the viewer in to a series of micro-commitments. The site www.MakeUpTutorials.com starts the customer relationship by offering one makeup brush for sale. Once the purchasers say yes, they are then taken to another landing page where they are offered the chance to add more brushes and sign up for the makeup tutorial subscription. (See Figure 14.7 and Figure 14.8 on page 276.)
 Not until step three are you asked for credit card information (see Figure 14.9 on page 277).
 When you complete the purchase, you are then invited to get an entire set for free as long as you take the subscription to RAW, which is $19.95 a month (see Figure 14.10 on page 277).
 It is growing subscriptions for an online community of women that focuses on building self-esteem and self-confidence. However, they are leading with makeup brushes, a much easier sell.
 We have used this strategy for other clients as well, from products in front of membership to a book as the starting point in a launch. We are reaching people where they are with what they want and giving them what they actually need later on.

###### Be creative when you are thinking of lead generation and that first sale. It does not need to be directly tied to what you do, but instead aligned with the needs of your target market. Remember, those who buy from you are 70% more likely to buy from you again. Your goal should be to get that first sale in place.

 25. CREATE A DIGITAL COURSE But How Do I Know If I Should Launch a Course? Back in the day, we were not, as you say, “flush with cash.”
 I was trying to grow my public relations firm with no funding. And what I had been doing wasn’t working. I knew I needed to find a way to fund my marketing and operations that would be consistent. Better yet, one that wouldn’t require me to work around the clock.
 I was dreaming of the proverbial “make money while you sleep” concept—and one that could maybe even help attract better paying clients on the back end.
 I had invested in online courses for some time. These programs had helped me improve my operations, increase lead flow, and make my website more effective. I had also purchased programs that helped in other aspects of my life, such as fitness, being a mom, and decorating our home.


-----

###### I knew how much these systems had helped me, and I wanted to be able to help others in the same way. But would people really pay for something I knew?
 I started brainstorming using these questions—the same ones I coach our students through to this day …

 • What topics am I asked for advice on?
 • When someone asks to “pick my brain,” what subject is the meeting
 about?
 • What industry are the people in who are asking?
 • Does this industry have the funds to afford a digital course?
 • Can I promote to this industry?
 • Do I understand this industry?
 • Can my topic help them save time and/or money?

 Going through this list, I realized that I had been answering questions and giving advice on how to generate leads on social media over and over again. I had in fact been giving this advice out for free … so could I really start charging for it?
 I remembered something Dan Kennedy said … “When people pay, they pay attention.” I knew that to be true. If I get a free pass to the gym, I am unlikely to go. But if I pay for a class, I am certainly showing up. The same goes for a free training online vs. a course I purchased … what I invest in, I take much more seriously and utilize.
 So, I started simple, just teaching others how to generate leads using Facebook in a free webinar, and then I offered them a course to learn more.
 I emailed my tiny list and prayed. In total, 97 people registered, 32 showed up for the webcast, and 7 bought. That meant I made $7,000 in sales!
 What?! At that time, making $7,000 would have required me to provide PR Services for 7 different accounts and hours of work.
 But that was just the beginning. I kept selling that same course—FB Profit Power—on auto-pilot for years while I ran my agency. Quickly, it not only paid for all of our marketing, it started producing an extra $5,000 a

###### month in sales. That was enough for us to cover all of our operating expenses for my parttime assistant and our office rent.
 Through that initial course I discovered different topics my audience wanted to cover and was able to create new courses now that I had the formula down. Eventually, these courses brought in more income than the consulting services.
 That’s when I discovered I loved coaching more than anything I had ever done before.
 This eventually led to me selling my agency and having the privilege of growing Powerful Professionals Business Coaching into what it is today.

 It Isn’t Just Me Thankfully, my story isn’t unique. Here are stories from a few of our students:
 Russell Strickland (see Figure 14.11) went through the process of getting his own Doctoral Degree and through that process figured out a quicker way to get it done. He developed a one-on-one coaching program for other Doctoral students and has grown that business over time. But this required his time to make money. Now he’s launched a digital course to sell the process and his first time out, he sold three courses, then five, then seven … and generated over five figures in revenue in the first 90 days. As a bonus, his course has brought him even more one-on-one clients, increasing his company’s revenue in that way as well.
