#### Truth through Numbers
##### First, we need to look at the cost of replacing 125 additional lost patients. To get that, we take the $213.00 that it costs to acquire a new patient and


-----

##### multiply it by the number of lost patients (125). The total cost to replace the lost patients with new patients is $26,625.00.

 125 Lost Patients × $213.00 Replacement Patient Cost = $26,625.00 Cost to
 Replace Additional Lost Patients

 Next, we also have lost production for those 125 patients who left the practice. Using the average annual revenue of a second year patient (as seen in the previous numbers), you see those lost patients each represent at least $1,215.00 in lost revenue to the practice.

 125 Lost Patients × $1,215.00 Lost Revenue Per Patient = $151,875.00 In
 Lost Revenue In Year One

 Next, we have to look at the lost referrals. Dr. Taylor’s practice gets 27 new patients from referrals every month. So, if we do the math, we can figure out those 125 lost patients also equals 16 lost referrals per year. Which is another $14,288.00 per year in lost revenue.

 16 Lost Referrals × $893.00 Lost Average First Year Patient Value =
 $14,288.00 Additional Lost Revenue

 I could easily go on from here. We could add up all the marketing money we’d need to replace all of the patients just to get the practice back to 2,500 active patients each year. We could talk about multiyear values or lifetime values of a patient. We could talk about the referrals we would have gotten from the referrals we didn’t get because we lost the referring patients, per Dan’s Chapter 12 on the Endless Chain. It is a nearly endless calculation. But instead, let’s stop here. Suffice to say the difference between focusing on customer/patient retention and not focusing on retention, for this practice, is $192,788.00 per year.

 $26,625.00 Cost to Replace Patients + $151,875.00 Lost Revenue from Lost Patients + $14,288.00 Additional Lost Revenue from Lost Referrals =


-----

##### $192,788.00 Total Lost Revenue

 That’s $192,788.00 lost if Dr. Taylor were to ignore or fail to invest in and assertively manage patient retention. To add insult to injury, that $192,788.00 lost is nearly all profit. The practice has already paid all of its overhead, rent, electricity, and insurance. The practice wasn’t 100% full on its schedule, so most of the payroll has already been paid for. Also, for a business owner, it really is more than lost money, it is lost peace of mind; it is lost nights of sleep spent worrying; it is lost vacation time with your family.
 Moving a needle by only five points seems small. But $192,000.00 in this instance is not small at all! If you’ll do the same calculations for your business with your facts, I’m certain you’ll make the same discovery: A small move of your needle can have big net financial impact.

#### Tilting Odds In Your Favor
##### Dan Kennedy owns a lot of racehorses, and he likes to wager now and then on the ponies and on sports. You can’t be around him very long without winding up in conversations about “odds.” He says that gambling and direct marketing have two things in common: math or odds, and behavioral psychology. More people are familiar with slot machines than the races or sports betting, so here’s a little trivia he passed on to me about slot machines. Keep it in mind the next time you visit a casino. Payback percentages and payback frequency vary by type of machine. On average, the house’s edge is about 4% on $10 denomination machines, 6% on $5 machines, 8% on $1 machines, 10% on 50-cent and 25-cent machines, 12% on 10-cent and 5-cent machines, and as much as 17% on penny machines, but then, it shifts more, and worse for the player, with “progressive jackpot” type machines, “betting pool” linked machines with giant jackpots (like “Megabucks”) or “branded” machines for which licensing fees have to be paid to celebrities, TV shows, or movies. The take-outs also vary by position of machines within the casino. It’s complicated. In this case, you will, ultimately, over time, lose no matter what you know about this or how you play, period. But you can lose less or lose slower and basically buy


-----

##### more entertainment for your dollars if you tilt the odds less in your dis- favor.
 The good thing about marketing is that you don’t have to settle for tilting odds less in your dis-favor. You can actually tilt them in your favor!
 When you only focus on new patients or customers and virtually ignore the current patients or customers, you are stepping over dollars to pick up dimes. According to research done by Market Metrics, the probability of selling repeatedly to an existing customer is 60% to 70%, while the probability of selling to a new prospect is only 5% to 20%. It is far easier to get someone who already has done business with you previously to come in and use your services or buy additional products from you than it is to always have to look for new business.
 When you take the data from Market Metrics and add in the research done by McKinsey and Company that says an average repeat customer will spend 214% more when compared to a new customer, you can clearly see that an existing customer is far more valuable than a new one.
 A Bain and Company/Harvard Business Review study found that a 5% increase in customer retention can increase profits between 25% and 100% percent. This can be seen in Dr. Taylor’s case study. Bain, by the way, buys, invests in, and resells companies, and has to improve their profitability to achieve its goals. Often, it is stepping into troubled companies and turning them from losers into winners. Other times, it is bringing a lot of capital, expertise, and connections to a company already winning with its numbers. In either case, given its finding that a small 5% needle move in retention can have such big impact, you can safely bet this is a point of focus in every situation it steps into.
 Finally, looking again at Dr. Taylor’s case study, consider this: According to the 2013 Dental Economics Report, the average full-time owner/dentist makes $239,336.00 per year. An extra $192,788.00 in profit would be an 80% increase in pay. That 5% needle move in retention equals an 80% increase in income!

#### CHAPTER 4

## Across the Rubicon

##### by Dan Kennedy

 buyer is not yet a customer. A customer is not yet a committed customer. A committed customer is not yet an evangelical ambassador. But only evangelical ambassadors refer in any significant numbers, with any significant frequency.

# ASomebody can attend your church regularly, yet never really engage

##### with it, with various groups, with other parishioners. Somebody can attend and engage but never or hardly ever invite, let alone successfully invite others to attend. This person can be a satisfied customer or a happy customer or even a committed customer, but never cross the Rubicon to evangelist.
 A member of my mastermind/coaching groups I’ve gotten to know well, Nelson Searcy, is head pastor of The Journey churches as well as the director of Church Leader Insights, a nationwide support organization for pastors of growing congregations. Nelson freely admits that churches have several advantages over ordinary businesses in the securing of referrals— one of which is that evangelism is baked in. It is part and parcel of being a good Christian and a good church member. No comparable intertwined obligation comes with being the customer of your shoe store, restaurant, financial advisory practice, or software company. Still, he teaches pastors


-----

##### not to take this for granted. If they must convert the person to being an evangelical ambassador, we must do so as well. Presumption or sense of entitlement tied to excellence of goods or services has no place and no power.
 The first Rubicon a person gets across is purchasing. He may have hung around as a prospect for some time, reading your online or offline media, seeing your ads, being aware of and interested in you, receiving offers from you. Or he may have seen your sale of the century ad on Friday, and come in and made a purchase on Saturday. Either way, there is absolutely no assurance he will return again and again. All he did was buy something, and all you did is sell something. A transaction happened. A window of opportunity is created that will close quite quickly. Nothing more happened and nothing more should be presumed to have happened.
 It’s worth noting, hardly any businesses do anything about this. If I wander into a store at the mall and buy something, at best I get my email captured (and I personally don’t use email) and get dumped into a generic email marketing and “constant contact” system. Most of the time, even that minimum isn’t tried. But I can count on one hand the times I’ve gotten an actual, personalized thank-you card in the mail with any sort of bounce- back coupon. It occurred with a jewelry store and a rare book dealer last year. Nobody calls, asks if the thing fits or looked good when I got it home or if the dog likes her bed, etc.
 In short, follow-up to ensure satisfaction sucks. That pet goods store owner believes: Let sleeping or not-sleeping dogs lie. I guess they assume I’ll be back if I liked their shop and if the dog likes her bed.
 You want to be assertive and proactive in moving first-time buyer to customer to committed customer. To be a customer, they merely need to return and develop a habituated pattern of patronage. A good example of this was explained to me by a very clever entrepreneur in the dry cleaning business. His grand opening strategy was to aggressively buy habit. The first offer spread through the neighborhood was: Everything you can carry in here in your arms, bag, or box dry cleaned for $1.00. When they came back to pick up that cleaning, they got a ten-day offer to bring in coats, rugs, bedding, or drapes and get a bagful cleaned for just $5.00. These are irresistible offers. By the time the person picks up the second load, she’s been to this cleaner four times in under 20 days. He says her car then heads

##### for that cleaner automatically if clothes are piled into its back seat. This turns a buyer into a customer by habit.
 The best way to have a committed customer is to have them paid forward or on autocharge, especially if there is pain of disconnect with the autocharge.
 In the 1980s, when I was very involved in the “prepay revolution” in chiropractic, I discovered two very important truths. You need to know that then, and now, most chiropractors charged by the visit, and by the treatment modality, as it was consumed. With prepay, the patient was prescribed a treatment plan like “three visits a week for three weeks, then two a week for four weeks, then one a week for five weeks, totaling 22 treatment sessions times $89.00 equals $1,958.00, plus one spinal decompression traction session a week for the 12 weeks times $240.00; $2,880.00; total $4,838.00” then asked to prepay that with a 5% savings or pay it in two monthly installments, right then, bing, bang, bingo.
 Here are the two truths that revealed themselves. First, the pay-as-they- went patients were miserably noncompliant. They skipped prescribed sessions, postponed at the last minute, didn’t do prescribed exercises at home, and more than half never completed their plans. Second, most did not refer at all or were only milked of one or two referrals early, if the office had a very aggressive approach—like a new patient class requiring “bring a buddy.” In contrast, the prepay patients were much more compliant; 80%+ completed their treatment programs on schedule or close to it, 70% referred, and about 25% referred abundantly, and stayed on after their primary treatment programs as lifetime ‘maintenance’ patients. That’s the power of prepay.
 Autocharge has a similar effect. The person getting his credit card charged $125.00 on the first of every month and getting $200.00 of vouchers for products and services is far more likely to use at least the $200.00 (but probably spend more) than the person paying as he patronizes. He is more likely to be exclusive rather than divide his spending in your category by whim and random convenience. Therefore, you are more likely to succeed at retention and a habituated pattern of patronage.
 Sometimes, one of these is helpful while one is harmful. For example, in the GKIC business, the bundled services of membership, subscriptions to newsletters, and other deliverables are autocharged monthly, usually after a


-----

##### free trial period. You can find the current offer at www.GKIC.com. This is contrary to the newsletter industry norm of one-, two-, and three-year pre- paid subscriptions. For GKIC, it works better than term subscriptions and renewals. Significantly, there is “Push,” not passive consumption of the goods and services involved. By that I mean, they arrive. GKIC sends Members two packages of newsletters, CDs, and other material each month that arrive at homes or offices, plus email series, calls from Concierges, as well as invitations to online and live events. Many businesses that ask the subscriber/customer to go fetch everything they’re being charged for, as digital downloads, content at membership sites, and benefits at physical locations, suffer a much higher loss rate when trying autocharge. Often, businesses built on passive consumption find prepay outperforms continuity.
 One way or another, or in multiple ways, the point is to get the customer committed.
 Consider visiting Disney World. We went about once a year and sometimes skipped a year and never went more than twice a year until we bought a time-share in the Disney Vacation Club. With that, we own a bank of points applied to lodging at our home-base Disney resort or at all the other Disney resorts, including a few not in Orlando by the parks. These points are added to our account but also expire year to year. We prepaid for them for life. It now feels free to go stay there, but costs out of pocket money to go anywhere else. We now go, on average, three times a year, sometimes four times a year. We are also more habituated: We have favorite restaurants there, favorite shops there, and we know the lay of the land. Every time we go, of course, we spend like maniacs at those restaurants, in those shops. They smartly seed that spending with discounts and promotions exclusive to Disney Vacation Club owners. To not go and let prepaid points expire is unimaginable! We are thoroughly committed customers.
 For guests who aren’t (yet) DVC owners, Disney is very aggressive in pushing the booking of the next vacation while enjoying the current one, with in-room, in-hotel, and in-literature marketing. They are also aggressive at converting resort guests and park visitors staying elsewhere to DVC. They are also pretty pushy about ascension. One-day to multiday park tickets. From park pass to express line pass. Up to use of private VIP
