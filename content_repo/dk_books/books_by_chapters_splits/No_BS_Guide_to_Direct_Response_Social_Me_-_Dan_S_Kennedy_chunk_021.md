MYTH #2: LEADS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA ARE NEVER QUALIFIED I’ve spoken to a lot of people who say something like: “This won’t work because the lead quality is no good …” This is very common when people think of social media, because again, they think of things like pictures of people’s kids, travel photos, food photos, and self-help quotes. And yet, as a lead generation company, we wouldn’t have been able to deliver any type of direct, measurable ROI if the leads we delivered weren’t good. It’s all in your strategy and approach.
 A common phrase I hear from business owners at events, masterminds, and online is, “This won’t work for me because I’m not selling a product. I sell a high-ticket service, and my audience doesn’t buy just because they saw an ad online or a message in their inbox.” While it’s true that many use Facebook to sell ecommerce products—physical or low-priced digital products—again, it’s a myth that you can’t sell high-end services on Facebook. We’ve proved that it works on both Facebook and LinkedIn … but that’s because the system we use is different than the spray-and-pray approach or direct-to-offer ads that most people try.

 MYTH #3: LEAD GENERATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS TOO EXPENSIVE The third myth we hear all the time is: “Why do I hear about people who aren’t getting great results on Facebook and LinkedIn?”
 It’s easy to find the people who complain about using social media for business appointments. Here’s my advice: Disregard what they’re saying. While they’re complaining about social media because they haven’t gotten results, we’re getting leads and booking appointments. I think we’re doing something right.
 Don’t feel bad though if you’ve been thinking this; you’re not alone. Let’s take Facebook as an example. According to the Content Marketing Institute, a global content marketing education and training organization,


-----

###### only 38% of B2B marketers surveyed say Facebook is effective for B2B marketing. But why?
 The answer to that is simple—too often the Facebook services that people buy from a typical “Facebook ads” agency are not actually designed to get results for businesses with high-ticket offers. Or at least not the types of results that matter to you and your bottom line. Remember, comments and likes don’t pay the bills. Most are trying strategies that were doomed from the start.
 Another reason is that people complicate the entire process, believing they need complex funnels and long online pipelines before asking for an appointment. This only results in confusion for you and, ultimately, your prospects.
 Through the work we do with our clients, we’ve proved that it’s not only possible to toss these myths to the side, but to overcome them using the same strategies I used to get appointments and grow my business, and the same strategies we now use for our clients.

 The Process for Generating a Flood of New Leads It all starts with knowing your prospect inside and out and getting their attention at the top of the funnel. Utilizing LinkedIn, Facebook, or any other platform you’ve identified and confirmed as places your target market can be found, you can quickly identify thousands of prospects that fit your prospect profile, then update your social profiles and your messaging to attract them. I’ll tell you how you can do exactly that in just a minute.
 From there, the key is to systematically reach out to these highly targeted prospects in a nonsalesy manner to first get them to agree to be in your network and then to agree to start a conversation through your nurture messaging.
 When you reach out to prospects and leverage common contacts, many of these business leaders will be open to connecting with you. (Yes, there is an art and science to doing this the right way, and we’ll talk about that further below.)
 Next may be the most important factor to remember: Once you’re connected to a new prospect, do not start pitching. That’s the best way to spoil the relationship. Instead, you want to design and execute a campaign that stays in front of them on a regular basis.


-----

###### This will position you and your business as a trusted advisor and as a resource to your prime prospects. Remember, your goal with this campaign is to stay in front of them and should include three primary components:

 1. TOP OF MIND CAMPAIGN VIA STATUS UPDATES By keeping your name and message in front of prospects, you’ll be the one they think of when they are in the market for your services. With the decline of traditional interruption marketing tactics, social media status updates have become one of the most powerful mechanisms for achieving a top of mind drip campaign. While this works on several social media platforms, it is especially true on LinkedIn, where it’s not as saturated as Facebook’s organic reach.

 2. PERSONAL MESSAGING CAMPAIGN (POSITION YOURSELF AS A TRUSTED
 RESOURCE) This step is why your competitors have no clue that these strategies even exist; it works behind the scenes. Believe it or not, you can connect with thousands of new prospects over time. This keeps you top of mind. But the real action is the systematic messaging campaign you can use to keep in touch and make sure they know who to turn to when they need your services. It works because it positions you and your business as a trusted resource.
 What happens is, over a short time frame, you’ll send a number of personal one-on-one messages to your most important prospects. For a while, these messages will contain nothing but valuable content. Case studies, articles, conversation. Your prospects will appreciate it and love the content.

 3. ZERO MOMENT OF TRUTH (STRATEGY FOR GOING FOR THE PHONE CALL) Once you get them to the point where they “know, like, and trust” you, that’s when you want to go for the phone call. It’s the transition point—and it’s here that a lot of people have problems. However, if you’ve sent your outreach messages and proved enough value, it’s likely that you’ll get a very high response rate. In fact, at this point, your prospects can hardly say no. On average our clients see 21 to 30% of total prospects agree to a phone call as a result.


-----

###### Be aware that at this stage, some of these prospects may be in the market for your services today. Those are certainly ideal situations. Others might not be ready right away, but now you’re miles ahead of the competition. You’ve built rapport. When the time comes, you’re in. Now you can work them through your typical funnel with email follow-ups, invitations to grab a coffee or a round of golf, whatever your typical sales process consists of. Don’t forget that on top of that, you’ll continue to run your top of mind campaign.
 What it boils down to is this: Some will become clients quickly. Others will require more time. Either way, both scenarios are covered and have positioned you as the leader in the clubhouse to win their business.

 When You’re Ready to Scale: Paid Strategies for Getting Appointments
 from Facebook and LinkedIn My company is known best for its ability to deliver outbound organic leads. This is perfect for businesses that need to get in front of very targeted, hard- to-reach prospects and that sell highend contracts or offers. These types of businesses use our organic outreach strategies to dramatically grow their businesses, even with just a few clients every single month.
 However, if you’re in a position where you’re ready to scale your efforts and you want to get in touch with hundreds or thousands of leads every month, we have refined an approach to paid ads that makes it possible to book a large volume of quality appointments each month.
 The truth is every business has growing pains. Amazon, Apple, and Facebook didn’t get to where they are today without facing adversity. Or without having to break through plateaus.
 But they aren’t the only ones. Companies of all sizes hit points where their growth is threatened.


-----

###### The companies we work closely with that accelerate past these points of stagnation have a documented process they follow to move past their obstacles.
 Here is what you need to do to break through if sales have begun to plateau.
 You need a process that generates a large volume of more at-bats, that does not rely solely on referrals, word of mouth, events, etc. Something that delivers appointments to your sales team day in and day out.
 What we have found that generates the most bang for your buck is not creating complex funnels and client journeys but to simplify as much as possible so you do not lose your prospects along the way.
 This doesn’t just apply to B2B businesses that sell high-ticket or enterprise services. These strategies have worked with every type of business from martial arts studios, gyms, health centers, insurance companies, bathtub refinishing companies, and many more!

 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PAID ADS ON FACEBOOK VS. LINKEDIN Finally, before I share with you the paid strategies we use, I want to address a very common question we get about using paid ads on Facebook and LinkedIn:
 Which is better for my business? At LinkedSelling, we use both Facebook and LinkedIn ads because we know how to find our audience on both platforms, and we know how to cater our messaging to each platform for best results.
 However, there are a few key differences you should be aware of. The main one you should know is that Facebook generally delivers a lower cost per lead. This attracts a lot of business owners and marketers because they obviously are chasing the biggest ROI and reducing the cost per lead plays a big part. However, the benefit of LinkedIn ads is that even though the cost per lead is generally more expensive, for most of the businesses we work with, the quality of leads is significantly greater.
 This means that on Facebook you might pay less per lead, but you will typically need more leads in order to find your ideal prospect. On LinkedIn, it’s easier to book appointments with the exact type of prospect that you’re looking for, and in general, more of your leads will be a better match for your business.


-----

###### The Three Types of Funnels We Use Now that you know the main differences, here are the three types of funnels we use to book appointments with cold traffic:

 1. The DTA Funnel
 This stands for the Direct-to-Appointment Funnel Campaign and only includes three steps. It’s easy to get excited about complex “funnel hacker” style funnels, but for most businesses that stuff is overkill. Leveraging LinkedIn’s insane targeting capabilities can get you right to the point so you can ask qualified prospects to raise their hand to let you know they are interested.
 There’s nuance here. If done correctly, this is the quickest way to get hot leads … but done poorly, it can completely turn off your prospect before they even consider taking action.
 Focus on just three simple steps:

 • LinkedIn Ad that directly calls out your prospect—be relevant.
 • Pre-populated native LinkedIn Lead form—be convenient.
 • Appointment bookings and follow-up—be proactive.

 Simple by design, this avoids wasted time, and it just flat-out works. LinkedIn is a different animal than Facebook. Your prospects are on there every day with business on their mind. We book hundreds of sales appointments from this, month after month, with fairly minimal edits needed.
 A few things to consider:
 • Video is better than a still photo. We found that using video for
 the sponsored post, whether that’s a talking head video or an explainer video, far outperforms still photos because, let’s be honest, a direct-to-appointment ad is a very, very big ask. This funnel may be simple, but standard marketing principles still apply; you have to dig into your prospect’s pain to get them to take action. Video provides a better opportunity to do this.
 • Ad copy and positioning. The copy is really framed like this: Do
 you fit this profile? Do you have this problem? If so, click here to figure out how to solve that problem.
 That’s it.


-----

###### Always call out exactly who you’re targeting, as we’ve found that gets much better results and makes it feel like the ad was written directly for them.
 •  Pre-populated Lead Forms on LinkedIn. The benefit is that it
 makes it that much easier for your prospect to book a call with you. They don’t need to fill out anything when you use a pre- populated lead form that automatically pulls their information from LinkedIn—including phone number, email, and more. You can even ask a custom question. Doing this, they only need to click two buttons. They don’t have to spend a bunch of time answering tons of questions and typing. Instead they just click two buttons and they’re in.
 As you can see, the DTA requires no external landing pages and no 27-part funnels. That’s just not needed. Remember, if someone gets to this stage and wants to opt in, it means there’s a very high probability that they fit that profile and are a solid lead.

 2. The RTA Funnel
 The RTA Funnel is the Report-to-Appointment Funnel. Again, keep things simple with only two real steps: Download Report AND Book an Appointment. By “report,” I mean any lead magnet. We’ve found that the “report” terminology appeals to a higher-level prospect, as they are looking for a winning playbook but are not necessarily planning on doing it themselves.
 Here are the steps:

 • LinkedIn Ad that calls your prospect out directly—be relevant
 • Pre-Populated LinkedIn Lead or Facebook Lead Form—be
 convenient
 • Appointment bookings and follow-up—be proactive
 • On the thank-you page, offer them the opportunity to book an
 appointment

 Here are a few tips:


-----

###### • Quickly provide an opportunity to book a call: There’s no reason
 why we should delay what we want. We want to get to that phone call. There is no reason to wait before you offer this. You have to capitalize on the momentum gained from them opting in for your content. This moment is the only opportunity when you are guaranteed to have that prospect’s attention again, so don’t waste it.
 •  Make sure the report solves a very specific problem for your
 targeted prospect: They’ll click on your ad if they are moved to find the answer to an urgent problem. Everyone and every business has pain, and your report needs to acknowledge that pain while showing them what the solution looks like. Stay focused on your prospect. No one wants a report about how great your product or service is. So, make the report about their pain and not about how great you are.
 •  Offer to book an appointment on the Thank-You page. Again,
 this is worth repeating. There is no reason to wait before you offer to book an appointment. Keep it simple, and give them every opportunity to get on your calendar.

 3. The WTA Funnel
 The WTA funnel, or Webinar-to-Appointment Funnel, is a strategy that we frequently use internally at LinkedSelling. Webinars are nothing new. If you are reading this book, chances are that you’ve attended at least one. Traditionally, webinars are used to sell low-cost products and online courses, but they are one of the best tools for establishing yourself as a thought leader, educating your prospects on how you can help, and then scheduling sales appointments or strategy sessions directly from the webinar.
 Here’s how the WTA Funnel works:

 • Your prospect sees an ad for a webinar on LinkedIn or Facebook
 (in our case, it’s most often both).
 • They click the ad and are taken to the webinar registration page
 that clearly states what you solve and who you solve it for.
 • On average you can expect 35 to 45% to attend the webinar.


-----

###### • At the height of the webinar, after you’ve provided value and
 they are the most engaged, offer strategy sessions or consultations to walk them through what your solution looks like for their business.
 • Frequent follow-up to all registrants, who did not schedule time
 to speak, through email, text messaging, and calling.

 The goal of this presentation is to really attack your prospect’s pain points while showing them what the path to success looks like. Give them just enough to understand what needs to happen for things to get better. And then offer the call to talk about customizing that plan and how you can help them get to that place even quicker.
 This is an amazing way to turn a complete stranger into a raving fan … into an interested prospect … into a paying client in under an hour.

 These are the three types of funnels we use on both LinkedIn and Facebook, adapting each to the audience and platform as necessary. They simplify most people’s marketing campaigns dramatically and focus on the absolute most important part of lead generation—getting leads to book appointments.
