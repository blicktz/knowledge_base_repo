###### things I’m reading for is opportunity. I was reading two books, one on Spielberg and one on Lucas. Both made a lot of money with movies—and we’re working on a Chicken Soup movie. E.T. made $800 million for Spielberg. A “feel good” movie, by the way. But his licensing made $1.5 billion. I ran into Jack’s office and said, “We have to stop thinking like publishers. We’ve got to get into licensing.” Jack said, “What do you know about licensing?” Well, I didn’t know anything about publishing or creating bestsellers when we started. I was confident there was a system for this somewhere. We could create a plan. Licensing was a $135 billion business in America. It may have begun with Walt Disney. And what’s so fantastic about licensing a brand is that not only do you make money from the licensing, but all the licensed products and promotions keep building the brand and making it more valuable so you can do more licensing for more money. That is Disney. So, that day, we got into the brand-licensing business.
 We found the big trade show of the licensing industry. The association. We found the top licensing agent and got her on board. We did a lot of licenses in a hurry, pretty indiscriminately. Even some little licensing deals made money. Jack and I wrote Chicken Soup for the Soul Conversation Starter Cards, with a question on each card, deep, soul-searching questions. We sold the rights to that for $650,000.00. We got better and better at this. After we did the book Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover’s Soul, with Jay Leno, and Dr. Marty Becker, one of the world’s top veterinarians, we almost did a licensing deal with Purina, but they were actually having trouble with dogs not liking their new products. I wound up making a deal with Diamond Pet Foods, and we’ve got Chicken Soup for the Soul branded healthy, organic, outstanding dog food. We just started, in 2,700 supermarkets. When we sold the entire Chicken Soup brand, and I re- committed and stayed involved, the new owners came in with an even bigger brand expansion vision, and contacts and capabilities. We had a relationship with Campbell’s before, and did promotions, like putting three Chicken Soup for the Soul stories inside their labels, and that sold a lot of books. With Nora Roberts’ Chicken Soup for the Romantic Soul, we did it with Diet Coke® for six months. But I always thought we should really be in business with Campbell’s Soup, and the new folks running the brand licensing got that done. Now we’ve got Chicken Soup for the Soul soups

###### and sauces and condiments. The man helming this is Bill Rouhana. He’s not very public. He likes being a behind-the-scenes dealmaker. His background as an entrepreneur and investor is incredible. He’s convinced that in two or three years the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand will be even better known, bigger, and more valuable with foods than it has been with books.
 I can believe that’s right. We’re also working on a movie, with the company created by the founder of Federal Express, Fred Smith. They did Blindside with Sandra Bullock. The producer involved was responsible for Fried Green Tomatoes, and it made $360 million. I’m seeing us as having the feel-good, holiday movie of 2014.

##### How to Think Bigger than the Other Guy

###### DAN: People reading this may be gasping for breath, and might disqualify themselves. Somebody reading this has a local shop, a great local restaurant, he’s a dentist in Spokane, he’s a stockbroker in New York. Whatever. He says, “Really, me?”

 MVH: You and I have known each other and been friends for about 40 years. We’ve both run through our share of skeptics and critics. I’ve been accused of a lot of things, but one that I’m never accused of is small thinking. You’ve got to have a big dream, a magnificent obsession that absorbs you. Jack and I said that we want to change the whole world, one story at a time. We figured out what was needed for that: stories that created goose bumps, God bumps, make you weak in the knees, made you cry, feel joy, feel hope. We owned that idea, and it owned us. Anybody can do this— find or create something they can get excited about and committed to and believe in, and that can build their business and build a brand or provide the business and brand-building opportunity.
 Then you’ve got to build a team. At first it was just Jack and me. When everybody else is telling you to forget it, you need somebody other than yourself saying we’re going to do this. I was even under attack by my own spouse; she was saying, “You spend more time with Jack than you do with me.” We worked at getting others to join the team, to contribute, to open doors for us. You can’t motivate big people with small ideas. To build a


-----

###### great team you need great ideas. I happen to believe there’s a very big opportunity inside every little business and every person, waiting to be let out. There was a Nightingale-Conant audio program that I created with a title “How to Think Bigger than You Ever Thought You Could Think.”
 You also have to think differently. One of my daughters recently graduated cum laude, and at the graduation, the speaker was talking about all the change that’s happened during the five years those kids went through school. Five years back, 98% of communication was talk, on the phone— now it’s text on the phone. Blockbuster was big. Now they’re gone, and Netflix is big. He went through a whole list, and what they all had in common was disruptive innovation and disruptive marketing. That’s what we did, a lot, with Chicken Soup for the Soul. We created an innovation in creating and assembling content and involving co-authors and partners so that we could put out a huge number of book titles at high speed and dominate a market. We built a brand, and we have done a lot of licensing with it by bringing innovative ideas to different kinds of companies—not here’s a brand, pay us, but here’s a great idea for you to use our brand, for us to do something unique together.
 Bill Rouhana, who bought our company, said he was buying it because there is so much noise and there’s going to be so much more noise in the future that the only thing people are going to be able to do to make decisions is to trust a brand—and everybody knows our brand. I do a whole talk on this I call “Brand to Command.” It’s really about identity, visibility, familiarity, and conformity. They all bought Mustangs together because when Iacocca was at Ford, he made that the brand, he convinced everybody it was the cool car. Then they all bought vans together, because they all had little kids together. What will they all buy or do together next? Will they all buy Teslas together? They are always all doing something together. Great brands have the power to command. Bill thinks, we think, we’ve got that kind of a brand. We’ve done it with the books—we made buying different, specific Chicken Soup for the Soul books as gifts for mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, the grieving, the romantic, the pet owner, the you-name-it, the thing they all did together. An entire generation has done this together. Now we’ll see just how much farther we can take our brand.

##### The “Secret” of Chicken Soup for the Soul’s Appeal

###### DAN: We can’t exit this without getting to the crux of your brand’s appeal. Why do you think it caught on and became as big as it has and has the longevity it has had?

 MVH: Everybody was already familiar with what chicken soup means. It means you’re safe and cared for and getting something good, that’s good for you, that heals. And everybody wants to be reached and touched and healed at the soul-ular level. The stories Jack and I chose for all the books are all high impact, very authentic, and insightful. I’ve actually had 20,000 stories memorized, stories for any and every occasion. Storytelling, as you know, is incredibly powerful. We created something that people responded to, but nobody should ever think it caught on and took off on its own or by some single stroke of luck or one big media break or anything like that.

 DAN: Mark, thank you, thank you, and thank you for a great interview.

#### AFTERWORD


## Lost in Space

###### by Dan S. Kennedy


###### grew up watching the black-and-white TV show Lost in Space. As I recall, it was the old Swiss Family Robinson relocated into a space capsule that had somehow lost the ability to get back to earth, and just

# I

###### drifted from planet to planet, place to place, misadventure to misadventure. No one on earth even knew they were out there. Despite the fact that they very definitely existed, they were as a practical matter invisible.
 Today’s entrepreneur is very easily lost in space; so is today’s consumer. There are, as of this writing, 55,000 YouTube channels. The number of individual videos on YouTube is a fast-multiplying multiple of that. Consider that as a representative of the epic media problem facing every entrepreneur. Look at the number of titles of books in any category at Amazon, the number of answers to a term searched at Google, the number of emails in an in-box, the number of competing car commercials in just the


-----

###### same hour of prime-time TV or a TV newscast, the number of competing ads in a magazine, and the number of magazines at a Barnes and Noble newsstand. If you mail to known responders to direct mail, which you want to do, and you could see the quantity of catalogs, magalogs, and solo direct- mail pieces in a week of their mail, you’d fear for forests.
 There are so many choices in virtually every category of commerce it’s dizzying. I’m only 58 years old; I’m not yet, exactly, an aged dinosaur. But when I became an adult, you still got local telephone service from the phone company and you got long-distance services from AT&T. Today, many competitors with many price plans are selling in their own stores but also at Best Buy, Walmart, and, of course, online. The dairy section at the supermarket is the fastest expanding area, with a myriad of choices for milk and milk alternatives made from soy and almonds and Martian grass, yogurts, and yogurt alternatives, infused with healthy probiotics—but there are different strains and kinds of those, no sugar added, sugar free, low fat, low calorie, organic.
 Few consumers can actually start from scratch with most purchasing decisions. Who has time to carefully investigate every phone plan? To go to the grocery store with a blank mind and compare every label for every type of food you want?
 There are solutions for the marketer, and this book has presented many, and the many organized into one approach. I hope you will go back through the book a second, even third time, and discuss it with your advisors or team. Brand is a solution. Brand is what consumers use as a shortcut, so they are not, themselves, lost in space. Facing the wide array of yogurts spread over many shelves, many consumers ignore everything but one brand they know, like Dannon. That, pardon the expression, freezes every other producer’s yogurt out. Of course, if their eye is caught by another brand or co-brand, like Weight Watchers yogurt or Starbucks yogurt or Arthritis Foundation-approved yogurt, a competitive battle ensues. Other consumers may take their shortcut by price, first by being at Walmart instead of Whole Foods, but then by the generic brand. But that’s why it’s important for a specialized yogurt alternative producer, Lifeway, an up-and-coming health food maker I’m watching and have invested in stock in (as of this writing—not that I’m giving investment advice) to have its products at the uppity Whole Foods and at the plebian

###### Walmart, which it does. And to invest in advertising that can build its brand and brand preference with consumers, which I hope they do via direct response.
 Which brings us to the second big solution, which is circumvention of search. You can avoid the lost-in-space syndrome if and when you show up alone and show up like no one else. It’s vital to understand that more goods and services are sold to people who were not actively looking for and trying to choose between versions of those goods and services than are sold to people already searching and comparing, and this is trebly true when you climb to higher price points, more specialty products, financial services, and investments, as well as more affluent consumers. This is why targeted direct marketing is so important to learn, understand, and use. To that end, I urge starting on that path with my book No B.S. Guide to DIRECT Marketing for NON-Direct Marketing Businesses (2nd Edition).
 I do not want you to underestimate the importance and power of circumventing search. You need strategies to be with your potential customer before he goes to Google or Yelp or the Yellow Pages or Amazon or anywhere else looking for a solution to a problem you solve or desire you meet. That does not necessarily mean you don’t utilize search-driven marketing, with online search engines, and social media, as well as good, old, still-very-effective (in many categories) search media like the Yellow Pages and association, industry, or consumer directories. But if you depend on search activity to feed you, there will always be others stealing the meal right off the table. You will go to sleep every night not knowing if Google will alter its algorithms while you sleep, essentially dropping a nuclear bomb on the road your new customers travel to you on. You will basically be forever in a bidding war for customers. You can easily get lost in that space.
 You can never truly control your own destiny. Brand provides a great advantage in search environments, but there is far greater advantage in a marketing system that circumvents search altogether. I have written a very detailed report on this subject titled: Grow Rich & Stay Rich with Peace of Mind: CIRCUMVENT SEARCH.
