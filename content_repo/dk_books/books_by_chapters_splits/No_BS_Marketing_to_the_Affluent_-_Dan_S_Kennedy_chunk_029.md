### This is about the designer of those flashy, paisley, and patterned shirts
##### guys wear with the cuffs rolled back to show a different pattern. The shirts are very popular in the Southwest with the rodeo crowd, rich oil men—one of whom has “collected 130 different designs” and spent so much money, the 2014 “collection” includes a design named after that customer, and quite a few GKIC Members. The shirts go for $225.00 to over $500.00*, and are sold direct, in catalogs, at Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, high-end country western shops, and in several Las Vegas stores. There are two company stores—the original in Venice, California, and a second in Houston. Warm weather climates have been identified by the shirt-maker as better than four season or cold because people can wear the colorful shirts year ‘round, so they buy more of them. The brand’s owner, a Ralph Lauren alumnus, Robert Stock, calls customers “connoisseurs.” He says he is in the business of selling “feeling good”—getting favorably noticed, getting compliments, getting bragging rights. There’s a fraternity: One Robert Graham shirt owner instantly recognizes another. Guys talk with each other about these shirts like the women on Sex and the City talk about shoes. Customers who own more than 100 of the shirts (from $25,000.00 to $50,000.00+) are inducted into a special club. Stock is, incidentally, 65 years old, still having fun as an entrepreneur.

##### *This is at a time when JoS. A. Bank advertises a $199.00 suit, and buy one, get two free. And you can buy dress shirts, as Mitt Romney claimed he did, in packs of three at Costco for $99.00. None of this matters. Not to the Robert Graham shirt connoisseur. Unless and until you grasp that what others are doing does NOT need to matter, you are as handicapped as a one-legged man lugging a 1,000-pound boulder up a mountain.

 To dissect, he has a) a unique look and design (that’s bright and stands out and is fun) for a routine item—shirts, b) premium pricing, c) multiple distribution channels and solid place strategy, d) a good understanding that he is NOT in the apparel business, and—maybe most importantly—e) a company and customer culture featuring recognition and supportive of contagion.

### Money Spent at Home

##### When the Seiberlings—he, a tire magnate—built their home, Stan Hywet Hall, an 80-room Tudor mansion in Akron, Ohio, in 1915, at a cost of $3 million (in 1915!), Mrs. Seiberling ordered workmen to cut scuff marks into the hardwood floors so the home wouldn’t look
 “ridiculously new and unlived in.”

# Between 25% and 30% of affluents own multiple homes for personal
##### use, with the majority of these owning two such homes. Ownership of three or more homes for personal use is concentrated among those with the highest net worth and is more common with ultra-affluents.


-----

##### The higher up the wealth ladder you go, the more homes owned. At the ultra-affluent level, with $100 million and higher net worth, an average of ten homes are owned.
 Most of my private clients own two, some three, and several five. One peer in my field owns only one here, but two in Asia, and one in Costa Rica.
 Whatever the number, a myriad of purchases and a lot of spending is required by each one. It should be obvious that securing one of these multi- home owners as a customer or client is potentially much more valuable than the owner of just one home at a time. The interior designer, the art dealer, the insurance agent, and so many others can live off a lot fewer multi-home owners than single-residence owners.
 For those with multiple residences, the average value of the second residence or vacation home is about $900,000.00; the average value of the primary residence is $1.5 million to $1.8 million. About half of the second homes are within a day’s drive of the primary residence and tend to get frequent weekend use. The more distant second residences tend to get seasonal use. What this means to the marketer of products and services for the home is that one-in-four to one-in-three affluent customers have opportunity to buy for more than one residence. This is another reason to think globally rather than locally (see Chapter 21).
 The dual- or multiple-residence owner is an outstanding target customer or client for marketers of a wide variety of goods and services beyond home furnishings, home decorating, home improvements, and home services such as maid service and landscape maintenance. For example, for insurance, financial services professionals, CPAs, and attorneys, these clients have more complicated needs and interests and tend to respond to professionals’ advertising in the national magazines and journals they read more so than local media.
 But, to return to the home itself, as a quick education, you might visit www.cambek.com to see “picture-perfect, hand-crafted architectural accents crafted by skilled artisans for the re-visioning™ of your home.” Or DolceGabbana.com, where you can find Smeg high-tech refrigerators selling for $50,000.00. Should you dare to call them garage doors or refrigerators, they dispatch a tough nanny to wash out your mouth with soap. This is a nice lesson in the fact that no commodity product bought


-----

##### solely as a necessity for its function need remain such a mundane thing when sold to the affluent.
 Kitchens, of course, are big business. A friend of mine recently had hers redone, and commented, “Apparently anything not made out of granite no longer has a place in the kitchen.” You probably know someone—if not yourself—who has recently put from $25,000.00 to $100,000.00 into a complete kitchen makeover. As with all big-ticket purchases made by the mass-affluent and affluent for their homes, whether kitchens, theater rooms, meticulously landscaped and lit backyards with grill areas rivaling the kitchen, and so on, it’s not about utility, but about a variety of emotional issues.


#### And What Might They Buy for Their Homes?

# If your family loves pizza, then you may have considered getting a
##### pizza oven. A double-deck pizza oven from high-end suppliers can set you back as much as $2,500.00

 If you’ve always wanted a tree in your living room—and hey, who hasn’t?—the next best thing is a natural-looking steel art replica tree. Shipped in color-coded sections for easy assembly, so you need not remove your home’s roof to get your tree inside. At www.NatureMaker.com.

 When winter arrives, what backyard is complete without its own outdoor sauna? Prices start at around $5,400.00. One maker is www.RedwoodSaunas.com.

 Artistically crafted hammock stands made with finely finished North Carolina cypress wood can be had for $599.00 to $1,095.00, soft-weave hammocks, tufted hammocks, or quilted hammocks from $299.99 to $699.00, matching pillows, $74.99 each. From www.Frontgate.com.

### Entertainment Spending and the Experience
 Economy

##### “Is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves?”

—FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

# Spending on entertainment is through the roof, into the stratosphere. It
##### has become a 24-7 obsession. The games closet at home, the TV watched only after dinner, the movie theater visited occasionally, the golf course, virtually every diversion and recreation has migrated to the iPad and smartphone, with everybody everywhere, at all times. Coupled with the


-----

##### incredible narcissistic orgy of social media and constant connectivity, itself entertainment, and you find a population consumed.
 If you are an investor, you can’t possibly afford to ignore the entertainment category—and to pick out of other categories the companies not characterized as entertainment enterprises, yet very much into this game. Apple, for example, is categorized as a tech company, but I consider them a 60%+ entertainment company. Disney®, Lionsgate®, Hasbro®, 100% entertainment. (Note: I’m not dispensing investing guidance, only commentary.)
 As a marketer, you have to look for ways to get your own business above the “50% entertainment” watermark. You want to be where the money is flowing like a river. This is more opiate of the masses than addiction of the affluent, but it is pernicious at all strata of society. The affluent consumer is, by and large, engaged with and embracing it all, if slightly more discriminating than most others.
 Here, a couple out-of-the-devices scenarios …

 Money Spent on Experiences I’ll borrow their ad copy:

 Today, you rescued the plane, prevented a carjacking, and shot your way out of a crowded subway station—and you never left our resort. Save the world by day. Relax with your favorite cocktail, vintage cigar, and fine cuisine at a true five-star mountain resort by night. A lifestyle typically reserved for secret agents and action heroes is now available to those who dare … Valhalla Shooting Club at Elk Mountain Resort. Ultra-realistic, theme-based, live-fire shooting scenarios put you in control of your destiny with pistol in hand. And when the shooting stops, our resort offers a full complement of activities and luxuries designed to satisfy you and your companion.

 Aah, shaken, not stirred. As someone who played with a Man from U.N.C.L.E. attaché case in the backyard and grew up on Napoleon Solo, Ilya Kuryakin, James Bond, and the original Avengers, I find the Valhalla adventure appealing. It may or may not be your cup of tea, but some


-----

##### experience—some packaged grand experience or amazing adventure— would be. And there may very well be some such experience you can create within or as an extension of your business with enormous appeal to some number of affluent individuals.
 One of our long time No B.S. Inner Circle Members running jewelry stores in small, Midwest communities takes a dozen or so of his most affluent clients on an annual trip to the South African diamond mines, where they pick out their own diamonds firsthand to be placed in custom- crafted jewelry. They can also add on an African safari or cruise if they desire. He collects a sizeable “experience fee” for putting this trip together and escorting his group. The fees combined are nearly as much as one- fourth of the net profit from one of his stores for the entire year.
 Even the rather pedestrian cruise industry has grown up and gone affluent. Take the Four Seasons cruise ship. You do not just grab a cabin at a website, hop on board, and line up for the bon voyage buffet. Instead, you buy a time-share in it, for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The shares sold fast. Other condo cruise ships with penthouse cabins priced into the millions are at sea, with more under hurried construction. People purchasing these floating condos and time-shares aren’t doing so purely to take cruises. They are buying into an elite gated community that floats, and they’re purchasing a unique experience. One of these ultra-luxury cruise ship residences, The Magellan, is described this way:

 The facilities and services of the world’s finest resorts are part of everyday life aboard The Magellan. On-call housekeeping staff, a world-class spa, 24-hour concierge staff, indoor and outdoor pools, six restaurants, a 450-seat theater with Broadway quality entertainment, a casino worthy of Monte Carlo, and an 8,000- square-foot greenhouse with onsite horticulturists are just a few of the conveniences that make living aboard The Magellan a unique experience.

 Since when are a greenhouse and in-house horticulturist and six restaurants conveniences? Since now, for the ultra-affluent. Note this ad is not talking about taking a cruise. Living aboard.

##### Incidentally, time-shares on dry land or afloat are historically notoriously bad investments. Developers frequently flirt with fraud in overselling capacity, amenities deteriorate after units sell out, bankruptcies occur with regularity—even with this new type of high-end, luxury time- share. Overall, resale values rarely even match original purchase prices let alone yield gains. So, shouldn’t ultra-affluent individuals know better? Only demonstrates that people are people.
 If you are following what most consider the smart money, you’ve seen it moving to companies, entrepreneurs, and projects creating and providing luxury experiences. As an example, two of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates and Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Alsaud, partnered in taking the Four Seasons hotel chain private—with its luxury time-share and condo properties and newest addition, cruise ships. Apparently they see big profit potential in this crown jewel company.
 Turning to the mass-affluent, the company I admire most in the world, Disney®, continues to diversify, developing and offering new experiences for sale to its customers. Its wedding business, thriving and expanding. Its multigenerational family reunion business, thriving. Its experience resorts like the Animal Kingdom Lodge, booked solid at premium prices. The FastPass® for many, but for some the $395 (and up)-per-hour private VIP guide with whom you bump all the lines, go backstage, and take shortcuts. In the time-share category, the Disney® Vacation Club is rapidly expanding to meet demand. When I took one of my client groups to Disney World® on a research excursion, we had a private lunch with two Imagineers, one of whom developed the group sales presentation used on board Disney® cruise ships to sell the club, who was thoroughly familiar with its growth. He predicted it would increase at least five-fold in less than three years, with new means of marketing and new luxury options. Since then, Disney® has opened the first of a number of planned stores in shopping malls exclusively devoted to selling the Vacation Club time-shares. The company has also gone west, turning 2.5 acres adjacent to the Grand Californian Hotel and Spa® at Disneyland® into 50 Vacation Club villas.
 In total, the Vacation Club time-share program is in its 20th year, has more than 500,000 owners, and simply can’t add facilities fast enough to meet demand. Current expansion includes the new villas at Disneyland® in


-----

##### California, new Animal Kingdom Villas and the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa® Villas in Florida, and Aulani Resort and Spa® Villas in Hawaii.
 Disney also opened up its previously “secret” Club 33 at Disneyland, now openly advertising a version of it at Disney World, with an initiation fee of $33,000.00 and annual dues of $15,000.00.
 Time-shares aren’t limited to something you stay and sleep in anymore either. Affluent customers are time-sharing collections of exotic automobiles and portfolios of expensive jewelry, and ultra-affluent clients are time-sharing a “family office,” typically comprised of a CPA and life concierge on staff, supervising and coordinating all aspects of clients’ lives, from paying bills to planning trips to finding someone to remodel the barn. Instead of owning only one or two exotic cars, you can buy into a timeshare and drive dozens. Instead of owning only a few $50,000.00 to $500,000.00 pieces of stunning, one-of-a-kind jewelry, you can draw from a collection of hundreds and never be seen wearing the same piece twice. Instead of using your own Rolodex® to find pool cleaners, find home remodelers, organize trips, buy gifts, and check up on your money managers and investments yourself, you can share a dedicated management team with two or three other families.
 Today, the affluent customer can get just about anything he can imagine —and will buy many things he didn’t imagine on his own—in the experience category. Oh, if you feel like helicoptering into Valhallas as its next tuxedoed, pistol-wielding, martini-drinking, beautiful-woman- impressing secret agent, you may begin your adventure at www.valhallasecurity.com.

 Money Spent Dining Out We love to eat. We love to eat out.
 The shrinkage of the middle-class consumer and the regressed spending of the mass-affluent consumer groups had hit mid-level restaurants hard between the time I wrote the first edition of this book and the year I did the update prior to this one, in 2014.
 From 2004 to 2008, U.S. restaurant sales climbed in virtually every category, at every level, topping $180 billion. In those years, 85% of Americans dined out at a minimum of once a month, over 20% paid
