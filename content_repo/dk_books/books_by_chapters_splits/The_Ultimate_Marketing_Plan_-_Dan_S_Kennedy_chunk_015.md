##### This is not the place to play it catch-as-catch-can. An angry, irate, unsatisfied customer on the loose in the marketplace can and often will cause you considerable damage—especially in today’s Internet age, where anybody can air their displeasure very publicly, to a large audience. At the very least, each one will spread the word to a dozen or more present or potential customers. They will take dollars right out of your bank account. At worst, they may also cause you some grief with the Better Business Bureau, the attorney general’s office, or other bureaucracies. Occasionally, a customer driven over the edge strolls in with a shotgun and does some permanent damage.

 You need to have a sensible, step-by-step process decided on and in place for diplomatically handling and attempting to resolve complaints. One of my adages is: Would you rather be right or rich? Sometimes, who’s right and who’s wrong is entirely irrelevant. It is potential cost that matters.

 Customer Retention as a Profit Center—Lost Customers as New Opportunity

 As we’ve already discussed, a common failing of businesses small and large is focusing all their resources on getting more new customers but investing little or nothing in retaining customers. I try to get business owners to view retention as a marketing function and as a profit center. Dumb companies and business owners view everything spent on established customers as an expense rather than an investment, despite the obvious fact that every discouraged, lost customer bears double the cost: the loss of the customer and whatever value he represents going forward plus the expense that must be incurred in replacing him.

 Disposal to Resolve the Dispute

##### But, no matter how determined and effective your efforts are at retention, some customers will wander off. Some can be brought back. Generally, it is less costly to tempt back a lost customer than to create a new one from scratch, so, ironically, your lost customers represent a better marketing opportunity than the pursuit of new ones.

 The sooner you act to rescue the lost, the better. Set up some kind of system to track every customer’s activity, and whenever one goes missing for an inordinate length of time, send that customer a letter and a great offer, coupon, or free gift, or pick up the phone and call to find out why the customer is no longer purchasing from your business.

 Don’t give up too early or easily. While a quick response to customer inactivity is going to yield best results, lost customers can still be reactivated even after months or years lost in the woods. Include them periodically in marketing for your best promotions, hottest new products, and most interesting events.

 The Four Best Ways to Increase Total Customer Value

-----

#### 1. Increase Average Order or Purchase Size

##### Restaurants do this by effectively merchandising desserts and take- home treats and other products. Industrial marketers do it by expanding product line use and upping the customer to bigger sizes. Catalog companies do it with “today’s telephone specials” offered to the caller after her intended order has been taken. At websites, versions of that are the thank-you page with up-sell offer and optional or forced live chat, immediately connecting the website visitor with a human salesperson.

-----

#### 2. Increase Frequency of Repeat Purchase

##### Using rewards, discounts, frequent buyer clubs, volume rebates, and frequent contact, you can capture a larger share of each customer’s expenditures.

-----

#### 3. Offer Existent Customers a Greater Variety of Goods and Services

##### These people are predisposed to buy from you. In my No B.S. Business Success in the New Economy book, I talk at some length about what I call “the mini-conglomerate approach.” Given that the most difficult and expensive business function is getting and keeping the customer, it just makes sense to work hard at doing more business with each customer. So, the carpet cleaning company that also offers air duct cleaning; sells premium quality vacuum cleaners and air purifiers; and maybe even owns or is in a strategic alliance with a pool cleaning business, lawn care business, or pest control business leverages each customer to maximum value.

 The Ultimate Wealth Plan

 Assets = equity, equity = wealth. The quality and value of your assets = amount of your equity = size, scope, and security of your wealth.

 Thus, the quality and value of your customers is a bigger and more significant thing to think about than simply making sales. As you translate all the ideas and information in this book into your own Ultimate Marketing Plan, be sure to strategically engineer it to (a) attract high quality, high value customers, and (b) retain, nurture, and grow the value of your customers.

 Comedienne-entrepreneur Joan Rivers, who I’ve had the privilege of once having as a client, writing for, and more recently having her speak at one of our Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Marketing & Moneymaking SuperConferences, has a line: “It’s no harder to fall in love with a rich man.” Similarly, it is not much more difficult to bring in ideal, high-value customers than it is to bring in any customer with a pulse, but most marketers think “anybody, everybody, and as many as possible” rather than think about the equity they are creating.

 That addresses the importance of selective attraction. Then there is the matter we’ve been discussing here: retention and preservation or improvement of customer value. The combination of those two determines the wealth your business provides to you and your family.

 For more on the subject of wealth, I unhumbly recommend my book, No B.S. Wealth Attraction in the New Economy. In that book, I present twenty-eight Wealth Magnets—the strategies, behaviors, and business practices that magnetically attract opportunity, cooperation from others, clientele, and money. One of these magnets is clarity. And one of the kinds of clarity that is vital is clarity of purpose, which gets to the question: Why are you here, to develop your own Ultimate Marketing Plan for your business? I urge not selling yourself or the tools given you in this book short with such a limited objective as “selling more stuff” or “increasing income.” You can accomplish much more and much more significant goals, but you’re unlikely to achieve goals you aren’t clear about.

## Customer Multiplication

##### Wouldn’t it be nice if science allowed you to just clone your best customers?

 Let’s begin by recognizing that there is no better new customer than a referral from a happy customer. I don’t care what business you’re in, this is true. The referred customer has less skepticism and is less price resistant, more receptive, and more easily sold and satisfied.

 Most businesses take referrals for granted. Whatever number of referrals they get, they gratefully accept, but they have no proactive plan for stimulating the maximum number of referrals.

 How Many Referrals Can You Get?

 Joe Girard, repeatedly recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s greatest salesman, has a “Rule of 52,” based on his discovery that the average number of attendees at both weddings and funerals is fifty-two. In marketing to consumers, his contention is that each customer has the potential of referring fifty-two other customers. Even if we cut his number in half, ask yourself: Is your business averaging twenty-six referrals per customer? Probably not—most average anywhere from less than one to three. There is room for improvement.

 In business-to-business marketing, the numbers are different. I did some admittedly clumsy but I think instructive research: I took executives and business owners in a dozen different industries and had them go through their trade association directories and count the number of people whom they knew (and who knew them) on a first-name basis. The average was thirty-seven—thus each business customer has the ability to refer thirty-seven others to a vendor.

 If you would like more referrals, begin by establishing goals and quotas, and holding yourself, your staff, and your customers accountable for achieving your objectives.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #16:
 Excellence, as Desired by the Customer

##### If there is one “secret” to maximum referrals, it is that satisfied customers do not refer abundantly. Enthused, inspired, awed customers refer in great abundance. If customers get only what they expect and deserve, that’s not enough. This is not in conflict with what I discuss in other books about finding the customer’s GE-SPOT: Good-Enough Spot. Customer enthusiasm comes from being good at what is important to them and about finding ways to WOW! them, that they couldn’t expect or desire but enjoy or appreciate when it occurs.

 Let me tell you about a dentist who multiplied his practice by ten in just one year without even a $1.00 increase in his advertising budget. He caters to children and, after a seminar on creative thinking, he built up a list of 300 things to change in his practice. For example:

 He redesigned his office to provide maximum comfort to the
 “short people” who came there. He lowered the reception staff into a pit behind the counter, so they were at eye level with the patients.

 He hung giant photographs of each dentist and dental assistant
 along with descriptions of each person’s hobbies and interests, so new patients could pick their dentists and D.A.s based on having something in common with them.

 He gave away free bicycles! Every patient got a “home care
 follow-through Report Card” for his or her parents to fill out. If the Report Card came back to the dentist with all As, the youngster got a bicycle. (Imagine as little Johnny rides around the neighborhood on his new bike and people ask him who got it for him, he answers, “My dentist.”)

 He called each new patient at home the evening after treatment,
 just to see how the patient was feeling. He called each parent the day after the child’s treatment.

 Each new patient left the office the first time with an autographed
 8 × 10 glossy of his dentist and dental assistant!

 Guess what? At backyard barbecues, PTA meetings, and office lunches, the number one topic of conversation was little Johnny’s weird dentist! Pardon the pun, but his practice multiplied itself by ten purely through word-of-mouth advertising.

-----

##### Most important to understand: his abundant referrals were not inspired by excellence in dentistry. That was just the ante to be in the game. An expected requirement.

-----

#### A Stands for ASK

##### I am amazed at the wimpiness of most businesspeople, salespeople, and professionals when it comes to the simple act of asking for referrals. I believe there is a Biblical instruction about this.

 Here are the three best ways to ask for referrals:

-----

#### 1. Display and convey your expectations

##### In doctors’ offices, we encourage the use of some kind of display board listing the names of the patients who have referred that month. This list says to everyone who sees it: “Our patients refer—we expect you to refer also.” It works. And it can be copied by an endless variety of retail businesses. Customers who refer should be recognized in your physical space, in your newsletters, at your websites, and in your marketing so that the idea that “referring is what you do around here” is in your customer’s face constantly.

-----

#### 2. Conduct referral promotions

##### Give your customers cards, coupons, or certificates good for gifts or discounts that they can endorse, like a check, and give to their friends and colleagues. Then give away prizes to those who generate the most referrals within a certain period.

-----

#### 3. Conduct referral events

##### An insurance agent I know throws himself a birthday party each year and invites all his clients and all the friends they care to bring to the bash. It’s usually held in a huge tent, with live entertainment, a buffet, drinks, wandering magicians, belly dancers, and all sorts of other goings-on. Hundreds of clients bring hundreds of other people each year —and the birthday boy gets to meet and make friends with hundreds of prospects.

-----

#### R Stands for RECOGNIZE and REWARD

##### A favorite story: A guy rows his little boat out to the middle of the lake for a relaxing day of fishing. Up over the side of the boat comes a huge green snake, with a half-swallowed frog sticking out of its mouth. Feeling for the frog, the guy whacks the snake with the oar; the snake spits out the frog, and the frog’s life is saved—and that makes the guy feel good. But the guy also knows he has just deprived the snake of a meal—and that makes him feel bad. Having no food with him, he gives the snake a swig out of his bottle of bourbon, and the snake swims away happy. Two minutes later the snake swims back with two frogs in its mouth.

 When we recognize and reward a certain behavior, we inspire more of the same. It’s true in parenting, in managing, and in managing customers. When you get a referral from a customer or client, the smartest thing you can do is to make a big, big deal out of it. Call with thanks or send a personal thank-you note or gift.

-----

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #17:
 Enlist a “Champion”

##### Elsewhere in this book I told you about the best car salesman I know, Bill Glazner. He has never yet asked me for a referral, but he is so darned good at what he does that, in the span of a few years, I sent him several dozen customers. And he has thanked me for every one of them.

 In me, he created a “champion”—a person who champions his cause, who tells everybody about him. A handful of cultivated, appreciated champions can make you rich.

##### Creating Short-Term Sales Surges

 Each business hits its own times of need when a sales surge is important. It’s always preferable to sell your way out of a financial problem than to borrow or sell off equity. Often that can be done. There is usually money waiting in customers’ pockets. Here are the best ways I know to create a short-term sales surge.

 Big Discount, Believable Reason Why

 Excess inventory, out-of-date inventory, service time during the off- season … such merchandise can often be sold at big discounts, but it’s important to remember the current high level of skepticism and cynicism of your public. Many outstanding discount offers fail miserably because the intended buyers “smell a rat.”

 When you run a fire sale, they’d better be able to see the charred timbers! When you offer an exceptional savings opportunity, there’d better be a good reason. Here are a few “good reasons”:

 We’re offering this value only to our best customers, as a reward
 for their support.

 We’re extending this offer only to new, first-time customers.

 Frankly, this is our slowest month, and to avoid laying off our
 great employees we’d rather offer you an exceptional value.

 We’ve been given a special incentive from the factory and are
 passing that savings on to you.

-----

##### We’re eager to show you our new (whatever) and thought that
 offering this exceptional value would be a good enticement.

 One of the best “excuses” for a big sale is Bill Glazer’s “Flood” ad. Bill is president of Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ as well as an advertising and marketing consultant and coach these days. In his former life, he operated very successful menswear stores—a laboratory where he perfected many of the strategies in his bestselling book, Outrageous Advertising That’s Outrageously Successful. This ad of his is one of my all-time favorites because of its twist on the classic fire sale and because of its use of the entrepreneurial success principle from Think and Grow Rich author, Napoleon Hill: in every adversity, the seed of opportunity. I’ll reveal two secrets about this ad. One, the severity of the leak was a bit exaggerated. Poetic license. Second, half of the ad cost was subsidized by the insurance agent Bill mentions by name in the ad. But what’s important here is that he recognized and capitalized on a golden opportunity, and used it as believable reason for a big sale.
