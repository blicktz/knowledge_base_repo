      MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #40:
      SELLING BRILLIANTLY WON’T MAKE YOU
     A MILLION IF YOU’RE NOT BUYING SMART!
  There’s no telling how many people have stepped up and
 tried ads in one media or another, lost money, and given up on
 their ideas when, in truth, their ideas, products, and advertise-
 ments were good enough to generate profits and build a business
 if they weren’t grossly overpaying for their advertising!
  One of the top negotiating experts in the country, Chester
 Karrass, uses this line in his ads: ‘‘In life, you don’t get what
 you deserve—you get what you negotiate.’’ Unfortunately, the
 media business is not unlike the car business, with a multiplicity
 of prices, discount schedules, and confusing terminology all con-
 cealing the bottom-line, rock-bottom, minimum “‘real’’ price. As
 a direct-response advertiser, though, you have an enormous ad-
 vantage in negotiating ad costs: Unlike most of a media’s tra-
 ditional advertisers, you actually know how well your ad works
 in each place. You have precise results. You know what your
 cost of advertising per sale is in Media A vs. Media B. And the
 media people know you know. So you can use this data to say:
 ‘‘This is all we can afford to pay for space in your magazine,
 in order to get the same cost per sale we get with these other
 two magazines.”’
    The Basic Decisions You Need to Make
         If Building a Business
    Through Direct-Response Advertising
  There are several basic, foundational decisions to make if
you’re going to sell products and build a business through direct-
response advertising. First, will you use one-step or multistep
advertising? One-step advertising is the simplest method; Joe

    step advertising, an ad is placed that usually offers something
    for free. such as a book, report, brochure, video, or catalog; it’s
    usually called a ‘‘lead generation advertisement.’’ Then the sale
    and profit are made by one or more follow-up mailings, plus,
    possibly, outbound telemarketing. This is the approach used by
    NordicTrack, one of the largest direct-response advertisers today.
    Each approach has its own pros and cons, and you should care-
    fully investigate the appropriateness of each to your particular
    product, media, and market. Generally speaking, you’ll have
    more success with lead generation advertising and multistep
    follow-up than one-step advertising, although one-step is obvi-
    ously simpler and, thus, an easier business system to operate.
     A hybrid approach I’ve had considerable good fortune with
    is what I call ‘‘self-liquidating’’ or “‘zero-cost lead generation.’’
   With this method, a very-low-cost item is offered for sale in the
    initial advertising, which is intended only to screen out the
    lowest-quality leads that are always collected with free offers
    and to cover most or all of the ad costs.
     Let me give you a great example of self-liquidating lead gen-
    eration. One company I own an interest in sells a relatively ex-
    pensive home-study course ($600), but it never advertises that
    product. Instead, all the advertising is for a low-priced introduc-
    tory book ($19), which includes both useful information and
    lengthy sales presentation for the product. The book costs about
   $2 to print .and deliver; the $17 ‘‘profit’’ serves only to offset
    all the advertising costs. The company’s real profit is made on
    the sale of the course. —
     Next, you must decide whether you will be front-end or
    back-end oriented—and that has nothing to do with anatomy! It
    is increasingly difficult to make your money on the front end,
    the first sale to the customer. Most people who do make millions
    in direct marketing do so by building long-term relationships
    with customers who buy a number of products from them over
    time. The profits come from what I call TCV, Total Customer
    Value. If you are going to build a business rather than try getting
    rich from one-shot sales, you have to give thought to how you

 you need to strategize beyond the first product and the first sale.
      A Classic Example of a Business Built
      Through Direct-Response Advertising
   I believe that Gerardo Joffee is one of the smartest mail-order
 entrepreneurs ever to openly and generously share his methods
 in a book, How You Too Can Make at Least One Million Dollars
 in the Mail-Order Business, and I urge everybody to buy it. The
 first business Joffee built was Haverhills, which was a household
 name in the 1970s. Haverhills did most of its marketing through
 its own catalogs of kitchen, household, travel, and electronic
 gadgets and unusual products, handpicked by Joffee, and de-
 scribed in clever, interesting copy. Joffee obtained the bulk of
 his customers using the self-liquidating approach to advertising
 I described above. The main product he used was a multipurpose
 knife he named MACK THE KNIFE, offered for just $1 in mag-
 azines such as The New Yorker. His most frequently used ad was
 a tall, thin, one-column ad, with a full-size picture of the knife
 standing up, and this copy run alongside:
         SUPERSTITIOUS?
   In our most compulsive desire to make
   new friends, we had decided to GIVE AWAY a
  whole truckload of MACK THE KNIFE ...a
  masterpiece of Vulcan’s art. At home, in kitchen,
   glove compartment or on a camping trip
   self-appointed experts have nominated
   versatile MACK ‘Knife Of The Year.’ But alas, our
  generous impulse was thwarted by one
   of our superstitious supernumeraries who
   officiously insisted that giving away a knife is
   very bad luck and in order not to kill an
   incipient friendship (and to ward off the evil eye)

```
      (although he lists for $4.95 in our catalog) AND—
      that isn’t all. For that same $1 we’ll also send you
      our Color-Full Catalog and a $2 Gift Certificate
      (good for your first purchase). If you think this is
      an unusual offer, you’re right. Better take
     advantage of it before our accountant returns from
      vacation and reads us the Riot Act.
      In the large quantities he purchased, Joffee got these knives
    for thirty-five cents each, and all the costs of handling and ful-
    fillment added another twenty-five cents, giving them a forty-
    cent-per-unit contribution to ad cost. At the time, it was routine
    for that contribution to pay back almost all or all of the costs of
    the advertising, providing them with thousands of new customers
    from each ad with zero acquisition cost. This strategy attracted
    enough customers to build Haverhills in just five years from a
    standing start into a company that Joffee sold to Time, Inc., for
    $1 million (see chapter 11). Of course, the days of the one-dollar
    self-liquidator are dead and gone. We are working with costs
    increased over twenty years since Joffee’s successes. But the
    strategy still works in an endless number of applications.
                           a
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #29:
        ACQUIRE CUSTOMERS FOR FREE ANY TIME,
             ANY WAY, EVERY TIME, |
        [ AND EVERY WAY THAT YOU CAN.
      If you are doing your job right, each customer has a certain
    value beyond the initial sale, so you can afford to invest up to
    the profit of the first sale in order to’acquire the customer. I have
    one client who acquires about one-fourth of his customers with
    a $99 sale. His costs are $55 in advertising and direct-mail
    follow-up to make the sale, $35 for the product, $3 for credit
    card processing, and $1 contribution to overhead, for a total of
    $94. He is only keeping a measly $5. But he’d cheerfully give
    even that up if he had to, because he knows that nearly 50 per-

six months. With that as a known fact, his number-one job is
pouring as many new $99 customers into his funnel as he pos-
sibly can, from any and every source he can find, even if he does
so by giving away the entire $99.
    Is Having Your Own Catalog the Ultimate
    Goal of a Direct-Marketing Business?
  Probably. Most companies begin with the entrepreneur some-
how advertising and promoting just one or two products, then,
as the customers accumulate, he expands the product line, offers
them other, related products, and soon decides to assemble all
of his products into a catalog.
  Richard Thalheimer started The Sharper Image selling only
jogger’s wristwatches and stopwatches. Lillian Vernon started
out advertising monogrammed handbags and totebags in maga-
zines. Ted Nicholas started Enterprise Publishing with his book
How to Form Your Own Corporation Without a Lawyer. And I
could continue this list.
  The lure of having and mailing a catalog is the economy of
scale, compared to mailings on behalf of single products and
offers, and the streamlined simplicity of the business. I put out
my own catalog.each year for exactly these reasons. However, I
want to warn you that they are ‘‘lazy’’ reasons. With his per-
mission, I’m going to quote Gary Halbert, who tells about his
experiences with his first catalogs.
   Many years ago, after Dennis Haslinger and I got our
   family coat-of-arms business cranked up, we decided to
   produce a catalog. It seemed like a good idea. It appeared
   to be a natural. You see, our front end product was an
   8% x 11" piece of parchmentlike paper upon which was
   printed a line drawing of the earliest family crest ever re-
   corded with a particular family name. This ‘‘family name

```

```
       who bought this inexpensive little report were fascinated,
       intrigued, and pleased enough to want to see their family
       coat-of-arms in full, authentic, heraldic colors in a variety
       of products, such as wall plaques, china plates and cups,
       drinking glasses, napkins, stationery, and so forth.
        So off I went into the woods of southern Ohio. All by
       myself. To camp out and create a catalog. I worked and
       worked and it really turned out neat. It featured cute pic-
        tures of my three small sons, billed as product testers,
       and approximately seventy items, most of which could be
       customized with your family crest. The catalog measured
      5% x 11" and was printed on glossy stock in full color.
          After it was finished, I had a bunch of them printed
       up and mailed out and I sat back to wait for the results.
       They sucked. We didn’t even break even. I said to my-
        self, I wonder what would happen if I eliminated all the
       loser products and then mailed a smaller catalog or sim-
       ple brochure? I did analysis [and] found that only three
       of those seventy products were carrying all the weight.
       Everything else was dead meat. Those three products, by
        the way, were all wall plaques. So I designed a simple
       color brochure that featured only those plaques.
        What happened? Actually, it wasn’t very exciting. All
       we did, after mailing those brochures to our customer list,
       was break even. But I was moving in the right direction,
       wasn’t I? So then I took the top-selling wall plaque, had
        a color photo taken of it, and I sent a replica of that
       photo along with a personal style sales letter to our
       customers.
        And we dragged in millions of dollars.
        What all this can teach us about what most catalog
       mailers do wrong is [that] they mail too many catalogs
       and not enough simple letters! When I told Ed Mayer
        [the ‘‘dean’’ of direct mail] about my catalog experience,
       he said that if everybody who now mails catalogs would
       instead build an individual direct-mail promotion around

```

```
   alog should stop. Not at all. What I do think, however, is
    that most catalog mailers should look at their catalogs as
   information-gathering devices.
      Let’s say we’ve got a big catalog mailer who is going
    to push out 3 million catalogs next year. In my opinion,
    this mailer should send, instead, only about 300,000 cata-
    logs. Next, he should analyze his response and then cre-
    ate a sales letter and simple brochure describing each of
    the top sellers from the catalog. Then these should be
   mailed as individual direct-mail promotions at about
   three-week intervals.
  Even though I do not do that in my own business out of lazi-
 ness and a willingness to knowingly trade off a certain amount of
 profits for convenience, my own experience tells me that Gary is
 right. And, although the company he left behind uses catalogs, and
 has made these catalogs perform profitably, it also relies on a solo-
 mailings strategy similar to what Gary just described.
  This means that the catalog is neither the panacea nor the ul-
 timate goal. Instead, it should be viewed as one weapon in a mul-
 tiweapon arsenal, to be used for certain purposes at certain times,
 but not relied on entirely if maximum profit is your objective.
   However, If Anybody Says You Can’t Start a
   New Mail-Order/Catalog Business from the
     Kitchen Table and Succeed Anymore,
      Tell "Em That’s ‘‘for the Birds’’
   In 1990, in the midst of the recession, Peter Deutsch and
 Carol Curtis started Creative Bird Accessories, a catalog com-
 pany serving pet bird enthusiasts. She was a school nurse, and
 he owned a furniture business tied up in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
 But their research had revealed that there were 52 million pet
 birds in the United States, 175,000 subscribers to Bird Talk mag-

     to catch bird droppings. In the fall of 1990 they advertised the
    perch for the first time in Bird Talk. The perches sold faster than
    he could make them.
      In 1991 Carol quit her job to work on getting out their first
    catalog: a six-page ‘‘mini’’ mailed to 5,000 names, most of them
    purchasers of the perch. Soon the catalog grew to twenty pages,
    the mailing list to nearly 20,000. In 1994 they hit sales of
    $200,000 a year, still operating out of their home, with very
    restrictive resources. Direct marketing still offers plenty of op-
    portunity for gutsy entrepreneurs to start new businesses from
    scratch and quickly experience substantial success.
      Here Are the Exact Ingredients for a Direct-
       Mail Moneymaking System of Your Own
             Ingredient #1: The Lists
       First, you need a list of prospective customers for your prod-
    uct or offer. In a hierarchy of quality, the very best list is that
    of present and past customers who know you, have purchased
    from you, and have been satisfied, to whom you are now making
     a new offer; next best are people who have taken the initiative
     to demonstrate current interest in what you have to offer by
    responding to your advertising; next best are commercially avail-
     able, rented lists of purchasers of related products; bringing up
     the rear are rented lists of compiled prospects, such as people of
     a certain age, occupation, or financial demographic.
      Even people like me, who make a living writing copy and
    creating direct-marketing materials, will admit that at least half
     the success or failure of a campaign depends on the quality of
     the list—not on our brilliance. I’ll even go further and tell you
     that a poorly written sales letter can get good results if it is
    matched to just the right list. But the greatest sales letter ever
    written could fail if mailed to a very poorly qualified list.

| getting my clients to mail more offers more frequently to their
_ past and present customers.
          Ingredient #2: The Offer
   In direct marketing, the offer usually includes an appealing
 product or products (or service/services), a discount, a premium
 or bonus, a strong guarantee, and an added reason to respond
_ promptly. This is all spelled out as ‘‘you get this . . . and this
 ... and this.’’ To state the obvious: The more attractive the offer
 is, the better.
         Ingredient #3: The Mailing
  Mailings can range from simple postcards and flyers to com-
 plex, costly catalogs. More often than not, I rely on a sales letter
 to present my offer. And beginners to direct-mail selling will do
 well to master the use of the letter before using more complicated
 or expensive materials.
   I’ve written an entire book that reveals and demonstrates my
 twenty-eight-step system for creating an effective sales letter—
 The Ultimate Sales Letter—and I believe that just about anybody
 can follow that system and do well. Without referring to that
 book, though, let me tell you a few of the most important things
 you need to know about sales letters.
  Long letters tremendously outperform brief letters, contrary
 to what most people assume. I often use letters eight to thirty-
 two pages in length. Your letter should be as long as is necessary
 to thoroughly, persuasively tell your story, not written to fit a
 certain predetermined length. The only way a long letter loses is
 if it’s boring. For that reason, your letter should replicate you,
 your personality, your enthusiasm for your product, much the
 way you would personally, conversationally tell a friend about
 it. And there are some simple, reliable formulas taken from
