STRATEGY 3USE LISTENING TO
 INFLUENCE PEOPLE

## Here’s my super-powerful secret selling weapon: I listen.
 Listening isn’t as simple as it sounds. In fact, the absence of good listening skills is rated as one of the top problems in North American business today. On the job accidents, manufacturing errors, medicine dispensing mistakes in hospitals…the list of costs, financial and human, attributed to listening errors is long. Some major corporations invest huge sums of money in listening skills training for their personnel. My biggest complaint with people I work with is their lack of listening effectiveness; I explain something deliberately and precisely, but they get only part of what I’m saying. So, the first problem is that most people lack know-how in listening. For the sales professional, this is double jeopardy: his own listening deficiencies, and those of his customers.
 The second problem is even those who CAN listen often DON’T, for all the following and many other reasons:

 Preoccupied with Other Thoughts
 If you could see what was going on in the other person’s mind, like images on a TV screen, you’d be shocked. Something related to what you are saying might appear every once in a while, but there’d be a rush of other, unrelated images in between.
 When I’m speaking to an audience, I know that a fast-paced parade of images is going through their heads: a kitchen on fire—“Gee, I wonder if I turned off the coffee pot?”; the supermarket—“What should I make for dinner?”; an angry spouse slamming the door—“She’s so unreasonable”; and on and on. They leave me and my presentation, mentally, then come back, leave again, and come back. In fact, psychologists say people

## mentally leave every four to eight minutes for sexual fantasy. The good news is, I know everybody in the audience’ll have a good time regardless of what I do. The bad news is, I’m up there to sell, and need their attention. I know they’re leaving; I must pull them back in. It is a huge face-to-face selling mistake to assume you have the other person’s attention just because he’s looking at you.
 Adult attention deficit disorder has been multiplied by technology. These days, most people are continuously connected to multiple stimuli. Nobody seems able to just take a walk; they require music from headphones and text messaging at the same time. Television news has type scrolling across the bottom of the screen, split-screen images, and more graphics going on around the talking head than you can find in a comic book. It is against this backdrop that we try to get and hold someone’s attention while we sell to them. Their actual ability to pay attention is lessened with each new wave of multistimuli connectivity they plug into. And your actual ability to pay attention has been lessened too. Simply, purely, completely concentrating on what your customer is saying is counter to all the ongoing behavioral conditioning you’re exposed to and all the other experiences you’re involved in. Getting your customer to concentrate on what you are saying requires behavior from him that is contrary to all the on-going conditioning he’s exposed to.
 The sales pro has to master methods for disconnecting all those other thoughts and ignoring all other stimuli and distractions and focusing entirely and exclusively on the prospect or client . . . before he can hope to get that customer to do so in return.

 Tired
 I’m guilty of this myself. After a few days of traveling, speaking, and consulting, a level of fatigue sets in that just about ruins my ability to listen.
 It’s worth noting that being properly rested and alert is an advantage in selling or negotiating. The sales pro who stays up too late night after night, or who schedules important meetings too close together, or employs an excessively exhausting travel schedule starts each selling situation with a handicap. Personally, I find both travel and selling activity require incredible physical energy. Avoiding fatigue-inducing foods, sticking to a

## healthy diet as best I can, seeing my chiropractor and massage therapist regularly, and taking carefully selected nutritional supplements are all lifestyle techniques I believe give me an edge in my selling activities.

 In Too Much of a Hurry
 It is easy and dangerous to be consumed by speed rather than to profit from efficiency. These days, it seems the sales pro never gets a breather; he lets his cell phone, e-mail, text messaging, etc. control him; he tries to run marathons as sprints. The trick is to use speed to your advantage and to prevent it from becoming a disadvantage. If you have a tendency, as I do, to get caught up in the pace of things going on around you, and to build up stress in the process, it’s important to consciously s-l-o-w y-o-u-r-s-e-l-f do- w-n in most selling situations. Listening effectively cannot be done at warp speed. You have to disengage from the race pace and shift into a relaxed selling pace. Another way of saying this is: let the sale come to you.

 Operating in Disadvantageous Conditions and Environments
 With mobile communications technology tools comes the temptation to completely confuse urgent and important, and be stampeded into responding to inquiries by prospects and customers thoughtlessly, even recklessly, on the spur of the moment, and in unhelpful environments— noisy restaurants or airport terminals, moving vehicles in heavy traffic, or while multitasking, such as driving and navigating through heavy traffic, or even standing at a urinal in a public restroom, peeing. (Yes, ladies, idiot men in large numbers are making this commonplace behavior. What you hear in the background while they’re talking to you isn’t a fountain.)
 LISTEN TO ME: environment matters. If you wouldn’t sit down face to face with somebody and attempt selling to them in a given environment because it is chaotic, full of disruptions, or otherwise not conducive to concentrating, listening, and communicating effectively, don’t sell from there by phone either. It’s stupid. Also, communicating about important matters to important people via thoughtlessly and hastily used means; instant response via an e-mail tapped out on your iPhone while eating, standing in a waiting area at the airport, or, God forbid, sitting on the toilet

## is also s-t-u-p-i-d. If you engage in this kind of moronic and unprofessional and sloppy, slap-dash behavior, know that I am hoping and praying for your failure. This is no way to conduct business.

 As a result of all this, nobody’s listening to anybody. And since people generally want most what they have the least of, many are running around in desperate search of someone—anyone —who will make them feel

 My friend Sydney Barrows, author of the excellent book Uncensored Sales Strategies was, in her former life, in distant past, a professional madam, and ultimately an infamous one, dubbed The Mayflower Madam, first by New York media, then nationally. For a time, she operated the priciest upscale escort service in New York, hiring, training, and dispatching elegant young ladies to entertain corporate executives, Wall Street elite, visiting foreign dignitaries, as well as thousands of more run-of- the-mill businessmen and “road warriors” alone at night in the city’s hotel rooms. While it is not all about that, her book does give you an insider’s look at many of that business’ secrets and the sales and marketing lessons to be drawn from it. From that experience, Sydney learned and can assure you they were never in anything as crass or simple as the business of selling sex. And one of the most important things they did sell, in high demand, was an intelligent, fully focused, interested, and appreciative listener. The fact that even highly successful and influential men find reason to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars an hour to be listened to—by therapist in a professional practice or lady of the evening in hotel suite—should tell you something significant.

## This is “as old as the hills” but it has not changed. Neither psychotherapy or prostitution including pricey escort services is leaving our world anytime soon. In fact, the desperate desire to be listened to, and willingness to reward it financially, are both expanding and escalating. Recently, a friend of mine, a businesswoman in her 40s, expressed her frustration to me with this story:

 “I was asked to join another business woman, a friend of the past I’d been out of touch with for a while for lunch. In the first 15 minutes we were together, she took calls, returned a call, and talked on her cell phone incessantly—and sent a text message. I got up to visit the ladies room and told her ‘If you’re still making out with that damned phone when I come back, I see no reason to stay and watch.’ ”
 If this businesswoman who invited my friend to lunch had ulterior motives of laying groundwork for selling her something, which she most certainly did, she ruined it with her rudeness. Of course, you might never be so overtly rude or stupid. But if the phone is locked away, but your mind is visiting it, the effect is the same.
 By training and disciplining myself to listen—really listen—I’ve been able to exert tremendous influence over many other people. I’ve gained their trust, stimulated friendship, gotten them to confide in me, and sold to them with ease. I’ve discovered that you can exchange attention for dollars! I’m now convinced that the person who gets his or her own way most often is the person doing a lot more listening than talking.

# What Are You Listening For?

## In selling, you should be listening with purpose. Not just to build rapport, not to be polite, not to flatter, not to seduce, but more for strategic acquisition of important and useful information. I’ve labeled this “Listening-Based Selling,” and taught it to thousands of salespeople. In doing so, I discovered a crying need for a “tool” to support their Listening- Based Selling.
 If you don’t know what you hope to hear, you might not recognize it when you do hear it. I’ve compiled a checklist of 21 things to listen for, which you can download free at NoBSBooks.com. For now, here are several of the most important:
 1. What keeps him up at night unable to sleep, bile crawling up his esophagus from frustration, anger, and resentment? (Note: Relief of pain sells more than potential gain.)
 2. What does he fear and worry about most? (Note: Fear is the most powerful of all motivational forces.)
 3. What overriding value is most important to him, as demonstrated by his behavior and prioritized actions, not just lip service—is it “family,” “marriage,” “career achievement,” “wealth,” “security,” what? There are 18 others. My 21 may or may not all apply to your particular selling situations so, ultimately, you should construct and memorize your own checklist. Then you’ll listen with purpose. And you’ll be able to quantify and measure your listening effectiveness. After a first conversation with a client, I measure mine by how many of the 21 things I was listening for I heard and remember. Since measurement automatically improves performance, you’ll become a much more effective listener with this discipline.
 To be redundant to be clear, I have just handed you two very specific things to do. Not “ideas.” Things to do, to measurably strengthen the

In writing. 2): After every meeting or conversation, but especially after initial meetings or conversations, grade yourself by how many of the items on your list you acquired information, insight, and understanding about.
 Would you care to guess what percentage of sales professionals reading this book will actually put together that tool and engage in that scoring?

# How to Read Anyone’s Mind

## Early in my business life, I traveled to New York, to a private meeting at the palatial office of the CEO of a large, fast-growing public company. I was being considered for a very important, very big, very lucrative consulting assignment, potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to me. In the 40 minutes or so of this meeting, we actually dealt with the matter at hand for only 10 minutes, and I listened, for half of those minutes. For the other half hour, I mostly listened to the CEO talk about his problems of the day, expound on his business philosophy, brag about his most recent big deal, and unintentionally tell me exactly what he wanted to hear from me to make our deal. I sat there and quietly “read his mind.”

## You don’t have to be a psychic to read someone’s mind—he or she will
 read it out loud to you, with a little encouragement!
 Way back in 1993, I wrote a small book about this subject: HOW TO READ ANYONE’S MIND. It has been out of print for years, but now you have it, as a Bonus Book, at the end of this one. I have added only a few updated references, but largely preserved the original text as-is.

# Five Steps to Listening More Effectively

## 1. Clear your mind of distractions before getting into a meeting with another person or other people. Take a minute to close your eyes and blank your mind immediately before going into a meeting or picking up the telephone. Top telemarketing trainers tell people handling incoming calls to set aside their paperwork on the first ring, close their eyes, and take a deep breath on the second ring, then smile and answer on the third ring.
 2. Determine in advance why the person you are going to be listening to is important to you, and why what he or she is saying might be important to you. You have to sell yourself on the relevance in order to focus your attention.
 3. Listen for information and insight that you can use to engineer cooperation with the other person. A long, apparently irrelevant, favorite story told by the other person may inadvertently reveal one tiny clue to effectively persuading or motivating that person.
 4. Be an active listener. Nod. Give feedback. Ask questions to encourage the person to continue and to demonstrate your interest. Use the technique of “mirroring”[1] to put the other person at ease. This is not to advise sacrificing personality and individuality. I certainly haven’t and I don’t believe anybody else should. But you can keep your individuality and still modify your physiology, within a range, to make the person you are listening to feel more comfortable.
 5. In some business situations, it may be appropriate to jot down notes as you listen. Don’t hesitate to do so; it helps illustrate your interest.
