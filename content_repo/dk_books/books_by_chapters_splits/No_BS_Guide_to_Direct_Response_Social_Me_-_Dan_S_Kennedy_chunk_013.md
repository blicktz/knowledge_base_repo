###### I have gone back to Dan’s collection of teachings time and time again while testing direct-response principles on social media. Many direct- response marketers think social media is complete fluff—and for a lot companies, it is. That’s because most marketers do not apply any direct- marketing tactics to their strategic approach (if they are even strategic at all).
 When I ran the agency, we spent thousands of dollars each day and millions each year in social media advertisements and used direct-response marketing principles to achieve financially rewarding results for our clients, and frankly, for us too, which did make us giddy—we were all known to do a daily happy dance or two. Today, we are still testing with thousands of dollars a day, and the same strategies apply.
 Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of marketing tactics in the pages that follow, let’s cover a few of Dan’s key business principles as applied to social media.

 1. HAVE A PLAN TO SELL FROM THE VERY BEGINNING In social media, you never want to come across as the used-car salesman pouncing on his next kill, but you do need to ensure you give your prospects a consistent opportunity to connect and do business with you. If you don’t, you will not realize a return of your marketing dollars and staff resources spent online. (General Motors is king of this. They did nothing to give an effective call to action and then declared social media advertising to be a waste of time and money. It is back on now, by the way.)

 2. TYPES OF OFFERS Lead generation. An incentive for your recipient to provide contact information. This is done through offering something of inherent value that is so good your recipient would pay for it, except they won’t have to because you will be giving it away for free. This can include any incentive such as a report, white paper, gift certificate, or ticket to a live event.
 Sale. It is possible to sell directly to cold traffic on social media. We do it every day using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram, but there are a few key things to remember. There should be something special about your offer, such as it is being sold online first, or offered at a special price, or at least it is positioned as though it is something special.


-----

###### If in contrast you post the same sale at the same price on social media as you do everywhere else, then you are most likely not going to realize great results. Social media is a cocktail party, not a shopping mall, and the only way to get people to pay attention to something being shared is to make sure it is really interesting. Do that, and everyone pays attention and wants in first.
 For example, when we came out with a new course on how to add 1,000 email addresses to your list using free social media, we didn’t pitch the course. Instead, the pitch was for a free workshop on how to grow your list. We positioned it that way because a workshop has value, different than a webinar.
 To see what message resonated most, we looked at the “share count,” aka the number of times someone shared the ad with their network. This demonstrates how interesting/fascinating they found the offer.
 This one ad alone has been shared 10 times (see Figure 3.1 on page 36). Imagine if each person sharing it only has 100 friends. That’s still 1,000 receiving a personal recommendation from a friend to take my free workshop.
 Plus, the social proof of the comments and “likes” has Facebook giving us better pricing on all our ads.
 Make your offers worthy of sharing.

 3. DON’T MAKE DELAYING A DESIRABLE OPTION While automation is possible in social media, setting up your offers and just letting them run forever is not effective in the least. Your offers should be fresh, new, and ever-changing with clear deadlines. Offer weekly perks to purchase, opt-in, comment, or share. Always give a deadline and incentive for taking action now.
 Satori Method ran a free energy workshop using a free media, Facebook Live, that was only on for six days yet drove thousands to their list, using no paid ads The founders Tristan and Sabrina Truscott are two of my Inner Circle Mastermind Members and you’ll discover more about how they used social media later in this book (see Figure 3.2 on page 37).

###### 4. GIVE VERY CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO
 RIGHT NOW Want your audience to click over to your website? Tell them to do it, clearly.
 In posts, put your link on its own line. Go here now, visit this page and enroll, pick up your phone, dial the number and talk to a Customer

###### Concierge now (see Figure 3.3 on page 38 for an example). The less work they have to do to figure out the next step, the more likely they are to take action.

###### 5. THERE WILL BE TRACKING AND MEASUREMENT How will you ever know the ROI on your social media marketing unless you track it? We have a lot of fun at my company, but we are a serious bunch when it comes to tracking.


-----

###### Use tracking options available in each social media network profile and advertising platform. They all have conversion tracking, analytics, and insights. Use them. On your end, you should also track unique forms, landing pages, and URLs. All this is hard or easy depending on your back- end program. Not all adapt well to intense measurement. But something is better than the nothing most do, because that is the kind of results they get … nothing.

 6. BRANDING SHOULD BE A BYPRODUCT OF EFFECTIVE DIRECT-RESPONSE
 MARKETING, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND In social media, all your posts, promotions, photos, and posturing should have a goal of sales, not branding. This may seem in conflict with the strategic approach to present valuable content 85% of the time and only sell 15% of the time, but the opposite is true. All your content should be developed with a goal of selling 15% of the time, meaning your posts should be cultivating interest and need in whatever pain your product will relieve when you make your pitch. In addition, this means money should only be spent on driving leads and sales, not on post engagement or building “likes.” Your page will not end up with 1 million engaged posting fans. Your goal should be ROI instead of popularity.

 RESULTS RULE. PERIOD. There is an endless supply of conjecture by social media “experts.” Be very cautious whenever you hear a universal truth about any type of social media marketing. When we ran the agency, we placed thousands of advertising dollars each day for clients across industries, geography, and products, and what we have found is that nothing can be deemed a universal truth, not even within the same industry. The only thing you should use to determine your spend and marketing direction are the results of your ads and posts. This is why everything needs to be tracked and checked every day. Yup, every day. Our client reporting was different than “clicks” and “engagement” metrics. We told our clients exactly what they spent for ads, for our fee, and how many qualified leads or customers resulted, so they always got an exact ROI on their spend. We then used this data to make their ad campaign more effective. Any other information is fluff and should be ignored.

###### Now, running Powerful Professionals, I require the same kind of reporting from my internal team who does this for me. We meet twice a week and review ad spend, leads generated, sales, and profit. Staying on top of these metrics is what has allowed us to grow so quickly.
 Are there more direct-response marketing truths that should be applied? Absolutely, and that is why you’ll need the rest of this book. Keep reading to discover exactly how to launch your first (or next) results-driven social media sales campaign.

#### The Importance of Creating Your Unique Selling
 Proposition

###### by Dan Kennedy I was reading an extensive survey about measuring the impact of advertising slogans. Among the slogans and advertising tag lines for 22 of the biggest U.S. advertisers, only six were recognized by more than 10% of the consumers surveyed.
 In other words, not even 1 out of 10 consumers could correctly identify 90% of the slogans. In fact, 16 of the 22 advertisers had slogans no one knew, although each spent more than $100 million a year advertising theirs!
 Three of these much-advertised slogans scored 0% recognition. 0%! Take the test, to see if you can name any of the big, dumb companies that match these slogans:

 1. We’re with You 2. That Was Easy 3. The Stuff of Life

 Only Walmart’s “Always Low Prices” was recognized by 64% of the consumers tested. (And by the way, if you can’t have the lowest prices, you might as well be the highest. Not much cache in “Almost Always Almost Lowest Prices Most Days.”)
 Those faring poorly, like #1 above, argued that it had only been advertising its slogan for YEARS!!!! Quote, “It takes time to build brand identity.” The spokesman for #3 justified its disaster as “only a transitional

###### slogan,” stating the company was moving toward yet another new brand- focused identity, whatever the beejeezus that is. Translation: New slogan being thunk up.
 The real laughter is that the copy of this article was from USA Today’s website, and at its end, two companies paid to advertise their services, doing, yep, “corporate branding.”

 Is a Slogan a Brand? Isn’t a Slogan Just Like a USP? No, a slogan is not a brand, and these results are not exactly an indictment of all brand-building approaches.
 For example, the kind of “personal branding” I teach encompasses more than a slogan and is usually more targeted to a market.
 However, it’s easy to have that go awry and wind up with branding that looks good but does nothing. There’s a tightrope to walk there, and it’s easy to fall off. Most ad agency types do.
 A slogan is definitely not a USP, although it can represent, telegraph, or at least be congruent with a USP in your small-business marketing.
 Actually, Walmart’s is the only slogan in all the ones tested via this survey that enunciates a USP. It is, not coincidentally, the only effective slogan. The others not only fail the Dan Kennedy USP Question #1 (Why should I, your prospect, choose to do business with you vs. any and every other option?), but they are also so generic they could be used by anybody.
 For example, “That Was Easy” could certainly work for Boston Market —how easy it is to put a “home cooked” dinner on the family table—or for Ditech—how easy it is to get a home loan.
 Warning: If anybody and everybody can use your USP, it ain’t one. If any and every Tom, Dick, and Mary can use your slogan, why on earth would you want it?
 In each of these cases, the minute the ad agency charlatans revealed these slogans in the corporate clients’ boardrooms, the CEOs should have stood up, pulled out a gun, shot one of them somewhere it would really hurt and bleed a lot but not kill him, and yelled, “Next.”
 This is the kind of chronic stupidity I encountered when working with big, dumb companies like Weight Watchers and Mass Mutual. (Incidentally, Weight Watchers could use any of the above three loser slogans. Mass could use two of them. And probably would.)

###### Every company behind these losers had a spokesperson ready with an excuse. Nobody said, truthfully, “We’re idiots.”
 I have the reputation of being anti-brand. Actually, I’m not “anti-brand” at all and, as you can observe, have diligently turned myself into a personality brand. (Go ahead, Google “Dan Kennedy” and see what turns up. Be sure you’ve packed a lunch. You’ll be there a while.) I also have “NO B.S.” as a brand extending over books, newsletters, products, and “RENEGADE MILLIONAIRE” to a lesser extent.
 I do counsel against investing directly into brand-building, especially with large-company-style “image” advertising that cannot be accurately and ruthlessly held accountable.
 A few principles and tips about your brand identity:

 1. By all means, work at creating name-brand identity and recognition
 for yourself and your small business, but do it where it counts, with a carefully selected target, niche, or subculture market small enough that you can have impact with whatever resources you have, defined narrowly enough you can create compelling messages for it. A giant market is only useful to someone with a giant wallet. You do not want to waste your life peeing into the ocean. (For example, I have aimed myself at “entrepreneurs” pretty successfully, but “corporate America” has been sacrificed. Stephen Covey may have 10,000 copies of one of his books bought by American Airlines or Citibank. I most assuredly will not.) Whatever your business, nationally or locally, there is a prime market and a prime audience. Build brand identity with them. 2. A brand or brand identity is, essentially, a recognized symbol that
 represents and calls to mind what you and your business is about. I maintain it should also be designed to resonate with a very specific who your business is for. Many marketers are reasonably clear about their what but woefully unclear about their who, thus their what is often wrong. 3. By all means, work at creating name-brand identity and recognition
 for yourself and your business, but do it as a byproduct and bonus of solid, accountable, profitable direct-response advertising and

###### marketing. Avoid buying it outright, such as with image advertising. Refer to the “Direct Marketing DIET” on pages 20 and 21 of my No B.S. Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses book. 4. Do not confuse “brand identity” with logos and slogans. Logos,
 slogans, color schemes, and other imagery are simply devices used to convey or support brand identity, just as typefaces are a means of conveying words. Brand identity is about ideas first and representations of ideas second. 5. If you do develop brand identity, develop a “customer culture” with
 it, so your brand is theirs. Think Starbucks or Disney. The customers are part of something, not just people being sold to. But, whatever you do, don’t blindly copy big companies’ advertising practices. Very, very, very carefully learn from the very few smart ones, like Disney. But remember they are playing in a different league with different rules and different means of keeping score. As an example, you may keep score by profit while they must keep score by stock price (which rarely, formulaically reflects profit). And they have more resources than you do. 6. For most small businesses, personal branding is far superior to
 corporate/business branding. People prefer dealing with people, rather than with nameless, faceless, soulless institutions. Put yourself out there! 7. Most basic, starting-point summary: Begin with WHO is your
 business for? + WHAT do you want to be known for, by WHO? then HOW can you represent, symbolize, and summarize that in a memorable way.

 In reality, the principles behind the USP have been talked about to death. You can call it the Purple Cow, your market position, your winning difference, or just the answer to Why Should Anyone Read Your Blog, connect with you on LinkedIn, “Like” you on Facebook, follow you on Twitter, or click on your ad.
 The reason the USP has been talked to death is that this core idea is essential to effective marketing. Even though defining your USP is one of the best places to start when you’re building a solid marketing plan, it also seems to be one of the easiest places for people to get lost.
 USP can be defined this way: When you set out to attract a new, prospective customer to your business for the first time, there is one paramount question you must answer:
 “Why should I choose your business/product/service vs. any/every other competitive option available to me?”
 It simply means “justify your reason to exist.” You must know the facts, features, benefits, and promises that your business makes—inside-out, upside-down, backwards, forwards, and sideways. Because if you can’t clearly articulate what makes your business unique, how can you expect anyone else to care?
 You will need to crow about your business if you expect it to expand, but it’s pivotal that you trumpet the right things.
 The right USP coupled with the right offer, especially at the right time and place, is important for any business. For a business fighting for attention with millions of other blogs all over the world, it’s essential.
 It is imperative you can answer the following questions:
