###### by Dan Kennedy As a fan of Disney, I think one of the greatest services it offers is a VIP guided tour.
 This allows you to do things such as skip to the front of the line, get led in through secret back doors, and basically do more in one day (and in great style) than most may ever imagine.
 It’s a premium service, so as you can imagine, there are people who say the price is exorbitant. These are the same people who complain about having to wait in long lines at Disney and only having time to go on four attractions during the entire day.
 Maybe if they considered that you can, for example, go on 12 attractions in the time it takes others to go on one attraction, they would see the value. Maybe they’d realize in the end, with a guide, you can do in one day what it takes the average person multiple days, even a week, to do.
 I see this in business all the time. People look for the easiest, fastest, or cheapest route without considering the whole picture.
 Email marketing is a prime example.


-----

###### Many businesses think, because it’s so easy to use, they don’t need to put as much thought, time, or planning into it as they do with direct-mail campaigns.
 Then these same people complain about their poor open rates, declining click-throughs, and deflated results.
 If you want better results, you have to consider the whole picture. And you have to invest in making your emails better.
 For instance, one key disadvantage of email is that there are a lot more of them flooding your customers’ inboxes every day, many more than there are pieces of mail being delivered to their regular mailbox.
 That means a lot more competition for eyeballs. So, you don’t want to be sloppy about what you are sending. Rather than firing off an email in ten minutes and blasting it out to your entire list without much thought or consideration, take the time to establish a plan, with response or conversion goals, so you know exactly what you want your audience to do before you ever write your email.
 And make sure you’ve included the core elements needed in each email you send.
 Consistency is also a factor. While you can execute a direct-mail campaign at random times, once you start sending emails, you should deliver them consistently week in, week out, without exception.
 If you send email in a hit or miss, random fashion, or go missing from their inbox, people will forget about you in a heartbeat—even if you return to a regular, predictable schedule at a later date.
 This doesn’t mean you can’t send emails at other times apart from your schedule. If you take care of the readers on your email list by sending valuable, relevant emails at regular intervals, they will pay attention at other times too.
 There are many strategies you can combine with your email marketing to improve your results and increase your profits—in many cases, well beyond the standard ROI you see quoted in studies.
 In fact, rarely do I consult with a client where there aren’t untapped opportunities within their email strategy, including ways to combine email with other media to get a higher response.
 Strategies to use with opt-ins can separate the looky-loos from hyperactive buyers, increase profits, improve click-throughs, or even create

###### more loyal customers, clients, or patients.
 Split-test your subject lines, layout, email length, time sent, call to action, and so on, and then examine your results to see what is working and what isn’t.
 There is no free pass to the front of the line. If you want your emails to be the first thing your customers want to open, you have to invest time and resources in making them worthy.


#### #NoBSsm Social Takeaways

###### • Do NOT use your email subject line to promote you. Use the
 subject line to entice the reader to open the message and read more. #NoBSsm

 • Include a clear call to action in your emails. People are too busy
 to figure out what you want from them … so they won’t. #NoBSsm

 • Write every one of your marketing emails like it’s a personal
 communication, and focus entirely on the reader of the email. #NoBSsm

 • Your email subject lines should be entertaining, engaging, or
 invite curiosity. #NoBSsm

 • Never assume you know best. Everything should be tested in
 small batches before the big launch. #NoBSsm

 • Determine who your target market trusts the most, and utilize
 that voice in your messaging. #NoBSsm

##### CHAPTER 11

### Engaging Online:

## What to Post About

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### Increase Your Free Reach

###### When it comes to social media, the more comments, likes, and shares you get, the higher your engagement level is and the more your content will be shown to others for free. If you can keep that engagement level even when you aren’t promoting anything, when it comes time to promote, you will have more reach into the newsfeeds of your target audience.

 Strategies to Create Engagement I like to follow a formula of 85% PBS and 15% QVC, meaning you give valuable and nonsales content 85% of the time and only self-promote or sell 15% of the time. You can look at this as one or two posts from every seven are going to be promotional. Stacking non-promotional posts when you aren’t in a launch serves you well for when you are.

 CREATE ORIGINAL VISUAL CONTENT Social media is a visual, quick-paced medium that requires you not only compete with other businesses, but also with content being produced by your target market’s friends and family, all of which are being shown on the same information feed.


-----

###### To get the attention from your prospect away from “What Aunt Mary is making for dinner tonight,” create original free content that invites the reader to share.
 This is your opportunity to establish yourself as the thought leader and the expert in your industry, so create visuals out of your quotes and blog posts. I recommend scheduling time to batch your post creation and put together 30 at a time that you can use for the month, ensuring you have enough content to post daily.
 Let’s first dive into some of my favorite apps/tools for creating content and then a formula for the posts themselves.

 1. Tools for Content Creation While running Powerful Professionals Business Coaching, writing a series of books for Entrepreneur Press, and raising two young girls, I am often asked, “How do you do it all?”
 My response is generally, “Laughter, prayer, and coffee.” Very true … but that’s not all. In reality, there are 8,907 things I depend on to make my time more efficient and effective. This includes my “can’t-live-without-them” resources, many of which help me keep up my daily posting schedule. Think of these as a collection of “easy buttons” you can use to cut time spent on social content creation to just a fraction.

 Design Apps Some people collect figurines, put together train sets, or spend time on puzzles. I investigate time-saving apps.
 Finding new tools to save me time/improve workflow is a hobby of mine and makes me giddy. Yes, I am that much of a nerd.
 Good news for you, I did the research and you get to use the apps.

 • Canva. Design everything for social media (posts, ads, cover photos,
 and more) and/or anything else you need to design with the custom- dimensions feature. This is my go-to design app when working on Desktop. Even though we have several designers on staff, I use the app for creating ad variations on the fly to keep our costs low and lead

###### • Word Swag. If one could marry an app, I would be willing to commit
 polygamy with this one. (Just kidding … kind of.) In a matter of seconds, you create gorgeous images that make you look like you can actually design. Which I cannot. But this app can. I use these images for social media and to create logos and webinar slides. (See Figures 11.3 and 11.4, on page 191 for some examples.)
 •  Facetune2. I was a fan of the original Facetune for turning my
 ordinary iPhone photos into professional-looking images, but this new version is seven bazillion times better. You can still do the fancy things like whiten teeth, smooth out wrinkles, and improve coloring (not saying how I know this, of course), but you can do the same thing in real-time photos and videos. This app is the social content creator’s bff. For reals.
 Figure 11.5 (on page 192) was created with the app after a workout with no makeup on … the app is that good.

###### • Swish. This app is a legit game changer for video and ad creation. It
 comes with video and music you can use, and in just a few seconds, create your own professionally produced video. (See Figure 11.6 on page 193 for an example.)

 2. Tools for Copy Writing

 • Words That Sell. From Amazon: More than 6,000 words and phrases
 that make the difference between “yadda-yadda-yadda” and copy that sells.
 More than 75 lists of powerful and persuasive words and phrases, including 21 new lists for this edition cross-referencing categories to jump-start creative thinking (see Figure 11.7 on page 193).
 I write a lot of copy every day and find myself starting to use the same exact phrases and descriptions over and over again. This book by Richard Bayan (McGraw-Hill Education, 2006) helps keep my copy fresh and more effective. Plus, when suffering from writer’s

 Pages, Sales Letters and More!: From Amazon: IN MARKETING, what is the main difference between “pathetic” and “profitable?” A compelling advertising headline … the right advertising headline will attract, persuade, and retain your most loyal, valuable customers.
 This book by David Garfinkel (Morgan James Publishing, 2019) can help give your headlines a professional copywriter’s makeover, making them more compelling and persuasive for your target market. Again, add it to your “free help team” that Words That Sell joined.

#### What to Post About

###### Some harsh reality about content creation … Posting is less about what “comes natural” and more about doing what works.
 I’ve studied the top social media marketers in every niche imaginable and found what works best on social.
 First, never use stock photos that look like stock photos. They do not perform well.
 Use your phone, a good selfie stick, and a tripod, then get to work batching photos. Here’s what does work:

 • Looking at camera
 • Looking away from camera
 • Laughing
 • Looking down
 • Nature
 • Coffee cup and computer

 See Figures 11.9 through 11.12 on pages 196 to 199 for some prime examples of photos that work.

###### Ask Questions The simple act of posing a question on social media is the quickest and simplest way to signal that you’re looking for input. Being willing to ask for feedback and listen to what is and isn’t working not only helps your business grow, but it also builds loyalty.
 Oreo cookies, at over 40 million engaged fans, is very successful at this. Nabisco infamously ran the “cookie or crème?” campaign—getting over 1 million people to answer on the Oreo Facebook page. It was a campaign to engage Millennials and obtain contact information for its customers.

 Use Fill-in-the-Blank Posts Fill-in-the-blank posts are a go-to way to increase engagement. Here’s an example from our client, The Fertility Center: Fill in the blank: I am a ____ woman. (See Figure 11.13 on page 201.)

 Write a Photo Caption Post a funny or unique photo of your company or your products at work, or another photo you find online, and ask people to make up their own caption. These posts can be smaller giveaways where the winners get coupons or other prizes. It’s a tried-and-true way to keep your visitors entertained.
 We did this for Ron LeGrand, a real estate investment training guru, and the results were phenomenal.
 Mary Lorson, the Account Manager leading this project at the time, wrote:

 When our client shared a quirky photo of himself looking at a horse, we saw an opportunity. We posted the photo on Facebook and took a lighthearted approach with this post: “Okay, everyone, this photo is BEGGING for a good caption. We’d love to hear your ideas!” (See Figure 11.14 on page 201.)

**FIGURE 11.13: Fill-in-the-Blank Posts Inspire Increased Engagement**

###### Inspire Engagement


-----

###### We posted our own comments to keep the mood light and provided replies or “Likes” for each suggestion to keep engagement high. After the first few days, we “spontaneously” suggested that since suggestions were so good, we should hold a contest. Two days later, we announced the winning caption would win a customized T-shirt, then created a link to keep the contest legal. In the next few weeks, we created only two additional newsfeed posts, with links back to the photo, reminding people of the contest. Over the 20 days the contest ran, we received more than 70 entries and 24 Likes, all without any media spend. (See Figure 11.15.)

 To make sure this happens despite how crazy your week may get, systematize the process using a form tied into your CRM and a set schedule of awarding prizes.
 Make sure to announce the winner each week publicly to encourage others to participate in the following week’s post. (Plus, this gives you another post and another chance for engagement.)

 Here’s a Posting Schedule Template to Help You Get Started
