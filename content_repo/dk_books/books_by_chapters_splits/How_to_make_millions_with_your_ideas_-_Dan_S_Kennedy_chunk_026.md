  businesses.
    The catalogs provide fundamentally free advertising for the
  stores. The stores utilize the same catalogs as their own. The
  revenue from the stores and the existence of the distribution
  pipeline make it easier for the company to continually invest in
  new, original product development. The stores’ salesforces se-
  cure business from a type of clientele that might never walk in
  and buy off a store shelf, but, while doing so, automatically
  promote the stores and the catalogs, so that contacts they make
  but do not convert to clients may later visit a store or shop from
  a catalog. The outside salesforce and the advertising for the
  stores by the catalogs serve to make the store franchise a more
  certain, reliable success for the franchisee. Catalogs x Stores x
  Salesforces = Millions.
    The overall success of this three-pronged synergistic strategy
  is impressive: over 100,000 corporate customers, including
  Xerox, AT&T, 3M, and Ford, and total sales in 1993 exceeding
  $13 million. At the end of the first quarter of 1994, Celex Group,
  Inc., the parent of Successories, Creating Excellence, and its pub-
  lishing arm, Great Quotations, announced record sales and earn-
  ings, featuring a whopping 129 percent increase in sales
  compared to the same quarter in 1993. Barring any unforeseen
  disaster, Celex may as much as double in size over the next two
  years.
      The MiniConglomerate Philosophy
    I have long encouraged my clients to view their businesses
  and business opportunities very differently from most. If you
  start asking people ‘‘What business are you in?’’ or ‘‘What do
  you do?’’ you will usually get answers that impose very limited
  definitions on their activities. They box themselves in, mentally
  and otherwise. A person who owns a chain of jewelry stores, for
  example, may answer, at worst, ‘‘I’m a jeweler’’ to, at best, “‘I
  own a chain of jewelry stores.’’ But those very definitions pre-

    business or importing pearls from the South Seas or putting up-
    scale engraved gift kiosks in the same malls where they have
    stores or creating a ‘‘wedding store’’ or “‘wedding catalog’’ or
    a travel business specializing in unique honeymoon trips or...
     There is a difference between being focused and being re-
    stricted. One of my most frequently dispensed suggestions is that
   you focus on the customer. You'll recall my other references to
   TCV, Total Customer Value. Once you come to grips with the
    fact that the single biggest expense of business is acquiring a
    new customer, then it becomes evident that it can be easier and
   more profitable to grow by offering more products and services
    to the customers whose trust you have than by only searching
    for new customers. Then you can fit that idea together with other
    synergy. If you put two consumer service businesses together
    under one umbrella, you not only halve the cost of acquiring
    customers, you share fixed and operations expenses in order to
    create better bottom-line profits.
     You might also focus on the product. Disney was the first to
    ask the very smart question: Since our characters are eagerly
    licensed by manufacturers of all kinds of merchandise that sells
   by the multimillions in all kinds of stores, why don’t we have
    our own products sold in our own stores? Now it’s hard to walk
    into a mall anywhere without finding a busy, very profitable
   Disney Store. Their success awakened a sleepy Warner Brothers
    to the neglected product value in their characters, and now
    equally successful Warner Brothers stores are proliferating like
    crazy. Both Disney and Warner also have thriving catalog busi-
    nesses, and their catalogs promote their stores.
     When I coauthored the ‘‘Be Your Own Boss’’ products with
   Tony Robbins, Fran Tarkenton, and Entrepreneur magazine’s
    columnists, and the TV infomercial that promoted this product,
    I interviewed Beverly, a bright, dynamic lady who had used En-
    trepreneur’s Business Start-Up Guides to launch her gourmet
    muffin shop in Atlanta’s The Underground. She had a successful
    shop, baking and selling muffins, including many unusual muf-
    fins from her own recipes, such as ‘‘Meal-In-A-Muffin’’ items

  other ways to make money when a local Wal-Mart executive,
  who liked her products, asked if she could supply the area Wal-
  Mart stores with packaged muffins to sell.
   She did not say (or think): I’m not in the wholesale bakery
  business. She said yes. And, instantly, she was in the wholesale
  bakery business. Initially, she marshaled a night shift of workers
  who produced muffins for Wal-Mart stores right there in the
  store. But soon, the demand of Wal-Mart and other stores she
  added to her clientele forced her to expand to a larger muffin
  “*factory’’ in a lower rent area. The last time I talked to her, her
  wholesale business was much bigger and more lucrative than her
  store.
   Odds are, in your current business or the business you’re
  about to create, you have or will have an asset, be it the custom-
  ers, the product, or something else that could and should serve
  as the basis for very creative synergistic expansion. Here are a
  few quick tips for recognizing it and exploiting it:
         THINK BIGGER!
  Most big businesses began as small businesses. There’s no rea-
  son that you can’t expand, duplicate, diversify, combine, etc.,
  and turn your small business into an exciting, growing business.
          THINK BROADLY!
  Don’t define your business too narrowly. Give yourself mental
  creative room to maneuver and to respond to new opportunities.
          THINK LEVERAGE!
  What is your greatest asset? Is it a loyal, highly responsive cli-
  entele? Is it store traffic? A phenomenal location? Your product
  or products? Whatever it is, how can you get more leverage from
  it? How can you better exploit it? Mickey Mouse was a cartoon
  character, of use originally only in short cartoons for movie the-

```

```
   a cable TV network, and on and on and on.
         THINK SYNERGISTICALLY!
   What elements can you combine under your single roof or um-
   brella that multiply rather than just add to the value of your
   business?
        A Final Word from the Author
     There is a reason that people choose the United States of
   America over every other nation in the world. They wait pa-
   tiently and fight persistently to gain entry legally. They risk their
   lives to sneak in illegally. They come across the harsh, dark
   desert; they row here on rafts. This has been going on since the
   beginning of America, and it will go on as long as we remain a
    true free-enterprise society. Why? Because of the Great Ameri-
   can Dream.
     And they can have it. This remains a place, just about the
   only place, where anybody can set and achieve virtually any
   goal, regardless of where they start, regardless of the particular
   obstacles they carry with them, and that goal can certainly in-
   clude turning their ideas into a million dollars or more. This book
    is intended, in part, as a reaffirmation of the availability of The
   Dream.
     I tell people that I am woefully unqualified for every business
    activity I’m involved in, every success I have achieved. I’m one
   of the highest-paid advertising copywriters and marketing con-
    sultants in the field, yet I never attended college and never had
   any formai education or apprenticeship in advertising. I’m a very
    successful professional speaker who routinely earns $10,000 to
   $25,000 per speech (in fees plus educational materials sales), and
   who has shared the platform with a long list of celebrities, in-
   cluding two former U.S. presidents. But, when I was a kid, I
    stuttered almost uncontrollably, I got a C in high school speech

        ¢ Lead your marketing with irresistible offers.
       ¢ Create extra profit centers.
        ¢ Diversify your marketing efforts.
        ¢ Continually listen to your customers—react and re-
      spond.
        ¢ Deliberately build on customer loyalty.
      2. Exclusively control your products and businesses
        ¢ ‘‘Have’’ the market, then get the product (the reverse
      of most people’s approach).
        ¢ Pick products (and businesses) using proven criteria
       with your greatest interests.
        ¢ Negotiate for limited, carefully defined exclusive rights
       in a way that is a win-win for you and the manufac-
       turer or other party granting the rights.
        ¢ Remember, if you don’t ask, you don’t get!

       small.)

    * Turn your business or moneymaking system into a
    ‘‘business opportunity in a box.”’
   5. Get involved in the exciting world of direct
    marketing
    * Bypass middlemen and complicated distribution—go
    direct to the end user and build relationships with your
    consumers.
    * Use your marketing as a means of collecting data about
    your customers.
    ¢ Test, test, test.
    ¢ Tap into others’ databases and established customer
    relationships.
   6. Turn information into millions
    ¢ The most in-demand, most-consumed commodity of
    our time is information, _
    ¢ Packaging and selling information, with emphasis on
    publishing-on-demand, gives you enormous financial
    leverage.
    ¢ If you know “‘how to,’’ you have the basis for a prof-
    itable information marketing business.
    ¢ If you’re not going to be in the information business
    exclusively, at least incorporate information products
    and information marketing in your other business. Plus
    your other product(s) with information components.
   7. Publicize!
    ¢ Publicity is so powerful it can even build businesses
    with no other proactive advertising or marketing. This
    fact tells you that you must make it part of your mix

HOW TO USE ARISTOTLE ONASSIS’S
  BIGGEST BUSINESS SECRET:
 THE MILLION-DOLLAR ROLODEX
 Le billionaire Aristotle Onassis said that the secret to success
   in business is to know something nobody else knows. Along
 these lines, one of the most frustrating, time-consuming, and
 often costly challenges of turning ideas into profits is finding the
 right contacts, vendors, resources, information, and knowledge.
   Over the years, I have built up quite an arsenal of resources.
 I have already sifted and sorted through thousands to arrive at
 the relatively small number that I rely on repeatedly. In this
 chapter, I pass those on to you. You might think of it as having
 a million-dollar Rolodex on your desk, as it has cost me at least
 that much to assemble, and could be worth more than that to
 you now, just in time saved.
   In contacting these sources, it will be of benefit to let them
 know you read about them in my book. In many cases, you will
 get discounts or other special considerations as a result.
       Important Notices About the
        Million-Dollar Rolodex
    1. Although every effort has been made to ensure the
    accuracy of the listings provided here, the very na-
     ture of publishing a directory is that information
     will be out of date and incorrect even before the

```

-----

```
       publisher can accept any responsibility for inaccura-
       cies in these listings. I will remind you that your li-
       brary’s business librarian can be incredibly helpful
       in tracking down directories, companies’ new ad-
       dresses and phone numbers, and all sorts of
       information.
             . Being included in these listings does not constitute
       endorsement by me or by the publisher. In many in-
       stances, I’ve listed suppliers and contacts I’ve had
       very good experiences with, but that’s just no guar-
       antee that you will have the same kind of experi-
       ence and feel the same way. Consider what I’ ve
       done here as a very valuable shortcut in your shop-
       ping and information-gathering activities, but do not
       consider it some kind of warranty. It is not. You
        are an adult, responsible for your own decisions.
       Caveat emptor.
             . Because time will elapse between the assembly of
        this information, its publication, and your obtaining
        it, all offers must be subject to change without
       notice.
