###### Often, acting in a way that contradicts principle severely damages or ruins a personal or corporate brand. President Bush No.1 was, in the short term, virtually ruined by his failure to honor his “Read my lips—NO new taxes” pledge. A big-time TV preacher, Jimmy Swaggert, a moralist, never recovered from his public scandal involving under-age prostitutes. (For somebody like a rap music star or mogul, the same scandal might be helpful.) Disney has carefully, tentatively negotiated and expanded the serving of alcoholic beverages in select places and at certain times in its parks—something antithetical to Walt’s principles for the parks (although Walt personally was a drinker). Strategies that contradict principle are equally perilous. Pierre Cardin and Oleg Cassini were once very elite and exclusive fashion brands, but by extremely aggressive and indiscriminate licensing, including several different price levels and distribution channels for the same category of items—like sunglasses in boutiques at $500.00 but also in department stores at $50.00 and in discount stores for $19.95—their value was destroyed. The minute you can buy a cheaply made handbag with the Birkin brand on it, in unlimited quantity, at Target, the end for Birkin will be near. Disney licensed out the operation of its retail stores in shopping malls and gave up managerial control of the Florida community it created, Celebration, and lived to regret both strategic decisions as damaging to its brand. (It remedied the matter of the stores. It was too late to re-take control of Celebration). With 20/20 hindsight, there is only one strategic decision I’ve personally made in my own businesses that I consider damaging to my brand, and I’m embarrassed to say I repeated it and made fundamentally the same mistake twice. It was at odds with Principle.
 Just as linking Principle to Strategies is powerful, de-linking them is dangerous.

 Finally, we can get to tactics. This is too often where businesspeople begin or hurry, even race, to implementation. Advertising and marketing content, media, and process decisions are very often made with little or no

###### regard to a principle that governs strategy. Entrepreneurs are often “Ready, Fire, Then Aim” people. Entrepreneurs are often operating under extreme time or financial pressure. The temptations to make tactical moves without full consideration of them against strategies set by principle is difficult to resist. Often, we don’t even slow down enough to recognize that is what we’re doing!
 Martha Stewart risked great brand damage when she took Kmart as her first major retail partner. It was a simple tactical act: They were there with money and no one else was, and they had—at the time—enormous distribution power. She made a similar, apparently money- and immediacy- driven decision when she broke with Macy’s and did a huge deal with J.C. Penney, creating a triangle of messy, expensive, and hazardous litigation, ill will, and bad PR. Pharmaceutical companies helped themselves tremendously when they became direct-to-consumer advertisers in print media and on TV, when they copied a favorite tactic of late-night infomercials and hired and showcased celebrity spokespersons, a practice they continue to use. Sleep Number Beds began as a pure direct marketer and built their brand by direct-response advertising, but then made a tactical decision to open and operate their own local, brick-and-mortar retail locations (as opposed to distributing through other retailers or remaining a pure direct marketer), a decision that appears to be working out well for them. It has not worked out well at all for a number of other direct marketers, including brands like The Sharper Image and J. Peterman. Iron Tribe Fitness’s owners decided to operate the opposite of most gyms, limiting membership to just 300 rather than selling as many memberships as possible, and selling at a very premium price as opposed to the common, cheap fee. This is working out very well for them. A friend of mine self- published his health book, chooses not to sell it via Amazon or any other bookseller or in any ebook form (where it would probably bring from $4.00 to $9.00), sells it direct to consumers by direct mail only (at a $45.00 price), and has sold nearly 250,000 books at a nice profit. These are all tactical decisions. There are so many tactical options to consider that it’s vital to have a fixed basis for evaluating them—such as Strategies based on Principle.
 The brands I built and the relationship they and I have with my target market formed the basis for a substantial sale of the company I founded and

###### built, GKIC, to private equity investors, who now own it. It’s very rare for an individual author or speaker or thought leader to create a business with real, salable equity. These businesses are mostly income plays, not equity plays. Most are truthfully glorified jobs masquerading as businesses. Not mine. Mine was, in fact, sold twice, first to Bill Glazer, who helmed it with me heavily involved for about ten years, and again to the professional investment group. They valued this company in the tens of millions of dollars. All centered around little ol’ me. Why? Because, in my small way, in my niche field, I emulated truly extraordinary builders of brand value like Walt Disney and Hugh Hefner. (See Chapter 17.) I made my personal brand and affiliation with me, and my business brands and involvement with them, about high trust (like Disney) and dynamic aspiration (like Hefner). Within the confines and dictates of principle, I was extremely strategic. You will come away with a better, clearer, deeper understanding of why this approach is so important and how you can use it for any business, product, person, or cause.
 I pride myself on pragmatism, so I’ve made this a very practical book. It lays out a productive path, not an ethereal and theoretical jumble of ideas. But this is also an inspirational book. It shows how you can take your business and make it really mean something to its customers. My co- authors from Iron Tribe Fitness demonstrate this clearly. I hope you find this premise exciting and motivational: the making a business into something that really means something to its customers.
 Frankly, just selling stuff and making money, even a lot of money, is neither mysterious rocket science nor beyond anyone’s reach, because of upbringing, education, resources, or any other common excuse for poor life outcomes. I have a happy relationship with money and like making it and like, a lot more, having it, but just making it never really fascinated me. It now seems mundane. I think it’s damnably difficult to sustain creativity and enthusiasm for any business if all you’re doing with it is exchanging goods or services for money. The building of a powerful brand and a positive relationship with a group of customers to whom your work and your business is important and means something, that is a far more interesting exercise. It is a lie to suggest that, if you do that, plenty of money will automatically follow. Don’t believe that for a minute. But it is true that when that is done in concert with the other functions of business, with

##### How Are You to Learn AND IMPLEMENT Brand-Building by
 Direct Response?

###### It’s possible that the best education is demonstration.
 Two of the best practitioners of brand-building by direct response that I’ve consulted with, coached, and observed closely over the past several years are Forrest Walden and Jim Cavale, developers of a unique franchise concept in the fitness industry. In the next nine chapters, they provide an in- depth show-’n-tell demonstration of exactly how to do it, from startup to local market dominance to national expansion, beginning simply, then becoming incredibly sophisticated. Their chapters are rich with examples, and there is a video extension of every chapter at www.IronTribeFranchise.com/NoBS. I’ll return after these chapters, to talk about different applications of brand-building by direct response.
 One quick caution: Please do not sabotage yourself with the small, provincial, and very unimaginative “. . . but MY business is different” thinking. If that’s where your mind is at and will stay, you might as well stop right here, return this book for a refund, and move on. NO business is different. ALL businesses require the attraction and fascination and motivation of customers, and ALL successful businesses thrive by converting at least some of those customers to evangelical advocates. In short, to successful tribalism. Few tribes rise and stay together without a powerful brand to which they have allegiance. In this profound way, ALL businesses are the same—so all the lessons of Iron Tribe apply to all businesses.
 Attempting success as an entrepreneur with a closed mind is akin to leaping from an airplane and making the rest of the journey with a closed parachute.
 Even the Amish aren’t this Amish. In GKIC, studying my methods through the No B.S. Marketing Letter and the myriad of other resources and at our conferences, right along with the Iron Tribe guys, there are Amish

## They Digest Your Marketing Before You Have
 a Brand

###### by Jim Cavale


###### ith Iron Tribe, we knew the mountain we wanted to climb was brand. To have a recognized and understood brand that people felt drawn to and wanted to be part of was our goal. But we did

# W

###### not drive in that exact direction at first. We began by building gyms, not a brand. We began by marketing those gyms, not a brand. We began by selling memberships, not a brand. In the beginning, we just let the brand come along for the ride.
 It had been just one year since Forrest Walden and I began franchising our life-changing, Birmingham-based Iron Tribe Fitness brand, and we were finishing up a two-day trip to Charlotte, where we had the chance to


-----

###### coach up our newest franchisees on their pre-opening sales and marketing initiatives.
 Before we left town, we decided to visit a mentor who works in the investment banking world. His firm is perched high atop one of the modern skyscrapers located in Charlotte’s Uptown district.
 As we walked through this new, not-yet-established market for Iron Tribe, a group passing by us suddenly shouted out “Iron Tribe!”
 I turned and said, “Yes, the logo on my shirt represents Iron Tribe. How do you know about us?”
 A young man emerged from the group and said that he’d seen us building in a couple of different areas in Charlotte, where our gym construction signs had been put up and direct-response advertisements were already running.
 Based on what he said, he’d clearly digested our marketing. Which means he was educated and informed on how exactly Iron Tribe provides “LIFE. Changed.”
 Our initial marketing messages trained him to know that we only have 300 member athlete spots available at the gym opening near him, and if he acts now, he has the chance to join this tribe of athletes that will be established in his backyard and several other places throughout the “Queen City.”
 Just one of dozens of U.S. markets where we are now developing our Iron Tribe brand.
 He and his friends knew these things about Iron Tribe because we set out to clearly communicate them in our advertising and marketing—not just promote a vague idea, slogan, or logo. As direct-response marketers, it seems kind of crazy that we have actually built powerful brand identity. To our clients, our logo is known and prized. We didn’t get to this point overnight or by directly investing in brand identity.
 We’ve come a long way, from a small group of 30-somethings working out in Forrest’s garage to a nationally franchised fitness chain with more than 50 gym territories sold (and counting), just three years later.
 It began with one gym built upon a strict dedication to Dan Kennedy’s direct-response marketing principles, and it has evolved into a brand that people truly want to be a part of, as member athletes, as employee coaches and managers, and as brand ambassador franchise owners.


-----

###### Heck, it was a direct-response sales letter from Forrest himself that arrived in my mailbox, only to make me feel like I’d be crazy NOT to be a founding member athlete of this brand-new gym called Iron Tribe that was opening around the corner from my house!
 I rushed in to become one of the first ever Iron Tribe member athletes, and my life was so transformed that I was moved to change my entire entrepreneurial trajectory.
 So just a few months after Forrest started this new Iron Tribe Fitness gym concept, I approached him with aspirations of partnering to bring Iron Tribe to the world. It was a big idea that might have seemed insane to most people at that time, but not to him. That’s the very reason he started it in the first place—to make a life-changing impact on the world, one life at a time.
 Three years later, we are living out our dream, establishing a brand that is much bigger than ourselves, growing a nationwide franchise model with world impact aspirations, and ultimately, continuing to make this impact one person at a time with a systematized business model that has proven scalable.
 How did we get here so fast? How can we maintain this growth pace at such a rapid rate? What makes us think that we have an actual brand and not just one of the latest fitness fads?
 Great questions. There are several different paths I could take in approaching each, but there would be one common denominator in each of those answers—Iron Tribe is a brand that is built upon a solid base of direct-response marketing systems.
 Dan Kennedy once told us that “those who choose to grow their business from the beginning, with a foundation in direct-response marketing, will simply be more agile and so do the things that the big companies won’t do and can’t do, even though they want to. And should you become a big boy with direct response at your core, you have the chance to spread your tentacles around the entire globe.”
 The majority of small-businessmen have it completely backwards when it comes to building a brand-marketing platform that attracts new clients like a cult following. Everyone wants it, but most are not willing to do what it takes to get there.


-----

###### Instead of starting with direct response or even using it whatsoever, most businesses tend to act as if they are already an established brand, wasting real estate on their ad space with oversized logos and clever slogans that the market doesn’t even notice.
 This is a result of the masses copying the masses. Which of course, is always a no-no. My father raised me on the principle of watching what everyone else does and doing the opposite, and that rule certainly applies here.
 Don’t get me wrong, your brand and your logo can eventually stand for something. But first you have to raise your logo up like a child and earn it some respect.

##### Customers, Sales, Revenues, and Profits First

###### This enthusiasm starts with a first step of actually going out there with your new business and getting clients. Then you have to fulfill their orders with an experience that makes them feel good about seeing your business’s cost on their bank statement.
 Despite what most people would like to think, marketing is much more than hiring a graphic designer who creates a trendy logo and colorful sales brochures, hoping to distribute these pretty materials and watch the cash come pouring into your bank account.
 Instead, marketing is the science of getting your message to your market, with a willingness to test multiple messages and medias, and a strict dedication to tracking each of these tests in great detail. These tests produce successes and failures that turn marketing theories into a winning marketing plan. On its back, your brand can evolve.
 This success starts with the direct-response formulaic approach, and if you do it right, you can actually earn your brand some respect. Maybe even enough respect to attract loads of new clients who want to be a part of a tribe—to be a part of something bigger than themselves.

## How I Discovered Direct

###### irect response is a different animal.
 Most of the advertising you see is not direct response. Much of it is brand-driven advertising, either promoting a brand or,

###### more frequently, reinforcing an already recognized and established brand. Because the majority of all the advertising you see is this kind, you are naturally oriented toward doing that kind of advertising. But if you don’t have a brand as established and universally recognized as Ford or Budweiser or Apple or ESPN, it is very dangerous to copy what they and companies like them do. I learned that it is more useful to look at much younger, now known brands that seem to have come out of nowhere and become widely known, like the George Foreman Grill, or even to look at ideas that have become widely known and accepted, like individuals
