##### is also very likely to selectively shop at Whole Foods. (Bezos strikes again!) These are the customers Buick aims at with their “surprised that’s a Buick” TV commercials, GEICO wants to sell insurance to, and E*Trade wants to get involved in stock market investing. The current mass-affluent class is the most demographically diverse in American history, by age range, ethnicity, occupations, and geography.
 There is upward mobility, too. According to Spectrum Group’s Market Insights Report of 2017, there are 31 million mass-affluent households, an increase of 500,000 from 2016.
 •  Affluent. These income and net-worth markers have also risen. In
 earlier editions, I put those with household incomes of $150,000.00 to $250,000.00 and/or a net worth, including primary and additional residences’ equity, exceeding $1 million in this category. According to Ipsos Connect, Fall 2016, 23% of the country had risen to a household income exceeding $125,000.00. Commonly held assets like 401(k) plan investments and real estate are also significantly higher in value.
 There is dramatic upward mobility here. According to Wealth Engine, the number of millionaires has doubled from 2008 to 2017, to a record high number exceeding 16 million. Millionaire status is more common than it has ever been before.
 I again adjust this category’s income levels up, in this case with slightly more and faster growth than the mass-affluent group’s, to $200,000.00 to $400,000.00, but their net worth by an even greater boost to $2 million and up, in large part by the simple fact that they are more invested in the first place.
 It is within the Mass-Affluent in move-up mode and the Affluent categories that we find what some demographers have taken to calling “middle-class millionaires.” They are of a very particular mindset, which we’ll be talking about at length.
 In total, the combined wealth held by the world’s millionaires increased for the sixth consecutive year in 2018, topping $70 trillion for the first time. There is more spendable and investable money in these hands than ever before.

##### • Ultra-Affluent. Again, some increases here. Earlier, I had them with
 household incomes of $250,000.00 and up and/or a net worth of $3 million to $10 million. Their average household income is, as of 2017, $295,845.00, and, while the net worth still bottoms at $2.7 million, the average is $5.4 millon, and the top is past $10 million to $12 million. Here is where we find the top 10% of U.S. households in net worth. According to the Federal Reserve Survey, there are more than 5 million households in this category.
 This group controls 46% of U.S. wealth, 55% are men, and 45% are women—the financial gaps seen in the lower groups abate here. Fifty-eight percent are Democrats, sometimes called “limousine liberals;” only 38% are Republicans; 3% own boats, 1% own private planes, but nearly 10% fly private. The age of 55+ that has historically dominated here is slipping, as there is a rising number arriving at 45, with 18% of the total in the 45-to-55 bracket. They, of course, tend to be college educated. Nearly all own their primary residence and nearly half own a second residence and other real estate holdings.
 There is an ultra, ultra-affluent subset: the top 5%, with average annual incomes exceeding $350,000.00, snaring 22% of all earned income. Their net-worth range reaches from $10 million to $25 million. Their number grew by 84,000 in just the two years from 2016 to 2018, topping 1.3 million households. Above them are the much- politicized 1%, with an average income exceeding $1.2 million and with a net worth above $25 million to $100 million and much more. This group’s size grew by about 10% in the U.S. in 2016-2018. They captured about 10% of all the income growth. Average age is 57 and 70% are men. Here, the gender gap widens.
 Each year they report spending $30,000.00+ on wine and alcoholic beverages, $150,000.00+ at hotels and resorts, $115,000.00+ on clothes and accessories, $250,000.00+ on jewelry, $500,000.00+ on home improvements and furnishings, and they have multiple residences. As a practical matter, their spending power is unlimited. Their ranks include Fortune 1000 CEOs, Hollywood celebrities, executives, and professional athletes, but more than half are not famous or in exotic occupations or businesses but are, instead,

##### “the millionaire next door” who has moved up. Many have built up and sold businesses or taken their businesses public, creating lump- sum wealth.
 • Affluent Boomers. You’ll find a chapter devoted exclusively to this,
 pardon the pun, booming group actively exploring and even inventing an entirely new approach to retirement and Act 3 and Act 4 of life— and funding it with an unprecedented amount of spending power. The comprehensive resource on this is a separate book, No B.S. Guide to Marketing to Leading-Edge Boomers and Seniors. Also, a related book is No B.S. Guide to Trust-Based Marketing.

 With all of this, the trend since my earlier editions of this book is more moving up, and the spending power of each group increasing. Bloomberg put it this way:

 With $25 million, maybe, just maybe you are starting to be rich. Call it “economy class rich.” Business class rich? $100 million. First class? $200 million Private jet rich? Try $1 billion. That’s how the various levels of wealth are viewed by the world of high finance.

 These groups, and other affluent groups, offer opportunity to marketers as unprecedented as is their prosperity, spending power, and attitudes about spending. In the chapters to come, you will explore the mechanics of exploiting these opportunities.
 Outside the U.S., in various parts of the globe, there is explosive growth of middle-class consumer populations somewhat mimicking our post-WWII boom, as well as explosive growth of affluent and ultra-affluent consumer populations. Their ability to spend tracks the U.S. groups, but their willingness to spend is more voracious, as these levels of affluence are still relatively new to them. Most luxury goods companies have, in recent years, seen more sales growth opportunities overseas than within the U.S. The U.S., Japan, Germany, and China are home to the most millionaires; a combined 61%.
 As 80% of my readers are with me in the U.S., I’ve predominately described U.S. market conditions; however, the marketing strategies that

#### CHAPTER 3

### The Ultra-Rich: Different from You and Me

##### F. Scott Fitzgerald: “The very rich are different from you and me.”
 Ernest Hemingway: “Yes, they have more money.”

—DOCUMENTED EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE FAMOUS AUTHORS, FROM MARK MY

_WORDS, COMPILED BY NIGEL REES_

# We are endlessly fascinated with the strange ultra-rich. Fitzgerald’s
##### 1925 novel was made into a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the enigmatic Gatsby. For years, a popular TV show, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, aired. Today’s cable networks are well populated with “reality” shows featuring the homes and “cribs,” cars, and lives of the super wealthy.
 A client of mine, a niche gun manufacturer, told me about a guy contacting him directly, identifying himself as a huge fan of this particular gun—the Hand Cannon (www.BondArms.com)—which sells for $400.00 to $1,200.00. The fellow bought half a dozen, had them delivered to his engraver, and spent over $5,000.00 having each one custom engraved for family and friends. The customer has, for years, been a member of the Forbes 400. But there are a whole lot more than 400 of these ultra-rich, price-no-object consumers. More like 6 million, with another 15 million or so running around just a step or two beneath them, striving to climb up, and often spending as if they were already there.
 The Forbes 400 list, compiled and published annually by Forbes magazine, is a microcosmic look at the ultra-rich. In 2007, the first year that admission required a net worth of at least a billion dollars, many former multimillionaires dropped from the list. In the book All the Money in the World, authors and researchers Peter Bernstein and Annalyn Swan provide a terrific in-depth analysis of the earning and spending of these wealthiest people in the world. I recommend the book for those seriously interested in


-----

##### understanding and marketing to the ultra-rich. Here, I’ll give you a thumb- sized overview of what they found out, as well as my own observations.
 First of all, you should be interested in who is on this list. There are many names you know, like Oprah, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and the omnipresent modern-day Barnum, Donald Trump—of whom I am a fan. I have appeared as a speaker on programs and spent some interesting “quality time” with him backstage, and I, in print, predicted his winning of the presidency beginning the day of his announcement, descended by the gleaming gold escalators from On High. Since becoming President, Trump he has fallen some positions down on this list but still holds a spot above 200.

 Higher Education Predicts Affluence—But There Are Plenty Who Defy
 the Norms You might find a variety of statistics interesting and, in some instances, useful. These are from one year of the Forbes 400 list. In the particular year I analyzed for this chapter, 2018, 241 of the 400 basically made their fortunes from scratch, and another 36 made a large portion of their money even if also inheriting some wealth. Translation: 71% of the ultra-rich got there through ambition, initiative, drive, grit, ingenuity, hard work, and entrepreneurship. Their wealth has not separated them from those values. Only 116 of the 400 inherited their fortunes. Thinking of the ultra-rich as a silver-spoon-in-mouth crowd born of the lucky sperm club would be a serious mistake. This is not who they are, and it is definitely not how they think of themselves.


### Dan Kennedy’s #1 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### Make all your marketing to the affluent mirror the way they see and
 think about themselves.

##### Forty-one of the 400 attended Harvard; 27, Stanford; 10, Yale; and 2, Princeton—a total of 51 from the top-rated, most prestigious universities. It is worth noting however, that a higher percentage of the ultra-rich attended run-of-the-mill universities or did not attend college at all. Mythology about college education as requisite for any success above serving lattes at Starbucks persists now, even as a college debt bubble that is bigger than the mortgage bubble that burst in 2008 grows, past $1.3 trillion. Further, while college enrollments have climbed from 47% in 1973, the year I graduated from high school and did not go to college, to 69.7% now, college graduation rates have stayed the same—62%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. So, while more are going, more are dropping out. Imagine what that statistic will look like if we make college free for all. Got lousy grades, no work ethic, no ambition? Here’s a free ride at Harvard. Have fun.
 That kind of talk—the criticism of the free-college plans I just provided —really resonates with the ultra-rich, by the way. They deeply resent the popular but erroneous idea that they got their money through inheritance or luck, and they bear even greater resentment for and disapproval of handouts and freebies provided to others. Fundamentally, the more affluent a person is by his own making, the more vehemently opposed he is to handouts to anyone under any circumstances, except severe tragedy, such as volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, floods, and fires.
 A wonderful example of talking to this audience in a way that resonates —what I teach as “marketing by values”—is shown off in the little article reprinted at the end of this chapter, by a client of mine, Ted Oakley (www.OxbowAdvisors.com), a wealth manager specializing in entrepreneur/business owner and retired entrepreneur clients with assets from $10 million to $50 million. This “article” sometimes appears as the second page of a two-page lead generation advertisement, offering free copies of his book, $20 Million and Broke, but it is also used as a standalone item in different information packages sent to clients and in web media. It perfectly syncs with the thinking of his avatar client, from affluent to ultra-affluent.

 Married, with Children


-----

##### The ultra-rich are a marrying bunch. Only 14 of the Forbes 400 list I analyzed have never been married. Thirty-one have been divorced at least once, but 281 are married, the majority to their first spouses—a significantly better percentage than the general population. Cynics would say that has something to do with the high price of divorce. Golfer Greg Norman’s divorce was reported to cost more than $200 million, and he wasn’t even on the Forbes list! When asked by Johnny Carson why Arnold Schwarzenegger was rich and he was not, Burt Reynolds answered: “number of wives.” Still, as many, including former General Electric captain Jack Welch, have observed, the reason divorce is so expensive is it’s worth it. My own affluence was wounded significantly by divorce, helped by remarrying the same wife. Finally, I got to marry rich.

 Age and Affluence Still Go Together The age of the ultra-rich skews mature, as you’d expect, but it does span wide. The oldest of the Forbes 400 members in 2018 was 95 and the youngest was 31. Average: 69. If you step away from the top of the pyramid, the Forbes 400, and look at the broader affluent population, you will still see age skew senior, pointing the ambitious marketer to the affluent toward affluent Boomers.
 There are many reasons for this marriage of affluence to age. One is that simple high income does not equal wealth; equity does, and that usually takes time to accumulate. There’s also a profound difference between making money and holding onto it. Wealthy entrepreneurs tend to have won and lost one or more times before proving able to hold onto their gains. Information, knowledge, and capability can be acquired rather quickly, but wisdom cannot.

 WHERE Are the Rich? There is geographic concentration. And there is migration. Only a handful of years ago, more than 20% lived in California and nearly as many in New York. In 2018, out of the Forbes 400, only 28 have their primary residence in California, and 24 in New York. As cities and states like New York and California ever more greedily tax-target the rich, more and more leave. Limbaugh famously exited New York for Florida, Glenn Beck for

##### Texas, both low-tax states. Hollywood stars have fled Los Angeles in favor of places like Wyoming. Low-tax states like Florida and Texas have 16 from this list and are winning the competition for the relocation of the ultra- affluent. This is a factor in Google’s locating a large facility outside Silicon Valley, in Oklahoma. And in expanding there in 2012, again in 2015, and yet again in 2018. For a time, the Oklahoma Department of Commerce and its economic development arm, then led by Secretary of Commerce Larry Parman, was a client of mine. Its marketing targeted California and New York.
 The top ten counties where the richest people in America are concentrated are listed here, along with the average annual income of the one percenters in each place:
