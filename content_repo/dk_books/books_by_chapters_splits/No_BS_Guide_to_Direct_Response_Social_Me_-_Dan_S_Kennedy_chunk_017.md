###### According to Business Insider, “For a while, analysts called the company ‘Amazon Bomb.’ But Amazon survived for two reasons: Users kept coming to the site in bigger numbers, and Jeff never promised shareholders anything but a long-term vision.” Since then, Amazon.com has expanded beyond selling books to selling almost everything, from clothes to bird cages to a grossly dramatic replica of five pounds of human flesh, for example. (And some day when you have time on your hands, check out the reviews for sugar-free gummy bears. It’s interesting because people love it and hate it for the same reason—it’s a gastric nightmare! It has 1,400+ humorous product reviews.)
 By 2009, Amazon was up 5,000% since its IPO. And I am a happy stockholder.
 (If you want to read more about Amazon’s story, check out The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon by Brad Stone [Back Bay Books, 2014]. It is a very candid telling of how Bezos created a new disruptive way of doing business.)
 You may not be trying to create the next Amazon. But if you offer a quality product or service you believe in, or people have a need for what you offer, or you want to get more customers, clients, or patients, and you want to increase sales to your current customers, clients, or patients, then you are going to need your target market to respond to your ads.
 After you’ve decided on the who and the what … it’s time to launch! When you are ready to launch your ad campaign, be sure to avoid these mistakes.

 • Do not spend just to spend. I get it. There is a lot of pressure to launch
 your ads. But before you know whether your campaign will produce results, keep your credit card in your wallet. Test before launching with warm traffic, like your email list or social media followers. If you don’t have those yet, and you need to spend to test, start very slowly, at around $25/day. No need to go broke seeing if your offer is a winner.
 • Do not try to be everything to everybody. Make sure your copy and
 images speak to a specific audience. We’ve seen businesses set up their audience to be very narrow but then use the same image for

###### every audience. Being broad with your messaging is a quick way to waste your money.
 • Do not make the ad about you or your product/program/service/event.
 Ads that speak directly to your target market and share why someone should click on the ad (or play the video or Like your page) will perform a lot better.
 • Do not copy other ads you see on Facebook. Most of the people doing
 social media marketing are doing it terribly, terribly wrong and are not seeing measurable success. Follow them and you’ll get the same thing as them … bupkis.

 Instead, read the next chapter on how to write an effective ad.

##### CHAPTER 7

### Fill Your Funnel

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### Launching Your Offer

###### Once you know who you are targeting and what they want, and your Juicy Carrot is good to go, it is time to send traffic—aka people—to it.
 In this chapter you will discover my favorite hacks for each social media channel in building an audience quickly for free. In the next chapter you will discover paid strategies that will help you scale (and profit) quickly.

 Facebook As of the writing of this book, Facebook still has more locations for you to gather leads than any other social media channel. From the Newsfeed to your Business Page, Messenger, and Groups, you can use multiple channels all within the same platform.
 Let’s dive into each and learn how to get the most opt-ins for free from your Juicy Carrot.

 Your Business Page Lead Mecca Last year my company, Powerful Professionals, generated $54,387 for free from my Facebook Page. How?
 I promoted the sweet biscuits and gravy out of my Juicy Carrots on my page.
 Most businesses just let their page sit there and collect dust. You, on the other hand, will use it to gather leads.

###### Here’s how:

 1. YOUR COVER PHOTO Use your Cover Photo on Facebook as a billboard for a Call to Action to your Juicy Carrot. When your prospect clicks on the Cover Photo, up will come a description of the image, and in it, you can include a link of your choice.
 We change our cover photo to match the promotion we are working on. See Figures 7.1 thru 7.3.
 What does your cover photo promote? Your blog? Your email?

**FIGURE 7.1: Facebook Cover Photo and Description Example A**

###### Try adding a next step to increase your lead-to-sale conversation and see your ROI rise right away.
 And to leverage a professional appearance, I recommend you get your cover photo designed by a professional. DIY Cover Photos look DIY. If there is anywhere you want to spend the money to make a first impression, it is here. Plus, when you assign this, you can assign dimensions for LinkedIn and Twitter, too, so all three channels match.


###### Download resources for getting your Cover Photo done for you at

###### Revise your Facebook “About” descriptions and add a link to your Juicy Carrot everywhere you can (see Figure 7.4). Not 2,342 different links. Just one path to your Juicy Carrot.

**FIGURE 7.4: Call-to-Action Link on Kim’s About Page**

###### Do all your bios and descriptions on your social media pages have links to the next step?

 2. THE THREE-LINE POST Facebook’s platform gives us the most opportunity to promote our Juicy Carrot within a post, because when crafted correctly, the entire post and image will link directly to your Juicy Carrot page. You can accomplish this in a simple three-line post:


-----

###### • Line One: Get the reader’s attention by asking a question about the
 problem you are about to solve for them.
 • Line Two: Tease that there is a solution to that problem.
 • Line Three: Give a link to the call to action.

 Important: Type the copy and link in before adding any photos. Let the preview of the page come up and then add your pictures afterward so the entire post becomes clickable to your Juicy Carrot.

###### Post several times a week with a twist on the copy and different images, but always with a link to your Juicy Carrot. (See Figure 7.5 for an example of a three-line post.)

###### 3. FACEBOOK LIVE Growing up as a child of a first-generation American-born parent, I was taught to value a dollar and make the most of every opportunity. My father also taught us to go up for tenth helpings at All You Can Eat Buffets. (In Italian, we call this being a “Gavone.”) Thankfully, I quickly got over the buffet thing, and unless it is New Year’s Day brunch at the Breakers on Palm Beach, you won’t find me at one.
 But being conscious of a dollar and making the most of every opportunity is something that has never left my value system. So, when it comes to lead generation, I am all in for getting as much as I can for every dollar I spend …
 … Hence, why my lead generation BFF is Facebook Live. OK, this is supposed to be the free section, but it’s almost free, because with less than $5 spent, you can reach your exact target market and drive them to join your email list and/or buy your products, programs, and services. The best part is, there is no guess work required.


-----

###### Before you spend any money, you can post your Facebook Live for free to see if you get any kind of reaction from your target market, and only if you do, then you can promote it to your intended target market. (Love me some free market research.)
 Fantastically, there are a lot of uses for this type of post, too, such as:

 1. Promote your blog post topic, and include a link to get more readers
 of your content. 2. Share a tip from your “Juicy Carrot,” and include a link for opt-ins. 3. Give a strategy related to an affiliate offer, and include a link for opt ins. 4. Broadcast a preview of a webinar, seminar, or event, and give a link
 to register. 5. Interview a client, referral source, or thought leader, and share a link
 to learn more. 6. Livestream an event with a link to register for a future one or a link
 to buy the product, program, or service you are promoting.

 And that is just the start. All you need is a phone or computer to broadcast. No fancy-schmancy equipment or expensive software to buy. Unlike my shoe collection, this platform is cheap and fabulous (see Figure 7.6).
 Facebook Live is better than anything I’ve experienced in social media, ever. You can reach more people faster than anything else and for free or just a tiny bit of ad spend.

###### Instagram Hacks INSTA-LAUNCH I’ve tested a lot when it comes to Instagram. Many things didn’t work. But a few worked really, really well.
 In this section you’ll discover how to quickly score your first or next 1,000 Instagram followers and reach your target market so you can grow your list and scale your business.
 Why bother with Instagram? Instagram has over a billion people—more than NBC, CBS, FOX, and all the major networks combined.
 Plus 80% of all Instagram users say they purchased something because they discovered it on Instagram. So not only can you grow your massive following easily without spending money on ads, but you can get purchasers directly from this platform.
 You can take years growing your following. Or you can use the shortcuts I’ve discovered.
 I first found them because Entrepreneur Press, my publisher and the fabulous people behind this book, asked me to write a book on Instagram after the book you are reading now published and did well.
 At the time, I had only 352 Instagram followers. So, I told myself, “All right, well, if I’m going to put out a book about being an Instagram expert, I better get it together and become an Instagram expert. I’m going to have to study. I’m going to have to grow my Instagram account, and I’ve got to do it fast.”


-----

###### So, I tried a whole lot of stuff. I took a deep dive into research, I experimented, I took courses, I listened to podcasts. I did all the research for you, and I tested everything.
 Most of the stuff frankly did not work. It was a bunch of hogwash— people making stuff up, as gurus like to do on the internet. They rent a Ferrari, stand in front of it for a few minutes, and then tell us some hack that doesn’t work.
 But there were several techniques that worked incredibly well, and in less than one year, I went from 352 followers to over 10,000.
 The following are the exact strategies you can use to quickly grow your Instagram following:

 HASHTAGS The number-one thing to start with is hashtags. Hashtags are how people find information that they’re looking for, kind of like little file folders inside of Instagram.
 Let’s say I’m planning a trip to Disney, and I’m going to stay at the Grand Floridian. I might search Instagram for “#Disney,” or “#GrandFloridian” and see posts with information about the Grand Floridian (see Figure 7.7).

**FIGURE 7.7: #GrandFloridian Instagram Posts**


-----

###### Or, let’s say I’m trying to find tax hacks. I could type in “#taxdeductions” (see Figure 7.8). Or, let’s say I love me some sushi; I might search “#sushi.” One that I actually follow is called Rooftop Bars, “#rooftopbars,” which features pictures from different fabulous rooftop bars all around the world (see Figure 7.9 on page 109).

**FIGURE 7.8: #taxdeductions Instagram Posts**


-----

###### I love to get myself a drink with a great view when I’m traveling, or I can do so virtually on any day.
 Hashtags are how people who are looking for you can find you. They are everything. And you can organically grow your Instagram following without spending a bunch of money on advertising.

**FIGURE 7.9: #rooftopbars Instagram Posts**


-----

###### Which hashtag should you use in your post to get the best results? There are several hashtag directories you can use. According to Influencer Marketing Hub, the 25 most popular hashtags are:

 1. #love 2. #instagood 3. #photooftheday 4. #fashion 5. #beautiful 6. #happy 7. #cute 8. #tbt 9. #like4like 10. #followme


-----

###### 11. #picoftheday 12. #follow 13. #me 14. #selfie 15. #summer 16. #art 17. #instadaily 18. #friends 19. #repost 20. #nature 21. #girl 22. #fun 23. #style 24. #smile 25. #food

 However, remember that very popular hashtags may not be very effective, because you’re just one in a sea of noise. You won’t have a very specific audience.
 Instead, go after your niche to attract your perfect prospect. It’s the difference between generic #work and specific #momboss. Or even more specific with #fitmomboss.
 In this narrower niche you could accurately target women who are moms, who own their own company, and who are into fitness. The more specific you get, the more likely your message will resonate with your target market.
 But how do you figure out which hashtag to use? It’s really super simple.
 Find ten people with at least 10,000 followers in your niche on Instagram. They may not do the exact same thing that you do. (Because you may be thinking, “No one does what I do.”) And that’s cool. I mean, you are unique. You’re created with a purpose. But there are other people who serve the same niche you do. So, find them.
 Maybe you serve small businesses, or people who are going through a divorce, or who are seeking fitness. Whatever it is, find similar businesses (that may or may not be similar to you) that serve the same market. That’s


-----

###### all that’s important. It doesn’t matter what they do. What matters is that they serve the same people as you.
 Next, check what hashtags they are using. Make a list of them, because those are what you’re going to use to test in your own posts.
 For example, in my niche I might check out Russell Brunson. (I’m not saying that I’ve ever done this, but I do this all the time.) On his posts are hashtags like #socialmediamarketing, #businessrefined, and #marketinglife.
 The easiest way to keep track of hashtags and use them in posts is to keep a list in the notes section of your phone—so you can copy and paste when needed. Then just keep testing different hashtags to see which ones give you the best reach.
 It is important to know that you can include up to 30 hashtags in a post. Test how many work best for you, but I’ve found around 15 is the sweet spot to include without it impacting reach.
 Nonetheless … test, test, test.

 INSTA-STORIES Insta-Stories have become the most popular part of Instagram. While you can include a link to whatever you like once you have more than 10,000 followers, anyone can use stories from the start.
 Getting 10,000 followers is a good reach goal because linking to your next webinar, Juicy Carrot, or live event is free lead generation. But until then, keep using Insta-stories.
 Here’s how to use Instagram Stories:

 1. Click on the camera icon in the top left or the ‘+’ on your profile
 picture, or simply swipe right and click on the camera icon. 2. Tap the white circle in the middle to take a picture, hold it for a
 video, or tap the gallery icon in the left corner (or just swipe up) to use existing media on your phone. (More options for Instagram below.) 3. Edit your photo or video and get it just the way you like it using
 Instagram’s various editing options with the ability to add hashtags and text to the image. (Have fun exploring.) 4. Tap the « Your Story » button to post publicly.


-----

###### 5. You can also save it to your phone to download and use later for
 another purpose.

 Important to note … Unlike the dimensions for standard square Instagram posts, stories are shot vertically. Your photos and videos should be sized accordingly, at 1080 pixels wide by 1920 pixels tall. Thankfully, you can resize your images and videos right inside of Instagram by pinching the image on screen.
 If you post more than one story in a 24-hour period—which on Instagram is quite welcome—anything added to your camera roll should show when you swipe up in the stories camera view.
 With stories, you can do a bunch of things like…
