of consultative-based sale (e.g., look over the home to be

 remodeled or assess their current financial situation), it’s wise

 to get the ball rolling with an appropriate lead generation

 offer of a free report or DVD or audio.
 Don’t ignore this strategy if your business does NOT require

 a consultation. Remember, you have skepticism to overcome

 with almost every kind of sale, whether it’s for something

 relatively simple like a garden shed for the backyard or a

 standard service like a plumber or carpenter may offer. Just about EVERY kind of business can do lead generation with this

 approach.

 For example, if you sell garden sheds, you could offer a free

 DVD showing the many different ways a simple garden shed can be used to make your life more practical or fun. If you

 offer carpentry services, you could offer a report laying out

 “Seven Easy Ways to Save Serious Money When You Have to

 Fix Your Deck.”

 We call th
is report or DVD or whatever a Lead Generation Magnet and I’ll go into more detail in an upcoming chapter.

 CONSULTATION OFFERS

-----

###### It’s important to understand the lead generation offer as it

 could very well be a foreign concept to you. However, the

 consultation offer is probably already familiar. Indeed, it could

 be the basic kind of offer you’re making right now in your

 business, especially if you’re in some kind of professional service industry like dentistry,
 legal services, financial

 planning, and yes, even copywriting.

 The point of a consultation offer is to compel the prospect

 to meet—either face to face in person or over the phone or

 the internet—to discuss their specific situation as it relates to your business.

 Again, do not underestimate how hard it can be to get

 someone—who may or may not know you—to drop

 everything and commit to this kind of meeting. You can couch

 this in all kinds of friendly terms like “free” and “no obligation” and what have you, but the bottom line is, they

 know deep down there’s going to be a sales pitch in there

 somewhere. The
 y are deciding whether they want to give

 you an hour in their day to find out IF you are everything you say you will be. They need to trade an hour that could be

 spent making dinner, meeting with a new client, watching

 their child’s soccer game, or even just the hour that they

 planned to spend reading a book to meet with you.

 So you need to p
 rovide compelling copy that clearly explains the benefits (to them—not you), clearly articulates

 how easy
and low-impact this meeting will be.
Talking about

 the transformation that will take place AFTER they finish the

 meeting with you. Here’s where my earlier points about

 “emotional copywriting” come into play. You’re painting a

-----

###### picture of how their life is lacking something now, but when

 they finish with you, all will be right with the world.

 And at the end of your meeting—or at any other point in

 the marketing process, it depends on your business model and how you close the deal on your goods and services—you

 present the offer to purchase what it is you have to sell.

 DIRECT PURCHASE OR FINAL OFFER

 Here’s where you present the widget and ask for the sale.
 The direct purchase offer you’re likely most familiar with is

 a straight coupon offer—either from a Valpak mailing or

 online from Groupon or the like. Now, I’m not a champion of

 simply offering discounts as a strategy, but this is definitely one option.

 Another common direct purchase offer, in place of or in

 combination with discounting, is gift with purchase where you

 toss in one or more bonuses.

 And as we discussed earlier, when describing how to create widgets, there’s other things you could integrate to make this

 more appealing and to drive urgency.

 It’s important to note that the direct purchase offer is the

 model used by most businesses—they go right for the sale,

 because they don’t do any of the lead generation and—even worse—fail to follow up if the initial offer doesn’t get

 accepted.

 In the
Magnetic Marketing System
, you can go directly for

 the sale—and in many cases it’s the right thing to do. But we

 don’t leave that as your only option. You can, instead, work your way through the sales process with multiple steps,

-----

###### starting with lead generation, moving on to consultation, and

 then finally closing the deal with your final offer.

 MEDIA

 So we’ve got a great message, we’ve got a great market.

 Here’s the next challenge.

 How do you take the message you so lovingly crafted and birthed, and deliver it
 via the right MEDIA to these people

 you’ve carefully selected, in a way that’s effective, efficient,

 and
affordable? How will it magnetically attract back to you

 the perfect prospects who are ready, able and eager to buy

 and buy only from you, so you get to sell in a competitive vacuum?

 How do you do that?

 It’s incredibly challenging, even for business owners who are

 far more technologically astute than
 I. The laundry list of

 media options available changes practically with every breath

 you take. There’s no possible way anyone could keep up.

 So how do you choose? Once you know your WHO, it’s easy.

 Where they live is where you target.

 I know—you’ve been told to be EVERYWHERE for EVERYBODY.

 Instead, you go everywhere ONLY where your WHO is.

 If they’re on Facebook (and Facebook has amazing

 capabilities to segment, divide, and conquer) then you go to Facebook.

-----

###### If they’re subscribers to a highly focused, niche

 magazine that’s eagerly awaited every month by a dedicated fan base, then you go there.

 If they’re hard-core conservatives who plan their day around talk radio, then you go there.

 You do NOT go where they’re NOT. It’s not only unnecessary,

 it’s a waste of time, energy, and money. You go where they

 ARE instead.
 If you make a list, and if you stop to think about it,

 whatever business you’re in, whatever sales career you’re in,

 you can make a long list of media—things that you can spend

 money on to deliver marketing messages.

 These days, everyone is infatuated with the Internet—and the systems that we teach work brilliantly online. But the

 Internet is not a business. It is a media, and it is not the only

 media.

 So, while going online is one option, another option is to use traditional print advertising. This could mean direct mail,

 Valpak, Free Standing Inserts, Yellow Pages or displaying ads

 in newspapers or local periodicals.

 You can go exhibit at home and consumer shows or trade

 shows. You can go on radio and television. You can put telemarketers on the phone. On and on and on and on.

 The reality is, you should use a combination of all of the

 different media—in fact, a combination of online and offline.

 Here’s a couple things you need to know.

 First of all, all that stuff works, and it all can be made to work better with good, direct response methods.

-----

###### But only a handful of all those things that you can do can be converted into a system. And SYSTEM’s one of my favorite

 words. System means reliable, consistent, and predictable

 results.

 You get it working once and then it keeps working on its own for a long, long, long, long, long time before you have to

 tweak it again.

 We need marketing systems.

 And over the next few chapters, I’m going to lay out for you

 a marketing system that is so predictable, so reliable, and so consistent, that when this is working for you, you go to bed at

 night knowing—not hoping, wishing, or praying, but knowing

 —within a small, acceptable range of variance, how many

 good prospects, customers or clients are going to come to

 you by noon the next day, every single day, for as long as you use the system.

 It’s like a thermometer. You can turn it up or down to get

 more or less any time of the week, month or year that you

 want them. It’s that scientific.
 But there are some rules you must follow…

### CHAPTER 6
#### THE 10 FOUNDATIONAL RULES

-----

###### I spend a good portion of my book,
The No B.S. Guide to

 Direct Marketing,
 laying out the ironclad rules that will

 transform any business into an infinitely more powerful direct

 marketing business. These also are the foundational rules that govern Magnetic Marketing
.

 Note that these are NOT “recommendations”—consider

 them mandates. Gospel. Etchings in stone brought down at

 great peril from the mountain. Please copy them down and

 post them anywhere and everywhere you work so that they will remain front and center of all marketing efforts from this

 day forward.

 Resolve now that every ad you run, every flyer you

 distribute, every postcard or letter you mail, every website

 you put up, everything and anything you do to market your business MUST adhere to these rules.

 Yes, they are simplistic, dogmatic, and you will undoubtedly

 encounter specific situations where you find there truly is a

 rational reason to violate one or more.
 But for now, sticking to them rigidly is the right approach,

 the best approach, and the approach that you can be sure of

 that will work. You can experiment later after you have gained

 practical experience in their use and have fully exorcised the

 demons of “brand advertising” from your mindset and your business.

#### RULE #1—THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
 AN OFFER OR OFFERS

-----

###### Number one, there will always be an offer or offers. On the

 internet especially, there’s a popular idea that content is king.

 I would disagree. The sale is king.
 All your marketing needs to have is an offer telling your

 ideal prospects exactly what to do and why they want to do it

 right now. It should be irresistible and time sensitive and give

 them some kind of transformative value if they take action.

 This is not just an implied offer like a store running ads, “We’re here, come on in.” This should not be a common

 offer like, “The Sale of the Century. This Weekend

 Only.”
Instead, ideally, yours is a Godfather’s offer—an offer

 so big, so bold, so perfectly targeted to the WHO you’ve identified as your slam-dunk customer that it is impossible to

 refuse.

 Now, this offer could be to generate a lead (with some sort

 of “lead generation magnet” like a free report, video, etc.) or

 to actually make the sale at that time. Needless to say, a great deal of thought needs to go into your offer as we

 explained in the previous chapter.

 Regardless of the nature of the offer itself, the point is to

 make certain that every communication actually asks

 somebody to do something. Focusing on this injects a new level of discipline into all of your communications with

 prospects, customers, and the marketplace at large.

 This rule should open your eyes to the sad reality that the

 vast majority of advertising presented merely shows up and

 talks about the marketplace, the advertiser, the wind, sun, and the rain, social values, what have you without any kind of

 reference to something specific to be had by immediately

-----

###### responding. In essence, the blimp passes by once again,

 fading into the sunset, leaving no trace behind. Nothing to track, nothing to measure, nothing to score. Money flies off

 with the wind.

 When you take this kind of undisciplined approach to your

 marketing and simply spend and hope and guess, you’re at

 the mercy of relying on opinion as to its effect—do you like it? Did your mother-in-law think it was humorous and expel a

 chuckle? Do your customers say nice things about it? Try

 paying your bills with that kind of feedback.

#### RULE #2—THERE WILL BE A REASON TO RESPOND RIGHT NOW

###### The hidden cost and failure in all advertising and marketing

 are in the “almost persuaded.”

 They were tempted to respond. They nearly responded.

 They got right up to the edge of response, but they set it

 aside to do it later or to mull over or to check out other options.

 When they get to that edge, we must reach across and

 drag them past it. There must be a good reason for them not

 to stop short or delay or ponder, there must be urgency.
 Remember, hesitation and procrastination are among the

 most common of human behaviors. Your prospect doesn’t

 want to move, period. Just like Homer Simpson, the last thing

 he wants is put down the donut, get off the couch, and

 actually do something. Hence, you must provide a compelling reason to act and NOW.

-----

###### There are plenty of ways to add URGENCY:

 tie the offer to a hard and fast deadline

 restrict the offer to a limited number of customers

 remove the bonus or gift from the deal if they don’t act right away

 add an element of “bidding” to the deal, a la eBay

 Those are just a few ideas; open your eyes to the world of

 experienced direct marketers out there and I’m confident

 you’ll discover many more. Regardless, make sure to give a

 reason to act NOW.

#### RULE #3—YOU WILL GIVE CLEAR
 INSTRUCTIONS

###### Most people do a reasonably good job at following directions.

 For the most part, they stop on red and go on green; stand

 in the lines they’re told to stand in; fill out the forms they’re

 given to fill out and applaud when the applause sign comes on.

 Most people are conditioned from infancy in every

 environment to do as they are told. Marketers’ failures and

 disappointments often result from giving confusing directions,

 or no directions at all and confused or uncertain consumers do nothing.

 People rarely buy anything of consequence without being

 asked. You must walk your prospect through the steps you

 want them to take in order to make the sale.

-----

###### This is far more important than you might imagine. Take to

 heart the old rule: “A confused buyer—WON’T buy!” Anxiety

 rises anytime you ask someone to do something that they’re

 unsure of what to expect or how to carry out.
 Therefore, whenever you put together any kind of

 marketing tool, ad, flyer, sales letter, website, phone script,

 etc. make sure to examine it from the perspective of an

 unsuspecting customer/prospect encountering it for the very

 first time.
 Consumers like, are reassured by, and respond to clarity. Be

 sure
you provide it.

#### RULE #4—THERE WILL BE TRACKING, MEASUREMENT, AND
 ACCOUNTABILITY

###### If you want real profits from your marketing, you are no

 longer going to permit any advertising, marketing or selling

 investments to be made without directing accurate tracking, measurement and accountability.

 Forget about likes, links, opens, shares, reach, visibility,

 views, and engagement—they can’t be deposited in your

 bank account. All of that may be interesting, even indicative, but what matters is that for every dollar you spend, you can

 clearly identify how much comes back as a result.

 This is for two reasons,

 1. Business management by objectives is the only kind
 of management that actually works.

-----

###### 2. You need real, hard facts and data to make good,

 intelligent marketing decisions.

 If you loop back and connect this to Rule #1, you’ll find an

 important key in tracking—offers. Different offers can be

 made in different media, to different lists, and at different

 times. You can include and assign promotion codes to

 coupons, reply cards, websites, order forms, phone numbers, and so forth. With this data, you can determine which offers

 and variations of offers work best to which lists under what

 conditions.

 Tough-minded management of marketing requires knowing

 things and then acting wisely upon what you know.

#### RULE #5—ONLY NO-COST BRAND
 BUILDING

###### I am not opposed to brand-building.

 I am opposed to paying
for brand-building

 Most small business owners cannot afford to properly invest in brand-building. I do not believe it is a wise investment for

 small business owners and entrepreneurs, nor do I believe it

 is even necessary. You can acquire all the brand power you

 need as a no-cost byproduct of profitable direct response

 advertising and marketing as described in this book.
 My preferred strategy is simple: buy response, gratefully

 accept brand-building as a bonus. NEVER buy brand-building

 and hope for response as a bonus, unless you simply want to

 spend Daddy’s fortune out of spite.

-----

###### Paying for traditional brand-building may be fine, even

 essential for giant companies with giant budgets engaged in a fierce combat over shelf space and consumer recognition.

 So if you’re Coors or Heinz or some other company like that,

 feel free to play with the shareholders’ money to buy name

 recognition. But if you’re an entrepreneur playing with your

 own marbles, beware because copying what the big companies do to build their brands can bankrupt you.

 Even though held in high regard by media companies and

 advertising agencies alike, “brand” is not the holy grail

 magically able to cure all your business woes. Brand-building is best left to very patient marketers with very deep pockets

 filled with other people’s money. You are far better served by

 focusing on leads, customers, sales, and profits directly

 driven by your marketing system.

#### RULE #6—THERE WILL BE FOLLOW
 UP

###### People read your ad, get your letter, see your sign, find you

 online, etc.

 They call or visit your website or place of business.

 They ask your receptionist or staff questions. And sadly, in far too many cases, that’s it.

 There’s not even the slightest attempt to capture the

 prospect’s name, physical address, or email address. There’s

 no offer to immediately send an information package, free

 report, or coupons.
