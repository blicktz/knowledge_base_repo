_y business—(lie_ information business, as well as busi-l^xl
nesses such as weight loss, diet, and financial advisory J"
services—revolves around the public's stubborn
belief that there must be a "secret" to success, concealed from
them, possibly by conspiracy, that if uncovered, would change
everything. This concept can be useful to remember if you work
in advertising, marketing, and selling, but it is a useless, even
harmful, delusion otherwise. With regard to time, I promise you,
there's no secret magic pill you don't know about. And no new,
whiz-bang, computerized doohickey or color-coded appointment book is going to change everything.

In business, there are good strategies poorly executed, poor ir.itegies

executed well, but rarely is there a truly new, revolu-tionary
strategy. In this chapter are ten good strategies. Nothing e.irth-shaking,

nothing revolutionary, probably nothing you
don't already know. The issue is execution, not innovation.

The "joke" in the weight-loss industry, where I find myself doing

marketing consulting from time to time, is this: if there
were a diet that worked, there'd only be one diet. Similarly, you l

< >uld reasonably argue that if there was one time management
system that worked perfectly for everybody, there'd be only one
system. The good news is that, in a way, there IS just one time
management "system," and it's all here in this chapter.

If you read every time management book ever written, go to
every time management seminar offered, and, more importantly,
observe and analyze lots of people who get an exceptional quantity of important things accomplished, you will be able to boil
ALL the technique "stuff" down to only ten things worth doing.
So, let me save you all that time and just hand them to you here.
I'll note, too, that all ten might not apply to you and your situations. When it's all said and done, you sort of have to find your
own way.

###### Technique #1: Tame the Phone
As I discussed in detail elsewhere in this book, you've got to free
yourself from the tyranny of the phone. And the fax. And e-mail.
And similar stuff. Take few if any incoming calls. Return your
calls at your convenience. As this is the number-one source of
disruption and distraction for most people, you must get a firm
grip on this technique.

###### Technique #2: Minimize Meetings
Find every way possible to minimize your time spent in formal
meetings. Most meetings end where they begin anyway.

**I deal with one company where literally every time I call,**
anyone I call is always "in a meeting." The company has six conference rooms—a very bad sign. If Noah had convened a meeting of architects, interior decorators, goat and sheep herders, lion
tamers, navigators, we would all have fins. Nothing ever got
done in a meeting. I hate 'em.
For a lot of people, meetings are a place to hide out. Or preen
and be important. But not a place to actually do work or get anything done. You need a strategy to avoid them. If you lead meetings, you need a strategy to abbreviate and focus them. If you
must attend meetings, you need a strategy to escape from them
at will.

O h, and here's a "little tip" that saves me quite

a bit of time: stop meeting people at restaurants for

lunch or drinks, or whatever. Four out of five times,

they'll keep you waiting. For years, when I spent time

at an office, if I was going to lunch with somebody, I

had them first come to my office, then we would go

from there. Then, when they were 20 minutes late, I got

to do 20 minutes of real work. If you must go to such

an "off-site" meeting place, have something to read or

some work to do with you.

###### Technique #3: Practice Absolute Punctuality
See Chapter 4.

###### Technique #4: Make and Use Lists
There is not a single time management discipline or system on
earth that doesn't revolve around making and using lists. You
CANNOT carry it all in your head. For years, I've operated with
four basic lists:

1. My Schedule. This is for the entire year, day by day.
_2. Things to Do List. My basic "Things to Do" list is organized_
by the month, the week, and each day, prioritized as A's,
B's, and C's. Management consultant (and "hustler") Ivy
Lee reportedly sold this idea to billionaire industrialist
Andrew Carnegie's right-hand man, Charles Schwab, for
$25,000.00. It worked for Schwab. It works for just about
everybody who uses it now.
3. People to Call List. My third list is a "People to Call" list,
also prioritized alphabetically.
4. Conference Planner. And finally, I have the "Conference Planner"—just

a page for each person I interact with a lot,
where I jot down things I need to talk to them about as
they occur to me in between meetings or conversations.

To be perfectly honest, I do this with a yellow legal pad and
pages I most often carry folded up in my pocket. And I'll admit
that this is not exactly a shining example for a time management
"leader" to set, but I've found that this works just as well for me
as a number of different, more organized and formal systems I've
tried. Over the years, I've experimented with the Day-Timer and

if you are a "free spirit," you might

think something like these lists to be intolerably confin
ing, like a pair of jockey shorts mistakenly bought one

size too small. (What?—like I'm the only one to ever

make that mistake.) Actually, once you get used to using

these lists, you'll find them mentally, creatively liberating.

Why? Because the more details you get on paper, the

fewer you must remember and worry about remember
ing. This frees your mind up for more important tasks.

several other systems, even one I designed myself. Anyway, the
"magic" is more in the making and using the lists than in the particular tool, media, or format you use.

I also use a "storyboard" for planning, somewhat like the
storyboard used to plan a TV program or movie. My speaking
colleague Mike Vance, author of Think Outside the Box, teaches
this method. As I've had Mike speak twice to my Inner Circle
Members in past years, quite a few of my Members and clients
have learned this and use it, reporting great results.

I'm usually amused by people dependent on their Palm Pilot
devices and laptops for their schedules, plans, and lists. On more
than one occasion, I've heard them wailing about the machine
gleefully erasing everything and leaving them with a blank
screen. Or watched their batteries go dead. So far, the tri-folded
pages in my jacket pocket and pen have not failed me.

Ultimately, though, whether with crayon and pad or computer, you have got to get some sort of regimented, regularly

list-making system working for you. If you aren't making
lists, you probably aren't making a lot of money either.

###### Technique #5: Fight to Link Everything to Your Goals

**(The secret reason why there aren't more millionaires) My**
speaking colleague Jim Rohn often says that the only real rea-(in
more people do not become millionaires is that they don't
have enough reasons to. It's certainly not lack of opportunity! 100k

around. You can't pick up a magazine without reading of
people who've taken very ordinary ideas, even weird ideas, and
used them to become rich. You can't pick up a magazine and not
read of someone who has scrambled up out of poor circumstances and gotten rich. So why don't more people become mil-lionaires?

They just don't have enough reasons to.
Similarly, I insist that the only real reason more people aren't much,

much more productive is that they don't have enough reasons to. So, a secret to greater personal productivity is more good
reasons to be more productive. That's why you have to fight to link

everything you do (and choose not to do) to your goals.
Frankly, this is very difficult. You've undoubtedly heard the
adage: when you're up to your neck in alligators, it's difficult to
remember that your original objective was to drain the swamp.
And, having been up to my neck in alligator-filled swamp water
more often than I like to remember, I know just how tough it is to
keep at least one eye fixed firmly on your list of goals. But that's
EVERYTHING. That is what gets goals achieved. And that is
what creates peak productivity, as I'll explain.

In the 1980s, "productivity" was a big, big buzzword. There
were all sorts of folks running around teaching businesses
and businesspeople every conceivable gimmick for improving

ever defining or (I contend) knowing what
the heck productivity was. For corporations, there was regurgitated Demingism, Japanese management styles, MBO, MBV,
and on and on. All in search of an invisible, ill-defined intangible.

If you're going to achieve peak personal productivity, you've
got to define peak personal productivity.

Here's an old joke: the wife prevails upon her husband, an
avid hunter, to take her along on the annual deer hunting trip, so
she can finally see what all the fuss is about. To keep her out of
harm's way, he stations her at the bottom of a hill and instructs
her to shoot her gun into the air as a signal if she spots deer. Then
he and the other guys head off through the woods, toward the
creek, where deer are likely to be found. About ten minutes later,
they hear not one but four quick shots. They race back to the hill,
where the wife is standing, pointing her rifle at a fellow standing
next to a fallen, dead horse. The guy is saying, "OK lady, it's your
deer. But at least let me get my saddle."

If you don't know what peak personal productivity looks
like, how are you gonna hit it?

So, here's my definition:
Note that this definition presupposes the existence of meaningful goals. I don't know of a single successful individual, in productivity

**is the deliberate, strategic investment**
**of your time, talent, intelligence, energy, resources,**
**and opportunities in a manner calculated to move you**
**measurably closer to meaningful goals.**

field, who isn't goal-directed, and who is not involved in measuring,

preferably daily, movement toward those goals. Paul Meyer,
founder of Success Motivation Institute, once stated that, 11
you are not achieving what you feel you should in life, it is because

your goals are not defined well enough. But my defini-tion
of productivity goes beyond that. It says that you cannot be productive

without goals, in fact, without linkage with goals. It says
you cannot be productive without measurement.
This gives you a very simple standard for determining, minute

by minute, task by task, choice by choice, whether you .ire
being productive or unproductive:

Is what I am doing, _this minute, moving me measurably_
_closer to my goals?_

Now, to be reasonable, and to be human, let's cheerfully
acknowledge that nobody can—or should—be able to say "yes"
to that question all of the time. We need, want, and deserve time
for casual conversation, for baseball scores, for political arguments, for reading the comics, for just plain goofing off. But you
want to do those things knowingly, consciously, by choice, not by
random accident or others' direction.

I'd say that anything beyond a 50% "yes rate" qualifies as
peak personal productivity. Incidentally, measurement alone will
enhance your productivity. Just asking the question will enhance
your productivity. Any athlete will tell you that measurement
alone improves performance.

###### Technique #6: Tickle the Memory with Tickler Files
I've got a memory like a steel trap. A rusted steel trap. Seems a
lot seeps out through those rust holes. For example, I seem to

have mental blocks about how old people are (the ONLY person's age I know is mine), birthdays, anniversaries, holidays,
peoples' names. With this in mind, I wrote a country-western
song: I Love My Wife But I Can't Remember Where I Live. Perversely,
**I can perfectly recall the lyrics from 20-year-old songs, obscure**
actors' names, and a collection of other useless trivia. If I could
remember to phrase it as a question, I'd go on Jeopardy! and get
rich. Seriously, I need tools and systems to substitute for memory.
The Tickler File is one of my favorites.

The more I use this technique, the better I like it, although it
does work much better for someone who gets to his desk everyday than for someone as mobile as I. The idea is simple: you have
90 file folders: numbered 1 through 30; blue numbered 1 through
30; and white 1 through 30 representing the current month, next
month and the month after that. This is most commonly used by
accountant-type folks, to keep track of bills to be paid. (We use it
for that purpose in our office.) But it can be used for anything.
Let's assume you agree to follow up with a client on a particular
matter on the tenth of next month. Take either that client's whole
file or just that piece of correspondence or just a handwritten
note and plop it into the Blue file folder numbered 10. And forget it. On the 10th of next month, it'll pop up all by itself and
remind you to do it. Used right, these Tickler Files reduce clutter,
serve as automatic memory, and help organize daily activities.

Yes, I know there are all sorts of "contact management programs" for desktop and laptop computers that do this same
thing, and if you want to go that way, by all means, be my guest.
For me, though, this would be one of those examples of using
technology just because the technology exists, not because it's
better. Running my Tickler Files on my laptop would require me

**to input** or scan in stuff needlessly, and it still wouldn't accom-modate
the "lumpy stuff," like a whole client file or a 56-page mtomercial

proposal or, well, you get the idea. But whether you
choose manual or automated, this is a very good technique.

###### Technique #7: Block Your Time Mere
is one of the real, hidden secrets of people who consistently achieve

peak productivity: make inviolate appointments with
yourself. You know, we all do a pretty good job at keeping the
appointments we make with others. We have this skill down. So,
why not use it to get things done?

I am completing this book in December. As of the writing of
this edition of this book, my calendar for next year has nine days
assigned to doing tele-coaching sessions with 45 Gold /VIP
Members, 22 days to mastermind meetings with VIP and
Platinum groups, eight travel days related to those meetings, five
speaking engagement days, three travel days for those, and ten
days of pre-arranged vacations. That's 57 of 365 blocked. Then
there are holidays, a couple of birthdays, Super Bowl Sunday,
that sort of thing, another ten. Only 298 days remain available.
But that's still a lot of days to wander and meander around in.
The less wandering and meandering the better. The more time
gets blocked, the less room there is to aimlessly meander. So I
also go ahead and block out the times I'll record my monthly
tapes for Gold Members, the days I'll use to write my newsletter,
other reoccurring activities. On a week-to-week basis, I block the
morning hours when I write and the Monday and Wednesday
evenings when I drive in harness races. For the year, for the quarter immediately ahead, for the month ahead, and week ahead, I

try to leave as little "loose" or unassigned time as possible. Then
I treat the blocked times—even those that are work appointments
or play appointments with myself—just as inviolate as I do a
paid speaking gig or consulting day.
