 titles, well, the variables that have to be sorted out, tried, tested,
 and fit together to market each different information product prof-
 itably are almost endless.
  Ted Nicholas figures that only six out of fifteen of his ad-
 vertising campaigns for his information products have worked;
 nine out of every fifteen have failed. Gary Halbert says, ‘‘There’s
 probably no human alive who knows more about making mag-
 azine advertisements pay off than Ted Nicholas.’’ And I would
 agree. Yet, he fails nine out of fifteen times. What does that tell
 you?
  Sometimes you hit the home run at your very first at bat.
 Recently, a partner and I created a brand-new information prod-
 uct, a new, untested full-page ad, ran the ad in several magazines,
 and had an instant, huge success—pulling almost three times ad
 cost with the product being sold in the ad, plus about 20 percent
 of those customers turned right around and bought our much-
 higher-priced, even-more-profitable information product. The
 numbers are still holding up, and this little business is on track
 to produce about $500,000 this year. Several months before this,
 for a client with a new, unusual information product, I had cre-
 ated a full-page ad that hit right out of the gate and now runs in
 about twenty different magazines a month to the tune of over
 $100,000 a month in advertising investment.
   But, like Ted, I’ll confess that more of my product ideas flop
 than succeed, more of my ads die than live, more of my info-
 mercials bomb than score, and I’m wrong much more often than
 I’m right. And just about the time I start believing in my own
 genius, I confidently and optimistically give birth to a real
 clinker. Still, I have enough winners to more than make up for
 the losers, and that’s why stepping up to the plate with some
 patience, persistence, and staying power is important in this busi-
 ness. It really is true, in this business, that just one good idea
 can make you rich.

      From $100,000 in Credit Card Debt to a
      $200,000-a-Month Home-Based Business:
     How a Desperate but Determined Young Man
       Turned Failure into Success Virtually
             Overnight
     One of the all-time best success stories in this category that
    I know of is that of Jeff Paul. There’s always a student who
    surpasses the master, and I want to tell you about one of mine
    in detail, because his story includes an ideal model for anybody
    starting out in the information products business.
      Jeff had been very successful as a certified financial planner
    at attracting new clients, but, for a collection of reasons I won’t
    bore you with, he left the business and had no desire to return.
    But he knew he possessed valuable, important how-to infor-
    mation other financial planners would kill for. And Jeff was
    obsessed with the idea of creating a home-based mail-order busi-
    ness that would give him privacy, freedom, and a high income
    with minimal hassle. So he put the two together, wrote a mar-
    keting manual for financial planners, and attempted to sell it with
    ads in the trade journals read by financial advisers.
      Unfortunately, he failed miserably.
     Running ads, testing different ideas, fighting to get it right,
    Jeff managed to run up over $100,000 in debt on his credit cards.
    He moved his family in with his wife’s sister and lived in her
    basement. When he and his wife, Peggy, first came to my sem-
    inar, they viewed it as a last-ditch attempt at finding out what
    they were doing wrong before declaring bankruptcy. They
    couldn’t afford to join the other attendees in the restaurant; they
    snuck off to their room and ate peanut butter and crackers.
     Most people, of course, would have given up. You can feel
    free to argue in your own mind whether Jeff is incredibly stub-
    born and persistent or incredibly stupid. The one tiny glimmer
    of hope that had brought them to the seminar was that they were
    doing some business. That month, they had sold $1,090 worth

 (and weren’t) doing, it was obvious to me what needed to be
 done to turn his fledgling business into a winner. Now, I quickly
 want to disclaim genius, brilliance, or wizardry; it was just that
 I had already failed a whole lot more than Jeff had, and had lots
 of unsuccessful ‘experience and a little bit of successful experi-
 ence directly relevant to what he was attempting. So I gave them
 fifteen minutes of advice and sent them home. I’m going to let
 Jeff tell you the rest of the story in his own words:
   I’m writing this little contribution to Dan’s book sitting at
   my kitchen table in my boxer shorts and T-shirt, where I
   have made an average of over $4,000 a day for the last
   two years. That’s right: $4,000 a day. I have achieved the
    fantasy of making a ton of money from a home-based,
    easy, pleasant, information products business.
     Dan has told you that when I was trying to launch my
    business, I literally worked my family right smack into
    the proverbial poorhouse—actually living on a couch in a
    corner of my sister-in-law’s basement. Now here’s the
    unbelievable punch line: In just two years, I leaped from
    that basement to buying a $385,000 house with half
   down, no other debt whatsoever, money in the bank, a
    terrific daily income streaming in, and Peggy and I al-
    most single-handedly run this business.
     After we went home from Dan’s seminar and raced to
   implement the changes he suggested, our income ex-
   ploded like a fireworks display. Here are the numbers, ab-
    solutely verifiable by my bank deposits: in the next
   month, October, we took in $13,400, in November,
    $26,200, in December, [$49,800. ] [In ] [1992 ] [I ][took ] [in ] [over ]
   $1 million and I kept half as pure profit, after all my ex-
    penses. 1993 and 1994 have been even better.
     Let me briefly tell you what we were doing right, and
   what we fixed. First of all, having an information product
    solidly based on my credibility and track record, exclu-
    sively and specifically targeted to an enormous need and

       was trying io sell it in one step, with ads too small to get
        the job done, instead of using a multistep selling system
        that fit with my very limited resources and the nature of
       my product and market.
         I quickly developed a series of marketing steps, be-
       ginning with ads that did nothing more than prompt a
       phone call to a recorded message. I also took my single
       product, a manual, and took it apart, reconfigured it into
        an entire collection of products—manuals, reports, cas-
        settes, and forms. I started over again with an ad that cost
       just $138 and, by the third month, I took in over $50,000
       from just $2,200 of advertising. I’ve since mastered such
        strategies as the ‘‘triple hoop advertising method,’’ and
        ‘‘auto-pilot marketing,’’ and learned how to get two-
        thirds of my profits from continuing relationships and
       additional sales to satisfied customers.
         I became convinced that other people could learn and
        use my model to successfully sell just about any kind of
       information product, so I put it all down in a book titled
      How You Can Make $4,000 a Day, Sitting at Your
       Kitchen Table, in Your Underwear. Peggy hates the title.
       She says it’s bad enough that I do sit around the house in
       my underwear, why tell everybody about it? But I find
        that revealing these things about myself helps people be-
        lieve that they can do what I do. So we’re now selling
       thousands of these books at $29.95 each as a second
       business.
      If you read Jeff's story carefully, you were able to isolate a
    number of elements of a reliable, duplicatable formula for cre-
    ating and selling information products successfully. Let me point
    out a few of the most important ones:
     1. Having a sound basis for your information products. It is
      rarely a good idea to choose a subject area for products just
     because you think it is hot or timely. It is usually a good idea

    . about, can consid-
  ered an expert in.
  . Having a properly selected target market. Selection of the
  target market is at least half the battle. It needs to be a market
  you can reach easily, efficiently, and affordably; for example,
  if everybody in the target group reads one or two particular
  magazines. It needs to be a ‘‘starving crowd,’’ a market that
  has demonstrated interest in and desire for the kind of infor-
  mation you intend to provide. It needs to be a market that
  has demonstrated responsiveness to direct-response advertis-
  ing. All this requires research, and I’ve suggested methods
  and sources in chapter 13.
   . Having a high enough price point to support necessary ad-
  vertising and marketing efforts. It is very difficult to make a
  profit by direct marketing a $19, $29, $39, or even $49 item
  these days. Personally, I would not undertake a campaign for
  anything priced below $99, and I’d prefer something priced
  higher. Jeff had to dissect his low-priced product, break it up
  into a number of separate products, and then reassemble those
  products into a new offer that had a much higher perceived
  value and commanded a much higher price (without a pro-
  portionately higher manufactured cost).
   . Having a multistep marketing strategy. Jeff has developed
  what he calls ‘‘triple hoop advertising’’: His prospects have
  to take three steps to prove their interest before he aggres-
  sively pursues them—they have to read his ads, call and listen
  to a lengthy recorded message, and record and leave their
  name and address. This describes the front end of his mar-
  keting system. The back end is made up of a timed sequence
  of sales letters and other mailings. While this is obviously
  more complicated than just running a one-step ad that asks
  for the order and makes the sale, this multistep approach is
  also much safer and reliable.
  . Having an auto-pilot orientation. By ‘‘auto-pilot marketing,”’
  Jeff means marketing processes that function by themselves
  without continuing physical labor. For example, collecting
  name and address information from prospects responding to

      If most of your business is auto-piloted, you have more free-
            - dom and less overhead to worry about. Jeff has really mas-
     ‘tered this business, and there is much to be learned by
     studying every little nuance of his operation. If you would
      like a copy of Jeff’s book, refer to chapter 13.
    6. Having or quickly developing a back-end business. The ma-
      jority of big profits will come from the second, third, fourth,
      fourteenth, and fortieth sale to the same customer (back-end
      business), not from selling one product to one new customer
      after another (front-end business). The big profits are only in
      the back end.
          Exploring New Frontiers in
            Information Products
      As you work. at developing back-end products, you'll be
    pushed into considering every possible media for packaging and
    delivering information. Three that tend to fascinate people the
    most are the much-ballyhooed 900 numbers, software, and
    newsletters.
               900 Nurshers
     You have undoubtedly become aware of 900 numbers, the
    pay-per-call industry. Callers to advertised 900 numbers are
    charged by the minute or the call, at a flat rate, to listen to the
    message or, in some cases, converse live with a person. The
    information product is that recording; there’s nothing to print,
    publish, manufacture, or fulfill. The long-distance carrier (AT&T,
    Sprint, MCI, etc.) and the service bureau that delivers your mes-
    sage for you through its equipment systems (capable of taking
    thousands of simultaneous incoming calls) each take a piece
    of the charges, but the biggest chunk of the charge revenue re-
    verts to you, usually paid to you by the telephone company. The

```

```
AT&T is appealing, isn’t it?
  Unfortunately, the truth is that the overwhelming majority of
successful, profitable uses of 900 numbers is limited to a very small
number of businesses or products you might not want to be in-
volved with, notably featuring hard-core sexual conversation
(phone sex), soft-core conversation (confessions, chat lines, date
lines), gambling tips, and psychic counseling. Once you go beyond
those products, and uses by big nonprofit organizations as a means
of collecting donations, the pickings get pretty slim for legitimate
success stories.
  There are also problems with message and advertising approv-
als from the long-distance carrier, and an even bigger problem with
chargebacks: customers who do not want to pay their bill need only
notify the phone company and they are let off the hook. They are al-
ways right, you are always wrong, and that’s that. And this is a
highly scrutinized, highly regulated business with frequently
changing rules and regulations. Certain demographic groups, no-
tably fifty years of age and older, are very reluctant to call a 900
number. Many companies, hotels, and other places have their
phones blocked so that a call cannot be made to a 900 number. And
all government offices have such phone blocks, the result of Pen-
tagon employees running up huge phone bills calling 1-900-WHIP-
MEE and similar lines. Some media refuse all advertisements
including.a 900 number. So there are a great many obstacles to deal
with. ;
  With all that said, however, there are successes. And enterpris-
ing, creative marketers are continually finding new and different
ways to use 900 numbers profitably, either as a business or as a
means of offsetting advertising costs in acquiring leads or custom-
ers. Infotext magazine (see chapter 13) regularly reports on these
businesses. If you’re interested in what works and what doesn’t,
you should subscribe to Infotext, and review a couple of years of
back issues.
  Personally, I have experimented with 900 numbers for several
different purposes, mostly with unsuccessful results, and, in the
few cases where I experienced success, it was not significant

    subsidized media. Since advertising is virtually your only ex-
    pense, cutting that to the bone can make 900-number profits even
    from unsatisfactory response. If you are putting out a newsletter
    or magazine, distributing other information products, shipping
    packages, or mailing catalogs in sufficient quantity, add a 900-
    number advertisement with no added cost, or joint venture with
    someone who can provide that media, so that you get to promote
    the line with zero expense, and every call represents profit. Many
    newspapers and magazines at least experiment with, and some
    run ads with, 900 numbers for this reason.
      Another way to profit from 900 numbers (or 800 numbers) is
    by providing tele-services to your established customers. By serv-
    ing established customers only, you minimize the nonpayment
    problems and the costs of advertising and marketing the service.
    You might have a frequently or regularly updated hotline of
    timely information your customers can call. You might hold tele-
    seminars or conference calls/discussions that customers pay to
    dial into and participate in. These can be done through a 900 num-
    ber, at a set charge per minute or per call, billed on their regular
    phone bills, or via an 800 number, where they pay by credit card.
        Information Products for the Computer Age
      Software is an increasingly popular addition to information
    products. Entrepreneur magazine now sells computer diskettes
    with many of its business start-up manuals. Products like legal
    forms kits, business letter collections, and time management sys-
    tems are sold with diskettes or the diskettes are sold alone. My
    client Larry Pino advertises and sells a product called The Desk-
    top Lawyer, which is an entire collection of fill-in-the-blank con-
    tracts, agreements, forms, and form letters, all on diskettes.
      Jeff Paul sells diskettes with the ads, direct-mail letters, and
    other literature he teaches his financial planner—customers to use,
    so they can pull those marketing documents up on their com-
    puters, make minor changes, and create their own literature in-

longs on diskette, and will be welcomed in that format by your
customers.
  Diskettes offer markups as good as or better than any other
information product media, by the way. A diskette costing thirty
cents to no more than a dollar to reproduce will sell for $19.95
to $200 or $300, depending on the content, use, and market.
  Most recently, CD-ROM discs are becoming hot information
products. There is a starving market; people with CD-ROM play-
ers are really hungry for more product, and seem to be buying
discs on just about anything and everything. (A CD-ROM disc
all about taking African safaris sold over 30,000 copies!) The
reason there is such a shortage of product in this category is the
barrier to entry. It has cost $100,000 to $200,000 to produce
the master for duplicating these discs. Several entrepreneurs I
know claim to have come up with do-it-yourself production tech-
nology that dramatically reduces that cost and is likely to spur
an explosion of individuals self-publishing in the CD-ROM busi-
ness in the next few years. I’ve included their information in
chapter 13.
    The Information Product That Provides
         Financial Security
  Newsletters are, in my mind, increasingly attractive infor-
mation products. Desktop publishing programs for personal com-
puters and high-speed copying has made the production of
newsletters easy and inexpensive. Including all costs, even post-
age, with a contribution to overhead, you can usually service a
subscriber for $1 to no more than $2 per month; $12 to $24 per
year. Even a low-priced newsletter, say $49 a year, offers as
much as a 400 percent markup. And specialized-topic business
newsletters can command $100 to $200 a year.
  Publishing a newsletter keeps you in constant contact with
your customers, at their expense instead of yours. Newsletters
provide a great venue for self-promotion, advertising other prod-
