The answer is: It depends. If your audience is the general public, for consumer products or services, a weekend might be best as this audience has more flexibility with their schedule than during the week. If your audience is from the corporate world, doing your event on a weekend may not be the smart play because they want to use their time for family, social activities, and recreation. If your audience is from the small-business community, you have to try to find the day or evening that they can be away from their business with the least difficulty. I’ve found that a lot of chiropractors take Thursdays off but are open on Saturdays, so doing a seminar for them on Thursday might be best. Dan Kennedy had a company for several years that put over 20,000 chiropractors and dentists into preview seminars all over the U.S. and Canada, and he used evenings, 7:00—9:30 p.m., Monday through Thursday.
 There are also seasonal considerations. Monday Night Football used to make Monday nights during the season impossible. MNF has lost some of


-----

###### its exclusivity now, thanks to also having Sunday and Thursday Night Football, but in most markets with college teams, you can’t risk Saturdays.

 Next, what are the optimal times?

 This depends on your audience and market and can be affected by your own logistics. If you are only doing occasional events locally for your business or practice, you can settle on an ideal time. When we were in the business of promoting public preview seminars about real estate investing and were traveling from city to city to do it, we chose to do two previews a day in each place even if that wasn’t ideal. It usually cost the same to rent the hotel meeting room for a half or whole day, our travel cost was the same, and our promotion costs were the same, so we settled for smaller audiences at each time to get to a bigger total audience for the entire day than we could achieve with one time. We were young. We experimented a lot, too, and if you are going to do a lot of events, you should too. For example, we tested scheduling our two-hour preview during people’s lunch hours from noon to 2:00 p.m. We found that fewer people attended than at any other time, but we had a much higher conversion rate; a higher percentage of the audience enrolled in the program presented. My theory is that the people who had enough flexibility and control over their workday schedules were more in tune with us and our particular offer.
 In multiday boot camp, some very successful event holders like to totally consume the attendees’ time with sessions starting at 8:00 a.m. or 9:00 a.m. and going into the evening, to 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. But other equally successful event holders prefer giving the groups evenings off to network and socialize with each other—and rest. If you have high-energy subject matter or are doing intense personal development work, you may be able to keep them up and in sessions until 2:00 a.m. I’ve certainly seen this, and sometimes wonder if personal growth gurus have a secret competition to see who can keep their audiences up the latest. If you have more technical subject matter, I’d think 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. might be the limit.
 With long hours and multiple days, one of the most important decisions you’ll make is when to do your most important presentation that sells the products, services, or programs you assembled the entire event to sell. There are many things to consider in making that decision. Does the


-----

###### audience already have a relationship with you, or are you creating trust from scratch at the event? How difficult is the buying decision, and how expensive (to the audience) is the decision? Will they need to phone home like E.T. or pray on it overnight like a devout Baptist? Are you going to offer a special, early a.m. breakfast, next-day lunch, cocktail reception, or fast-start training for those who buy? Think through the timing and agenda placement of your most important presentation very carefully.

 For many people, there is a question of whether your event should be free or involve paid registration.

 In-office events—like health-care classes put on by chiropractors for patients and patients’ guests, a preview seminar about implants put on by dentists, a presentation on Roth IRAs given by the financial planner—are almost always provided free of charge. Many preview seminars held in hotels, locally, or done as nationwide tours are also offered free so as not to put a decision barrier in the way. But make no mistake, just because it’s free doesn’t mean you don’t have to hustle nearly as hard to get people registered as if you were charging, and with free events, you may get a bigger number registered, but you’ll find many won’t honor their commitment, leaving you with empty chairs. A strong post-registration follow-up campaign is almost always needed.
 Some events are offered with seat deposits. This is when the people register with their credit cards, with a small seat deposit to guarantee they’ll attend, which they forfeit if they don’t show up. This can slightly reduce the number registering but as much as double the percentage of those showing up.
 In our business, we’ve moved more and more to paid events, and I like having both an accurate count of what the actual attendance will be and committed, invested attendees. With paid events such as boot camps, we use and recommend using price tiers, like general admission; VIP admission with better reserved seating; and VIP-PLUS, with the best reserved seating and other perks.

 None of this matters if you don’t have a way to fill the seats at your events. The most important thing to know about that is: Have many


-----

###### ways, not just one way, if at all possible.

 Ideally, you have your own lists of customers, clients, or patients past, present, and pending who can be invited and urged to bring family, friends, colleagues, or peers. If you are organizing a local event for your local business or practice, you may want to partner with a noncompetitive but compatible business so you can both deliver presentations and each benefit from exposure to the other’s lists. Be sure your customers see promotion for your event at every turn, from in-office or in-store signage and fliers to your web and social media sites and ezines.
 Whether marketing events locally or nationally, there are relevant trade or professional associations or clubs and organizations who may be persuaded to publicize, support, or even sponsor your events. If you are interested in this, and in lists of such groups, check out the information at http://NoBSPresentations.com/associations.
 Two other good resources are Eventbrite (www.eventbrite.com) and Meetup (www.meetup.com). I like to use them to connect with organizers and make deals. We also love to leverage Meetup at the local level to advertise events. If you need mailing lists to use with direct mail, the big daddy is SRDS (www.SRDS.com), the marketplace of lists to rent. One of my other favorites for list research is at NextMark (https://lists.nextmark.com/market).
 Many people are using Facebook and other social media for events. There is a book in the No B.S. series loaded with information on this, the No B.S. Guide to Direct-Response Social Media by Dan Kennedy and Kim Walsh-Phillips. We use paid, targeted Facebook, Google, and YouTube ads for our own events and promote organically through Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook.
 We have clients in financial, investment, and opportunity-related businesses who are still using city newspapers very productively. No, newspapers are not dead, and rates are often reasonable and affordable because a lot of advertisers believe they are dead. Don’t ignore the newspaper, especially if your audience age is 55 and older. We have filled a lot of events with the newspaper ad shown in Figure 10.1 on page 82.

###### Filling seats for events, small or large, is rarely a result of one big, splashy ad campaign or one simple announcement. People are picked off one at a time: one person by a social media post, another by a letter or postcard, another by word of mouth, and so on. Business owners who do a lot of events to promote their businesses and acquire customers or clients will unanimously tell you that their success at bringing audiences together comes from doing a lot of different things.

##### CHAPTER 11

### No Two Audiences Are
 Created Equal

###### by Dan Kennedy

 am now going to give you a shocking fact about success with presentations, whether delivered one-to-many in physical, real-world venues like seminars or delivered in virtual reality via online media, which we’ll next discuss in Section II of this book. Note I said

# I“success with presentations”—not “effective presentations.”

###### Here is the shocking fact: Results from a presentation vary, having nothing to do with the presentation itself, its structure, its content, its cleverness; nothing to do with the ability, experience, or efficacy of the presenter; and nothing to do with the venue or the media where the presentation is delivered. But these variances are not random or accidental —they are by cause and effect.
 This means that everything Dustin, Dave, and I have presented so far about crafting effective presentations is imperiled and potentially sabotaged, even possibly rendered worthless, by this shocking fact if left unmanaged.
 There, I said it. This entire book and your time spent with it can be zeroed out by just one mistake.


-----

###### Almost all my professional speaking, encompassing well over 2,500 compensated engagements plus additional ones done for business promotion, spanning 40 years, have involved my direct selling of print, audio, and video information products in the presentations, driving people to product tables or teams who collect order forms at the back of the room. This is the purest, most honest critique possible. There have been fewer than a dozen of these times when I have zeroed. Blanked. Left empty- handed. Failed abysmally. Not a one of those dozen had anything to do with my presentations; I was delivering already tested, refined, well-proven, and consistently productive presentations. Not a one of those dozen had anything to do with my delivery of the presentations; I was sufficiently rested, healthy, able, prepared, capable, and dynamic. Every one of the dozen “bomb sites” were the result of one thing and one thing only . . .
 We are going to talk about the secret of pre-existing conditions. You may know this term from health care and the feature put into the original Obamacare that restricts insurers from refusing coverage or appropriately pricing coverage to people with pre-existing illnesses— making it, incidentally, mathematically and financially impossible to provide health insurance without gigantic financial losses, as the fool’s-gold idea invites everybody to wait to buy insurance until they are ill. But this is not the kind of pre-existing condition I’m talking about here, although there are similarities. Not even a newborn infant is free of pre-existing conditions. The baby has genes and thus a genetic predisposition to certain diseases or illnesses and to certain wellness or probable life expectancy. Momma may have smoked, imbibed alcohol, or heaven forbid, listened to rap incessantly and thereby cursed the baby while it was still in its womb. Grown-ups, coming to the doorstep of a health insurer, carry a lot more of these pre-existing conditions. None arrive as pure, clean, and undamaged physical specimens, nor do any arrive with perfectly open, teachable, and coachable minds to be influenced about personal responsibility, diet, or exercise. In the past, insurers were, to some extent, able to sift, sort, reject, and accept people based on both pre-existing conditions and predictive indicators of longevity, years of expensive illness or infirmity, and even compliant or noncompliant behavior. As I write this, that authority over who such companies choose to do business with, at what prices, and under what terms has been largely taken away. This seems like a good thing for


-----

###### consumers, but its evolving reality is collapse of a health insurance system that has served 93% of the American public effectively up until now. Fortunately for you, this authority and power has not been taken from you. You still have the authority and power to choose your customers and your audiences. What I want you to know is how vital it is to exercise that power.
 People come into your audience with pre-existing conditions. Mental, emotional, philosophical, experiential, habitual and behavioral, and— important if you are selling—financial. No one comes with a fully open mind or heart. You get no blank slates.
 INFORMATION CHANGES LIVES—like nothing else can. This is the business I am in. I change lives for a living. Mostly, if you craft and deliver presentations, one way or another, you, too, will be in the business of changing lives for a living. If you are a podiatrist and give a presentation all about the history of shoes, the little-understood science of foot health, and the availability of orthotics, you are changing lives by potentially improving the quality of people’s lives, extending their ability to participate in sports as recreation in later years, and enabling them to walk, hike, and run without foot pain. If you are a financial advisor, your presentation on minimizing taxes and maximizing yields on safe retirement investments has the potential of giving seniors improved lifestyles, money to aid their grandchildren with college educations, business startups, or first home purchases, more generous contributions to charities, and overall peace of mind. Your presentation may change a retiree from a largely uninformed, vulnerable, and passive investor to a smarter, safer, and more engaged investor. Almost every professional, business owner, and entrepreneur, as well as every author, professional speaker, and self-appointed guru is, by their presentations, attempting to provoke and create change.
 After all, who makes any positive change in themselves, their lives, or their businesses without first discovering, being provided, and often being forced to confront information that is new to them?
 By presenting information, we are engaged in the noblest of causes. By making people aware of information, ideas, products, and possibilities they never knew existed with well-crafted presentations, we can focus people’s attention on beneficial opportunities they would otherwise barely glance at or ignore. When you assemble an audience and deliver your presentation,


-----

###### even when its chief purpose is to acquire a customer or make a sale, you display information that can lead to dynamic change.
 But information does not change every life or change any life automatically, organically, or by osmosis. We only affect those ready and willing to be affected. Change is a participatory activity, not a passive receipt. This is why 2, 10, or 10,000 people in very similar circumstances can all be given the same information, and only one or two or a hundred will see any changes because of it. This is why two people in identical businesses in the same town can be given the same information, and one soars to new heights while the other stays in place on the ground. This nearly drove a friend of mine insane: He believed his information should cause everyone he shared it with to soar, and he took each one who didn’t personally. The accumulating burden crushed him. I, fortunately, figured it out early and took what some would consider a callous attitude about it: Here is information, do with it what you will or do nothing at all and it’s all on you, not me; I will celebrate success with those who use my information, I will ignore, be unfazed by, and do my best to fast forget those who don’t.
 A change agent can only effect change with change makers. Just as a chef can only create grand meals with the right ingredients, a TV series can succeed only if populated by interesting characters an audience comes to care about, or a car can only get us from place to place fueled with gas and oil—not water and tofu.
 This is why psychographics are more important than demographics. This is how data can fail us. I often tell the story about the change in many states’ privacy laws years back, which put driver’s license data and lists on the market for the first time—giving companies in the diet and weight loss industry the seemingly golden opportunity to get lists by gender, age, height, and weight, thus getting lists of short, fat, dumpy women. It was thought to be a new road to riches. But what the data could not know or tell was whether or not those women cared enough about being dumpy, and were mentally and emotionally ready to responsibly and actively participate in their own positive change.
 Information changes lives as nothing else can, but not by itself and not universally applied. The great success philosopher Jim Rohn and I were once comparing notes about many things, and we got to the subject of people whose lives were dramatically changed by our information. Jim
