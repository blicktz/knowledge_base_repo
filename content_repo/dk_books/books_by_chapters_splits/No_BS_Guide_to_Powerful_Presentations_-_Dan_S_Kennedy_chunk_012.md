###### Few effective speakers stand still behind a podium or lectern, or read a word-for-word speech from notes or a teleprompter. It doesn’t have enough life to it. Audiences are affected as much or more by how you say what you say as they are by what you are saying. That “how” includes voice, confidence, enthusiasm, whether or not you seem to be happy to be in front of them delivering your message, and physical movement. In many ways, you are a performer delivering a performance.

##### CHAPTER 9

### Demonstration in Presentations

###### by Dan Kennedy

 eeing is believing. It’s one of the oldest clichés, for good reason.
 As one of my hobbies, I’m a student of the history of the art of deception, and one of the areas of life and commerce where it has been practiced most ardently, artfully, and consistently is with

# Spsychic phenomena. From simple ouiji board, tarot card, and

###### crystal ball readings to psychics claiming to contact and channel communication from the dead to the living, people are made to believe, and believers are defrauded of their money and dignity by con artists who have mastered convincing physical demonstrations of their psychic abilities. The book The Heyday of Spiritualism published in 1970 is one of hundreds of exposé and how-to books chronicling the popularity of mediums, psychics, faith healers, and the like, from the earliest days of the 1900s. Despite all the education and information that has become available since then, the exact same tricks used then are used now by scammers plying these trades. The only difference now is that some of them get their own reality TV shows.
 For the record, it is all charlatanism, deception, and fraud—often cruel. I mention it as a demonstration of the power of demonstration for presenters. The séance was and still is the number-one type of


-----

###### demonstration-presentation of this industry. People gather in a room that must go dark, as a medium supposedly rendered unable to move by hands held and feet bound or locked in a cabinet or some other means connects with The Other Side, and a ghostly presence speaks through her but also lifts the table, knocks objects off shelves, ruffles one of the attendees’ hair, empties a glass of water. The medium may also emit ectoplasm from her private parts, speak in tongues, vibrate, and collapse. Another favored demonstration is the “cold read,” where the psychic tells people things about themselves he couldn’t possibly know, often in concert with aid from each person’s dearly departed, and conveys heartfelt messages from the dead parents or children. When it is done well, it’s hard to disbelieve what you are seeing.
 Faith healing is of the same school of trickery. People still, to this day, leave America, travel to distant third-world countries, and hand over large sums to “miracle workers” who can deliver incredibly convincing demonstrations of opening a person’s body with no knife or scalpel—just bare hands or even mind power—and withdrawing blackened lumps of cancer or evil spirit manifestations, curing the afflicted and desperate people, although the demonstrations to the customer or the audience of prospective customers is usually done with a professional performer and co- conspirator pretending to be riddled with a disease and near death. It’s all bunk. But when it is done well, it’s hard to disbelieve what you are seeing.
 Houdini did his level best to debunk many of these fraudsters, yet Arthur Conan Doyle famously believed Houdini’s harsh criticism of the psychics and spiritualists was just a cover-up, as was his magic; Doyle believed Houdini himself actually had magical and psychic powers!

 This is what physical demonstration does. It creates, magnifies, and solidifies belief because an audience believes what it sees. When it is done well, it’s hard to disbelieve what you are seeing.

 In selling, one-to-one, in the home, in offices and clinics, and to groups, physical demonstration has long played a chief role, and many of these demonstrations have not gone away either. The incredible blender/food processor is still demonstrated today on TV, in stores, and at food and home and garden shows exactly as it was demonstrated 20 years ago, 30, 40, 50


-----

###### years ago. The same Tupperware® demonstration first devised by Brownie Wise in the 1950s is still used by Tupperware’s party plan agents in living rooms all around the world today. I learned and used demonstrations like that for a number of products in my earliest years, selling to people in their homes. I later devised demonstrations for use in TV infomercials. I have a whale of a lot of experience with demonstration, and I assure you regardless of who you are, what you sell, where or how you sell it, whatever presentation to develop and deliver will be multiplied in power if a compelling seeing-is-believing demonstration can be added.
 You may think there is no way to demonstrate what you sell or do in a demonstration to an audience—and you are almost certainly wrong. Figuring out demonstrations for tangible products is relatively easy. The aforementioned magic blender into which you can stick a whole watermelon and get juice, the knife that cuts a tomato into paper thin slices right after being used to carve wood or cut a metal nail in half, the red copper pan nothing will stick to, the amazing car polish so protective you pour gas all over the hood, light it, extinguish it, and there’s not even a smoke smudge. But you can demonstrate the intangible as well.
 If you’ve ever been to a network marketing company “opportunity meeting,” you know about “The Circles.” For a tiny group in a living room or on stage in front of hundreds or even thousands, somebody draws the circles on the whiteboard: You only have to bring six people into the business, then they each get six, then they each get six, etc., etc., and you are atop a gigantic, mushrooming constellation of busy-bee distributors from which money is passing upstream to you. But it is one thing seeing red and blue and green circles drawn on a whiteboard. It was a very different thing the Saturday I watched an Amway leader by the name of Charlie Marsh get 20 helpers on stage to unroll a huge, seven-foot-high and as wide as the room roll of brown butcher paper on which photos of everybody in his organization through its first eight levels had been glued on in the same pattern as you would draw the circles, with lines connecting them, and he walked around in front pointing to different ones he could tell the audience about but also admitting he’d never even met most of them, and then pointing to six at the top connected directly to him and saying, “They’re the only ones I recruited.” That was a demonstration!


-----

###### In my speech that sold tens of millions of dollars of my home study course and tool kit for small-business owners called The Magnetic Marketing System®, I built in demonstration. All the promised results were intangible. There was no physical way to show customers of a business receiving direct-mail sequences, reading, then coming into businesses because of the System. The product itself was paper pages in a notebook— remarkably unexciting. But I could do a show-and-tell demonstration. The now famous series of Giorgio letters for the Italian restaurant owner turned Romance Director can be seen in my book The Ultimate Sales Letter, 4th Edition. I explained these, showed them on the big screen as I read portions of them, emphasized what they demonstrated as I went, and ended with the flourish of a rhetorical question: Do you honestly believe that anybody receiving these four letters does not know all about Giorgio’s, isn’t showing the letters to their spouse, neighbors, and friends? For four postage stamps, we’ve made him famous almost overnight in his market!
 That “bit” in my presentation became so well-known and loved, that audiences asked me to do it again and again as they became part of my permanent audience attending seminars over years.
 For some years, I had a client who was the reigning authority on stopping employee and deliveryman theft in the supermarket and convenience store industry, and he delivered presentations to that industry’s company owners, executives, and store managers about 100 times a year. Most were skeptical of his information, believing their chief problems were with shoplifters. We devised a dramatic demonstration. He brought a “denier” manager up on stage, set up a fake delivery in a fake store, and challenged the manager to block every attempt to steal from him as the bread deliveryman—then right in front of everybody—robbed the poor victim blind. For another client who sells incoming call training to dentists, we devised a secret shopping and recording of the actual offices of the doctors who will be in an audience at a convention, then he plays the recordings of their own staffs’ bungling of calls from the stage for all to hear, one after the other, until the group yells, “We surrender!” For a financial advisor specializing in reducing tax bites into retirees’ 401(k) and IRA payouts, at his free seminars for seniors, I have him bring several folks up to the front of the room, giving them each a real $100.00 bill and a cigarette lighter and instructing them to burn the money just like they are


-----

###### with their poor tax strategies. Many can’t bring themselves to do it. Their hands shake. When he then puts about 20 of the $100.00 bills in a metal tray—representing the average losses of a retiree from his IRA payouts to unnecessary taxes—and pours lighter fluid all over it, the audience erupts and begs him not to burn the pile of money. When they have all agreed they shouldn’t either, he sets aside the lighter fluid and promises to donate the $2,000.00 instead to a charity named by one of the people in the front row.
 There is a demonstration, and often a dramatic, high-impact, and memorable demonstration, to be created for every intangible service or product. If you don’t create and use one, you are depriving yourself of one of the key elements of the most powerful presentation possible.

### Someone To Speak and
 Present To

###### by Dustin Mathews

 hile this is a book all about the maximum-effectiveness presentation itself, there’s no point to it without an audience for it!
 With that in mind, I’m going to talk a little bit about the

# Wlive event and the assembly of the audience.

###### I’ve made my living from doing a lot of live events in physical locations with audiences. There are many benefits to this. First of all, creating an event and offering it to a target market or the public immediately gives you some level of celebrity status and can position you as an expert. After all, when is there an event promoted and held starring a nobody?
 Live events are a staple of the entertainment industry. Movie stars aren’t just seen in movies, but at live events—movie premieres, red carpets at award events, the Cannes Film Festival, Comic-Con. These are breathlessly reported on by the media and eagerly watched by millions of people. Athletes’ games are live events. In this past presidential election, Donald Trump lived by the live event attended by thousands, much grander in theater and spectacle than most political gatherings. Even a small live event


-----

###### can wrap you in status, importance, and celebrity. For many years, a client of Dan Kennedy’s, a genealogy researcher, did a speaking tour once a year, conducting small group presentations at public libraries and bookstores, typically drawing only 15 or 20 to each event. But to them, she was a Very Important Expert, by virtue of the library or bookstore having promoted her event. From these, she secured all the individual clients she could handle, for whom she did comprehensive family history research projects, at fees from $5,000.00 to $25,000.00 each.
 The live event can also be a great place to show off existing clients to new, prospective clients. Smart cosmetic surgeons or dentists who hold live events for potential patients always have at least several of their proudest, happiest, most beautiful patients there to be introduced, interviewed, met, and mingled with.
 Your own live event is the perfect place to deliver your own presentation, because there is no interference from others, no limitations or rules to adhere to, and the assembled audience has come to see and hear from you.
 As you know, Dan, Dave, and I are big believers in one-to-many selling. It’s worth a fair amount of money and effort to get a group of 50 prospects together in one place at one time, weighed against the time cost of meeting with 50 different people individually and delivering the presentation one-to- one 50 times.

 There are a few different kinds of live events you might want to use.

 One is commonly called the “preview seminar.” You may be familiar with the real estate investing industry’s version of these, typically promoted on radio, on TV, in newspapers, and by mail as well as online, and held in hotels—often once in an afternoon and again that evening at five different locations in a circle around a city, five days in a row. Like these, most preview seminars are typically brief—from 90 minutes to 2 hours—so they can be done as lunch-and-learn events or held as evening seminars. They are introductory in nature, sometimes leading to registration for a subsequent multiday seminar, to follow-up appointments, or both.
 A very successful financial advisor in Michigan conducts two-hour preview seminars at community colleges, libraries, and community centers


-----

###### about maximizing Social Security, Medicare, and other government benefits for retirees. At these, he moves people to a full day, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. seminar on safe retirement investing. Five or six of the preview seminars feed into one of the full-day seminars, usually held on a Saturday. Out of that daylong seminar, individual appointments are set with interested, qualified potential clients to whom customized financial plans, annuities, insurance, and precious metals investments can be sold.
 Another is the “customer appreciation event.” This may be a seminar or workshop or a less formal social gathering. In either case, past and present customers are encouraged to attend with family, friends, and co-workers. Pastors rent movie theaters, show a family-friendly movie, and invite parishioners and their friends to attend. Usually, the pastor makes only a few welcoming remarks—there is no presentation, but he’s there to greet and meet, there’s church literature, and some promotion for an upcoming event at the church takes place. Others using this exact same movie theater/film night event include martial arts academy owners, orthodontists, and financial advisors. A customer appreciation event more suitable to an introductory presentation is a lunch or dinner with a guest speaker or celebrity in addition to yourself, possibly a local sports or TV celebrity.
 Finally, there is the “real” seminar or boot camp. These are at least one day in length but usually two to four days. This is a great venue to sell high- end, complex “programs,” services, or bundles of products and services. You have the luxury of time, a choreographed build-up to the sales presentation and multiple opportunities to support the sale before and after the presentation. Attendees can be badged or otherwise identified as being owners of or participants in the program being sold. They can be brought up on stage to be interviewed about their successful experiences and/or given awards. The entire event can be organized to support the one thing being sold and its sales presentation, or time can be apportioned so that multiple products or services can each get their own presentations.

 Whatever kind of event you decide to do, you’ll have to choose a place, date, and time.

 If you are holding a local event for people in your city or a chosen city, be sure to take traffic and traffic patterns and other local events, into

###### consideration. Dave and I once neglected checking on community events and had an Ironman Triathlon taking place, blocking off three of the four streets around the hotel we were holding a preview seminar in. In some cities, typically those designed as spokes-and-wheel, a central location can be best. In others, where there is great resistance to crossing an east-west or north-south dividing line, you may need to hold your event twice, once on each side of town. Sometimes an airport-adjacent hotel can be easiest to get to by the freeways. If people are flying in to attend, the airport location can be the winner.
 If you are holding a bigger event for a national audience and people will be flying in from all over the country, you have to consider seasonal weather, airline hubs and availability of direct flights from other cities, and costs to the travelers. If you want the destination itself to be a magnet, Las Vegas leaps to mind. Everybody likes a good excuse to go to Las Vegas. But you should remember that Vegas is a party city, and there’s a lot of competition for the attention and money of your attendees. Dave and I choose not to use Vegas, and I’m fond of Orlando because it’s family friendly and readily accessible for the entire country.

 Next, what are the optimal dates for holding your event?
