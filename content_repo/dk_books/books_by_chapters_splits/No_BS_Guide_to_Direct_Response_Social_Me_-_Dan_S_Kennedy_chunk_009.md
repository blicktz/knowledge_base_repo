### In the Last Moments …

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

 In the last moments of finishing this book, I received the unfortunate news that Dan Kennedy had come down with an infection and only had a few days left to live.
 I was in Capri on holiday, and although I was with close friends, none of them were part of this world of crazy pants direct-response entrepreneurs who would fully understand the impact of this news, nor did I want to ruin their vacation. So, I turned to the very thing this book is centered on … social media. There I got to see story after story shared about the difference Dan had made in others’ lives. (See just some of the many stories shared on pages xvi to xviii.)

###### Not only did it provide comfort and solace, but inspiration to continue to pursue the mission of this book … helping you get your message out in a way that people will listen and more important, take action.
 Admittedly, I love the irony that tribute after tribute was posted on Facebook about a guy who could only be reached with a fax machine.
 While it wasn’t easy to complete the book not knowing if I would be able to talk to my co-author again until we get to heaven, I knew finishing this is exactly what he would have wanted. That and making sure there are a lot of calls-to-action in each chapter. In miraculous news, as the book was in final editing, Dan recovered and literally walked out of hospice. His living legacy lives on.
 If you want to truly honor him while he is here to appreciate it, read, absorb, and then take action. His legacy multiplies the more we all succeed.

#### A Lot Has Changed … March 3, 2015

###### That’s when the original No B.S. Direct Response Social Media Marketing book was submitted for print. To say a lot has changed since then would be an understatement.
 Barak Obama was president, Facebook Live was just available to celebrities, and Meerkat and Periscope were supposedly the next biggest things. Today Facebook Live is one of the most effective ways to grow your business on social media.
 Back in 2015, Instagram was used to show chiseled physiques and not something you’d use for business.
 Now with over a billion active users, it is rich in opportunities to generate leads and flip them into sales, regardless of industry, niche, or geographic location. And it is still possible to grow this platform organically, aka for free.
 Personally, a lot has changed as well. Dan Kennedy went through another sale of GKIC Insider’s Circle, now No B.S. Inner Circle, purchased by one of his longtime proteges, Adam Witty.
 I sold my marketing agency to Josh Turner, founder of LinkedSelling, enabling my dream of devoting time to growing a coaching and training business, Powerful Professionals. And the focus? It worked. Powerful Professionals was just ranked No. 475 on the “Inc. 5000” for the growth we’ve had since 2015.
 Dan released multiple books since 2015, including the new Magnetic Marketing: How to Attract a Flood of New Customers That Pay, Stay, and Refer (ForbesBooks, 2018), https://amzn.to/2liZfqc, and I released my first solo book under Entrepreneur Press, The Ultimate Guide to Instagram for Business (Entrepreneur Press, 2017).
 Dan still hates social media with a venomous passion, except for how it can make money for him and his clients.
 I still love it, for not only the ROI from my audience of a million plus, but also because of the power of community. I’ve seen firsthand how an online network can bring comfort to a grieving parent, resources to a family post-fire, and joy for those achieving milestones.

###### Yes, there are problems—dollars wasted by businesses, a comparison trap of “grass is greener” envy, and a time suck of epic proportion.
 But that’s humans, my friend, not the media. The good news is, your story can be different: one of success and triumph; one of years of hard work that leads to your “overnight success” and becomes folklore for those entrepreneurs who come after you.
 You are different because you have chosen to arm yourself with the knowledge, strategy, and path to accomplish your goals. That—along with your gumption and a little chutzpah—is all it takes.
 In this edition, we’ve revised a lot. There’s a chapter on Instagram and LinkedIn, how to use live video to generate leads, and the power of filling your sales funnel through social media, and so much more.
 The strategies are timeless and the techniques up to date. Start with the Introduction, and take action one strategy at a time. No matter how slow you go, keep moving forward.

### Introduction

#### Why Would I Write a Book About Social Media and More Important, Why Should You Read It?

###### by Dan Kennedy Everyone’s talking about it, but nobody knows what they’re talking about.
 As pervasive as this nonsense is, the buzz is becoming quantifiable, and more businesses are feeling pressure to join the social media bandwagon. But what are consumers’ purchases really telling us about social media’s influence? And what mistakes can you hope to avoid without falling victim to the buzz?
 An unbiased, independent poll conducted by Gallup in May and June 2014 revealed that 63% of consumers are not influenced by social media regarding their buying choices, and only 5% claim social media has significant impact on their buying decisions.
 According to the May 26, 2017, Social Media Week article titled “How Social Media Is Influencing Purchasing Decisions,” “Seventy-four percent of shoppers make buying decisions based on social media.”[1] The Sprout Social 2019 Index dives a bit deeper on the subject, making the point that “this shift isn’t specific to B2C companies. B2B businesses are benefiting from social media’s purchasing influence too. Marketers need to identify what types of content and social actions will take that connection a step further. Sixty-one percent of social followers said posts offering discounts could encourage them to make a first purchase, while 45% said informational material would convince them to buy.”[2]
 I have no love affair with social media. In broadest context, I consider it a “cancer of narcissism” destructive to society, a way for people to feel important with zero reason or merit, thus removing essential motivation for a creative and constructive work. It brings other ills, too, with which I won’t bore you.

###### As a marketing and sales media expert, I lean toward Tupperware CEO Rick Goings’ characterization of it as “antisocial media.” I see enormous waste of time and money by people creating small and unscalable traffic but also, in some cases, huge traffic to YouTube videos, Facebook sites, etc., with little monetary results.
 But with all that said, I hold stock in a tobacco company, so I am not above making money on things I would not personally consume, and even consider a plague on society.
 I also know smart people who manage to consistently use social media for real lead generation and produce directly creditable sales results.
 So despite being a giraffe on a tricycle about all this, I’m in it. The reason I tell you this is to make the point: There are times in your life you are going to feel, maybe actually be, and certainly be looked at, like a giraffe on a tricycle.
 Sometimes you volunteer for this—like my early days in speaking. “Awkward” doesn’t even come close. Sometimes it is pushed upon you— my corporate and personal bankruptcies all those moons ago. “Humiliating,” “depressing,” and “frightening” are inadequate adjectives.
 When asked how he arrived at his brilliant discoveries, Einstein said, “I grope.”
 Much has been said and written about trying to abbreviate the qualities and characteristics and behavior of top achievers, mostly in futility. There are no correct simple answers to anything, but if you had a gun against my pet—The Million Dollar Dog’s cute little head—and demanded the ultimate abbreviation, I’d say, resilience.
 That includes a lot of groping … with the new, with the difficult, with problems.
 For at least as long as I choose to keep working at my trade, I must agree to some groping and coping. It’s all OK. It is never what you bungle that defines you or your success.
 Robert Downey Jr. is today a hugely successful and extremely rich actor. Only a handful of years ago, he was in and out of rehab, unbankable, uninsurable, and written off for dead by most in Hollywood.
 Two real estate crashes ago, Donald Trump was fundamentally bankrupt, bedeviled by multiple creditors (including Chinese bankers), publicly embarrassed, and written off as dead by much of the media—the

###### same media that genuflects today. Such stories are the true stories of the rich and most of the rich and famous.
 The fact of the matter is, I decided it was important to co-author a book about direct-response social media marketing, and again with this revised edition, because no matter what I say, you are most likely still going to move forward with it. And in fact, some of the time, I recommend that you do.
 I do have clients getting direct, profitable results, and I do see legitimate marketing being done in this venue. If you venture into social media, handle it with care. Do not be peer-pressured to follow how others are using it. I’d say 99% of them are doing it wrong.
 One of your best defenses is to stay grounded about profit—not gross revenue. Real profit is the only proof of sound strategy or (as an investor) of capable management. I actually sat in a corporate boardroom and listened as a board member urged one small company’s leaders to copycat a Facebook strategy, using a big name company (in a different, unrelated industry) as the shining example to emulate—despite there being no evidence of any kind of profit derived from its grandiose exercise.
 Incredibly, the others took him seriously. They should have burned him at the stake.
 This is not to say that online or social media can’t be made to disgorge profit. Chris Cardell, a client of mine, described his uses of this media to earn great profits. My co-author Kim Walsh Phillips also created real, measurable, and profitable results from social media for her clients I know personally—and people I know can count. And now that she sold her agency, her students tout success in the strategies she teaches at Powerful Professionals.
 This is why I wrote this book with her. She uses direct-response marketing principles to drive real results and profit. This must be your standard—money math—and no other.
 Unfortunately, most businesses proceed without caution and make a lot of mistakes in the process. Proceed with extreme diligence to ensure you are not in the majority. Once again, that isn’t the wise place to be.

#### Data Speaks Louder Than Beliefs


-----

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips My heart was beating so fast I was sure everyone else in the room could hear it. Boom, boom boom … boom, boom, boom …
 After I was done sharing my cost-per-client acquisition numbers and that my specialty was direct-response social media, the man said, “A social media person who actually cares about the numbers? I’ve never met anyone like you before. I’d like to hire you to work on my social media and bring you in to speak at my event of Shark investments.”
 Inside I was freaking out. Kevin “Mr. Wonderful” O’Leary from NBC’s Shark Tank just asked me to do consulting work for him and speak at an event with people from the show. I mean, could this really be happening?
 While my insides were a cyclone of pandemonium, I managed to squeak out, “That sounds like a great plan to me.”
 All I could think was: Wait until I can tell my husband what just happened …
 The Tall One (aka my husband Ian) and I spent many a Friday night after putting our girls to bed snuggled up on the couch geeking out on watching Shark Tank. We’d make bets on whether or not the entrepreneurs would get the deal, roll our eyes at some of the silly answers the guests would give, and always agree with Mr. Wonderful’s assessment.
 When I got the chance to work with Kevin as a consultant for his investment firm, it was a giddy fan girl moment. And it just got better.
 Turns out, he’s incredibly kind in person, but still no BS when it comes to business. That made me even more of a fan girl. He listened without hesitation to advice about his social media marketing and immediately saw a positive ROI.
 We were hired to work with his investment firm, O’Leary Ventures’ newest initiative, Beanstox, a mobile app (see Figure I.1). Beanstox puts the power of investing in the hands of anyone who’s ever wanted to invest in stocks. Through the app, you can invest in big-name stocks, such as Apple and Disney, and do so by purchasing only a small percentage of a share. For example, you can make your first trade for less than $15 total.

**FIGURE I.1: Beanstox App**

###### We were hired to increase Beanstox’s paid subscriptions. They had invested in other marketing avenues previously—such as radio and promotional appearances—and while they had some success, they were only seeing a 5 to 10% conversion rate from free downloads to paid subscriptions.
 This seems to be a common challenge within many businesses; they can bring in prospects with free “lead magnets” or free app downloads, but when it comes to the actual exchange of money, sales aren’t where they want them to be.


-----

###### In comes the power of direct-response Facebook marketing—a Facebook ads campaign focused on the goal of getting paid subscribers. We started by testing several variations of the campaign using assorted videos of Kevin, static images, and different copy options.
 The results? Mr. Wonderful-worthy. Daily downloads increased more than 300%, from around 40 per day to up to 120 per day with the addition of Facebook marketing. Within two weeks of launching, the conversion rate more than doubled (see Figure I.2).

**FIGURE I.2 : Beanstox Conversion Rate**

###### Beyond the front-end Facebook campaign, we identified additional areas where the campaign could be optimized. For example, we saw that Android users were coming in at a higher cost, so we dove deeper into the data to find out why. We identified that Android users are shown a permission request to share various pieces of information with the app (photos, locations, etc.) instead of going straight to the app download. This was preventing potential users from completing their download process. Identifying these types of opportunities for optimization throughout the entire funnel is a key for maximizing results.
 The overall ROI on the Beanstox campaign, including the fee paid to my firm, was over 200%. As in, for every dollar Beanstox put into marketing, they received more than two dollars back.


-----

###### As Mr. Wonderful would say, that’s what “showing the numbers” is all about.
 If you want a ringing endorsement of social media providing an ROI that is measurable and trackable, take it from a guy notorious about the numbers. Kevin said:
 Not only is Kim the first social media marketer I ever heard that even mentions ROI, but that is her main focus. She is the first marketer I have ever recommended to all of my Shark Tank investments and who I use for my personal business. She has my full endorsement.
 I went from working with Kevin’s investment firm to growing his celebrity Instagram and Facebook accounts. Using the same strategies I now teach, we saw immediate—like while we were still meeting—growth.
 Seeing such success from projects where I worked directly with him, Kevin invited me to consult with some of his Shark Tank investments, several of whom became clients themselves.
 When I sold my marketing company, Elite Digital Group, at the end of 2017 and launched a mastermind, one of Kevin’s investments—Snarky Tea —joined and is still a member to this day. (See the Snarky Tea campaign on page 179.)
 At the last event I went to with Mr. Wonderful, he gave me several bottles of his Kevin O’Leary Fine Wines as a gift. I mean it’s a tough job, but someone has to do it … (As a side note, they are under $20 a bottle and delicious. Worth checking out, as you can see below.)

###### I’ve had the chance to work with several celebrities over the years, both at my firm and now in our coaching business Powerful Professionals, including Top Chef superstar Stephen Asprinio when he opened his first restaurant, Nat King Cole’s Generation Hope foundation with his daughters to raise money for students who can’t afford instruments, and several TV and movie superstars presently.
 The good news is, what works for them works for regular folks, too. You’ll find case study after case study—from B2B to B2C, from online business to offline business, from local to national—in the pages of this book. Pick your favorite and launch right away to start getting leads and turning them into cash-paying customers within a few minutes.
 And because social media’s “how to” changes faster than Katy Perry’s hairstyle, we’ve put together a cheat sheet for you to get it all done quickly. Get yours at Nobssocialmediabook.com.
 No matter what, remember … Results rule, period.
