# CHAPTER 19

B.S. THATSALES MANAGERS SHOVEL
 ONTO SALESPEOPLE

## Bluntly, a lot of sales managers aren’t parked behind the big desk bellowing at you because they deserve to be there.
 Some are sales burn-outs, promoted to get them out of the field. Some were top salespeople, now promoted per the Peter Principle to their level of incompetence. Some are woefully lazy. Many are stubborn and close- minded, stuck in whatever era they were in at their peak. Like the 1950s. Just as the leading cause of death is hospitalization, the prime cause of a lot of sales career death is the sales manager!
 Here are the dumbest things I catch such sales managers telling their troops:

-----

# 1. “The Answer to Your Problem Is Simple: Make
 More Calls.”

## No, that’s not the answer. If you are not being effective at setting appointments, increasing the quantity of ineffective calls only speeds up the pace of failure. If you drink a sip of spoiled milk and feel nauseous, gulping down the rest of the carton isn’t the cure.
 Ignore this simple-minded advice and refer, instead, to Chapter 17. Implement a system that gets more good prospects calling you.

# 2. “Everybody’s Your Prospect.”

## No, they are not. When everybody’s a theoretical prospect, nobody’s a real prospect. Before The New Economy, salespeople could still earn a living with this 1950’s approach—even though the fragmentation of the market, the importance of specialization, and the insistence by consumers on specific relevance to them was well underway. These are not sudden trends. But they are now dominant. New Economy Customers are quicker than ever to effectively slam the door in the face of any salesperson trying to peddle the same dog food to every dog owner, regardless of breed, size, or age of their pups. You need a clear, in-depth profile of your ideal customer, and you then need to devise a system for attracting those customers—and preferably just those customers—to you.
 Refer to Chapter 17.

# 3. “It Is Easier to Sell to Someone Who Isn’t Interested than It Is to Find Someone Who Is.”

## It may be easier to get sex by taking a big club, whacking an unsuspecting woman over the head, dragging her back to your cave, and having your way with her than to meet, repeatedly date, get to know, build trust with, and seduce her, but it’s an antiquated, primitive—and illegal—approach. Similarly, brute force selling to the uninterested is a primitive, ugly approach. Antiquated, and even rapidly becoming illegal. Hopefully you are well aware, we now live in the age of the Do Not Call List, laws restricting use of broadcast fax and broadcast voice (robocalling), anti-spam laws, and even pending legislation to govern unwanted mail. The “No Solicitors” signs are proliferating.
 Further, forcing yourself on someone who isn’t ideally matched with what you sell and isn’t interested in and motivated by what you sell may be a way to grind out a living from commission checks, but it’s no way to build a sustainable, secure, and exceptionally successful career. Even more importantly, it’s a guarantee of future burn-out, fatigue, dissatisfaction, cynicism. The stress of forcing people to buy things they aren’t eager to buy and own is wearing. This is just no way to go through life. And anyone advising you to go through life this way certainly does not have your best interests in mind—and is probably ignorant about marketing.
 The New Economy outright demands a higher level of sophistication from successful sales professionals. Advertising, marketing, and selling can no longer be separated as if three different functions rather than the seamless process it should be. And my strongest advice to you is to educate yourself not just about selling, but to become a smart, skilled marketing professional and to take control of a marketing process that brings you ideally suited prospects eager to meet with you, respectful of your expertise and advice, and a pleasure to deal with.

## I have a saying, something I constantly talk with my clients about: it’s not just the money you make, it’s how you make the money. Life is too short and life is too long to spend it hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to work we go. Selling should not be drudgery.

-----

# 4. “Your Problem Is You’re Not Motivated.”

## My entire no-prospecting, “Magnetic Marketing” approach grew out of frustration with motivation. I had the car seat full of motivational tapes but I still had an empty bank account. The world’s greatest attitude is no better than the world’s worst attitude if you aren’t sitting across from a highly qualified, able-to-buy prospect. Motivation is fine, motivational influences and influencers have their place, self-motivation is best, but the key to it all isn’t pumping yourself up or being pumped up with pep talks; the key is having reasons to expect positive results. If you put in place the strategies and practices described in this book and go beyond them, to being a full- scale marketing professional, you won’t need to “get motivated.” You’ll be motivated, with good reason.
 With #3 and #4 here in mind, I must insert a commercial. There are a few additional books of mine I want to urge reading, and a collection of free resources I want you to have, to guide you in quick move up from sales professional to marketing professional. The No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing gives you a quick, concise fast start in using smart marketing in place of manual labor to attract, interest, develop and prepare prospects to become great customers by their choice rather than your force. It includes actual examples and even marketing samples from a number of sales professionals-turned-marketing professionals. The NO B.S. Guide to Time Management is about more; it is about autonomy, about making money in a way that pleases you and is respectful of you. In addition, I’d like you to experience two months of Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] Membership free of fee, including my No B.S. Marketing Letter, Marketing Gold Audio CD’s, webinars, and more. You’ll find that offer on pages 260–261 or go directly to www.FreeGiftFrom.com.sales.

# 5. “It’s Just a Numbers Game. Keep at It.”

## OK, there’s some truth to this. But—and it’s a big “but” (just like the sales manager’s!)—just stepping up to the plate and taking more swings, if you can’t hit, won’t help. It is, in part, a numbers game. But it’s also a game of strategy and skill. You want to be persistent, but you want to apply that persistence as productively as possible. As I said much earlier in this book, most sales pros—even doing everything brilliantly—are still going to hear a lot of No’s, Maybe’s, and Maybe Later’s. Selling is not the right profession for the individual weak of will or short of stamina. There’s much to be said for keeping at it, as long as that “it” is carefully chosen.

# How to Tell a Good Sales Manager from a Bad
 One

## A good sales manager teaches strategy, coaches skills, and works with you to solve problems and manage your opportunities. He does NOT regurgitate any of the above five B.S. clichés. He understands and supports sophisticated lead generation and prequalifying efforts, to make your time more productive. In fact, he is a serious student of marketing and direct marketing, not just sales. So, a word to any sales manager reading this, including those I’ve offended: it’s past time for you to reinvent yourself, your know-how and tool kit, your modus operandi for success in The New Economy. You can be an enormous asset to your company and greatly improve the productivity of your sales force by bringing direct marketing in, to replace old-fashioned prospecting, so your salespeople spend more time selling to people primed to buy. Check out the same resources I suggested above.
 A bad sales manager spits out the above five B.S. clichés so frequently and repeatedly it’s as if he has one of those pullstrings in his back, and a computer chip for a brain. Saddled with such, you have only two choices: ignore him, or get away from him and go and find a better opportunity.
