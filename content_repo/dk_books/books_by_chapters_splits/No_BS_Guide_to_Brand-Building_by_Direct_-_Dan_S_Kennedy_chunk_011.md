###### illusion, delusion, treasured beliefs, conventional “wisdom,” and industry norms and expose charlatans and fakers and theorists. This sometimes makes me unwelcome, and it’s possible that will be the case here, if you have treasured beliefs, illusions, or delusions about the magical power of a brand.
 On the surface, asking me to write a book on brand-building, as Entrepreneur did, seemed odd to me and to many who know me well, with whom I shared the mission. Hiring a heretic to pastor a church. I am a very vocal, near constant critic of big, brand-name companies and their huge expenditures on brand or image advertising. I am incessantly cautioning small-business owners, entrepreneurs, and private practice operators not to emulate the behavior of the big brand advertisers, due to their very different agendas as well as the emperors with no sense in their boardrooms. The potential to brand-build your way to bankruptcy is very real.
 I make fun of corporate goofiness, like the pink bunny with the drum that everybody knows but more than half of consumers queried attach it to the wrong band of battery, or the infamous Taco Bell stuffed dog that starred in months of commercials (replacing the food) only to produce a decline in sales, or the fortunes spent tweaking logos and meaningless slogans. When I was writing this book, USA Today actually had the unbridled corporate ego to trumpet its new logo—a big blue dot, by the way —as front page news, as if anybody but its designer and his mother cared. Bone-headed corporate CEOs routinely pour millions into brand symbols, logos, and slogans, and issue pompous press releases, even hold press conferences to announce their foolishness. It is routine folly to grossly exaggerate the significance and value of brands.
 Of course, there are plenty of iconic, powerhouse brands worth fortunes. In entertainment, James Bond, Batman, Superman, The Avengers, Disney. In food, Campbell’s Soup and Coca-Cola. Name a category, you can certainly name both corporate and personal brands that have sustained magnetic power. I’ve never denied that. I’ve just said that the way many have been built is not by throwing oceans of money into buying recognition, awareness, and familiarity, as most peddlers of brand-building theory and of ad media would have you believe. Also, that there’s no warranty of inevitability of brand power or value either.

###### In autos, Rambler was once a good brand. So was Pontiac. It even owned a craze for a time, the Pontiac Trans-Am, made famous by Burt Reynolds in Smokey and the Bandit. Oldsmobile, the symbol of having made it, but not wanting to be a show-off. They’re all gone. Zeroed out. One of the classic cars I drive around in is a 1972 AMC Javelin SST, then a very hot car (see below). Now, people ask: What is that? And often, when I say it was made by American Motors, people ask what that was.

###### More people know Jeep, of course, and today it is a valuable brand. But it twice flirted with extinction. The Jeep in the photo above is my restored 1986 Jeep Wagoneer, which I bought, on impulse, of all places, out of an Orvis catalog. And I felt fine doing so because Orvis is a trusted brand to me. If you’re unfamiliar with them, they are a long established catalog company, selling everything from apparel to hunting and fishing excursions. Orvis shirts, slacks, and a favorite leather jacket hang in my closet. If they say this is a well-restored classic car, I believe them.
 Increasingly, a brand is important to consumers—and therefore valuable —in categories of goods or services over-cluttered with competing choices and like or identical pricing, as a shortcut to decision, desperately needed in an over-busy life. Yet, this value and importance can, in some cases, be long-standing, as with, say, Campbell’s Soup or Bounty paper towels (you know, the quicker picker upper), but it can also lose its grip, as, say, Holiday Inns, or it can go from firm grip on consumer consciousness to utter oblivion, as, say, Timex or Dr. Spock (once THE name in advice for parents) or Firestone (a brand so weakened its name was even removed from its own PGA tournament held at the country club bearing its name). Brands can be important, until they aren’t.
 Brand as a holy grail or as a panacea for what ails a business—I buy neither and rail against both. And I strongly caution against pouring capital into a brand, per se.
 Yet, here I am, adding a book on brand-building to my stable of No B.S. books. When I took it on, I had my doubts it could be done without B.S. But, then again, I have had and have a lot of clients with very valuable brands they grew without having to pour oceans of money into them. That is what this book is about, in terms of strategy and tactics: getting a great brand—free. That makes this book radically different from any other books or advice in this category. Everything else about brands is piled high at one end of the library. This little book sits by itself, at the far, opposite end.

##### A Brand Atheist. A Brand Believer.

###### I am fundamentally a direct marketing guy. That means I want to be able to accurately, ruthlessly measure a money return on each and every dollar invested, preferably quickly. No ambiguity. No vague idea of gain by awareness. Show me the money. It also means I want direct response. Outreach that brings a customer to the door, credit card in hand. Big, valuable brands can and are created as free by-products of this kind of direct-marketing activity, including many owned by past or present clients of mine. Weight Watchers, a famous brand built with no brand-building advertising. Guthy-Renker’s Proactiv®, an $800-million-a-year business with a brand worth at least five times that much, created, built and sustained without brand or image advertising—one I’m proud to have made some small contributions to from time to time. Priceline.com, originally raised from scratch by hard-core direct-response radio advertising created and managed by my colleague and friend, Fred Catona at Bulldozer Media. The fast-growth software, Infusionsoft, which you’ll read about later in the book. These are all valuable brands that weren’t bought.
 There is one brand I know more about than any other, and we’ll start this book’s journey with it . . .
 This odd photo represents a powerful and valuable brand.

###### It was first used in 1993, and has since been in perpetual and proliferate use, adorning literature, book covers, catalogs, newsletters, websites, even a bobblehead doll.
 It’s a (much younger) me, on a rented albino bull—the bull itself a celebrity, having appeared in two Disney films and at countless trade show booths and shopping center grand openings. Its name is Tiny. Mine is Dan Kennedy. And I’m known for being the “No B.S.” guy. The actual business logo representing that brand concept is this:

###### This brand logo has adorned apparel, caps, wall posters, mousepads, jigsaw puzzles, toys, pens, flashlights, as well as books, newsletters, websites, and more.
 These brand images mean something to those they mean something to. Maybe you are one of those people, maybe not (yet). But maybe its obvious meaning attracted you to or interested you in this very book. No B.S. is pretty straightforward. It means blunt, unmitigated, unqualified truth. It’s said that there is a small market for the truth, and I have found that to be the truth—but it is a small and mighty market: a rabid, appreciative, and loyal audience. Being a truth-teller is not the easiest road to prosperity to travel, but it has proved itself a very reliable and rewarding one.

##### This Gets to the Question: What, Exactly, Is a Brand?

###### In the old West, it was an identifying mark burned onto livestock with a fire-heated iron to thwart rustlers and cattle thieves. In similar fashion, businesses and individuals try to mark themselves with a distinct brand and embed that brand in the minds of the public at large or a specific, targeted population, to thwart copycatting and commoditization. It can be said about

###### a very distinctive comedian, like the late Steven Wright, or Andrew Dice Clay, or my friend Joan Rivers, that they have a particular brand of humor. Serious students or even great fans of comedy would likely recognize a Steven Wright or Joan Rivers joke if written out on a 3-by-5 card. For a couple of decades, Cadillac was so branded on the public brain as the symbol of excellence and status that the phrase “The Cadillac of . . .” was used to describe (and nearly co-brand) all sorts of non-auto products. “This, madam, is the Cadillac of vacuum cleaners,” said the door-to-door salesman to the happy homemaker.
 A brand can be a representation of a philosophy or a philosophical position, a reason to do business with a person or entity, an instant message that communicates what a person or product or business is about. It can be aggressive or gentle, bold or subtle. It can represent the values or aspirations of a community of consumers or followers. It can be represented by a name in distinct typeface like Disney’s or IBM’s or by a distinctive image like Apple’s or the Playboy bunny. Many great brands are actually ideas, like Chicken Soup for the Soul (see pages 231 to 234), or another of my created brands:

 This is a philosophy and lifestyle brand. It marries two great aspirations. A whole lot of people would like to be rich. If you doubt it, watch the number of people buying Power Ball tickets as giant jackpots mount. And a whole lot of people like thinking of themselves as renegades, and many more would love to be, if they dared or felt they could afford the luxury. A lot of successful brands are aspirational, like Cadillac and Martha Stewart.
 A lot of what people believe about brand value, based on academic theory, Madison Avenue ad agencies and their frequent conning of big,

###### dumb companies’ leaders out of shareholders’ money, and simple assumption that brand automatically equals power is just B.S., piled high. A lot of money is wasted by small-business owners and entrepreneurs on brand-building strategies that mimic those of big, dumb companies. A brand can be a big drain into which money gets poured. Kind of like a yacht or a California divorce. Or, a brand can be a valuable asset, with much of that value measurable. Very accurate appraisal of brand equity occurs through brand licensing. Personalities like Gene Simmons (KISS) and Martha Stewart have been paid hundreds of millions of dollars to attach their names to all manner of products. There are, for example, KISS condoms and KISS caskets—as Gene puts it, brand licensing money made from the cradle to the grave.
 A brand can be important to consumers in different ways. It can, as I said before, help cut through marketplace clutter and chaos and sheer quantity of noise, to make choosing within a category easy and efficient. It can often be a guarantee of consistency, of a certain kind or level of experience, so that the consumer can know in advance what to expect, and what not to expect. It can provide pride of ownership and status; it can enable somebody to be in “the cool kids’ club;” it can stroke one’s ego: I am because I own. It can validate a person’s values or aspirations: I am a good mother because I serve this brand of food. It can satisfy at an emotional level, as with nostalgia brands.
 We will explore everything a brand can and can’t be and can and can’t do for you or your business in this book. Most importantly, we will dispel B.S., and we will be clear about wise strategies to develop and build brand identity and equity without direct investment.
 I have never spent a cent on outright brand advertising of any sort, yet within my chosen target markets my personal brand is strong—meaning, people know me, know what I’m about, and know what to expect when dealing with me. And my business brands are well recognized by customers, clients, readers, subscribers, and the fields in which I conduct business. The members of the organization built by me and around me, GKIC, which publishes the No B.S. Marketing Letter, identify with and have affinity for the No B.S. brand. In fact, many own logo apparel, desk ornaments, and various items linked to that brand. What might surprise some is that I have no interest in everybody recognizing these brands. Nor

###### in just anybody recognizing them. I have very deliberately made myself what I call a famous person nobody’s ever heard of—except the select audience that is of the highest value to me and best fit with me. One of the great myths of brand-building is that a brand’s value is proportionate to the raw numbers of those who know it. That can be true, but it isn’t always true.
 Business and marketing decisions, especially those about your brands, need to follow a linear path:

 Principle > Strategies > Tactics

 Great brands stand for something. Sam Walton knew exactly what he wanted Walmart to be when it grew up, and could clearly enunciate a handful of core principles. Ray Kroc had three principles on which to govern the growth of McDonald’s. The extremely successful celebrity- entrepreneur Kathy Ireland, who spoke at one of GKIC’s annual Marketing and Moneymaking SuperConferences[SM], explained there the key principles behind her brand, which now supports thousands of products and drives a multi-million-dollar empire. Walt Disney put his business’s number-one principle into its slogan and Unique Selling Proposition, something of a feat: The Happiest Place On Earth. The over-arching principle of all my work, represented by my brand, is truth-telling. Absolute, unvarnished, bare naked truth-telling. Brands backed by principle tend to outsell, outperform, and outlast brands that aren’t. If you stand for nothing, you can be felled by just about anything.
 From principle come strategies. Each of the above examples followed that path. If you obtain and read the autobiographies and biographies of these men and women and of other great entrepreneurs who’ve built powerful personal or business brands, you will find that each of their few chief principles drove a plethora of strategic decisions. I’ll use myself as an example here, and rattle off a sampling of strategic decisions mandated by my chief principle, in no particular order:

 • I have been selective, discriminating, and deliberate in the clients,
 customers, members, and fans I’ve sought and deliberately, overtly repelled others—so that I could be a truth-teller at all times, in every piece of work (book, newsletter, seminar, etc.) without worry over


-----

###### who I might offend or what sale or revenue I might lose by not sugar-coating or walking on tiptoes on the thin ice of political correctness.
 • I have focused on entrepreneurial business owners, business builders,
 and CEOs rather than larger, perhaps more lucrative corporate clients —because I understand and admire the determined entrepreneur but often question the very sanity and competence of corporate executives.
 • I’ve never sold or permitted anyone else to sell anything to my
 clientele, members, followers without at least a 30-day unconditional guarantee—because if any individual feels they were not told the truth about a product or service, I do not want them feeling stuck with something “false” to them.
 • I have been personally transparent with my members and clientele.
 For example, I have written and publicly spoken about my now long, long ago bankruptcy; my long ago heavy boozing; and I use my marketing misfires and flops as well as my successes as teaching examples. Contrary to the caution that business and politics don’t mix, the folks who follow me have no doubt about where I stand on political matters.

 Just to give you a couple non-Dan examples: Farm-to-table restaurants are based on a certain obvious principle. This governs strategic choices about physical location, menu items and food sources and vendors, and tactical decisions about price. Ralph Nader’s quixotic presidential campaigns (that made him a bestselling author, popular speaker, media personality—and quite wealthy) centered on being against corporate influence in politics, and this principle governed strategy about who he would and could not take donations or other support from, then tactical decisions about how he could and would raise money and finance campaigns. Bill Cosby determined he never wanted to do anything his young daughter or aging mother would be embarrassed to hear or watch. This principle governed strategic career choices about agents and managers, film and TV projects, down to the tactical choices of jokes, comedy material, and words he would and would not use.
