##### In my experience we have the best success with increasing prospects’ response by getting them to attend a free lunch or dinner event instead of having to go to the office. We accomplish this by sending out a direct-mail letter inviting the prospect to a special lunch or dinner where the doctor will give a presentation on their specific ailment. For example, if we are targeting those with migraines, then the invitation will talk about migraine pain and stress that there is a solution for that they may not be aware of, but that will be fully explained by the doctor at the free lunch or dinner event.
 With my doctor clients, once the prospect arrives at the lunch or dinner event, the doctor will proceed to give a presentation on migraines and share all the pain points the prospects are most likely dealing with. Then the doctor presents the solution and explains how treatment can reduce the pain and possibly take it away completely.
 The presentation offers an inexpensive consultation. The goal is to book consultations in the office within the next day or two. Once the prospect comes into the office and receives the full evaluation, the doctor can then present the treatment plan.
 Up to this point, there is nothing special about getting targeted prospects to attend a free lunch or dinner and then sign up for a low-priced evaluation. As long as the list is targeting migraines, you should be able to get people to attend.
 The hard part comes with getting someone to spend $5,000.00 to $12,000.00 on a treatment program. How can we increase the likelihood that these prospects convert into patients?
 The key is to start off on the right foot by being very specific in selecting our mailing list. Not only do we want a mailing list that targets people who suffer from migraines, but we also want to include a selection of a Value Score or Credit Score that is high enough to show that these prospects can afford the treatment or are qualified to receive funding for the treatment.
 In most cases, we are targeting seniors, so a Value Score, or Credit Score, will work better than selecting for a high income. In many cases, seniors will have a lower fixed income, but have hundreds of thousands in the bank—a very nice nest egg. So if you select based on income, you could end up missing a large portion of your qualified, affluent buyers.

##### A few other selects (criteria) that I’ve found help increase response rate are home ownership and being married. But the key to marketing to the affluent in this niche is to select by Value Score or Credit Score.

 Example #2: Financial Investing Now let’s look at another example in a different industry. This is for one of my clients, OptionSellers.com, an investment firm offering individually managed option-selling portfolios to highnet-worth investors.
 Selling options is appealing to many investors because it’s an alternative investment that can make money regardless of whether the market is moving up or down. Many investors use the services of OptionSellers because they are specialized experts in option selling.
 What’s unique about OptionSellers is that they traditionally only want to work with clients who have at least $2 million in net worth. Plus, these individuals need to be open to an alternative investment (not stocks and not real estate). This can be a very tough group of affluent prospects to get to respond. So, how do we find these individuals?
 First we need to create sales copy that speaks specifically to this group. We intentionally use wording like, “If you are an investor with a net worth of $2 million or more …”
 By calling them out like this in the sales copy, we will get their attention if they have a high net worth. It also discourages those who should not respond. Prospects who do not meet the net worth requirement are less likely to respond because we are telling them in the sales letter that they are not a fit.
 We also write sales copy that grabs the attention of those seeking alterative investments. We say, “Are you sick and tired of the lack of diversification and lackluster returns offered by your traditional investments?” The goal is to grab the attention of those who are unhappy with the results of traditional investments and want to try something different.
 The sales letter leads to an offer for a free book and DVD. This is a low barrier to entry. Prospects do not feel they are being sold something. Instead, we are educating them on how to sell options. Once they learn how


-----

##### the technique works, they may feel more comfortable taking the next step and setting up a consultation.
 In addition to having the right sales copy to attract the appropriate prospects, we also need to use lists that are going to generate a good response.
 On the list side, I select lists of prospects who have purchased other products and services that relate to alternative investments, such as a subscription to a newsletter on making international investments. Or it might be a group of prospects who have purchased a course on trading commodities. Or it might be investors who are purchasing Gold and Silver. The best list sources are made up of those who have responded to a prior marketing campaign related to alternative investments.
 The second criterion is to find those with investable assets of $500,000.00 or more, indicating that they have a large sum of money available to invest. An investable asset is money not currently tied up in another investment. This is important because it means prospects have money immediately available to invest.
 Once again, it’s the combination of list, copy, and offer all working together that gets these affluent investors to respond.

 Example #3: Real Estate Investing The last example I’ll give is for another of my clients, Teton Land & Development Group. They are looking for affluent real estate investors who want to invest in one of their many resort communities.
 They have a few challenges they must address. They need affluent prospects who are not only interested in real estate investing, but who are okay with investing in a specific location: Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
 We are able to deal with these challenges the same way we addressed the challenges in finding affluent patients for doctors and affluent alternative investors for OptionSellers. We succeed by specifying a targeted list, the right sales copy, and an appealing offer.
 Teton’s first issue is addressed by looking for affluent prospects on the list side. I find mailing lists made up of prospects who have a high net worth or have investable assets of $500,000.00 or more (similar to


-----

##### OptionSellers). I also find prospects who are interested in real estate investing.
 But even though we may find many prospects who are interested in real estate investing, the fact is that most want to invest in an area located near them. They want the option to easily visit the property they are investing in. Unfortunately, if we limited the mailing universe to a 200-mile radius around Jackson Hole, there would not be enough investors to keep growing this business. And this is where the sales copy must carry the load.
 In order to get prospects to respond to a real estate investment that’s not in their area, we need sales copy that promotes how extremely unusual it is to own property in a resort/national landmark area. We need to stress that this opportunity is limited and may not be around forever.
 The sales piece describes the location as being in one of the “most beautiful areas in the western hemisphere, Jackson Hole, Wyoming.” We make it clear to the prospect how limited and rare it is to find property in Jackson Hole and what an exclusive opportunity this is. Once all the property is sold, you can’t simply produce more. When the supply is gone, assuming the demand continues, the only option is for the real estate price to go up.
 We also invite prospects to come to Jackson Hole to visit the property. We say, “I’d love to personally host your trip here to Jackson Hole so you can see up close and in person what we have going on. I know you’ll love it here …”
 Of course, the offer is not to come visit Jackson Hole; that’s just an option we make available so they know they are welcome to visit if they want to. The offer is simply to get prospects to request more information. This makes affluent prospects feel as though they can educate themselves on this possible investment without having to commit to a sales call or a trip to Wyoming. With a high-priced product like this, or the other examples we looked at here, we have to ease the prospect to the final commitment in easy stages.

 Summary To summarize what we’ve learned from our three examples, first, you must do everything you can to find the affluent prospect on targeted mailing lists.


-----

##### The more specific you can be in pinpointing your prospect, the better. Second, you also need to make sure you use sales copy that will draw in the truly interested prospects and repel the tire kickers. And third, you need to make an offer that is an easy, non-threatening entry point. We don’t want to scare off prospects by making them feel as if they are going to be hit with a lengthy sales presentation to pressure them into something. Rather, we want to help educate them and then, if they choose, they can take the next steps.
 One final word: if you’ve gotten prospects this far, be prepared to take them the rest of the way. Once they’ve raised their hand and showed interest by attending an event or requesting more information, you must do everything you can to keep them engaged and get them to take the next step of scheduling an assessment or consultation.

#### CHAPTER 24

### Using Social Media to Reach the Affluent

##### By Cindy Cyr

# One in four purchases is influenced by social media in every category.
##### Sometimes this happens in ways you wouldn’t expect. The Gucci open- backed, coyote-fur lined Princetown slipper, which sells for $995.00, would normally just have stayed a runway oddity. However, thanks to social media influencers such as BryanBoy (659,000 followers on Instagram) and Leandra M. Cohen (697,000 followers on Instagram) posting them on their Instagram pages, the slipper became a Gucci staple produced every season.

##### The Drive reported that in 2017 Lamborghini had their seventh consecutive record-breaking year, increasing 10% over the previous year. In the article, Lamborghini’s CEO Stefano Domenicali said he believed their presence on social media played a key role. “We also significantly increased brand awareness, especially with the young generation, proved by the success of our social media channels,” Domenicali said.
 Reaching affluent customers on social media can build your authority, build trust and affinity, give you a bigger presence, circumvent search, and reach affluents directly and more. But to do this, you must arm yourself with a plan.

 Who Should You Be Targeting? Of course, Gucci and Lamborghini are well-established brands, so how can a lesser known brand target the affluent audience on social media? Start by understanding who you should be targeting.
 Affluencers, defined as affluents who are also influencers, is the top category of people you’ll want to target. They influence behavior and shopping habits in their network. They are early adopters of innovative new products and services, tech-driven, and prefer to go off the beaten track when they travel. People come to them for advice. Plus, they don’t just influence others, they spend more in nearly every category than other affluents, spending on average 1.4 times more than the general affluent population.
 On average, affluencers spend 7.5 hours a week on social media and ultra-affluencers spend 9.1 hours, and while affluencers tend to be younger, you’ll find affluencers across every age group. Affluencers differ in age and income depending on what category your product or service falls in. For example, if you’re selling watches or jewelry, affluencers tend to be in their mid-thirties. Home-remodeling and décor lean towards age 39. Planning and retirement, age 45. This doesn’t mean you won’t find affluencers at a different age, though.
 Affluencers like brands on social media, comment on products or brands, share content, look for something to read, and more, including making purchases. In fact, 10% make purchases on social networks. What is important to understand is that when affluencers like your brand on social


-----

##### media, they do so for one of three reasons: 1) They own or use the product or service (for some this is their way of bragging). 2) They are interested in purchasing your product or service soon. 3) They want updates/information on your products or services.

 Know Which Social Media Networks Your Audience Uses and How
 They Use Them Social media is a moving target, so you’ll constantly need to stay on top of which social networks your audience is using to see if they are migrating to a new platform. That said, different social networks are preferred within different categories and at times, even across different age groups. Affluencers across the board use Facebook the most. However, if you look at how much time is spent across a dozen or so other social media sites, it varies depending on the category they have the most influence in. For example, if you are in the travel industry, affluencers’ top four social media sites are Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram. But when comparing that to the general population, LinkedIn comes in last place on the list of 11 social media sites.
 If you are in a food and drink category, fashion, or home decorating category, you may find that Instagram and Pinterest are among your top social media networks. The point is to determine what networks are the best for your practice or business and spend more time creating a fleshed-out presence there. Keep an eye out for changes in the social media landscape and reduce time on platforms that are not delivering lead generation and awareness.

 Setting Up Social Media for Success No doubt you can find information on how to set up any social media network out there. But here are a few things you’ll want to do no matter what platform(s) you choose.

  1.  Fill out ALL your information across all of your social media
 accounts. Affluents search for businesses on social media. Make it convenient for them to get all the information they need without having to go dig for it or click a bunch of times. Your contact info,


-----

##### hours, website, ALL of your locations, popular times to visit, and so on should be listed. (Some profiles have limited space so be concise.)  2.  Make sure your information is consistent across all platforms.
 Affluents are keen on detail. Keep an eye out and make sure your business name, address, phone number, website, hours, payment options, parking info, and so on are the same on every social site you join. If your hours or some other piece of information differs from one social media site to the next, you’ll not just lose trust, you could lose them altogether.  3.  Optimize for search and filters. For every profile you create (or
 listing on a review site), use the categories provided. For some sites, you can add multiple categories and attributes such as payment options. This will help you get your business included in searches and filters.  4.  Invest in quality photos, content, and video. It pays to create
 attractive, well-composed photos. Pay attention to your videos too. I’m often surprised when a business that characterizes themselves as high quality posts something with a junky background or one inconsistent with their message or brand. Recently, I saw a high-end, high-priced publicist post a live video of an event she had been hired to promote. Not only was the video poor quality, but it looked like no one was there. Post good, quality content consistent with your message and what your audience wants to see.  5.  Use personality. There are a number of things affluent consumers
 find annoying on social media, and not having any personality is one of them. Other things you’ll want to stay away from is posting too many promotions, using slang or jargon, and trying to be funny when you’re not.  6. Reply to comments and messages. This should be obvious; however,
 it is surprising how many business people don’t answer people on social networks. You have an opportunity to start or build a relationship with people. Don’t just “like” a comment, reply to it. Check your messages and answer them. Pay attention to who is sharing your posts. If they share it, go make a comment on the shared post on their page. Unless you are getting hundreds of shares,
