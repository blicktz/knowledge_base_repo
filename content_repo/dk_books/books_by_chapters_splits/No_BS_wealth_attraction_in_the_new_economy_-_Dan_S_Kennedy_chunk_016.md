 • Where are your best prospective
 customers/clients/patients? (What do they read? Watch? Listen to? Where do they go, congregate?)
 • Where can you place yourself that elevates your status and
 importance?
 • Where can you place yourself that showcases and
 demonstrates your expertise?
 • Who or what can you associate yourself with that your best
 prospective customers/clients/patients pay attention to, respect, or are involved with?

 Do Something

#### M y friend and business legend, the late Gary Halbert’s favorite saying was: “Motion beats meditation.” It would probably amaze a lot of people if they could know the inside story of a lot of “rags to riches” entrepreneurs’ lives as I do, to discover that just about the only reason for their meteoric success was simply getting into motion, ready or not.
 Recently, recession has brought on a whole new level of mental and emotional paralysis; businesspeople at all levels have been affected. This paralysis is juxtaposed with the growing importance of speed-to-market and agile, continuous change. In The New Economy, rewards will be taken by those who act. Those who have historically lagged behind and survived off crumbs left behind by leaders will now discover there aren’t any crumbs left. More than ever, it’s necessary to put premium and priority on action .
 Some years ago, I had an opportunity to spend a day with Lee Iacocca, in my consulting work. I was thrilled to do so, as I had long studied him, his business methods, and his personal behavior. I often tell the entrepreneurs I

#### coach about how highly Iacocca prizes decisiveness and action, a fact perhaps best illustrated by his story of the rebirth of the convertible at the financially troubled Chrysler. Iacocca led Chrylser back from the brink, restoring its profitability, marketplace strength, and even repaying loans guaranteed by the government ahead of schedule. Factory workers caught him walking around and suggested that one of the cars would make a great convertible. He told them to get a blowtorch, cut the roof off, let him drive it around and see how people reacted. And the rest, as they say, is history. The relaunch of the convertible by Chrysler probably attracted more media and public attention and brought more money to Chrysler at a faster pace than any other idea ever acted on in the company’s history. All because there was that rare CEO in place who heard a good idea and immediately acted on it. No design committees, no focus groups, no endless meetings of engineers, no long-delayed prototype. A blowtorch.
 Sadly, of course, all these years later, Chrysler found its way back to the brink of bankruptcy, as did the even more venerable giant, GM. There were many contributing factors, but two of the biggest were delaying and delaying and delaying actions on festering, cancerous problems; denial, denial and more denial about a changed and changing marketplace. In some respects, it’s fitting that these companies became wards of the state, as they functioned for too long like government bureaucracies rather than like businesses. Ford fared better by doing more, more quickly. Its fate is still in question as I write this, but Ford is certainly the most likely to succeed of the three.
 The lesson is that problems rarely improve with age. Opportunities wait for no one .
 For the teleseminars and audio programs produced for Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] Members, I get to interview an eclectic mix of authors, experts, entrepreneurs, marketers, and innovators. One of my favorites has been an author I’ve long studied and admired, Robert Ringer. You may know him from his most famous best-selling book, Winning Through Intimidation, republished as To Be or Not To Be Intimidated. I rank it as one of the ten most influential books I have ever read, and credit it with directing me to my practice of “Takeaway Selling” described in a companion to this book: No B.S. Sales Success in The New Economy . When I interviewed Mr. Ringer about his newer book, titled Action!: Nothing Happens Until Something Moves, I said on the teleseminar, if you

#### I often say, if poor people knew how shockingly ordinary millionaires were, there’d be a lot more millionaires. One of the biggest erroneous ideas preventing poor people from getting rich is that the rich are somehow smarter or possess some “magic gene” that separates them from the masses in terms of aptitude or capability. Nothing could be further from the truth. I work very closely, day in and day out, with many millionaire and multi- millionaire entrepreneurs, and I assure you, we aren’t that much smarter than the clerk at the corner convenience store. I have clients personally earning millions of dollars a year who forget to put on their shoes when they leave the house, have walked through the screen door on the front of my house without noticing it was there, are woefully dysfunctional managers, incredibly disorganized, slow readers, can’t do math, etc. In fact, one, who has built a national chain of tax preparation offices serving hundreds of thousands of clients can’t, himself, add two numbers together without a calculator and couldn’t decipher a financial statement if you put a gun against his head. The richest real estate investor I work with was a car mechanic, another a prison guard. But there is one thing they all do that the vast majority of the population doesn’t. The “little” difference is the subject of Ringer’s book: these people take action.
 In Action!, Robert Ringer wrote “I have always believed that the difference between success and failure, in any area of life, is not nearly as

#### great as most people might suspect.” I not only agree, I have abundant proof from the more than 100 “from-scratch” millionaires I’ve worked with, from their stumbling beginnings to their present wealth, celebrity, expert credibility, and achievements.

#### The act of taking action is, in and of itself, a magnet for
 opportunity and wealth.

#### You’ve undoubtedly seen, in many movies, the guns with body-heat- seeking technology that make the person trying to hide appear in neon red or green, as he moves in the dark jungle, generating body heat. You’ve heard of heat-seeking missiles. There’s a similar effect with action and wealth. Wealth seeks movement .
 Over the years, I’ve found that just about everybody has at least one really good idea, skill, or talent that could translate to prosperity and success. I once briefly dated a divorced mother with three young kids, working in a low-wage factory job, barely staying one day ahead of bills. I discovered she occasionally found time to paint—and my jaw dropped when I saw the paintings. I own racehorses, and there are several artists who have become famous in the racing industry as horse portrait artists. People routinely pay them thousands of dollars to paint portraits of their horses. Several sell their original paintings for tens of thousands of dollars. This woman’s work was as good or better than any of those established and successful artists. As a marketing pro, without breaking a sweat, I was able to lay out a plan for her to enter this world, first locally, then nationally, and easily, quickly, make more money in a month than she was currently making all year—and achieve her stated number-one goal in life: to be a

#### stay-at-home mom, there for her kids. Giving such free advice is almost always futile, as it was here. In fact, she had already thought of many of the things I suggested. But had never acted on those thoughts. And never will.

 There are all sorts of reasons for this inaction. Poor self-image, lack of confidence, not being able to see yourself doing it. Ignorance. Laziness. Procrastination. Waiting for better timing, more resources. The list of excuses for inaction and status quo acceptance is long, and, of course,

#### useless and valueless. If you seek to attract wealth into your life, you have to get the list out of your life.
 I have had this exact same experience thousands of times. When I was doing interviews, appearances, and seminars for one of my previous books, How To Make Millions with Your Ideas, I had almost identical conversations with one person after another. Whenever someone finds out what I do, they tell me of their great idea that they’ve never acted on. Every cab and limo driver has a book he hasn’t written and never will—although one did, and it led to the HBO series Taxicab Confessions. I once spoke at a very special, high-priced seminar for entrepreneurs, where experts in direct marketing via home shopping channels like QVC and HSN, infomercials, and radio all spoke and worked with about 100 attendees. Everyone there had an “idea” for a product that would be terrific for sale on QVC. None acted on their ideas except one, who subsequently sold millions of dollars worth of his invented item on QVC. Being the one that takes action is entirely a matter of choice.
 Everybody has ideas. Everybody has latent talents. Everybody has ability.
 Few act on them. And make no mistake: There is no wealth to be found in an idea. There is only wealth to be had from acting on an idea.
 This is so important, I want to relate several stories of people I work with, to illustrate the way they behave when presented with a worthy idea. The details of their businesses are not all that important, and you should avoid being distracted by them. Instead, focus on the way they responded to ideas and opportunities.
 I mentioned Dr. Chris Tomshack earlier. He was an owner of four successful chiropractic practices when he was at a meeting of one of my coaching groups, with about 15 other clients, and we were discussing what each person thought of as the best aspects, assets, or strengths of their respective businesses, as well as their greatest frustrations and dislikes with their businesses. For each, I had a few pointed suggestions including a “big idea.” In his case, it was escaping the day to day detail of practice and leveraging his outstanding marketing by franchising his clinic, something tried a few times but never successfully done in chiropractic. He went home, devised a plan, called, consulted with me, went home and went to work—and in the first 2 years zoomed to 240 franchised clinics nationwide,

#### recognized by Entrepreneur magazine as one of the fastest growth franchise companies. I’m sorry to say that I don’t think any of the others ever acted on their “big ideas.” The difference between where Chris is now and where they are now has a lot less to do with the relative quality of their ideas than it does with the quantity of action.
 In fact, enough action is almost irresistible to the marketplace, which I’ll get to a bit later, in Section II of this book. That’s an advanced secret .
 One other story: Late in his life, I did some work with Joe Cossman, formally known as E. Joseph Cossman, and best known as the man who popularized the now iconic 1950s toy, The Ant Farm. Joe was a mail-order marketer who made ten different million dollar fortunes by finding ten different, existent, under-marketed products and bringing them to different avenues of distribution. He invented nothing. And, as he was the first to admit, he didn’t do a thing anybody else couldn’t do. As an example, he found a product, “fly cake,” being manufactured and sold to the military, hospitals, and other institutions in bulk, to be put into buildings to trap and kill flies. He secured mail-order rights and sold it to homeowners, initially with small magazine and newspaper ads, then through countless catalogs. The manufacturer could have done it, but didn’t—didn’t experiment with any means of selling the product except the one method he started with.
 The story of The Ant Farm is even more instructive. When Joe found it, its manufacturer was selling it only to schools, as a teaching aid for biology and earth-sciences classrooms. He recognized that kids would love to have this thing for themselves, and turned it into a blockbuster success as a toy. Joe told me he rarely went a week or two without hearing from a school teacher somewhere who said, “You know, I had the idea to do this before you did.” I’m sure thousands of teachers did. None acted on their idea.
 Getting into action on an idea is, itself, magnetic to opportunity and the resources needed to move it forward.
 One day, while visiting my client, Greg Renker of the Guthy-Renker Corporation—then a fledgling direct marketing firm with a few TV infomercials under its belt, today a billion-dollar-a-year marketing conglomerate—he said, “I’d pay at least $10,000.00 to come to your office for a day, poke around in all your files and make copies of whatever interested me—you’ve probably got more samples of great ads, sales letters, and copy than anybody I know.” By the time I got home, I’d toyed with the idea of holding days at my house when people came, paid, and got

#### to attack all my files, but rejected it due to its obvious nuisance factor. Instead I reasoned, if he’d pay $10,000.00, there are more who’d pay $1,000.00, and a lot more who’d pay a few hundred—if that experience was packaged and delivered. I narrowed the focus to all the marketing examples and information in my files about the sale of information—books, courses, seminars, and the like. The next day I wrote the first draft of the sales letter for a product, describing me dumping out all my files and photocopying the most interesting stuff and binding it together, and telling the story of the conversation with Greg as its genesis. Key words: the next day. You see, I got into motion, immediately.
 A day or so later, I was having a phone conversation with Gary Halbert, mentioned earlier in this chapter, about my conversation with Greg Renker, the idea, the sales letter I’d started for the product-to-be, now called “The Ultimate Information Entrepreneur’s Collection.” He said his newsletter subscribers would love to get their hands on it, and offered to sell it to them, splitting revenues. Within a month, we sold over $200,000.00 worth. Another direct marketer with a big list of people interested in different kinds of business opportunities saw the mailing Gary and I did to his list, called me, asked to take it to his list, and the next month we sold over $100,000.00 worth of the big, ugly, clunky, photocopied manuals. This all before I even had a chance to sell it to my own customers! And this was some 25 years ago, when $300,000.00 was a good-sized chunk of change. This giant manual, slightly improved, lives on today (incidentally, available from Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] at DanKennedy.com ). I suppose it’s generated at least a few million dollars in its lifetime.
 If space permitted, I could tell you another 20 very similar stories of my getting into motion with an idea and having the motion itself seem to attract the people, opportunity, resources, money needed to move forward. I said “seem” because I can’t prove a concrete connection, but, personally, I don’t believe in repetitive patterns of coincidence.
 Bill Glazer owned two clothing stores in Baltimore, which he’d made fabulously successful with unusual and innovative marketing strategies based, in large part, on ideas he got from my books and courses. He sought me out when he saw I was coming to Baltimore and we had lunch. When he showed me what he was doing, I told him he should resell all his advertising and marketing to other clothing store owners, and I gave him a business plan to do so. It is a relatively formulaic approach to what I call
