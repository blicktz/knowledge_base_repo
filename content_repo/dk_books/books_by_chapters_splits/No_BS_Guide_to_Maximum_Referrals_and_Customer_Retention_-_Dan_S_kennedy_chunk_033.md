#### My Two Instructions
##### My message about all social media and about this book is a simple one: Be careful and be demanding. Brook no bullshit.
 Consider Twitter’s own CFO, Anthony Noto, who infamously erred in sending a private message out into the public arena. As he painfully discovered, once such an error—of mechanics or of impulse—is made, it can be forwarded to the universe—fast—and it can’t be stopped.
 The news is chock-full of executives, celebrities, and athletes being wounded, and, in a few cases, ruined by an ill-advised tweet or Facebook post. Or, for that matter, hacked email. Even the private is no longer reliably private. Sony Pictures execs found this out. These same mistakes made even more commonly by small-business owners and entrepreneurs never make the TV news or get reported in The Wall Street Journal, but they foster mayhem just the same. This is also an environment where every complainant and every looney bird has a megaphone. The more you are present and active, the more you expose yourself to their type of social media terrorism: negative reviews, outright attacks, and bothersome complaints to the Facebooks of the world. This must be closely monitored and managed. It’s a price of playing in this sandbox. It carries an actual price tag.


-----

##### Be careful, too, not to treat any or all of this as a replacement for any other media or for a sensible multimedia business strategy. The worst number in business is one. Don’t count Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., as three, five, or 50. Social media is One. If you are overly dependent on any One, you are overly vulnerable. At enormous risk.
 My client Chris Cardell in the UK is extremely clever about using Facebook profitably. At the time I wrote this, he was merrily minting money with it. But you couldn’t take direct mail away from him at gunpoint. He also uses pay-per-click and email, online video sales letters, radio, TV, and newspapers. He won’t be caught being lazy about this. And if Facebook boots him from the castle, he’ll survive quite well. More than enough will still be coming for tea ‘n crumpets.
 A different client, after months of tussling with Facebook, getting booted and then getting back in, finally walked away. It has upped its advertising in newspapers nationwide, and is happy about the results.
 I can’t tell you what your decisions should be. However, this book can certainly help you make the best possible choice. What I can tell you with ironclad certainty is that overdependence puts you in peril. The only secure strategy is a multimedia marketing strategy and a multichannel sales strategy.
 If you are a success with social media, fine. This book can be a huge help. But if more than 20% of your leads, customers, or revenue comes from social media or more than 20% of your relationship with customers relies on it, you are a fool who is cruisin’ for a bruisin’.
 Next, be demanding. In a poll reported in USA Today, 61% of small- business owners could not document or prove any direct return on their investments in social media activity, yet 50% said they were increasing time and money commitments—and only 7% said they were cutting back on it. Incredible. The CEO of a social media agency insisted those latter business owners were wrong. He claimed they do get returns from social media activity—they just don’t know what they are when they see them. If you like being told you are an idiot, you’d love this guy. I sleep pretty soundly, but I know if I’ve had sex during the night, and nobody’s going to tell me I am having a lot of sex but just not smart enough to know it.
 After one of retail’s big days, Black Friday, another USA Today article reported an increase in social media campaigns by retailers like Walmart,


-----

##### Sears, and Amazon of 40%, yet IBM Smarter Commerce (which tracks sales of the top 500 retail sites) reported a decrease in online sales that day. Then an expert said, “While it may be hard to track how all this drives sales, most retailers agree that having people talking about their brand or store is better than not.” If that is consensus-thinking, the consensus is made up of morons who’ve lost a grip on the business they’re in. You are not in the business of being talked about. You are in the business of selling things. You are not in the buzz business. You are in The Money Business. Refuse to be dissuaded from that simple, straightforward fact.

#### The Marketing Success Triangle Has NOT Changed
##### RIGHT Markets Get RIGHT Message By RIGHT Media.
 Simply broadcasting a message to millions by social media accomplishes little, for most businesses. Companies like GoPro (the camera company) and Red Bull are great examples of brand-builders using viral videos and social media to rise from obscurity to fame in the marketplace. But your business is probably not kin to theirs. You have to be very careful —again that advice: Be careful—to model and emulate businesses with much in common with your own. Capital and human resources, for example. If you are funding your business’s growth from its profits or money borrowed by mortgaging your home and your grandma’s wheelchair, you are in an entirely different place than a company into which hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital and Wall Street money flows.
 Further, viral explosions are not all they’re cracked up to be, as Greg Levitt of 33Across.com, a social media sharing platform, admits. From his firm’s research:

 • Consumers are most likely to share articles, news, and content related
 to science, but only 9% of person-to-person recipients click on the shared links regarding these topics.
 • Timely news and political items are less widely shared at 2%, but the
 click rates are 86% and 77%, respectively.
 • Business-related: only a 4% share, and a 24% click on the shared
 links.


-----

##### • Health: 3% share, 15% click.
 • Celebrity and entertainment: 2% share, but 40% click.
 • Consumer reviews of products, businesses: 1% share, 4% click.
 • Personal finance: 1% share, 11% click.

 (The above stats were based on 500 publishers of online content.) Levitt explains the wide disparity between share and click rates as “ego sharing”: senders sharing content they believe boosts their perceived intelligence, informed status, etc., regardless of whether they think recipients will find it interesting or not. The overall average is 3% sharing of content, 24% of recipients clicking on shared links.
 To me, this says there are only two useful plays: First, work with a tightly targeted list of thought-leader, market-leader, and influential recipients to deliver content of high interest and value that enhances their status if shared—to hit or beat the 3% bar, but so that the 24% of those recipients shared with are ideal for you; or second, you need a massive volume outreach, so the 3% matters.
 The stats about forwarding/sharing of “reviews” about products and businesses suggest that angst over this—and time and money spent on it— may be overdone.
 Ironically, and in the face of what I have pointed out above, you can make a case that it is important to include social media as part of your integrated marketing plan. But approach it strategically, with the same direct response and sound business principles that you would in any other media channel. Social media is no different than any other media.

#### The Stuff of Bank Deposits Has NOT Changed
##### You can’t go to the bank and deposit likes, views, retweets, viral explosions, social media conversations, or brand recognition. Bankers are extremely narrow-minded. They won’t even accept vegetables grown in your backyard garden or bitcoin. They want real money.
 You must insist on exactly the same thing, from all media. Contrary to popular belief, no media is different. No media gets a pass because it is


-----

##### different. Don’t be fooled. Be open-minded, creative, and opportunistic. But always keep a watchful eye on the bottom line.
 Opportunism and skepticism are not mutually exclusive. They can and should work in concert, like partners, like Walt Disney The Visionary and Roy Disney The Money Watcher worked in tandem. Approach social media this way, and you’ll avoid being burnt.

#### From In Desperate Need to In-Demand

##### by Kim Walsh-Phillips

 I have a sign in my office that defines my modus operandi since becoming a Dan Kennedy convert:

 In God we trust, all others bring data.
 —William Edwards Deming

 Like so many, my introduction to Dan was through his No B.S. Guide to DIRECT Marketing for NON-Direct Marketing Businesses. That was the starting point of a series of life-changing events that led to the unlikely combination of a legendary contrarian marketer (who is not a fan of social media or women with hyphenated last names) writing a book with a female marketing maven who uses both social media and a hyphen on an hourly basis.
 It started like this . . . I was thinking to myself, “She looks so beautiful.” My daughter was only a couple of weeks old and was perfect. Blue eyes that sparkled. Ten toes. Ten fingers that loved to wrap around my pinky. Her skin smelled like heaven, and she was beautiful.
 But . . . she cried. A lot. Pretty much anytime she was awake and wasn’t nursing, she cried. She needed me all of the time to comfort her and bring her solace. I was needed by this little person.
 She was sleeping peacefully at this moment and content. Swaddled up in her pink blanket in her pack-and-play, she looked so peaceful. She looked so beautiful.


-----

##### And now it was my time to cry. Warm stinging tears ran down my face as I faced a harsh reality. If I didn’t go back to work in the next week or so, my company would go bankrupt. I had enough cash to cover one more payroll and that was it.
 My baby needed me. My staff needed me. The thing was, up to this point, my business was built on a lot of hard work: 18-hour days/7 days a week sometimes. That was the only way I kept the business afloat. For ten years, our survival was dependent on me running around all day—networking and volunteering for groups like the Chamber and Rotary Club (also known as “working for free”). I would then spend all night doing client work and weekends getting caught up.
 The work we did back then was the traditional marketing agency kind— awareness-based public relations and marketing. We did a lot of branding work for our clients without much thought on how that would result in sales. The truth is, we didn’t know any better.
 We were successful in creating beautiful designs and logos and in getting our clients’ faces in the paper, but nothing we did was measurable. While we were often told how much our clients loved us, we were the “fluff” of the budget. I spent so much time selling new accounts only to lose them at contract renewal time.
 I would staff up for the work we got and then be left covering a big payroll when clients ended their contracts. I kept this house of cards together with cheap imitation Elmer’s Glue® and it worked—but barely.
 When I took time off to take care of my new baby, it all fell apart. I never wanted to be in that position again. Not just for me now, but for my innocent and perfect daughter.
 I am a woman of faith, and so I did the only thing I thought could help . . .
 I prayed. I prayed that the struggles I faced for the last ten years would end. I prayed that I would stop killing myself working around the clock just to be poor. (Let me tell you, there are much better ways to be broke than working your fanny off.) I prayed for dramatic change.
 It was then that my dear friend Jon Toy gave me a book. It was Dan Kennedy’s No B.S. Direct Marketing. In a few days I had devoured it and started putting it into action. A few changes caused dramatic results.


-----

##### Later, I will go into more of what I needed to change in order for those dramatic results to happen. It is important to me that you know that no matter where you are in the journey, you can change the outcome. Starting today.
 And you have a good head start. How is my outcome different now? In every way possible. When we started offering direct response social media services, our monthly fee to manage Facebook was $375. Our clients’ minimum monthly budget is now $5,000. Being ROI focused is very profitable.
 I control my own schedule now, starting early in the morning before my kids wake up and stopping around 5 P.M. to spend the rest of the night with them. I usually have two or three children’s activities to attend during a workday and have arranged my schedule to be there for my children at every milestone, celebration, and heartbreak.
 My big indulgence (besides shoes) is travel, and with the changes I have made to the business, we are able to vacation for ten days, three times per year. Plus I take off most summer Fridays.
 And during these times, my business still grows! The real difference is that now I wake up excited every day for what’s in store. I am so thankful for this journey. The gifts I have bring value to those I work with, and I find great pleasure in doing so.
 And so should you. You have value that should be shared with the world. You just first need to reach those who need you and convince them to respond to your ad.
 Don’t get me wrong. Dan’s cautions are valid. You should only approach social media with caution and only if it makes sense for your business. This book’s goal is to give you the power of knowledge. I want you to approach your decisions on social media with both eyes open, fully informed about what you see.
 I am thankful for this opportunity to share strategies with you and hope you will find at least one idea that makes a difference in your business.
 Back when I was totally broke, working around the clock, I couldn’t have worked any harder—well, without fear of being hospitalized. My real change came when I discovered how to work smarter and not harder.
 So now I ask you to do the same thing. I want you to say to yourself right now:


-----

##### “If it’s not going to get me results, I am not going to do it.” C’mon, I know it’s hokey, but say it out loud right now as a commitment to yourself and your future growth. You have value and deserve to be paid for it.
 “If it’s not going to get me results, I am not going to do it.” You in? If you are in, go ahead and post this on your social media profiles right now:
 If it’s not going to get me results, I am not going to do it. #IAmIn In the next chapter, I have a story about what is possible and real with direct response social media marketing. If you do it right, it attracts new qualified leads and sales even while you are asleep.
 Let’s rock this.

## Social Media Is Not Marketing

#### Media is Not Marketing

##### by Dan Kennedy

 In the 2012 Olympics, U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympian of all time (beating gymnast Larisa Latynina’s prior record of 18 medals). Phelps earned his 19th Olympic medal in the men’s 4 × 200-meter freestyle relay. His current medal count of 22 is made up of 18 gold, two silver, and two bronze.
 Although he had a great Olympics, it could have easily not gone his way.
 In fact, prior to the Olympics Phelps fell short of many people’s expectations, including his own. His problems began after the 2008 Olympics when he got lazy. He stopped doing the things that brought him success in the first place, like going to the pool to train every day. Until 2011, when he was bested by his teammate Ryan Lochte in the 200-meter individual medley at the world championships.
 That’s when Phelps got back to the basics, doing the things he needed to do to win again.
 The funny thing with swimmers is that no matter how long they’ve been swimming, they do the same thing day in, day out to prepare for their races.
 Take U.S. swimmer Dara Torres, who at the age of 41, became the oldest Olympic swimming medalist in history when she won two Olympic
