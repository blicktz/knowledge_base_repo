    How To Manage Your Time,
      To Get Ahead In Life
    At age 20, age 40 seems as far away as a distant planet,
    and age 60 seems inconceivable. At age 40, people
    wonder what the heck happened to all that time between
    age 20 and 40! And at age 60, most adults, sadly, look
    back and see how they wasted and squandered time [—]
    and wish they could do it all over again. Which they can1.
   The "breakthrough idea" to living your life differently and
     getting much more out of your life is "goal-setting."
        If you've never set and systematically achieved goals, the
    idea may be frightening and intimidating. Or you may think
         it is too "pin-stripe suit-y"
     for you. Something other "Ask, and it shall be
    people do, but why should given you; seek and
    you? Or it may strike you ye shall find; knock
    as dull and boring. These and it shall be op>ened
    reactions are natural and unto you."
    understandable, but only -Matthew I'H
    because you don't have
   enough true information Pray to God, but keep
    about goal-setting. Once rovmig to shore!"
    you understand why and - Russian proverb
   how it works, you just
    cannot argue against it.
    Consider the game of baseball or softball. You've
    undoubtedly played it. Maybe you're good at it or know

   to the nearest batting cage, pay our money, get a bucket
   of balls, and let's play "Blind Baseball." The hitter can try
   to hit the balls only while blindfolded.
   He's probably not going to get very many hits.
  Going through life without goals is like playing "Blind Life."
  You are a wandering, meandering soul, bumping into
   things, reacting to things, at the mercy of every little
  breeze or bump in the road. Setting up goals for yourself
    is much like taking the blindfold off.
   Here's another explanation for why goal-setting works.
   Engineers have determined that the weight, per square
   inch, is actually greater from the average woman's single
   spike heel than from an elephant's foot. This is because
    all the woman's weight and power is focused in that tiny
   spike; the elephant's is spread out (diffused) over a much
   broader surface. This is like the power of focus. Or
  perhaps you remember the little experiment you probably
  had to do in junior high science. Focus the sun's rays
   through a magnifying glass and start a fire. The sun's rays
  do not start fires normally, because the heat is diffused
  over a large area. But focus those rays, and you will start
  a fire. When you direct all your **weighf ; energy, creativity,
  power and effort on achieving a very specific goal, you
   benefit from the power of focus.
    HOW TO BEGIN MAKING GOALS
       WORK FOR YOU
   Getting involved in goal-setting first forces you to focus
  your thinking, then your resources, then, finally your

   Forms are provided at the end of this Chapter to engage
   you in the goal-setting process. You'll see that we start
    with LONG-RANGE GOAL IDEAS, for 3 to 5 years away,
    with the process divided into 8 categories of living:
        1. Careers
       2. Money
        3. Social — Friendships
       4. Love Relationships — Family
       5. Physical — Health
       6. Mental — Intellectual
        7. Spiritual — Philosophical
        8. Recreation — Fun
    Next, we move to MEDIUM-RANGE GOALS, for 1 to 3
    years. Next, SHORT-RANGE: 3 to 12 months. Finally
   'THIS MONTH" — what can be done '1his month" to
   move toward the goals you set.
    HOW TO GOVERN THE WAY YOU
     INVEST YOUR TIME WITH GOALS
    For many, the idea of "investing" time is a new way of
    looking at things.

   in class a certain number of hours each day, and now
  maybe you have to be on the job a certain number of
  hours a day It takes a certain number of minutes to drive
   to and from work each day. Time to eat. To sleep. When
  you take all that out, you may have only about 5 or 6
  hours a day of time you truly control. Still, that's a lot. Five
  hours a day is 1 ,825 hours a year. Call that *YOUR TIME."
  Most people let all of this 'YOUR TIME" slip away. Sort of
  evaporate, like a glass of water evaporates into the air as
  the day goes on. At the end of a month or a year, people
   can't really point to many desired changes in any category
   of living resulting from the use of this 'YOUR TIME." In a
  very real sense, they just "spent" that time.
  And, often, they let others detemriine how it would be
   spent. A buddy drops by, says 'Let's shoot hoops," you
  say yes, and go shoot hoops for three hours. There's
  nothing wrong with that, of course. In fact, you might set
  a goal to shoot hoops or othen/vise get at least 5 hours a
  week of physical exercise. So there's nothing wrong with
   that act itself. But over time, if you casually let others
  spend all YOUR TIME for you, on impulse, haphazardly,
  you will probably find yourself disappointed with your
  progress in life.
   'Time is the coin of your life. It is the only
    coin you have and only you can determine how
      it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other
   people spend it for you."
         - Carl Sandburg

                 - Dan Rather
        CBS Evening News Anchor
   When you look at your goals, you'll see there are ways
   you could deliberately "invest" certain amounts of your
    time to move toward achieving them. The difference
   between "spending" and "investing" is that when you
    "spend," you have little to show for it after the fact; when
   you "invest," you have something of tangible value to
   show for it after the fact. There's nothing wrong with
    "spending" a lot of YOUR TIME, but don't you think it'd be
    smart to "invest" some of it?
       THE MAGIC POWER OF
       JUST ONE HOUR A DAY
    Earl Nightingale, one of the most respected authorities of
      all in the field of human potential and self-improvement,
   became convinced that if a person dedicated just one
    hour a day to study one particular subject or skill, he
   would be a world class expert in that subject in less than
    three years.
    Imagine doing nothing but watching videos of great
    players shooting foul shots, studying the mechanics of
    shooting from the line in slow motion, and practicing
    shooting from the line for one hour everyday, every single
    day, for three years. You'd probably get pretty darned
   good at it, even if, in the beginning, you had never
   touched a basketball, watched a basketball game or
   done anything athletic before. (Of course, this IS the kind

  You could apply this to ANYTHING. For example, as you
  may know, people judge you, in part, by your vocabulary.
  Many high school graduates — even some college
  graduates — have very limited vocabularies. Many
  people are unable to confidently and effectively present
   their ideas in the workplace because of limited
  vocabulary.
  So, let's say you decide to significantly expand and
  improve your vocabulary. All you would need to do is set
  aside one hour a day That's all, one hour a day There are
  approximately 50,000 words
   in a typical dictionary. You
  could easily go through "For good or ill,

   Any "big improvemenf ' you want to make can be achieved
    with the magic one hour a day The way you eat an
    elephant is the same way you eat a Big Mac — just one
     bite at a time.
   The famous at-home training method provided by
    Education Direct takes this "one bite at a time" approach
     into account, by the way Only Education Direct offers
    "Career-in-a-Year" planned training. And you work entirely
    at your own pace, using as little as that magic one hour a
    day. "One bite at a time," you can train for an entirely new,
    exciting, high-paying career of your choice, in the comfort
   and convenience of your own home. We'll talk a little more
    about this in Chapter 7.
    THE ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE OF A
        "PRODUCTIVE DAY"
   What is a "productive day," anyway? Here are several
    related definitions:
        1. At the end of the day, you can see, feel and know
      that you have accomplished and achieved
     something.
       2. At the end of the day, you can see, feel and know
      that you have done something that has moved you
      closer to one of your most important goals.
       3. At the end of the day, you can take note of having
     learned something new, something you did not
    know before.

  You turn off the tube, crash, get up, and go through the

  as a little test, for a month, you may be very, very
   surprised at how differently you feel about yourself and
  your life.
       The $25,000.00 "Secret"
      To Having A Productive Day
            Every Day
  Back during America's Industrial Revolution, the top
   executive running Andrew Carnegie's steel mills was a
  man named Charles Schwab. Mr. Schwab was always
   looking for ways to improve "productivity" — in the mills,
  as well as his own. A consultant named Ivy Lee offered
  Schwab an idea to improve his productivity, and told
  Schwab he could pay him whatever he thought it was
   worth, after trying it for a month. The idea he provided was
   incredibly simple: Each night, write down a list of the ten
  most important things you want to get done the next day,
    in order of their importance, 1,2,3. Then force yourself to
   get Number One done before moving on to Number Two.
  Check off each item as you finish it.
   After trying this simple idea for a month, Schwab
   reportedly sent Lee a check for $25,000.00. Why not try it
   yourself for 30 days and see how valuable you think it is?

   How To Manage Your Money,
      To Get Ahead In Life
  MONEY gives most people a whole lot of trouble! There
     is a lot of unhappiness that comes from not having
   enough of it. Misuse or excessive use of credit, for many,
     is like the use of drugs; it temporarily feels good and
   masks some pain, but that's only temporary; 'Ihe morning
    after," there's more pain.
   Government statistics indicate that the majority of adults
   go through their entire lives without ever figuring out how
    to master money.
   During the average working person's life, well over a
    million to several million dollars will run through his
    fingers. You'd think: Hey, some of that has to stick! But
    at retirement age, after forty plus years of work, fewer
   than 5% of the people have enough money saved,
    invested and in assets to produce a decent retirement
   income. 95% are dependent on their measly Social
    Security check for part or all of their basic needs. And if
   you gathered a random sampling of those 95%'ers
    together, you'd find they had one thing in common:
    surprise at reaching that age with so little to show for it
    financially.
                       i
   Of course, ifs very hard to think that far ahead now. But
   you cannot wait until you are 50 either! There are certain
   "Money Habits" that make you a master over money,
    instead of a slave to it. The sooner you put those habits to
   work for you, the better.

   the lives of everybody stuck in poverty. If you happen to
  have a lot of money troubles now, not enough income
  now, breaking these poverty habits is the first step up and
   out.
        Poverty-Inducing Habit #1
      Negative Attitude About l\/loney
   President Abraham Lincoln once said, "A penny saved is
  a penny eamed." These days, you can scatter pennies on
  a sidewalk and nobody will even bother to stoop over and
   pick them up. This says: "A penny is too small. Its not
   important." Maybe. Maybe not.
  People who work for low wages and have very little
  money tend to "blow" what little they have left after paying
                       for necessities, like rent and
     "If your outgo exceeds utilities, often saying to
   your income, themselves or to the world:
    then your upkeep "What the heck — what I've
   becomes got is so little it won't make
   your downfall." any difference, so I might as
       - Jim Rohn well blow it and have a
    Author, "Seven good time today. Ill suffer
     Strategies For tomorrow anyway." All this
    Wealth, can ever do is guarantee
     Success And more of the same.
    Happiness"
  The solution, by the way, is NOT a bigger paycheck. You
  may think it is. "Gee, if I just had another fifty bucks a

```
   his behavior keeps applying the habit to the bigger
   paycheck. And the bigger paycheck after that. As hard as
      it may be for you to imagine, there are people earning
   $50,000.00 a year STILL living paycheck to paycheck,
   STILL saying to themselves: "I've got so little left here
   after paying my essential bills, I might as well just blow it!"
       The Only Law About Money
      You Ever Really Need To Know
     To Escape From Financial Prison!
   Going through life paycheck to paycheck, using up all
   your money even before the next paycheck, is like locking
   yourself up in financial prison and throwing away the key.
   This negative cycle MUST be broken before you can ever
   hope to get ahead. You break it by obeying 'The Only Law
   About Money You Ever Really Need To Know." This "Law"
   requires a habit that, over time, changes the lives of all
  who use it for the better. At first, the results may seem
    insignificant. But it is the habit itself that leads to big
   differences. The Law is: Pay Yourself First.
   Out of every dollar that comes to you, in your paycheck or
   from any and every other source, expected or
   unexpected, you take a pre-determined percentage off
   the top and put that aside as an "untouchable," as
   savings, BEFORE you pay any other bill. You might
   choose just 1%: from a dollar, a penny. You might choose
  5%; from each dollar, a nickel. But "lock in" on that
   percentage and keep this promise to yourself no matter
   what.

```

-----

```
   bills paid now, using 1 00% of my income — now you want
  me to manage with 95% — how's that gonna work?" We
  don't blame you for being doubtful. Fortunately you don't
  have to believe this law makes any sense for it to pay
  dividends. All you have to do is obey it. If you will try this
   idea, and stick with it absolutely, for just three months, you
   will see for yourself how your attitudes about money AND
  your actual financial situation almost miraculously
  changes for the better.
  Here is a 'bottom line': You must change the way you
  THINK about money before the actual money situations
   of your life will change.
       Poverty-Inducing Habit #2:
          Slavery To Debt
  Our parents and, certainly our grandparents lived very,
  very differently than we do with regard to credit versus
  cash. If our grandparents decided to buy a new washing
  machine, they didn't pop it on a credit card, get it the same
  day they decided they wanted it, and pay for it month after
  month for years. Instead, they saved up money until they
  had enough to go buy it.
  Today we are very much into "instant gratification." We
  want it — and we want it NOW.
  Well, for certain purposes, modern credit is a wonderful
   thing. But misused and overused, it can literally make you
  a SLAVE to it.
  Most people do not understand the true cost of credit.
  Take shows
