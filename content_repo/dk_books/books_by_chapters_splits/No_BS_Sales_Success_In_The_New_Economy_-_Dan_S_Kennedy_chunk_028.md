SIX DUMBEST THINGS SALESPEOPLE DO
 TO SABOTAGE THEMSELVES

## Most salespeople I know cut their own income by at least 75%, with no help needed from dysfunctional sales managers, corporate home office pinheads, tough competition, troubles in the economy, or meddling in their field by politicians. They are their own worst enemies.
 For too long, the economy was forgiving of these sins, and salespeople guilty of some or even all of them could still do well. I am absolutely delighted that is no longer the case. As the recession revealed the slop and sloth and miserable disservice run rampant in many businesses, large and small, and wiped many off the landscape, I celebrated their demise. As quite a few salespeople stumbled from unearned prosperity to shock and starvation, I thanked the recession for its overdue good work. Now The New Economy will provide greater rewards than ever to those who step up, and will go right on meting out harsher punishments than ever for those who won’t. Here are six poor behaviors that will make you deservedly poor should you persist in them in The New Economy:

# 1. Lousy Follow-Up

## If you’ve ever gone to a trade show as a buyer, as I do, you know that you will get follow-up from nearly none of the salespeople you talk to in the booth. You might, might get sent the same dumb brochure you were handed at the booth. That’s it. This pathetic situation actually permeates leads produced from all sources. Most salespeople under-value leads, have no follow-up SYSTEM in place, and rarely exhibit any persistence in following up on leads.
 Most of the successful clients I work with or who are in my coaching programs have 8 to 28 steps in their prospect follow-up sequences, which may include multiple mailings, e-mail, fax, invitations to lunches, seminars, teleseminars, online “webinars,” and more. For example, a client, a salesman of a $20,000.00 business product, has gone from $200,000.00 to $500,000.00 a year in commissions in the past 24 months by, at my urging, adding five follow-up steps beyond his norm; three lengthy letters two weeks apart, followed by a faxed invitation to a group teleseminar held only for these unconverted leads. He closes as many sales from these added five steps as from his regular selling activity.

# 2. Hanging Out with Losers

## In virtually every sales organization, 5% make 95% of the money. If you are wasting your time hanging around 95%’ers, you get crumbs.
 Toxic influences are less affordable than ever. You need to be mentally sharp. Hanging around with anybody not all about success; hanging out with the lazy, the un-curious, the complainers and whiners, the complacent has to get to zero. Find and associate only with winners.

# 3. Hanging Out with the Losers at the Bar, Strip
 Club, or Coffee Shop

## No additional commentary needed.

# 4. Wasting Time

## Walk into the typical auto showroom, pool and patio store, or some other business where customers come to the salespeople. Watch everybody. Most of the salespeople are standing around waiting, talking to each other, munching doughnuts, and drinking coffee. They’re playing games on their computers, texting their friends. Not selling. The two car sales guys I know, who each earn over $200,000.00 a year, never take a walk-in, never stand around waiting for a turn. They are busy with appointments, generated proactively.
 Bill Glazer, President of Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™, which publishes my No B.S. Marketing Letter, is a marketing coach to retail store owners, and also, up until very recently leaving that business by choice, owned two thriving menswear stores in Baltimore. He made sure his in- store clothing salespeople did well over 40% of their business by pre-set appointments with their customers. When they weren’t engaged in selling, they were mailing or calling their clients to set up appointments, not standing around sucking up java. That’s what coffee breaks are for.

# 5. Not Creating SYSTEMS

## The seat-of-the-pants salesperson will never, ever match the income of the systemized salesperson. The top producers live by systems.
 They have a system for generating a steady stream of good leads from multiple sources. They have an intake system for those leads, for categorizing them, managing them, following up on them with multiple steps and multiple types of media. If the system, for example, calls for four letters, each seven days apart, by God, each prospect gets each letter on schedule. Top performers also have a system for selling. My own “million dollar presentation” I use from the platform, the process and language I use in selling my consulting and copywriting services, all scripted, rehearsed, fine-tuned, and memorized. I subscribe to David Sandler’s axiom: if you do not have a system for selling, you are at the mercy of the prospect’s system for buying (or not buying).
 Finally, top performers have an organized, multi-step system for encouraging, obtaining, and rewarding referrals.
 Think about this: most businesses and companies have very detailed operating systems. But most have random and erratic acts of selling. I suppose by nature, or by habit, most salespeople chafe at rules, standards, set procedures, structured presentations, structured work—and that’s one of the chief reasons there is such a huge disparity in income between the 95% group and the elite 5% in every sales organization. If you really want to be in the 5%, you will impose your own structures.
 A good way of looking at this, suggested to business owners by Michael Gerber, author of The E-Myth: organize your business into systems so it could be franchised like McDonalds, even if you have no intention of ever doing so. I would suggest the very same idea to the sales professional. In fact, you need to manage yourself as your employee, and your selling as your business. For that purpose, read my book, No B.S. Guide to Ruthless Management of People and Profits.

# 6. Poor Self-Discipline

## For several years, I was on about 20 programs a year as a speaker with General Norman Schwarzkopf immediately preceding me. Norm echoed some classic advice to military men and women: the difference between a live soldier and a dead one is discipline.
 Top salespeople hold themselves accountable. They organize each week’s and day’s work, they have goals and standards and benchmarks, they get going early in the morning and they keep going all day.
