STRATEGY 5 THE PROCESS OF PERSONAL
 PACKAGING

## I have a lot of experience in the advertising business, so I often think in terms of advertising. One big factor in the advertising and marketing of most products is packaging. Different packaging is appropriate for different products. Sometimes different packaging for the same product works better in different geographic areas. There are many variables to consider. These same considerations apply to packaging yourself.
 Like everybody else, I have strong personal preferences about clothing and fashion. I like certain things; I dislike other things. I’m sure you do, too. However, the successful sales pro learns to set aside his or her preferences in favor of the most effective and appropriate personal packaging for a given situation. You might think of this as image management. It is critically important.
 A prime consideration when packaging yourself is the first impression you give others. Psychologists tell us that most people form impressions of others in the first four minutes of meeting them and that 80% of the impression is based on nonverbal input. What you say has very little to do with it. We also know that people are very reluctant to change their first impressions.
 Another consideration is the overall, continuing impression you communicate. You need to always be thinking about what your appearance says about you.
 Earlier I mentioned that The New Economy Customer is more discerning. That means he is, initially and continually, critically assessing and analyzing the salesperson or service provider or professional he’s buying from or doing business with, alert for hints of what he can expect from the relationship going forward. What might have been overlooked, shrugged off, or assigned little importance during wildly free-spending times is now looked at and considered more seriously.

# A Valuable Lesson from a Prejudiced Banker

## Early in the operation of my first business—an ad agency—my Monday mail brought back a client’s check for a sizable amount marked NSF. (That means “non-sufficient funds,” although I’m told that in the South it means “not so fast!”) This was not good news. So I jumped in my car and took my client’s bad check to the bank, hoping there might be some money passing through that I could intercept. I sat down across the desk from the bank’s vice president, passed him his customer’s bad check, and told him my story.
 The banker said, “As I’m sure you can appreciate, this is the type of matter we prefer to discuss only with the principals of the firms involved.”
 I handed him my business card and said, “I’m president of the agency. I’m the principal. Let’s talk.”
 He said, in a sincerely surprised voice, “You can’t be president; you’re not wearing a tie.”
 Of course, I stomped and growled and slammed angrily out of the bank. But later, when I calmed down, I dealt with several interesting issues about success:

 For Every One Person Who Says It, There Are Somewhere Between 10
 and 10,000 Who Think It
 All marketing research is based on that premise, and I believe it is sound. Most people are too intimidated or too lazy to express their opinions. Some are only subconsciously affected by something and couldn’t enunciate their opinion even though their buying behavior is affected. Most companies count each customer complaint about a given product at 20 or 30 to 1, based on this premise. So the banker’s notion about business leaders and neckties has much greater significance than just one solitary opinion from a banker with unfair preconceptions.

## I do not like this fact, by the way. I wish image wasn’t as important as it is. But fooling myself that way wouldn’t be very smart. Comforting, but not smart. Comfortable, but not smart.
 Of course, that incident occurred more than 30 years ago. We do live in more casual times. Maybe. Yet “image” seems more important than ever. And if I was going to bank or boardroom today to conduct important business, I would thoughtfully and meticulously choose personal packaging meant to make a particular statement. And it would include wearing of a tie.

 In Selling, We Succeed Based on What Is, Not on What Ought to Be
 I agree that books should not be judged by their covers. People should not be judged by the clothes they wear or the length of their hair. I argued that point vehemently when I was young and my hair was long. But I also know that the reality is that people do judge books and people by their covers.
 I was at a social gathering this year and listened as the host’s daughter, a recent high school graduate, complained bitterly to another guest, a doctor, about her experiences in the job market. She was dressed in a manner that can best be described as a cross between a rock musician and a homeless person. The doctor asked if she had gone out seeking employment dressed that way.
 “Of course!” she replied. In fact, she had gone to apply for a job behind the counter at a yogurt shop—where she would be greeting customers and serving food to them—and been told that she could not work there looking like that. “How dare they try to tell me how I can dress?” she demanded, outraged at the injustice of the world.
 Sadly, she is not alone in her stupidity.

 Would You Rather Be Right or Rich?
 I chose the latter, and I’ve learned to package myself as appropriately and effectively as possible for various situations—to fit the costume to the role. I assure you that it does make a difference.
 In my speaking activities, I’ve experimented and satisfied myself that I sell my educational materials to a higher percentage of an audience when I’m wearing a suit than when I’m wearing a sports coat and slacks. Also,

## there are clothes I might wear in California that I will not wear in Massachusetts, for example. I’ve learned these things make a dollars-and- cents difference in my results.
 There is no doubt in my mind that the clothes and accessories you wear, the briefcase you carry, the pen you write with, and the car you drive all combine to communicate a message to others that can help you or hurt you. To deny it, to resist it, or to ignore it is self-destructive.
 Know this, too: people prefer dealing with successful people. I want my insurance agent, my real estate agent, my accountant, my lawyer, my doctor, and my public relations consultant to be doing well. The fact that they appear to be doing well indicates that many others agree with my choice and my judgment.

## The logic is simple: if the packaging of products has an impact on how
 people regard those products, then the packaging of people must have
 an impact on how others regard those people.
 I’ve also observed that I’m treated with greater courtesy and respect by merchants, store clerks, waiters and waitresses, bank tellers, airline employees, and hotel clerks when I’m dressed for business than when I’m in casual clothes.
 To be absolutely honest, I no longer live this advice day-today, but then I no longer sell much; given that 90% of all my business is from continuing or repeat clientele, much of it done longdistance. I do dress casually when meeting with clients and running my coaching group meetings. I now live most of the time in a small town, and spend as much time as possible around the racetrack with my horses, so comfortable jeans and boots are the

## order of the day. But if I am speaking to a new audience, I break out the pin-striped suit, tie, and cuff links. On the now rare occasion when I travel to a new client’s offices, on goes the tie, gray or tan slacks, blue blazer. I have a separate section in the closet for my “selling wardrobe.”
 Not long ago, I produced a television infomercial hosted by Robert Wagner. Younger people may only know him from the Austin Powers movies. You might also associate him with the popular Hart to Hart television series. Robert Wagner goes back to days of true Hollywood stars and classic leading men, like Cary Grant. He dresses this part. When we were discussing wardrobe, he said, “How ‘bout if I wear my Basic TV Star Uniform?—Navy blue blazer, grey wool slacks, blue dress shirt, you pick the tie.”
 I believe in having the right uniform for the right role. When I go to sell, I dress to sell.
