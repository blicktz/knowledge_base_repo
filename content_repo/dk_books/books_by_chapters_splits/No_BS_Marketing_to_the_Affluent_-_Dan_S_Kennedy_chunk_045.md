These score toward High Threshold because they can be scary and intimidating to the consumer. They require people to put themselves in uncomfortable positions. They require a decision nearly made, to get care, to find an advisor, to get remodeling done. A great many people with evolving interest or interest that can be stimulated will still not be prepared to take this big of a step forward.
 Examples of offers that fall at the High Threshold are:

 Chiropractor $29 Exam

 Financial Advisor Free Private Appointment

 Examples of Low-Threshold Offers The lowest threshold offer is for free information, to be sent by mail or FedEx, or accessed online. This is the staple item of direct-response advertising, in virtually every category of business. The largest wealth management firm, Fischer Investments, on TV and radio, in Forbes and other magazines; one of the most successful home improvement product manufacturers, SunSetter Awnings, by direct-mail and blow-in inserts in magazines and newspapers; one of the biggest health insurers, Humana, in TV commercials; virtually all of the retirement communities advertising in the Where to Retire magazine; my client, High Point University; my client, ExcellenceInOrthodontics.org all offer low-threshold, information items like books, free reports, DVDs. If this is their number-one strategy, why shouldn’t it be yours? Keep in mind, these are big, national direct-response advertisers who have plenty of opportunity to run split tests often, and do, and keep returning to the tried-and-true, low-threshold, free information offer.

##### I have coined the term “Information First Marketing” for this. Really savvy local business operators are embracing it, modeling the national advertisers. This is a wave of change, not just in the way businesses advertise to attract new customers, but in what they advertise. The karate school doesn’t advertise itself, its lessons, or a free lesson. Instead, it advertises a free report by its owner: The Parents’ Guide to Cyber-Bullying and Bullying: Raising Emotionally Strong Kids. The mattress store doesn’t advertise itself, its mattresses, or some sale of the century. It advertises its free guidebook: Why You Can’t Seem to Get a Good Night’s Sleep. The IT consultant doesn’t advertise his services. He advertises a free book: You Are the Target: Cybersecurity Before It’s Too Late.
 Consider a very ordinary business—a funeral home. Most funeral home advertising is very basic: name, location, years in the community, list of services. The only offer is implied: when you need us, we’ll bury you. But even a funeral home can create and put forward a low-threshold, informationbased, lead-generation offer that begins a relationship, builds trust, and establishes preference in advance of need, like this:

 The Hybrid Approach There is no law that says you must choose just one of these approaches.
 Most advertising dramatically suppresses possible response by presenting only a single reason for a response. Typically, this is a High Threshold Offer that requires somebody to be 99.9% ready to buy now. Nobody’s coming in for a $59.00 exam unless they are 99% ready to put a chiropractic physician to work on their back pain today. But a lot of people suffering with nagging or episodically reoccurring back pain, who are having evolving thoughts about doing something about it, would respond to a Low Threshold Offer of information about “True Causes and Best Ways to Relieve Nagging Back Pain—Without Surgery or Drugs.” You don’t have to be dead or have a dead family member in the parlor to respond to a

 To be clear, here’s what I’ve introduced you to here:

 1. The use of offers

 2. The difference between Low and High-Threshold Offers 3. The use of Lead-Generation Offers 4. Single Reason to Respond vs. Multiple Reasons to Respond

 Once a business owner understands these things, his objection is often about a possible trade-down of response. The fear is that somebody who might call or come in or otherwise respond to a High-Threshold Offer and make an immediate purchase will trade down to a Low-Threshold Offer and delay his purchase or be scooped up by a competitor. While this does happen, it usually affects far fewer people than a business owner fears, and the improved total response and value of leads captured for development more than makes up for what little trade-down occurs. After all, the person who fell off a ladder and has to crawl to the phone isn’t gong to trade down from making an appointment with the doctor to requesting a free report or DVD delivered days later by mail. The person with a dead body is unlikely to trade down from immediate assistance at the funeral parlor to booking a

##### tour next Thursday. In most cases, you can safely add Low-Threshold Offers without significantly compromising response to a High-Threshold Offer designed for the person ready to buy right this minute.
 Ultimately, your decisions about the nature of your offer(s), where they fall on the Low- to High-Threshold continuum, whether or not they feature information, whether they are for lead generation or immediate purchase activity or a hybrid of the two are situational. Different media, different markets, different timing will color those decisions. You should realize you have choices and you can make your marketing dollars work harder for you by offering people more than one reason and more than one means of responding to you. But no matter what you make of these choices each time you must make them in putting forward marketing, your pledge of honor to Rule #1 must be: there will always be an offer or offers.

 Rule #2 There Will Be a Reason to Respond Right Now Hesitation and procrastination are amongst the most common of all human behaviors.
 If you are a mail-order catalog shopper, you have—more than once— browsed, folded down corners of pages from which you intended to buy items, set the catalogs aside, and never placed the orders. This happens with every marketing media. People watching a TV infomercial almost buy, but put it off, to do the next time they see it, or jot down the 800-number, to do it later, but later never comes. A shopper enters the mall, sees an outfit she likes, but tells herself she’ll stop and look at it and probably get it on her way out. By the time she has walked the mall, had lunch, bought other items, and is headed back to the end of the mall she entered at, she is focused on getting to her car and getting home. The dress spotted on arrival is left behind.
 We must be sharply, painfully aware of all the potential response lost to such hesitation. The hidden cost and failure in all advertising and marketing is with the Almost-Persuaded. They were tempted to respond. They nearly responded. They got right up to the edge of response, but then set it aside to take care of later or to mull over or to Google the next time they were at their computer. When they get to that edge, we must reach across and pull

##### them past it. There must be good reason for them not to stop short or delay or ponder. There must be urgency.
 At Disney World, at the parks’ closing times, they need to get everybody out quickly, for they have much work to do during the night, to be clean, fresh, restocked, and ready to re-open on time the next morning. If they offered transportation from the parks to the hotels, resorts, and parking lots until everyone was accommodated, people would stroll, loiter, find a bench to sit on until the crowd thinned. But there are posted and announced times for the last bus and the last boat. Thus there is urgency. (Further, they switch from gentle to up-tempo music, dim lights first in the back sections of the park, and have cast members with flashlights waving people along toward the exits.) They undoubtedly empty a park faster by at least an hour than if they created no urgency and let everybody meander out at their own chosen pace. Southwest Airlines figured out how to get their planes boarded much faster than other airlines by issuing colored boarding cards but not assigning seats, so each group is in a hurry—sometimes a stampede—to board, to get the best remaining seat. They create urgency. No, these are not marketing examples, but they are excellent demonstrations of the role that success or failure at creating urgency has in every kind of business.
 Direct marketing can often contextually provide opportunity to create urgency of immediate response. This can be done with limited supply, limit per household or buyer, the countdown clock you see on a direct response TV commercial or a webinar. If the product itself cannot be limited in supply, some bonus or premium attached to it certainly can be. In the seminar business, a place I live and work, we use the obvious devices like “early bird discounts” and extend-a-pay monthly installments tied to a deadline to motivate early registrations. But we also use bonuses, entries into prize drawings, backstage-pass opportunities, preferred seating, closed- door, limited-number luncheon tickets available only to the first 50 or first 100 to beat the deadline in order to create even more urgency. Retail mimics this with the “door buster sales” starting at 5 A.M., 6 A.M., or 7 A.M., and can increase that urgency with a gift for the first x-number to be there with noses pressed against the glass. Disney creates false limited supply by bringing a product like a movie DVD, in their language, “out of the Disney vault just until Halloween—then it goes back in the vault and can’t be had.” They periodically bring the same product out of the vault, run the same

##### short promotion, return it to the vault, wait until consumers have forgotten about the promotion, and then trot it out again. All these examples are about creating a context for urgency of response.
 Direct marketing can also structurally provide opportunity for urgency of response. Anytime a group dynamic can be applied, a stampede effect seen, an “act now or lose out forever” reality displayed, a higher percentage of people presented with an offer will act than will under any other circumstances. People are motivated to buy what they will not be able to get if they don’t buy now, even when they would not buy now if relieved of that threat of loss. An auction is a prime example of this, and it has successfully been moved to online media—with live auctions and with timed auctions on sites like eBay. Putting people “live” into a seminar room where a persuasive speaker makes an offer from the stage, citing limited supply or discount or gift only for the first x-number, and having people see the stampede of earliest responders rushing to the product table at the back of the room is hard to trump by any other means and impossible to perfectly replicate by any other means; however, we’ve learned to come close with live online webinars, where viewers can see the earliest buyers’ comments, the “ticker” recording the purchase, the countdown clock for the closing of the shopping cart ticking away, and in live webinars, we can recognize by name the fast buyers. A direct mail, fax, and/or email sequence that begins by announcing that only 47 of the whatever-product will be sold (at this price, in this color, with this bonus, etc.) can, in its second piece, list the names of the first 18 buyers and show that only 29 remain, and in its third piece list the names of the 34 buyers and show that only 13 remain available.
 The most powerful urgency by exclusivity is having only one available. Neiman-Marcus does this every year, in the pages of its big Christmas catalog, with unique gift items and experiences that there is only one of. For example, in one year’s Christmas book, they offered a backstage experience and actual walk-on part one night in the Broadway musical Annie, for just $30,000.00; a Woody Trailer reconfigured as an elaborate portable bar, as the ultimate tailgate party vehicle, for $150,000.00; a private dinner for a party of ten with a gaggle of great celebrity chefs, for $250,000.00; and a trip for two to Paris and Geneva, including a visit to the Van Cleef & Arpels boutique and watch-making shop, and unique his and her watches, for

##### $1,090,000.00. Will someone buy each of these one-of-a-kind gifts? Based on historical precedent with NM’s annual one-of-a-kind gifts, that answer is almost certainly yes. But, really, anybody can create one-of-a-kind gifts and experiences, or very limited availability equivalents. NM also garners an enormous amount of media attention and free publicity each year because of these extraordinary gift offers—something a local business could do at a local level just as easily.
 In B2B, in the advertising, consulting, and coaching fields, this is often done with geographic area exclusivity. A collection of licensed print ads and radio and TV commercials, a seat in a mastermind group, access to various resources becomes more desirable (and can be sold for a much higher price) when only one CPA in Pittsburgh can have it, thus the race is on and any delay may put it in the hands of your arch-competitor with you forever locked out than when it is available to any and all comers. A very successful program like this I helped a client, Burleson Seminars, develop is ExcellenceInOrthodontics.org. Only one orthodontist per geoarea gets the certification, use of the identity and logo, use of exclusive patient education books and videos, and holds a position in an online directory promoted to consumers by online and magazine advertising. They went from zero to a multimillion-dollar licensing business almost overnight.
 Certain businesses have actual scarcity. The people I acquire rare and first edition books from for my collection, Bauman Rare Books in New York, have actual scarcity and therefore real urgency. If they have a single copy of a first edition of a book I want, signed by its author, I know they are simultaneously notifying multiple clients of its availability and even a minute’s hesitation may let someone beat me to the purchase—so I must decide quickly and impulsively; I have no time to consider cost. Most businesses lacking such actual scarcity can, with creative thought, manufacture it, offer by offer by offer.
 So, how could an ordinary local restaurant and sports bar create an exclusive offer with enormous inherent urgency, publicity appeal to local media, and excitment to its customers? My prescription would be to rent a football celebrity, perhaps a local hero, and craft an afternoon and evening of activities around his presence. One offer, fairly standard: he’s there for a meet ‘n’ greet and photo opportunity during the Sunday afternoon games for any customer with autographed footballs and jerseys auctioned off


-----

##### during an hour within that time frame, with proceeds to a local charity—a limited number permitted in, pre-registration made possible, with or without ticket fee. Then, the exclusive offer: just 12 patrons can buy a ticket to go into the private dining room or roped-off section, have dinner with, watch the Sunday night game with, and hang out with the star, and get an autographed ball, jersey, and photo—at, say, $2,000.00 per ticket. With that, there’s massive urgency because there are only 12. A financial advisor, lawyer, auto dealer, etc., could use the same premise, renting the facility or joint-venturing with a restaurant owner, and still incorporating the local charity. The event itself would be directly profitable, reward good clients, and create new clients. The “halo effect” of the promotion to the business’ entire email, social media, and mailing lists is significant, while the opportunity for free—but valuable—publicity is profound. What’s most important to understand is that I took a business that is about “come on in” and eat, drink, and be merry, and converted it into a direct marketing business, with two different, specific offers, both with created and legitimate urgency.
 My friend, top direct-response copywriter John Carlton, always advises imagining your prospective customer or client as a gigantic somnambulant sloth, spread out on the couch, loathe to move his sleeping bulk, phone just out of reach. Your offer must force and compel him to move now. Your goal is immediate response. A plain vanilla, dull, mundane offer won’t do it.
