my files. I save only the documents I need, and throw out the
envelopes and enclosures. If I can't act on something immediately, my next preference is to get it into my Tickler Files. If
I can pick up the phone and deal with something quickly and
easily, I do it. Oh, and my incoming mail is screened, so a few
things get handled without me even seeing them. And I'm
able to delegate some stuff immediately. The big goal is to
avoid having piles of paper that you haven't acted on,
haven't filed, don't know where to file, but aren't willing to
throw out.

As an aside, when asked what one, single quality he looked
for in his top associates, Lee Iacocca said "Decisiveness." I
look around today in business—and government—and I'm
dismayed at the inability and unwillingness of the so-called
leaders to make a decision, clearly enunciate it, and stand up
for it. The more decisions you make and the faster you make
them, the more productive you are.

Q: What's the worst mistake you can make related to productivity?

A: Losing control. To anything or anybody. Control and productivity are inextricably intertwined. How can you be productive
if you are not in control? It follows, then, that the more control you exert, the more productive you are.

The minute you get diverted to dealing with somebody else's
priorities at the expense of your own, you're headed down a
very slippery slope. Doesn't matter if that happens because
somebody is hovering in your doorway, sending a fax, calling, whatever. You can't let it happen. When I had a fairly
large staff, I had people hang in my doorway for 20 minutes

while I refused to visually or verbally acknowledge them
before they finally gave up and left. My own habit, when I'm
in town, is often to do a little bit of reading, easy paperwork,
and organizing in the evening while watching television. I
prefer to regroup in the evening for the next day But if I
don't, the first thing I do the next morning—after my writing time—is
to regroup, reorganize, and establish my priorities
for the day. As each day goes along, people spring things on
you, unexpected good things as well as unexpected bad
things happen, and the firm grip you have on your time is
forcibly loosened. At the end of the day, you've got to put
things back together so you can begin the next day with a
firm grip.

**V** no holds barred, no-nonsense, no B.S. book you have
ever read on succeeding as an entrepreneur.

I wrote the first edition of this book back in 1993, and since
then, I've personally heard from thousands of readers from all
over the world. You saw a few of their comments on the opening
pages of this book. It struck a chord with entrepreneurs; the
chord of authenticity. No college classroom theory, no baloney.
Real world truths from somebody who succeeds day in, day out,
as an entrepreneur, working without a net. Since then, a lot has
happened in my life, business and personal. For example, I've
sold two businesses I built up; walked away from a very important and lucrative nine-year business relationship; made wellplanned, continual, evolutionary changes in my other businesses;
gone through a divorce after 22 years of marriage; been diagnosed
diabetic; and more. I'm pleased to report I'm happier than I've
been in many years and am living the life I set out to live. 162

Anyway, all these changes, new experiences, and lessons I've
learned from my clients certainly warranted a complete updating
of this book.

It is a personal book, me talking straight with you, as if I was
consulting with you and as if we were sitting around at the end
of the day on my deck, watching the sunset, enjoying adult beverages, and just hanging out. Because it is personal, along the
way I'll be telling you quite a bit about me and about my business life—past, present, and future. None of this is about bragging. I have no need for that or interest in doing it. What I share,
I tell you so that you understand the basis for the advice and
opinions I dispense.

I have occasionally been introduced as The Professor of
Harsh Reality. This does NOT mean I'm negative. If anything,
I'm one of the most optimistic, positive-minded people you'll
ever meet. However, I do not believe in confusing positive thinking with fantasy. And the word optimism, like many words in our
perplexing English language, has more than one meaning.
There's a mammoth difference between earned, deserved, justified optimism and wild-eyed, blue-sky, stubborn optimism.

I've discovered that I'm most successful when I have a firm
grip on what is and least successful when caught wrestling with
what ought to be.

In this book, I've tried to share, from my 25-plus years of
entrepreneurial adventure, what is. Not what should he or what is
only in theoretical books, classrooms, or seminar rooms.

**_If You Are Already in Business for Yourself_**
This book will help you go forward more astutely, efficiently,
productively, and confidently. I think you'll also catch yourself

nodding as you go along, saying to yourself, "This guy has been
where I live." Sometimes there is value in just finding out you're
not alone! The very first "success education" that I was ever
exposed to was a set of recordings by Earl Nightingale titled Lead
_the Field, that I listened to when I was in my early teens. In those_
tapes, Nightingale gave me badly needed permission to violate
the norms I saw around me, with his dramatic statement:

_If you have no successful example to follow in whatever_
_endeavor you choose, you may simply look at what everyone_
_else around you is doing and do the opposite,_ _because—THE_
_MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG._

That may not be a precise, verbatim quote; but it is what I
recall and have stored in my subconscious as a primary guiding
principle. This leads to my strategy of deliberately questioning all
industry norms, deliberately violating most of them, and encouraging my clients to do the same. It also led to my coining of the
term "Mediocre Majority" to succinctly describe the vast undistinguished middle of any industry or profession. Anyway, Earl said a
lot of things I had been thinking but had never heard anyone validate, and that gave me a great boost of confidence and conviction.
Maybe some of my words, here, will do the same for you.

Most entrepreneurs tell me that the feeling they get from this
book make them instantly eager to share it with other entrepreneurs. Please do so! If you want some place to send them, refer

is no place for the timid, nervous, or easily worried to come and
play.

If it doesn't scare you off, it will help you avoid many pitfalls
and problems and help you cope with those that can't be avoided.
It will not cover the basics. There are plenty of books out there on
the basics, and we're not going to cover the same ground all over
again. This is not a how-to-start-a-small-business book. This is a go-for-the-jugular
success book.
As I said earlier, I am not a fuzzy-headed academic, pocketprotector-and-wingtip-shoes accountant, or other theorist,
although plenty of these pretenders write business books. I'm
also not a retired authority who runs a business in my memory.
I've been on the firing line meeting a payroll, battling the bankers
and bureaucrats, struggling to satisfy customers, and solving real
business problems. Over years, I've arrived at a point where my
own business is engineered to meet all my lifestyle preferences—
for example, only one employee, in a distant office, not underfoot; no set hours; no unscheduled phone calls. But still, I deal
with clients and vendors and real business life just like you do. I
also work very hands-on with clients in a wide variety of businesses, as well as being "the consultant to the consultants"—I
advise more than 50 different leading marketing and business
consultants, each exclusively serving a different business or professional niche, in direct, hands-on relationships with more than
one million small business owners. I want you to know this
because I think it makes this book more valuable to you.

I'll never forget taking over a company with 43 employees,
never having managed more than two people in my life. I
grabbed every management book I could get my paws on and
sucked up all the experts' advice. Then, after a couple of months

of getting my brains beat in every day by my employees, I started
to look critically at the credentials of those "expert" authors.
Most of them had never—I repeat, never—managed a workforce.
These geniuses spewing out creative management, nonmanipulative management, Japanese management, open-door management, and everything-else management wouldn't have survived
a week in the real world. I resent those authors to this day. And
it's a shame that a lot of college kids get that management theory,
that is, fantasy sold to them as reality. So, I chucked all their
books, rolled up my sleeves, used my common sense, and started
finding out what really works and what doesn't.

Ever since then, I look at every new business book with suspicion. Most won't pass muster because most can't pass the realexperience test. I was originally motivated to write this book
largely because reading most of the other books written for and
sold to entrepreneurs turned my stomach.

I also want you to know that there are a lot more things I
haven't got a clue about than there are things I understand; in
this book, I have not dealt with any of the many things I'm in the
dark about. Everything in here is based on my own expensive
experience. It may not be right. You may not agree with it. But at
least you should know that I didn't swipe it out of somebody
else's book, give it a jazzy new psychobabble name, and pass it
off as a new miracle tonic.

**_It's about Getting Rich_**
I also know you can't eat philosophy. So, although there is a lot
of my own philosophy in this book, its primary job is to show
you how to make more money then you ever imagined possible,
faster than you can believe possible. This is a book about getting
