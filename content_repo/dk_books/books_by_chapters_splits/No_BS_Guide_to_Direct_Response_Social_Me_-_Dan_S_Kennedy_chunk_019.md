###### Whatever it might be, focus on just one goal you can accomplish with your LinkedIn profile.
 This will make a difference in how you write your LinkedIn profile. For example, one of my coaching clients uses LinkedIn specifically to get more industrial cleaning clients. The headline he utilizes is “Creating sparkling first impressions for patients at doctors’ offices and health-care facilities through custodial services.” Just by reading his profile you can tell who he serves and what he does for them.
 For my marketing agency I used a headline of “Creates revenue on demand through direct-response social media marketing. Digital marketing strategist, author, and speaker.”
 My headline now is, “Empowers Entrepreneurs to Lean into Their Super Powers to Scale Profitably & Create the Business & Life They Love.”
 Change your headline to reflect who you want to attract and what you can do for them.
 Add a new cover photo promoting your Juicy Carrot (as taught on page 88).
 The LinkedIn cover photo is not clickable, so make sure to include your URL in your profile bio as well.
 Write your summary in the first person so you are having a conversation with the reader, sharing why they should contact/hire you/buy from you. What difference will you create for them?
 Make them want to get to know you. Tell them why it matters. And write as though you were talking to them so they can already begin to feel like you’re developing a relationship with them. As they get to know you and your voice, you’re either going to resonate with them or not. Better that they know now so you can spend your time attracting those you were meant to serve and repel everybody else, because you don’t have time for that business.
 As a bonus, once you have written your summary, you can use it in all sorts of places like a Facebook story or the About Us on your website.
 Finally, fill in the Skills section to make you more “searchable” on LinkedIn.

 Long-Form Posts


-----

###### The next thing to do is use LinkedIn’s long-form posts to set you up as an authority. They’re SEO-optimized—meaning they’re incorporated with Google. They’re kind of like blog posts on LinkedIn.
 When you write long-form posts, you will show up more often in searches. It can also drive traffic to your site because you can include any links you want. Plus, it gives clout because it builds out your network. They can see who’s viewing it, and you can see who’s commenting on it—so you know how to connect with them later on.
 From the top of the dashboard, click “video, images, write an article,” and choose “write an article.” LinkedIn will bring you to a blank page, and you can cut and paste any blog or Word doc, or you can start from scratch by adding text, links, and images as you go. You can also add a title and video, and play around with the style of the page. It is easy to use and it creates an interactive post for your readers.


###### You can get more out of your overall content by posting it first on your website, and then a few days later sharing it on LinkedIn and
 Twitter.


###### After you post, it gives you an opportunity to share, so go ahead and share it elsewhere, bringing you even more distribution.
 You can ask your team to Like it, because that fuels the fire, giving juice to LinkedIn so they’ll share it with more people. Then tweet out a link to your article.
 Video posts also do very well on LinkedIn and should be incorporated into your overall content strategy to build engagement and drive more leads onto your list.

 GROWING YOUR NETWORK It’s “show me the money time,” aka prospecting on LinkedIn. Hopefully you have already established your one goal for using LinkedIn.
 We’ve all received those incredibly annoying contacts on LinkedIn from somebody you’ve never met or maybe who just connected with you … and


-----

###### they’re already asking you to buy something. Not cool. Nobody’s going to marry you at hello, so don’t be one of those annoying people. Don’t do it.
 Instead when prospecting, first research your target market, then establish a connection through a three-contact process, and only then ask for the appointment or opt-in or whatever your goal might be.
 A few examples … A Member of our Inner Circle Mastermind wanted more clients for her IT firm. She used LinkedIn to send out invitations to a lunch-and-learn about how to use voice-over-IP to actually make more sales by handling calls better. This topic is something her ideal clients would care about— generating three times more sales without spending a dime on advertising.
 That’s a more powerful invitation than, “Hey, do you want to have a conversation about voice-over-IP?” No one wants to have a conversation about that. But they do want more sales, so get your target market to lean in by using language that resonates with them.
 Another Inner Circle Mastermind member, Scott Whitaker, Founder of Membership Multipliers, uses LinkedIn to engage in conversations with key decision makers in order to land VIP client accounts.

 YOUR DREAM 100 On LinkedIn, focus on your Dream 100—the top 100 prospects, JV partners, media outlets, or any other dream connection you’d like to make. Spending time connecting with this group will rapidly multiply your results.
 Here’s how:

 1. Set a timer for 15 minutes and craft a list of your Dream 100. Don’t
 hold back with the dreaming … pick exactly who you want to do business with, work on a partnership with, or be featured in a media outlet. 2. Locate these individuals using LinkedIn’s search box. 3. Visit their profile and look at their recent LinkedIn activity. Did they
 post anything? Interact with a post? What insights can you get from their profile? 4. Connect with them using this message: “(name), I’ve followed your
 work with (company) for a while now and what you have been doing is incredible. I would love to learn more by connecting here.”


-----

###### 5. Once you are connected, this person can start seeing your LinkedIn
 videos, long-form posts, and updates for free. 6. Download your LinkedIn contact list and upload the contact list to
 your Facebook Ads Manager as a Custom Audience for retargeting. Only spend money on your top prospects/dream connections of all time.

 More LinkedIn connection scripts you can use:

 1. If you met at a conference, event, or in-person meeting:
 “Hi, Bob. It was great to meet you at this event. I’d love to connect with you here as well as keep in touch and discover more about your business.” 2. If you share a connection:
 “Hi, Bob. I see that you’re connected to one of my close associates. I’d love to connect with you on here in order to discover more about your business.” 3. If you read a post by this person:
 “ Hi, Bob. I came across your blog post/article (or news story you were mentioned in), and I’d love to connect with you here to find out more about your business. I was particularly interested in … “ 4. If you are members of the same LinkedIn group, association, or
 organization: “ Hi, Bob. You and I are both members of XYZ group. I’d love to connect with you here to discover more about your business.”

 If you are interested in turning connections into sales conversations, in addition to posting regularly, you can systematically prospect via LinkedIn.

 • Message One: “Hi, Bob. Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. I came
 across this article I thought you might find useful.” Then share an article with them.
 •  Message Two: One week later, research the company and find
 something current that’s interesting. “Hey, Bob. I just saw that your company achieved XYZ. Congratulations.” Then you can ask a question about it. Or “I hope you found that last article useful. We


-----

###### have a case study on the same topic I thought you might enjoy.” Or you can link to a long-form post you posted on LinkedIn.

 You’re just sharing content to begin to establish a deeper relationship. Continue on with another message each week …

 •  Message Three: It’s time to go in for the kill and share. “Hey. I’m
 Bob. I want to have a conversation with you about what I can sell you.” Just kidding, although I get these messages all the time on LinkedIn.
 •  Instead, make Message Three: “Greetings, Bob. I’d love to get to
 know you and your company better and see if it makes sense for us to work together. Please let me know if you’re open to this. In the meantime, I came across this article I thought you might be interested in.”

 Over time, you’ve established you know who they are, you know what they care about, and you’ve given value. That’s when you can ask for that sales appointment. Alternatively, if you invite them to an event from the very beginning, you can lean in quicker.
 The best way to get a response from your connection is to show up in multiple ways and not just in their inbox. Run your ads in their newsfeed on Facebook, post long-form content on LinkedIn, and use videos to build authority, which will give you a much better chance of getting a return contact.
 The best way to use LinkedIn is to schedule time to do it. Just thinking about it as a goal will not make it happen unless you do something about it.
 Schedule ten minutes a day to dive in deep, make those stronger connections, build out your network, and move your prospects along from someone who’s never had a conversation with you to someone you close as your next big sale.

 Twitter “Twitter,” you say … “Isn’t that platform dead?”
 To the contrary.


-----

###### While it never grew as much as the others, users of Twitter are highly engaged and buy things they see on the platform.
 According to Twitter’s own statistics:

 • 66% of people have discovered a new business on Twitter
 • 94% are planning to buy something from businesses they follow on
 Twitter
 • 69% of people have bought something as a result of a tweet

 So how to leverage the platform?

 1. Create two accounts. Do you have a personal account that you use
 for things other than business? If so, the first thing you need to do is create another profile that is just used for your business brand. No mixing of the accounts. 2. Link to your Juicy Carrot in your bio. Include a link in your bio to
 your Juicy Carrot and leverage hashtags in your niche. (Create your list the same way you did with Instagram. See page 105.) 3. Put a call to action in your cover photo. Hopefully you already made
 a Twitter cover photo image when you created your Facebook one, but if not, now is the time. Make sure it includes a URL to go right to your Juicy Carrot. 4. Post manually, up to six times a day. Unlike other newsfeeds, Twitter
 users welcome frequent posting. Plus, tweets do not last long, since no one is scrolling a timeline for days looking for what they missed. Make sure to use the same posting format mentioned before … create curiosity and give a link to take action while also including hashtags. 5. Find those you want to connect with. Similar to the Dream 100 on
 LinkedIn, you can follow whoever you want on Twitter and interact with them.

 Craft a list of your Dream 100 and start following, tagging, and messaging your dream tribe to get even more out of the platform. (See Figure 7.11 on page 130 for an example of an effective tweet.)

###### Scale Your Audience Quickly with Just a Little Ad Spend Want to grow your audience quickly without a big budget? This time no fairy godmother is required. You can stick your pinky toe in the water of ad spend and quickly grow your audiences. A few quick-win strategies to use:

 1.  Facebook. A little unknown targeting option on Facebook is
 “Worldwide.” If you launch a “Page Promotion” campaign targeting a worldwide audience, you can grow your audience quickly with very little ad spend (see Figure 7.12 on page 131). After a few days of going international, you can then flip over to the U.S., or other country of choice, and get local likes for pennies on the dollar.
 We’ve generated over $56,743 in sales just from a Facebook fan coming to the page, clicking on the cover photo, and becoming a customer. (Insert happy dance.)
 For a free workshop on how to get 10,000 fans and turn them into your next cash-paying customers, visit 3daysto10k.com.

**FIGURE 7.12: Facebook Page Promotion**

###### 2. Instagram. You can boost a post for just a few dollars and drive in
 hundreds of followers. Use posts that will get you the best results if you choose to use them as ads later on.
 Here’s how:
 • First, hit “Promote” under your post of choice (see Figure 7.13
 on page 132).
 • Second, choose “Profile” as the thing to promote (see Figure
 7.14 on page 133).
 • Then pick who you want to promote to (see Figure 7.15 on page
 134).
 • Then, pick your budget (see Figure 7.16 on page 135).

##### CHAPTER 8

### Scaling Results with

## Paid Ads

###### by Kelly LeMay


#### Side Note from Kim

###### A chapter by someone else on Facebook ads?
 You betcha. Kelly has been my behind-the-scenes magic maker for over 14 years. She has been with me since Facebook started offering ads, taught herself how to do them, and eventually ran the agency and client ad accounts. Since we sold, she manages our Facebook ads and teaches our coaching clients how to do theirs. There is no one better in our industry to learn from than this creative Facebook ninja.


###### Back when Kim owned the agency, I was doing work for a local family attraction. Our graphic designer created several beautiful Facebook BOGO ads and, in an epic blonde moment, I mistakenly used just their logo. Typically we don’t recommend this (especially if it is sized wrong and cuts off half the image, like this one did). I didn’t realize the mistake I had made


-----

###### until checking the ad the next day… when I saw that the logo was the best performing ad they had.
 Long story short, I like to operate under the assumption that I have no clue what is going to grab an audience’s attention. We’ve done years of testing and tweaking Facebook ads, and I’m going to share with you all the insider secrets.

 Writing Ad Copy I like testing at least two different types of copy—one short, one long. The best part is that I’m never starting from scratch; I’m always using one of my trusty templates, which saves me a ton of time.
 First, we’ll test a short version that follows this simple three-line template:

 1. Pose a question to your target market:
 Want to uncover a new way to get as many clients as you want quickly and easily for your coaching, consulting, or services business?

 2. Offer a solution:

###### Next, we’ll test a long storytelling version of the copy following this template:
 Tell a story of struggle:

 “Will this ever get easier?”

 I was ten years into running my firm and things still seemed really hard. Every client we had came from me going and getting them.

###### Usually from attending a painful networking event with those annoying nametag stickers that always got caught in my long hair.
