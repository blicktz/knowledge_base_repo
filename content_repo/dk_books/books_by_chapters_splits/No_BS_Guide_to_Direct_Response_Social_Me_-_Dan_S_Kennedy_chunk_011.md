###### looked so beautiful. And now it was my time to cry. Warm stinging tears ran down my face as I confronted a harsh reality. If I didn’t go back to work in the next week or so, my company would go bankrupt. I only had enough cash to cover one more payroll and that was it.
 My baby needed me. My staff needed me. The thing was, up to this point, my business was built on a lot of hard work: 18-hour days/7 days a week sometimes. That was the only way I kept the business afloat. For ten years, our survival was dependent on me running around all day—networking and volunteering for groups like the Chamber and Rotary Club (also known as “working for free”). I would then spend all night doing client work and weekends getting caught up.
 The work we did back then was the traditional marketing agency kind— awareness-based public relations and marketing. We did a lot of branding work for our clients without much thought on how that would result in sales. The truth was, we didn’t know any better.
 We were successful in creating beautiful designs and logos and in getting our clients’ faces in the paper, but nothing we did was measurable. While we were often told how much our clients loved us, we were the “fluff” of the budget. I spent so much time selling new accounts only to lose them at contract renewal time.
 I would staff up for the work we got and then be left covering a big payroll when clients ended their contracts. I kept this house of cards together with cheap imitation Elmer’s Glue® and it worked—but barely.
 When I took time off to take care of my new baby, it all fell apart. I never wanted to be in that position again. Not just for me now, but for my innocent and perfect daughter.
 I am a woman of faith, and so I did the only thing I thought could help …
 I prayed. I prayed that the struggles I faced for the last ten years would end. I prayed that I would stop killing myself working around the clock just to be poor. (Let me tell you, there are much better ways to be broke than working your fanny off.) I prayed for dramatic change.
 It was then that my dear friend Jon Toy gave me a book. It was Dan Kennedy’s No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses (Entrepreneur Press, 2018). In a few days I had devoured it and started putting it into action. A few changes caused dramatic results. I found

###### that I could stop wishing for things to be different, and I could instead make them different. I could change my pool of prospects, multiply my lead flow, and give myself a raise, week after week.
 In one year, we more than 10X’d our revenue and profit. And it changed everything … I could work for clients that I loved, I could take time off without things falling apart, and I could take care of the team that stood by me through the hard times.
 When I started offering direct-response social media services, I got paid $375 per month. When I sold the agency, our monthly minimum had raised to $3,500. Even the fact that I was able to sell my firm and have a great exit is proof of the power of the strategies in this book.
 I went from one time hocking my engagement ring because it was all I had left to help make payroll to a having a multimillion-dollar firm I was able to sell and focus on what I believe to be my true purpose in life—our business coaching company, Powerful Professionals, which was just named to the “Inc. 5000,” the fastest-growing companies in the United States.
 Being ROI-focused is very profitable. I control my own schedule now, starting early in the morning before my kids wake up and stopping when they get off the bus. I usually have two or three children’s activities to attend during a workday and I have arranged my schedule to be there for them at every milestone, celebration, and the occasional tear to wipe away. I went from having a full-time nanny to an occasional babysitter.
 My big indulgence (besides shoes) is travel, and we do it often. In the last year I’ve gone to Paris, London, Mexico, Belize, Capri, all across the U.S. with multiple stops in Palm Beach, L.A. and NYC and, of course, my first love … Disney. All for fun.
 Because travel brings me joy and when I travel, my business still grows. My favorite thing about making this change is that now I wake up excited every day for what’s in store. I am so thankful for this journey. The gifts I have bring value to those I work with, and I find great pleasure in doing so.
 And so should you. While you will discover the exact blueprint we followed that you can use to grow your own business in the chapters to come, there is one lesson

###### to start with right now …
 … no matter where you are along the journey, you can change the outcome. Starting today.
 Right this minute. You have value that should be shared with the world. You just first need to reach those who need you and convince them to respond to your ad.
 Seal the deal, and say to yourself right now: “If it’s not going to get me results, I am not going to do it.” C’mon, I know it may feel silly, but say it out loud right now as a commitment to yourself and your future growth. You have value and deserve to be paid for it.
 “If it’s not going to get me results, I am not going to do it.” Are you in? If you are, go ahead and post this on your social media profiles right now:
 If it’s not going to get me results, I am not going to do it. #IAmIn In the next chapter, I have a story about what is possible and real with direct-response social media marketing. If you do it right, it attracts new qualified leads and sales even while you are asleep.
 Let’s do this.

##### CHAPTER 2

### Social Media Is Not

## Marketing

#### Media Is Not Marketing

###### by Dan Kennedy In the 2012 Olympics, U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympian of all time (beating gymnast Larisa Latynina’s prior record of 18 medals). Phelps earned his 19th Olympic medal in the men’s 4 × 200-meter freestyle relay. His current medal count of 28 is made up of 23 gold, two silver, and two bronze.
 Although he had a great Olympics, it could have easily not gone his way.
 In fact, prior to the Olympics Phelps fell short of many people’s expectations, including his own. His problems began after the 2008 Olympics when he got lazy. He stopped doing the things that brought him success in the first place, like going to the pool to train every day. Until 2011, when he was bested by his teammate Ryan Lochte in the 200-meter individual medley at the world championships.
 That’s when Phelps got back to the basics, doing the things he needed to do to win again.
 The funny thing with swimmers is that no matter how long they’ve been swimming, they do the same thing day in, day out to prepare for their races.
 Take U.S. swimmer Dara Torres, who at the age of 41, became the oldest Olympic swimming medalist in history when she won two Olympic


-----

###### silver medals in 2008. Despite having swam her whole life, she never forgot the basics. She did the same workouts as every other sprint swimmer on her team, such as kicking and drills. She kept the foundational pieces in place as circumstances around her changed.
 Despite his success in the 2012 Olympics, Phelps announced his retirement directly after their conclusion. But like a true champion, he didn’t stay poolside for long.
 At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the games for the fourth Olympics in a row.
 He announced his second retirement on August 12, 2016, having won more medals than anyone else in the Olympics at final count of 28. According to a Fox News story by Chris Chase, if Michael Phelps was a country, he’d be ranked 32nd on the alltime medal count. That’s all-time, as in everything a country has won in 120 years and 28 Summer Olympics.
 While you may never be an Olympic Record holder, you can follow the success principle of staying true to the same behaviors that got you in there in the first place.

 Contrary to Popular Belief… The internet is not as special as most people think, and media is not marketing. The same disciplined business and marketing practices must be kept in place to drive real results. Very few will do this, so very few will ever see results through social media marketing, or any marketing for that matter.
 Social media has a lot of the same dangers that email marketing does. It is free and can be distributed quickly with a very low barrier to entry. Not much thought or strategy needs to be put into place in order to launch messaging or paid ads.

 WHY SO MANY BUSINESSES ARE FAILING Just because it is social media doesn’t mean it shouldn’t use all the same principles as direct-response marketing.
 It’s been 40 years or more since I replaced old-fashioned prospecting grunt work for a 100% measurable way to attract a predictable, reliable stream of ideal clients.


-----

###### Success at getting qualified clients, customers, or patients has a lot more to do with understanding the real secrets of direct-response marketing and a lot less to do with chasing prospects through tweets and status updates.
 I’ve been entirely DR (direct response) since 1975 and pioneered a few things of my own. Although the fundamentals and the principles of this do not change, it is still really about applying tested and proven mail order methodology to nonmail order businesses.
 The overwhelming majority of commerce of all kinds is driven by direct response.
 Everyone from the credit card industry to the apparel industry, from the information business to the local service business is using direct response. The fundamental principle of my approach to marketing is this: Let’s make sure we’re talking to highly interested, highly motivated, very appropriate prospects for what it is that we have to offer people, who will have a high level of interest the minute we show up.
 Do a decent job of selling to them, instead of trying to reduce everything to 140-character tweets, videos no longer that 3.8 minutes, and no sales letters with words more than two syllables so that everybody can pay attention.

 WHY YOU ARE THE SAME Everybody believes their business is different. That this doesn’t apply to them. That no one else is doing this in their industry. Just because they aren’t using the written word to sell, it must be acceptable because they are making sales. Maybe it’s “acceptable.” But using better sales copy gives you a competitive edge. Especially when you possess this number-one skill and others don’t.
 Darin Garman was making sales in real estate, but he wasn’t happy with the process and was becoming increasingly frustrated doing a lot of work only to lose the sale to a competitor.
 No one was using sales letters to sell apartment buildings until Darin decided to do it. Not only did he succeed at selling apartment buildings with sales letters, but he also got the people he predetermined were good candidates to respond. Plus, when he did some research, he found he had moved into a position where his office, Heartland Investment Partners,

###### handled 70% of all apartment building transactions. That was not the case before he started using sales letters.
 It does not matter whether your client is the CEO or the broom pusher or which media channels you use, everybody buys the same way. They all go through the same process. They all go through the same emotional journey.

 The Basics of Effective Marketing There are just a few plain and simple direct-marketing rules to follow, and by committing to them, you’ll reap the long-term benefits you desire and develop a long-lasting business foundation.
 These basics are skipped by most businesses using Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn as their primary sources of communication. Realize you have choices, and you can make your marketing dollars work harder for you by offering people more than one reason and more than one means of responding to you.
 However many channels you market in, there are basic rules you need to understand in order to succeed. These foundational concepts must be fully comprehended, practiced, managed, and enforced.

 1. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN OFFER There is a popular saying out there that “content is king.” I would disagree. The sale is king. Without it, you have no market share and no kingdom to rule over. Your social media marketing needs to have an offer, telling your ideal prospects exactly what to do and why they want to do it right now. It should be irresistible and time sensitive, and give them some type of transformative value if they take action.
 Ideally, it’s a Godfather’s Offer—one that the appropriate prospect or customer can’t refuse.

 2. THERE WILL BE A REASON TO RESPOND RIGHT NOW The hidden cost and failure in all advertising and marketing is in the almost-persuaded. They were tempted to respond. They nearly responded. They got right up to the edge of response, but then set it aside to do later or to mull over or to check out more the next time they were at their computers. When they get to that edge, we must reach across and pull them


-----

###### past it. There must be a good reason for them not to stop short or delay or ponder. There must be urgency.

 3. THERE WILL BE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS Most people do a reasonably good job of following directions. For the most part, they stop on red and go on green, stand in the lines they’re told to stand in, fill out the forms they’re given to fill out, and applaud when the Applause sign comes on. Most people are well conditioned from infancy, in every environment, to do as they are told.
 Most marketers’ failures and disappointments result from giving confusing directions—or no directions at all. Confused or uncertain consumers do nothing. And people rarely buy anything of consequence without being asked. Sharing content alone will not bring measurable results from your social media. You must walk your prospect through the steps you want them to take in order to make the sale.

 4. THERE WILL BE TRACKING AND MEASUREMENT If you want real profits from your marketing, you are no longer going to permit any advertising, marketing, or selling investments to be made without direct and accurate tracking, measurement, and accountability. You will be given all sorts of arguments against such a harsh position by media salespeople, by online media champions talking a “new” language of “new metrics,” by staff and peers. You will hear terms like “engagement” and “reach” and “virality,” with no data to back up the results. You will smile and politely say, “Rubbish.” Each dollar sent out to forage must come back with more and/or must meet predetermined objectives. There will be no freeloaders; there will be no slackers.

 5. THERE WILL BE FOLLOW-UP Often, I find business owners with more holes in their bucket than they’ve got bucket! People read your ad, get your letter, see your sign, find you online, call or visit your place of business, ask your receptionist or staff questions, and that’s it. There’s no capture of the prospect’s name, physical address, email address, and no offer to immediately send an information package, free report, coupons. This is criminal waste.


-----

###### I’ve been poor, so I abhor and detest and condemn waste. Just how much waste are you permitting to slop around in your business? Probably a lot. When you invest in advertising and marketing, you don’t just pay for the customers you get. You pay a price for every call, every walk-in. Every one. Doing nothing with one is like flushing money down the toilet.
 To be simplistic, if you invest $1,000 in an ad campaign and get 50 phone calls, you bought each call for $20. If you’re going to waste one, take a nice, crisp $20 bill, go into the bathroom, tear the bill into pieces, let the pieces flutter into the toilet, and flush. Stand there and watch it go away. If you’re going to do nothing with 30 of those 50 calls, stand there and do it 30 times. Feel it.
 You probably won’t like how it feels. Good. Remember that feeling every time you fail—and it is failure—to thoroughly follow up on a lead or customer.
