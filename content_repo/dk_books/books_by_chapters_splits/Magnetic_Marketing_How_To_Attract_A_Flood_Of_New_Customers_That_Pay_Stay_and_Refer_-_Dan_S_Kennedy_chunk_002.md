# FOUNDATIONS OF MAGNETIC MARKETING

###### CHAPTER 1
#### WHAT IF EVERYTHING YOU’VE EVER
 BEEN TOLD ABOUT GROWING A
 BUSINESS WAS WRONG?

-----

###### I am sorry to tell you that you have been lied to for a very long time!
 Note that I didn’t use softer words like “misled,” “mis- informed,” “offered less than optimal advice.” Nope. I laid it out straight and plain.
 You’ve been lied to
.

 It’s critical to your success that I open your eyes to this fact. And I hope you’re interested in the blunt, unvarnished truth about what entrepreneurs and business owners actually do to create top income, wealth, independence, and sustainability. Frankly, not everyone is ready for such a conversation. Many prefer excuses to achievement. Others prefer fantasy to reality.

 What I’m about to teach you will radically alter how you acquire customers, clients and patients, and boost your sales and profits. I have a track record of forty-five-plus years creating multi-millionaires and seven-figure income earners. I am a made-from-scratch multi-millionaire, serial entrepreneur and I’m doing real work in the trenches right now, working

 with real clients and solving real issues. In fact, in one recent year alone, the combined revenues of my small cadre of private clients exceeded $1 billion.
 And every marketing plan I’ve ever devised for any client— and they now number in the hundreds and hundreds, commanding fees exceeding $100,000 plus royalties—has been based on the SYSTEM I’m going to reveal in this book.

 This book is for entrepreneurs, business owners, professional services practices, coaches and consultants. It pulls back the curtain on real world strategies I’ve revealed to

-----

###### the thousands of entrepreneurs just like you who have subscribed to my No B.S. Marketing Letter
, and use my systems to transform “ordinary” businesses into extraordinary money machines that far outperform their industry norms, peers, competitors and the wildest imagination of the owners.
 How do they do it?

 By making the strategic switch from traditional advertising to a response-driven advertising
strategy we call “Magnetic Marketing
.”
 Magnetic Marketing
was created to help entrepreneurs and business owners—with NO marketing knowledge or expertise —and empower them to create compelling marketing on their own without hiring outside help.

 Magnetic Marketing
has impacted thousands of businesses, professions, industries, product and service categories, literally changing the way their customers are obtained. (Indeed, today they form what could well be called a “secret society” of people who have figured it out.)
 Its roots go back decades, if not centuries. Its core

 foundational principle is that every advertisement, promotion, email, flyer, TV commercial, etc. focuses ALL energy on:

 identifying exactly who you want to be your customer,
client, or patient, and

 getting them to respond in a specific way—not

 wasting any effort on branding, image, humor, style or anything else.

-----

###### THIS is the kind of marketing we’ll discuss in this book— marketing designed to “magnetically attract” in a specific, repeatable, measurable way. And this is the ONLY model of marketing that you as a entrepreneur and business owner should model and use.
 When you embrace this, you become part of a movement

 that I started over two decades ago and that’s now carried on by the company I founded thirty-eight years ago, Magnetic Marketing|No B.S. Inner Circle
, which continues to provide powerful marketing and business growth strategies to maximize the success of entrepreneurs and business owners all over the world—a rare feat considering how many companies have come and gone over that period of time.

 LET’S DISPEL THE MYTHS…

 Personally, early on I went through a painful phase of thinking where I believed that I should be successful by my
willingness to work hard and by offering products and services that were truly valuable.
 As logical as this may sound, it’s merely a painful myth. I

 still struggled.
 And so I immersed myself in self-help, personal improvement, and motivational materials. I said affirmations. I thought only positive thoughts. I believed. And still I struggled—even with great products and what I believed was a great mindset to go with them.

 My life only changed when it dawned on me that great
was no better than lousy
if I had no able, willing, ready buyers to present great
to.

-----

###### This is the key realization. Without a sufficient and steady stream of people with whom you can exchange value for money, nothing else about your business matters. Not your most excellent website. Not your high visibility location. Not your credentials, degrees, certifications, education, etc. Not your hard-working “nose-to
 the-grindstone” ethic.
 Being more talented or skilled than others in your area of expertise has ZERO value if you cannot harness the principles and power of magnetic attraction
in a practical way.
 Having the very best, most innovative, most beneficial products or services has ZERO value if you cannot harness

 the principles and power of magnetic attraction
in a practical way.
 Many harm themselves by denying or decrying this reality. They desperately want to believe that better is better... having better credentials... having gone to a better school... having more and better experience... having more and better integrity... better work ethic, better at paying your dues… etc.

 BETTER SHOULD
BE ENOUGH.
 Maybe in an idyllic and just world that would be so. But not in THIS world. In this world, you are not automatically awarded what you deserve or think you deserve. It’s not a pure meritocracy. If that were the case, there’d probably be no rich porn stars and no poor pastors and preachers. I have learned and taught

 that money moves about for its own reasons, and neither need nor deservingness are magnetic to it.

-----

###### It depends on powerful, well-crafted, measurable strategies —a tried and true system—rooted in common sense and that works across all kinds of media. The strategies that we’ll talk about have been applied in 136 different business categories, by over 93,417 entrepreneurs in 167 different countries—they deliver.

 In other words, Magnetic Marketing
is as proven as the law of gravity. I tell you this because it may require some patience from you for you to really get it and use it, but like gravity, you cannot defy its facts.
 This switch is critical because…

 YOU’VE BEEN SET UP TO FAIL

 If you’ve managed to survive even a year or two in business, it’s obvious that you’ve gone well beyond the limited framework provided by our
 “educational system
 ” when it comes to grasping the core principles of marketing.
 But even with the scant marketing education business owners may have acquired from school, mentors, and self
 schooling, the fact is that most of them are like the blind leading the blind. Even the highly vaunted MBA accreditations typically fail to deliver serious
 “real-world,
 ” bottom-line results when put to the test of facing the dog-eat-dog frenzy of the marketplace.
 I set before you as proof—and
is a law much like gravity is, you can not fix it, you can only know it and change your

 actions to fit into the section you want to. The financial reality is that in every profession, every category of business, every sales team, every population, these figures hold true:

-----

###### 1% create tremendous incomes and wealth

 4% do very well

 15% earn good livings

 60% struggle endlessly

 20% fail

 In a nutshell, 80 percent do poorly / 20 percent succeed.
 Why then would you want to copy the marketing done by

 the majority when facts show it FAILS THEM? Why should you follow that same path to frustration and failure?
 Most
“ordinary
” businesses believe they have to advertise and market like much bigger brand-name companies, so they invest (waste) lots of money in many different kinds of media to promote image, brand, and presence.

 You CANNOT make the mistake of jumping into media because
“everyone else is using it.
” Big name brands have all sorts of reasons for the way they advertise and market that have ZERO to do with getting a customer or making sales. Your agenda is much simpler—in fact, there’s a huge difference between how BIG
corporations consider marketing and how you as a
entrepreneur and business owner sees it.

 Big Corporation Agenda for Advertising and Marketing

Please/appease its board of directors (most of whom know zip about
advertising and marketing but have lots of opinions)

Please/appease its stockholders.

Look good and appropriate to Wall Street.

Look good and appropriate to the media.

Build brand identity.

Win awards for advertising.

Sell something.

-----

###### YOUR Agenda

Sell something. NOW!

###### I realized a long time ago that big dumb c
orporations were

 using sloppy, wasteful
“mass advertising
” practices that had them hemorrhaging money left and right.
 But that didn’t stop
entrepreneurs and businesses owners from
 “modeling
 ” what they saw-read-heard every day, wrongly thinking that “if it works for them, it’s gotta work for us too.”

**Here’s the No B.S. Truth:
The typical entrepreneur and business owner is**
essentially clueless when it comes to advertising and marketing. This makes
them highly vulnerable to becoming what I call “Advertising Victims”—easy
prey for media salespeople and ad agencies and anyone else who doesn’t
know how to actually close the deal and make a sale.

###### Think I’m wrong?
 If you ever manage to corner a business owner, try to get him to tell you with confidence WHERE his customers and sales come from, what it costs to get a customer, what kind of results does one ad get versus another. Try. He can’t. He’s guessing. And that’s what the industry vultures rely on, they know that when their customer (i.e., YOU) can only guess how

 well their marketing works, they have a credit card they can ding regularly and without fail.
 I realized something different had to be done, because entr epreneurs and business owners need a saner, more productive path to business growth that makes their business life more pleasant, lucrative, and certain.

 AND IT’S NOT ABOUT WORKING HARDER

-----

###### You’ve been told over and over again that the answer to all your troubles is to:

 Work Harder

 Work Smarter

 Work Harder and Smarter

 Sorry, but none of those will fly or even come close to hitting the mark.
 It’s not about working harder and being smarter about how

 you do so. I’m willing to wager you’ve already gone down that road and have done all you can do and the results just weren’t there.
 You don’t need more hard work… not from yourself, your spouse, your staff—nobody. Instead, you need a NEW strategy. You need a SYSTEM—one that works for you, 24/7/365 doing all this for you:

 A system that generates a predictable flow of new customers, clients,
and patients

 A system that turns every customer into two customers

 A system that creates repeatable business

 A system that allows you freedom (financial and

 time)

 A system focused on marketing

 The more productive answer is to develop a SYSTEM that attracts new customers, clients, or patients to you in an

-----

###### organized way.

 WHY NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR THIS NEW SYSTEM

 The system I’m about to reveal to you in this book will radically change your thinking about what you invest your time in, what’s truly important when it comes to making

 money, and the way you communicate your ideas, products, services and worth to the world.
 It’s a much more sophisticated way of creating power for yourself in a cluttered marketplace. A systematic way to magnetically attract your ideal customers, clients or patients
.
 A system that gives you reliable and predictable results so

 you finally know when you invest X dollars, you can expect Y number of leads, then Z number of appointments or selling opportunities.
 You want a system that enables you to better target the most appropriate and valuable customers for your business, so you’re not wasting time, energy, resources scurrying down rabbit holes chasing “would-be” customers who in fact will

 “never-be.”
 Most importantly, you need a system you can comprehend and control.
 It’s just too complicated to wing it on your own anymore. Way back when, I managed my own mailings with a printout of the prospect list, a stack of envelopes, and an occasionally

 amenable cat to lick the stamps. It worked great for me then, but today’s barrage of media options makes such a simple operation not only outdated, but terribly self-limiting. Media choices abound and multi-channel marketing funnels that

-----

###### best leverage the unique strengths of each is the proper path. You can’t succeed with a haphazard approach.
 You MUST follow a well-conceived, testable, scalable, practical system—and you’ve come to the right person to reveal just such a system to you.

 THEY CALL ME “THE PROFESSOR OF HARSH REALITY”

 It’s a title I proudly embrace. Reality and life have always been harsh. As Hollywood legend John Wayne once said:

#### “Life is hard. And it’s harder if you’re
 stupid.”

###### In forty-five years of helping all kinds of entrepreneurs and businesses achieve their dreams, I’ve realized that business owners aren’t actually “stupid” when it comes to raw cerebral horsepower. The problem lies in the “stupid” things they do that they’ve been led to believe are true.
 That may seem a bit blunt, or even a bit uncomfortable.

 Good.
 I unapologetically wrote this book to offer the blunt, unvarnished truth
 about how entrepreneurs and business owners really CAN create a flood of new customers, clients, and patients while building wealth, independence and sustainability.
 There are a lot of numbers bandied about in marketing—

 response percentages, circulation, pass-along effect, visitors, dedicated visitors, likes, friends, fans, and on and on. I’m here to tell you it’s all B.S. It’s all about leads that convert to income. Period.

-----

###### And the very worst number in business is ONE. If you are over-dependent on any ONE thing in your business, you will— at some point—be punished for this vulnerability. You can bank on that. One key person, one key account or client, one product, one service, one skill, one technology—all woefully

 insecure and unstable. This is particularly true of MEDIA.
 It’s about attracting more customers who respect and value what you do so much so that they are willing to pay for it. It’s not about just bringing in more (quantity), it’s about bringing in more of the right people (quality).
 And the foundational key to making this happen…

 YOU MUST SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM THE COMPETITION

 I want you to understand, whatever your deliverables are, they are not your business.
 You must make yourself the go-to person, place, or entity for some audience that can be interested in you and your

 deliverables. And the primary way to accomplish this is by crafting an answer to this question:

#### “Why should I choose you versus any and every other provider of the same product or service that you provide?”

###### Resolved with what legendary ad man Rosser Reeves called a

 USP
, a Unique Selling Proposition.
 Tremendous turnarounds in business have taken place as the result of great USPs. Domino’s Pizza was originally driven by a marketing message which everybody came to know,

-----

###### “Fresh hot pizza delivered in thirty minutes or less, guaranteed.”
 If you dissect it, you’ll see some interesting things. First of all, it doesn’t claim to be all things to all people. There’s no mention of mama’s recipe from the old country. No mention

 of a special sauce. In fact, there’s not even any mention of good
pizza. All it says is that it is going to get to you while it’s still hot and it’s still fresh and that they guarantee to do that.
 What is your USP? This is going to take a little bit of work. Somewhere in your business, there is a good answer. If not, you need to make one.

 Unfortunately, the first thing one does when we start to talk about Unique Selling Proposition is to jump to the conclusion that there is nothing special about their business. Sometimes in rare instances, that’s true. That’s when you have to do some creative thinking about your business to make it into something unique.
 Here are three questions you can ask yourself to help kick
 start the process of finding or creating your USP.

 1. What specifically do you do that’s truly different
 compared to competitors?

 For Domino’s, it was originally being there in thirty minutes or less. More recently, they revolutionized the company against badly sagging sales by taking the worst ranked pizza to the best ranked for taste and quality. But

 that’s actually the ante to already being in the game.

 2. How do you uniquely benefit your target market?

-----

###### J.K. Rowling of the Harry Potter
books and her publisher made each new book’s release of exceptional benefit to independent bookstores with a devised plan for big events, books held back to release at midnight, drawing huge numbers of kids and parents into these stores

 milling about at a party, in costume, snacking and browsing and buying other books for an hour or more before the clock struck midnight.
 The target market, the bookstore owner, was uniquely

 benefited in reciprocity. Rowling got far more promotional work out of the store owners than hundreds of other

 authors of other children’s fantasy books.

 3. Can you niche your target market in a way nobody

 else can or will?

 One of my students, a lawyer named Bill Hammond, created

 Alzheimer’s Law, a subset of elder law essentially wrapping traditional estate planning, Medicare and Medicaid planning,

 and other family legal matters inside a differently described package, positioned for families with a senior showing signs

 of or having been diagnosed with dementia. This enabled Bill to use the exact lead generation strategies laid out in this

 system.

 Take the time to create your own USP—it’s one of the greatest marketing weapons you can ever have for your

 product(s) or your business.
