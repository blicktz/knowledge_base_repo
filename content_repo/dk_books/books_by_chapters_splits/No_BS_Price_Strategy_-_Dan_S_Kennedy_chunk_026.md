For this strategy to work, price cannot be their primary concern. They must be concerned with
some other form of value. It can be exclusivity, quality, or something else, but it has to exist. This
applies to my healthcare business and its clients, evidenced by its prices being a substantial
premium over the typical competitor. Very rarely do we get price shoppers. When we do they grab
their chest and gasp for air when they hear our prices. We do our best to keep them away, and to
attract only those for whom price is not a concern. Our internal philosophy is that we’d rather
provide the best therapy possible than provide the most therapy possible. Everything we do is
aligned with that attitude. We’re in the results business. That is one of the key values we provide.
Ironically we don’t promote that, our clients do. Our reputation is that of being expensive but worth
it.

A couple of other examples of skimming would be prestige carmakers such as Rolls-Royce and
Bugatti. In case you don’t know, Bugatti sells cars for over $1,000,000.00 each. Clearly their market
is not even remotely concerned with price. Simon Cowell from _American Idol has the Bugatti_
Veyron. He is one, only one, of the 6,000 people in the world that this carmaker estimates can afford
the $1,700,000 price tag. If it strikes you as a drawback that they have only 6,000 potential
customers in the entire world, don’t lose sight of the advantage of only having 6,000 prospects,
knowing exactly who they are, and knowing a great deal about why they buy. Don’t lose sight,
either, that selling to just 1% produces $102-million.

You do not need a price as high as the Bugatti to utilize skim pricing. You just need to focus on
the cream of your market and not be concerned with producing large amounts of volume. Price
skimming is about small volume by nature. Only certain people within the market can afford to be a
part of the club. They have to be your focus if your objective is to skim the cream. My co-author,
Dan Kennedy, has always run his private practice as a consultant and direct-response copywriter this
way, much the same as I run our therapy practice. In Dan’s case, there are lot of marketing
consultants renting themselves out for a few thousand dollars a day, and traveling to their clients
(thus incurring considerable opportunity cost—one day’s work equals two or three days of travel);
Dan charges $18,800.00 per day and makes clients come to him. There are a lot of copywriters
creating ads and direct-mail campaigns for fees in the $5,000.00 to $15,000.00 range; Dan routinely
commands from $50,000.00 to $100,000.00 and up, plus royalties. The pool of prospective clients
for Dan is much, much, much smaller than for the other consultants and copywriters, but he knows
who they are and he is rather easily able to make sure they all know of him. He has written much

## Sequential Skimming

Another related method is called sequential skimming. Just like skimming, this method starts with
skimming cream off the top. The difference is that once demand dips because the top has been
skimmed, so does the price. It drops down a level in order to stimulate more demand. It stays at that
level until demand drops off and then the price will be reduced to increase demand for the next
lower level of buyers. This goes on until the demand for the offering is exhausted.

The most obvious examples of sequential skimming can be found by looking at electronics. Think
about plasma televisions. They came out and were priced high to attract the early adopters. The
early adopters ran out and paid the price to be the first kids on the block that could hang their
television on their wall. They were a little bummed out when they realized that the TVs didn’t last
long and were prone to have images burnt into the screen. That gave them reason to run out to buy
the new and improved models when they came out. So what happened to the old models when the
new ones came out? Their prices dropped to an acceptable level for the next market. This trend
continues today. Flat panels have prices reminiscent of the old tube-TVs. As of this writing it seems
the next generation is going to be 3D. They will follow the same path.

The downside of this strategy is that it can have a negative effect on purchase patterns. Savvy
buyers often figure out what is happening and delay their purchase as a result. This can be mitigated
two ways. The first is to maximize the time between price decreases so that there is a significant
cost of waiting. The other way to mitigate buyers putting off a purchase is to strip features as you
drop the price.

## Penetration Pricing

Penetration pricing is expected to drive huge volumes of product into a market, taking a product or
business from new and unknown to dominant at high velocity, penetrating broad and deep in the
market.

Penetration pricing is driven by the belief that customers prefer lower prices. Logically it sounds
true, and it can be; however if you have two products that the buyers know nothing about some will
choose the low price while others choose the higher price. That is because some see less risk in the
lower price and others see less risk in the higher price. A higher price holds the perception of
quality. The old saying “you get what you pay for” has a strong influence on our psyche. If
everyone preferred lowest price, there would only be Kohl’s and no Neimann Marcus, there would
only be drugstore sunglasses and no Bulgari, there would only be Yugo and no Rolls-Royce, there
would only be Hanes and no _Carine Gilson. The list goes on and on. Obviously, if everyone_
preferred the lowest price and shopped only based on price, the diversity that exists in the market
would not be there. There would be no luxury offerings of any kind.

Apple manages big, fast penetration with a new product, yet practices skimming rather than
penetration pricing.

The dangerous idea behind penetration pricing is that market share automatically equates to
profit. This myth cropped up back in the late ’60s and spawned a cult of thought. The concept has
been hailed by many business leaders including Jack Welch who said GE would not participate in
any category in which it did not hold either the number one or number the two positions in marketshare. As a result a whole generation of businesses have been destroying margins in search for the
holy grail of market share. It is believed you get there faster and surer with penetration pricing.
Amazon has sold e-books at a loss in order to dominate the e-reader market with its Kindle, on the
theory that its market share will equate to profit after the fact.

To be fair, there is some truth in the idea. The company with the greatest market share should
enjoy economies of scale. That is, they should be able to produce their offerings for a lower price
than their competitors. They may also kill off competitors early, avoiding costs of ongoing head-tohead competition. Dan Kennedy tells a story of once selling a company to its competitor for
considerably more than it was intrinsically worth, based largely on the savings snared by the buyer
by not having to compete with it going forward.

Being number one matters. But how you get to number one matters too. For most small
businesses, profit must come before market share. If you prioritize growth over profit then you run a
significant risk of never reaching profitability, and running out of gas before you get to the last lap,
let alone the checkered flag and trophy. Market share is nice, profit is better, and often, the marketshare leader never becomes the most profitable competitor in the field. Penetration pricing is not for
the faint of heart nor the thinly capitalized.

While penetration prices are low in comparison to the rest of the market, that does not always
mean they are cheap. The advent of Lexus was an example of this. The car company saw a gap
between the average car market and the luxury market. They determined that they could pull buyers
up, from basic to luxury, and pull luxury buyers down to more affordable product, creating a new
category they would lead and dominate.

As you can see, there are many ways to work your way to the price you finally settle on and
present to the marketplace, and you will likely wind up setting prices differently for different
products and services, maybe for different markets, maybe at different times. Penetration pricing is
a timing driven, typically short-lived price strategy replaced by others. Prices set by other methods
may live long and produce great prosperity with only tweaks up or down based on costs, seasons or
competitive influences. How you set your prices is one of the most important decisions you make in
business. It deserves a lot of thought.

## Where Did 99 Cents Come From?

 Jason Marrs

We’ve all seen prices ending in 99 cents. Have you ever wondered why it is done? Some
say it generates higher sales than rounding up to the next number. On the other hand some
say it generates more profit than rounding down to the next number since the buyer will
still round up in his head thereby causing you to leave money on the table.

The origin of 99 cents depends on who you ask. Paul Harvey said that it was created in
Chicago by newspaper publisher Melville E. Stone who sold his paper for a penny. In
order to generate more sales he talked newsstand operators into selling their products for a
penny less than an even number so that buyers would be encouraged to spend the extra
penny on his paper.

Another theory holds that it was done to fix a flaw in cash registers. Cash registers were
seen as a great invention in 1883, and you have to credit it as such since they’re still in use
today. They allowed merchants to record and track every transaction except one, the one
that never got entered. To solve the problem of unscrupulous cashiers pocketing money it
is believed that merchants started ending their prices in 99 cents to force the cashier to use
the cash register in order to make change.

Finally some believe that it was used by merchants to better track and identify sale-priced
items. I frequent a wine store that does this. Their sale items all end in 7.

Regardless of where this all started, one of the big reasons it continues is because it
works. For some strange reason more people will pay $9.99 than will pay $10.00. It is
totally irrational but testing continues to prove it true. But it is not universally true. There
are, of course, real psychological barriers in prices such as $20.00, $50.00, $100.00, and
$500.00. So the idea of staying just below them has long proven to be a successful
strategy in pricing. This all varies from business to business. I tend to use round numbers
in my healthcare business. In my experience with that business and market, zeros work
great. Of course we attract a very high-end market. My personal theory is that the odd
numbers are seen as nickel-and-diming. I don’t know the reason. I just know that it works
well in that business at this point in time.

That said, I do currently have some new packaged products that I have developed for the
business. While their total numbers are round, their discounted numbers all end in 7. I am
testing different end numbers in these prices and, at this writing, have not yet determined
whether 7, 9, or 0 serves me best. As with most things in business, the reality is that you
need to test them. Just because O’s or 7’s work great in one market for one offering does
not necessarily mean they’ll transfer over to another offering in a different market. Many
swear that a 3 is the kiss of death while others swear that it is a godsend. You don’t know
for certain until you test.

## CHAPTER 18

 Why Not Charge People to Buy From You?

 Dan Kennedy

**Would you be interested in a fascinating “secret” about the rich vs. the poor?**

Before you answer, let me share one of the 28 Wealth Magnets from my book _No B.S. Wealth_
_Attraction in The New Economy, Magnet #24: Behavioral Congruency. In briefest form, this says_
that you can’t reasonably expect to be wealthy unless you adopt the behavior of the wealthy that
separate them from the non-wealthy and never-to-become wealthy. You can’t reasonably expect to
have an exceptionally prosperous business unless you utilize the practices that separate prosperous
from poor and always-struggling businesses. This is behavioral congruency. Your behavior must be
congruent with your ambitions, and the behavior of those successfully achieving your ambitions.

Now, would you like to know a fascinating “secret” about the rich vs. the poor?

The rich are paid for what they do in advance, before they do it. The poor are paid after their
work. The poor work from the first through the fourteenth day to be finally paid on the fifteenth.
The rich are paid before they even begin. Trump gets “points” in a real estate development and,
often, upfront cash too, before the first brick is delivered to its site let alone laid, the developer gets
his fee for assembling the investors before building begins, the architect gets a retainer before even
writing one line on blueprints—but the bricklayer, he works from the first through the 14th day to
be finally paid on the 15th. There are many practical reasons it is better to be paid before rather than
after. There are remarkably powerful metaphysical reasons too. Because being paid before rather
than after puts you squarely in the company of the rich instead of the poor, you are rich rather than
poor. Mental state is precursor to physical reality.

So, why not add price strategy to your business that gets you paid before, by literally charging
people fees of some kind merely for the privilege of subsequently buying goods and services from
you? Get paid in advance and get paid for “air” too!

Can’t be done? Really?

Country clubs do it. Night clubs have cover charges. Disney World does it: you are paying
admission to enter a giant, interconnected web of souvenir shops surrounded by “attractions” that
drive sales of the items in the stores. Racetracks do it: they charge for parking, admission, and
programs, for you to have the privilege of wagering (on which they profit) and eating in their
restaurants or at their concession stands. Hertz does it—their top-level #1 Club Membership carries
a fee of $1,500.00 a year, for which you get to rent cars from them. I do it: new clients pay, as of
this writing, $18,800.00 for an initial consulting day devoted, in large part, to determining what
projects I’m going to do for them, for which they will pay fees and royalties. Many consultants and
copywriters do those kinds of initial meetings free, in hope of securing assignments. Not me. No
free lunch. I have guided clients of mine in the pizza business, other kinds of restaurants, retail
stores, and professional practices to converting customers to members and collecting access fees.

This strategy delivers several benefits. First, it is a product with a price collected, before any
other purchases are made, so that you at least get some money from each and every customer
regardless of their subsequent purchase activity. This money can fund your advertising, marketing,
and promotion, as well as provide profit. Second, the customer who pays for the right to buy is
infinitely less likely to spread his purchasing around and buy elsewhere, and likely to patronize your
business more frequently than he otherwise would. If you’ve paid $1,500.00 for the privilege of
renting cars from Hertz, are you going to call Avis? We own a Disney time-share in Orlando.
Owning it motivates (compels) us to vacation there, on average, two to three times more often each
year than we would otherwise. It’s a discouragement to go elsewhere and pay for lodging at a

vacation destination when we already own one with annually expiring points at Disney. This brings
us back to their souvenir, apparel and gift stores, and restaurants with greater frequency.
