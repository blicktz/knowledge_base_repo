###### more desirable your magnet and its offer, the stronger the pull it will have to your perfect prospect.
 Here are a few Lead Generation Magnets that work very well:

 • My friend Larry Levin, seen often on Fox Business News and heard
 on radio, offers his options trading technique that made him over $1 million—for free. If you’ll just call his 800 number and leave your email address, he’ll send it to you.
 • My client Ted Oakley, a wealth manager seen on CNBC and other
 investor-oriented publications, offers his free book, $20 MILLION AND BROKE (Keysar Publishing, 2013), for business owners selling or who have recently sold their companies.
 • My client ArthroNew offers a free online video about chronic and
 arthritic pain relief featuring Dr. John Frank, M.D. and Super Bowl player, and a free month’s trial package (to move prospects to tele- reps).
 • Doctors with local practices I’ve worked with offer books like The
 Official Consumer Guide to Cosmetic Surgery and How to End Back Pain and Golf As If You Were 10 Years Younger—Without Drugs or Surgery.
 • A B2B consultant offers a “Special Research Report” on expense
 reduction and cost control case histories to hospital CEOs and CFOs.
 • A company of which I was part owner taught people how to start
 homebased information-publishing businesses. It successfully advertised its Lead Generation Magnet in over 50 national magazines for years—its “little yellow book” was titled How to Make $4,000 a Day, Sitting at Home in Your Underwear, with Your Computer.
 • My longtime client Ben Glass, a personal injury attorney in Virginia,
 creates and advertises many different free reports and books and is a master at using Lead Generation Magnets. You can take a look at www.BenGlassLaw.com. Ben is so good at this, thousands of lawyers all across the country use his LGM formats and models, and you can see that at GreatLegalMarketing.com.

 Answer the WHY YOU Question


-----

###### “Why should I do business with you rather than any other option— including doing nothing?” The answer is what I call your Unique Selling Proposition (USP). Your lead magnet should make dead certain that the factors that make you different are clearly spelled out. This provides fuel to your Call to Action (something else you need in your magnet; do not forget that critical piece) that compels them to act without hesitation, knowing that the benefit they want can only be found with your products/services.
 Don’t rely on hope, networking, or prospecting grunt work to get customers through your door or to your website. Create a lead-generation system that includes these key components to get them to raise their hands and ask for you.

 The Seamless System Wins Many big, dumb companies wind up with separate, separately ruled little fiefdoms. Advertising. Marketing. Social Media. Sales. Their princes view each other with suspicion. Often, they compete with each other for budget dollars. They don’t respect each other’s roles or value. The whole thing winds up a patchwork quilt, with big, ugly seams separating each patch. You probably can’t afford this all-too-common level of corporate dysfunction.
 In its place, you want a seamless system—a customer-centric system. It’s entirely about the customer and totally designed and organized to move someone seamlessly from first point of contact along a single, well- paved and fenced-in path to the point of sale. If that point of first contact is in social media, terrific—but then you must move that person from the avenue through your driveway, onto your garden path, and ultimately to the point of sale.

#### Making the Sale

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips “Well, it was a gold bomber jacket. How could people stay away?” said art advisor Stefano Basilico after the sale. “I think we’re going to start seeing a lot of bomber jackets come out at auction from now on.”
 This quote ran as part of a story on www.ArtNews.com after Christie’s Auction House ran a record-breaking auction of contemporary art,


-----

###### including Seth Price’s Vintage Bomber 2006 that sold for $785,000, beating its high estimate by more than ten times.
 That night, Christie’s grossed $852.9 million. The artists included Cy Twombly, Ed Ruscha, Peter Doig, Martin Kippenberger, Elaine Sturtevant, and Seth Price. Seventy-five of the 80 lots on offer found buyers, for an impressive sell-through rate by lot of 94%.
 Warhol’s Triple Elvis [Ferus Type] 1963 sold for $81.9 million and Warhol’s Four Marlons made $69.6 million. An untitled Cy Twombly from 1970 handily surpassed its estimate, $35 million to $55 million, selling for $69.6 million with premium.
 “The evening was primarily made up of people buying for themselves,” Brett Gorvy, Christie’s chairman and international head of postwar and contemporary art, said at the postsale press conference. He pointed out there were 500 bidders from 43 different countries and that new buyers were facilitated by recent “outreach” efforts in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Middle East.
 “This was a collecting-buying pool tonight, rather than dealers,” he said. Christie’s got it right. It wasn’t inviting people to an art opening or gallery event. It was cultivating relationships with qualified art buyers from around the world in order to make a sale.
 And it was record-breaking. Many brands on social media stay in the engagement stage and never move on to the sale. They want “Likes” because it makes them feel good to have people connected to them.
 Likes can’t be deposited in the bank and won’t pay your bills. How you make the sale has to be determined before you create content. Using the famous Covey tactic, begin with the end in mind.

 How to Do It Right Michael Kors, world-renowned, award-winning designer of luxury accessories and ready-to-wear, did a fantastic job of incorporating a sales strategy into Facebook marketing. According to its case study on Facebook:

 Michael Kors launched a new sneaker product line. The launch, the brand’s biggest new product launch, reached the target customers (women, ages 15 to 35) for the shoes—“decked out with luxe


-----

###### textures, metallic accents, and high-shine studs”—so Michael Kors decided it would make Facebook a key focus. The launch kicked off the brand’s move into sneakers and was part of a broader effort to attract new customers to the brand. The campaign primarily aimed to increase awareness and drive purchases of the new sneakers.

 It created an exclusive sneaker line of 500 pairs that sold out in a matter of seconds via Facebook, prior to releasing a full new line in its stores. In many locations, that second release sold out as well, no doubt spurred by the frenzy social media caused.
 The overall results:

 • Reached 36 million people in its target audience (Nielsen Online
 Campaign Ratings)
 • Sellout of many sneaker styles in-store and online
 • A 16-point increase in awareness of the new sneaker (Nielsen Brand
 Effect study), equating to 5.8 million incremental users aware of the sneaker
 • A 16-point increase in association of Michael Kors with “Jet. Set.
 Go” (Nielsen Brand Effect study), equating to 5.8 million incremental users associating the brand with the message
 • 1 million views of the sneaker videos attributed to the ads

 We’ve used this same model for something a little less sexy than sneakers: furnaces.
 For McCarthy’s One-Hour Heating and Air Conditioning in Omaha, Nebraska, we wanted to drive direct sales to a profitable offering but one that gave great value to its target market. Here’s how you make a furnace sexy: Make your offer exclusive, special, and time-limited, and watch your audience behave differently. This offer was available for only 57 furnaces at a price of $981 (normally valued at $3,000) with the purchase of an air conditioning system.
 When it’s time to make the sale, if you’ve followed my advice and focused your attention only on your perfect prospects and spent time perfecting the skill of community engagement, your job will now be easy.

###### But how exactly does this happen? Sometimes it’s better not to ask for the sale of what you really want, but rather for the sale of something else entirely.

 The Youngest Influencer to Make It Big Twenty-two-year-old Kylie Jenner has been named the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, snatching the crown from Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg who was 23 at the time he accrued the title. This comes just three years and four months after her company, Kylie Cosmetics, was founded in November 2015.
 As the youngest member of the wealthy, idolized Kardashian/Jenner clan she has had an unquestionable advantage over competition, of which most other business owners can only dream. Prior to setting up Kylie Cosmetics, she starred in the hit reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians for nearly a decade of her childhood and teenage life. Kylie began to build an enviable following of dedicated fans on multiple social platforms alongside the growth of social media. As of the time of writing (December 24, 2019), she has 154M followers on Instagram, ranking her as the most followed person on the channel.
 As a result, Kylie had already established her own brand before creating Kylie Cosmetics. The financial boost that the Kardashians’ publicity provided her, combined with her fame and beauty, has proved a winning marketing formula.

 THE ULTIMATE INFLUENCER Unlike most beauty and cosmetics companies with a presence on social media, Kylie does not need to turn to others for help when promoting her products. She is the ultimate influencer, using her own face to exhibit her makeup range. This likely saves her a lot of money many others would need to budget for third-party endorsement and also eliminates the risk of being caught up in influencer fraud.
 Despite Kylie Cosmetics having its own dedicated social media accounts, it seems Jenner cannot resist plugging the brand on her personal channels too. It is clear why; Kylie Cosmetics’ mere 19.8M Instagram followers pales in comparison to her own personal following. Although this number surpasses many other international cosmetics giants, it is certainly


-----

###### not the most popular among the Instagram community. Rival MAC cosmetics, for example, has 21.2M followers to date.
 It is therefore safe to assume that Kylie’s sales success comes from a mixture of promotion on her personal channel as well as her dedicated business channel. As a result, she increases her chances of conversion by targeting a wide audience. She can appeal to repeat Kylie Cosmetics customers through one channel, whilst attempting to convert fans of her celebrity into consumers of her products on the other.
 In June, it was revealed that Instagram stories now has more than 500M active daily users, a figure that has risen dramatically from 250M since 2017. According to a recent report by Google, 59.6% of Generation Z actively uses Instagram, in contrast to Facebook (52.8%) and Twitter (just 35.4%). Despite Snapchat being the second most popular platform among this generation (56.4%), it attracted just 200M daily active users in the first quarter of this year by comparison.
 It is definitely no coincidence that Kylie has cut back on her frequent Snapchat activity and refocused her efforts on Instagram. She is observing how her core fan base is interacting with her content and adjusting channel usage according to the presence of her young target audience.
 With this rise in the popularity of Instagram stories, Jenner has most recently taken to obsessively updating her Instagram story and feed, rather than focusing on other less popular social channels.
 Nearly all of these stories are used to endorse products from kyliecosmetics.com. Whether in the form of selfies, color swatches, or packaging previews, Kylie likes to inundate her followers with makeup. When she’s not trying to convince her fans to buy her cosmetics, she’s trying to entice them into buying her boyfriend’s latest album.

 A SIMPLE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE Kylie Cosmetics’ website is (as expected) unequivocally girly, although not particularly groundbreaking or original in its design. Instead, it has been created to provide a quick, seamless shopping experience, whilst also affording customers the opportunity to browse at their leisure through simplified menu items like “face” “eyes,” and “lips” (see Figure 14.1 on page 253).


-----

###### The official Kyliecosmetics.com is clearly designed as an extension of her Instagram presence. Powered by the ecommerce platform Shopify, the website includes a long, segmented homepage, which makes it perfect for browsing on mobile. A significant amount of scrolling is required to browse featured products, and this resonates with Instagram’s user interface from which plenty of site traffic originates.

**FIGURE 14.1: Kylie Cosmetics Simple Menu Tab**

###### The design is built to accommodate impulse purchases, with a centrally placed “add to cart” call to action button beneath each product photo, leaving little chance for customers to dither and change their mind (see Figure 14.2).

**FIGURE 14.2: “Add to Cart” CTAs Ask Customers to Buy Now**

###### Priority has also been placed on upselling here, as a sticky shopping cart appears with a handy reminder to spend “$X more for free shipping” once you have added the first item to your cart (see Figure 14.3 on page 255).

 DRIVING DEMAND Driving demand with limited edition stock is something Kylie is no stranger to. Seasonal launches are a hit with her fans, who have come to expect new collections at Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and mid-summer, to name a few.
 Releasing a new range for her August birthday each year has also become a tradition (see Figure 14.4 on page 255), and she even announced an assortment of limited-edition cosmetics to celebrate her daughter, Stormi, just weeks after she was born. In February 2016, Jenner released six limited-edition lip-shade kits inspired by Valentine’s Day, which sold out in

###### If you are old enough to have owned a Walkman, then you probably remember Columbia House’s special introductory offer … eight records (or tapes or CDs or eight-tracks even!) for the price of one. Started as a mail order business in 1955, Columbia House secured over 125,000 members and $1.7 million in net revenue its first year alone. Its model was, and still is with a DVD-only program, to give away its product with a small level of commitment in order to secure a customer.
 Jay McKeever at Seconds & Surplus offered a coupon that gave a 10% discount after a Fan “liked” the Facebook page (see Figure 14.5). Along with that he ran surveys, quizzes, and posted photos to increase engagement.
 The results:

 • $12,000 in sales directly from Facebook with total sales increase of
 over $32,000 in one month
 • Increase in Facebook fan count by 300%

**FIGURE 14.5: Convert Prospects into Customers with a Coupon**

###### The popular Asian restaurant P.F. Chang’s ran a Facebook promotion in celebration of its anniversary. All of its Facebook fans received a coupon for complimentary lettuce wraps with the purchase of any entrée. While of course this attracted a lot of new fans, the real success was that it drove 50,000 people into the restaurant for the offer, 40% of which were first-time customers.
 Or in the B2B space, give a seminar on a topic of interest for your prospects and include one-on-one consultations as part of the event. Your attendees get a sense of what you have to offer in a trial run yet in the most- likely-to-purchase environment. Include a time-sensitive call-to-action introductory offer to your services or product to drive more prospects into your “upsell” marketing funnel.
 Offering a transitional stepping stone is a strategic way to speed up your sales cycle and convert more leads into paying customers. How can you give your prospects a compelling reason to give you a try while ensuring they are committed and serious potential customers? Because if they aren’t, then they aren’t worth pursuing any further.
 Ever hear the saying that an idea is worthless without action? Along those lines, a prospect is worthless without conversion. If you aren’t actively turning your prospects into buyers, then you are missing out on a lot of potential revenue. It would be like closing your flower shop that is overflowing with red roses in inventory the day before Valentine’s Day.

 THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF CONVERTING YOUR LEADS INTO SALES While there are many different ways you can convert a lead into a sale, here are a few to keep in mind:

 • Email follow-up sequence with a call to action. Following up after a
 prospect doesn’t convert means more than just emailing additional sales messages. It requires answering objectives and providing content to further nurture the relationship before making the sale.
 •  Follow-up training event. If you had a training event and your
 prospects did not convert, that does not mean it is a one-and-done deal. When we held our FB Sales Funnel launch in the fall, almost 500 people watched videos 1 through 4, but many did not convert
