You can misinterpret, and I realize that. It's not thai **li**

I learned long ago the vital importance of regimen, ritual, COfl

So it takes a lot to derail me. Most people are much,
more easily distracted. Perhaps I'm extreme in my insistence proceeding with my work plans no matter what, but mosl |>npie
are even more extreme in their willingness to set aside tin **I**
work plans for just about anything—hangnail, stiff breeze.

###### How a "Little Man" Reminds Us of "The Magic Power" 8,000 Times and Counting
Some of you may know that I'm a horse racing aficionado. **Id**
me, a bad day at the track beats a good day at the office. I could
relate when George Burns as God in the movie Oh God! headed
off to the track with a racing form stuck in his back pocket to
watch "the magnificent animals I created. I did very good work
there." The racetrack is one of the most interesting places on
earth. And there, like everywhere we really look, we can find
powerful reminders of what it takes to excel in this world.

At age 46, Laffit Pincay, Jr., had accomplished just about
everything a jockey can hope to accomplish. He had won the
Kentucky Derby, the Belmont, six Breeder's Cups, the Eclipse
Award five times, and he had already been in the Sports Hall of Fame—for

18 years. In 1995, he won his 8,000th race. He has
since retired at age 56.

A decade ago, you wouldn't have found any racing authority
who would have bet that Pincay would still be riding, winning,
and winning more frequently than most, at the old-for-athletes
age of 46, and on to 50. To a man, we would all have bet against

horse racing, you'll quickly see that this is no easy task. Perched
like a bird on top of an elephant, the jockey cannot control the
horse through brute strength. There is that, but there is more. A
horse either respects his jockey or he does not. Most respected
Pincay. A 115-pound embodiment of extraordinary, applied selfdiscipline that commanded respect from beast as well as man.

###### How to Make the World Hand Over Just about Anything You Ask
Having and commanding the respect of others is a tremendous
advantage in life. That edge comes from self-discipline. Having a
(preferably private) sense of superiority over others is another
power-producing edge. That, too, comes from self-discipline.
The highly disciplined individual does not have to point a gun at
anyone to take what he wants; people "sense" his power and
cheerfully give him everything they've got.

Take a look at how little discipline most people have. I admit,
I couldn't match Lafitt Pincay. One of America's greatest humorous speakers, Charlie Jarvis, tells of coming home from a trip and
confessing to his wife that he'd violated his diet and wolfed
down a Snickers bar at the airport snack shop. After she chided
him, he pointed out that he had actually demonstrated enormous
self-discipline: "I wanted to wolf down ALL the Snickers bars."
I'm sorry to say, I was in that category more often than not for

years. Still, compared to most of the people I observe, I was a selfdiscipline master even then. These days, I must control what I eat
much more carefully than ever. I peeled off 45 pounds from my
heaviest peak; I keep that off and my diabetes in check without
prescription medication of any kind. I must pay attention to carb
counts and blood sugar levels, and I take about 50 different vitamin, mineral, and herbal supplements a day. Compare that to the
average "wide-load" American, who can't go a full day resisting
junk food. In 2003, a record number of "million-dollar babies" in
the NFL showed up at camp overweight and out of shape.

I have noticed, since I took off my fat and got my physical
condition under better control, my income has gone up. Is this
coincidental? Maybe. Complex? Maybe. But quite probably it
reflects an unconscious preference on clients' part to have confidence in, to trust, to give money to, to meet the fee demands
without question of someone who appears to have self-esteem,
self-control, self-discipline. Food—pardon the word—for
thought.

As I was writing the first edition of this book, a young lady
named Shannon Faulkner concluded a two-year court battle in
order to gain entrance to the all-male military academy, The
Citadel. Her presence there was bitterly opposed by the administration, faculty, students, and alumni. On her day of arrival,
armed guards escorted her in. One week later, she quit. Setting
all political arguments aside, I believe that she or some woman in
her position could have won the grudging respect of a significant number of the other cadets, won over some, made allies,
and gotten through the academy—but, incredibly, with two
years to prepare, knowing that such a military academy features
tough physical as well as mental activity, knowing she would be
put upon—she showed up more than 20 pounds overweight and

clearly in no condition to withstand the rigors of the physical
training. On the first 100-degree day, Faulkner wound up in the
clinic with heat stroke. To be fair, four male cadets went with her.
But many more didn't. And she couldn't afford to. If she had possessed the self-discipline to thoroughly prepare for what was
obviously going to be a physical and emotional ordeal, she could
have earned the respect of enough people there to, first, survive;
second, gradually thrive; and overall, succeed. But in America
these days, people don't think they should have to earn anything
anymore. They feel entitled.

Take a look at how little self-discipline most people have. The
thousands of business owners I work with tell me more than half
their rank-and-file workers frequently show up late for work. Ask
any employer of size and you'll hear how big the problems of tardiness and absenteeism are. People do not even have enough selfdiscipline to get up in the morning! It seems that the majority of
today's work force cannot cannot be depended on to read, write,
count, or to do anything on their own to improve their skills.
(Which is why they are replaced by automation, relocation of jobs
to foreign lands, and through every other means possible.)

In my business dealings, I find more than half the people cannot seem to get to appointments and meetings on time or keep
preset telephone appointments. Clients miss pre-scheduled
coaching appointments. Vendors miss deadlines as often as they
make them.

Woody Allen once observed half of success seems to be
showing up. Ed Foreman, a popular motivational speaker, very
successful businessman, and, I think, the only man to be elected
to Congress representing two different states at two different
times, says you can be certain of rapid advancement in most
business organizations if you'll just do three things:

CHAPTER 5 / THE MAGIC POWER THAT MAKES YOU UNSTOPPABLE

pre-scheduled

-----

**NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs 0** **si**

1. Show up.
2. Show up on time.
3. Show up on time, ready to work. So few do.
Lafitt Pincay, Jr., never failed to show up, show up on time, 110%

ready to give each ride his very best effort.
In the entrepreneurial environment, it is much the same.
There's a lot to be said just for showing up on time, ready to
work. (Not hung over. Not exhausted. Not distracted.) The
meeting of deadlines and commitments alone causes a person
to stand out from the crowd like an alien space ship parked in
an Iowa cornfield. The ability to get things done and done right
the first time will magnetically attract incredible contacts,
opportunities, and resources to you. All of this is a matter of
self-discipline.

###### Kennedy's #6JTo
 B.S. Time Truth

Self-discipline is MAGNETIC.

And self-discipline aimed and applied at a particular thing,
as I do to writing, as Pincay does to fitness, is quite literally a
magic power. When you focus your self-discipline on a single
purpose, like sunlight through a magnifying glass on a single
object, look out! The whole world will scramble to get out of your
way, hold the doors open for you, and salute as you walk by. E>an

###### The Inextricable Link between Time Management and Self-Discipline

It takes tremendous self-discipline to productively allocate and
invest time and to stick to your intentions. It's said that "the road
to hell is paved with good intentions," and I believe it. Although
some people find it hard to believe, I'm one of the laziest guys on
the planet. There's no internal force that drives me to work.
Every morning, I have a little fight with myself, and I have to
force myself to haul it out of bed and into the office. On the road,
I may sit on the edge of the bed and glare at my laptop and battle with my lazy self to do what I need to do. And I could quite
happily forget it all, go find a hammock on the beach, and sleep
all day long.

I think this is a secret true of a lot of very successful people.
I think they are secretly lazy and become exceptionally selfdisciplined out of necessity.

Because the entrepreneur is his own boss and can do as he
pleases with his time, it is very important to be self-disciplined.
The entrepreneur with a loose, buddy-buddy, easily forgiving
boss will never accomplish much. It is the entrepreneur with the
tough taskmaster as a boss who excels.

###### "Success Leaves Clues"
Tony Robbins says, "Success leaves clues." It seems that the
Creator thought it a good idea to leave clues to success all over
the place, so that—if you have your eyes open—you can't stand
in any one place, turn all the way around, and not find one. You
can go to the racetrack, of all places, and find clues. You can
watch sports on TV and find clues. You can pick up a magazine

find clues. You can drive down a street and look at the busi-nesses

and see clues.
The one thing that seems universal is that self-discipline is I
_\ ulent_ in every winner. The
great success educator Earl Nightingale once said that if

what everybody else is doing and don't do that. Look at how I
