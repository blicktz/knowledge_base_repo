# Case History: How Using Artificial Intelligence to Create a
 Black Friday Challenge Funnel
 Hit a Sales Home Run

 (Selling: How to Use AI to Do a
 Challenge Campaign)

##### from Jeff Hunter and Samuel Young

###### AI expert and entrepreneur Jeff J. Hunter had his reservations about doing a Black Friday promotion. Between running his AI training business and managing high-ticket consulting contracts already generating over $300K annually, he felt too busy to orchestrate a sales campaign himself. But then fellow marketing expert Samuel Young, one of Jeff’s past students, reached out with a bold idea. He asked Jeff, “Got any plans for Black Friday?” Jeff said no, and Samuel saw an opportunity. He told Jeff, “I have a plan for

-----

###### how we can use AI to fully automate and optimize an entire Black Friday promo focused on your AI program. And I think if we work fast, we can hit $50K in sales. In one day.”
 Intrigued, Jeff agreed to move forward and brought Samuel onto the project on November 4. They had less than a month before Black Friday. Together, Jeff and Samuel combined their expertise across marketing, technology, and AI to execute a cutting-edge campaign. While ambitious in its scope and timeline, they knew leveraging AI to handle time-intensive processes like copywriting, design, and video production could enable their speed and efficiency.
 Incredibly, just 25 days later, Samuel’s plan worked better than envisioned. Through relentless AI automation to create assets and drive exposure combined with carefully crafted scarcity and urgency elements, they generated over $50K in sales before Black Friday even arrived. This chapter will document Jeff and Samuel’s approach so others can adapt these

###### techniques of rapid AI automation, growth hacking, and converged media to drive similar innovations and results.

#### It Began with Lead Generation

###### Jeff and Samuel knew generating high-quality leads would be key for their promotion’s success. To kick things off, they decided to leverage AI to create a Lead Magnet that would provide immense value to their target audience of marketers.
 They used Claude AI to generate the concept based on this prompt: “Provide me with 5 Lead Magnet Ideas for the AI Persona Method.” Claude suggested several options, with the one that resonated being “100 AI-Powered Marketing Prompts,” which aligned perfectly with their

-----

###### promotion’s focus. However, rather than just running with Claude’s initial phrasing for the prompts, Jeff and Samuel refined them extensively by hand to ensure maximum quality. This hybrid approach enabled them to tap into AI for ideation while still delivering a polished, human-crafted marketing asset. Once finalized, the prompts were placed behind an opt-in form as a free downloadable resource.
 To drive traffic to this lead capture landing page, Claude AI was once again leveraged: “Create an opt-in page for my Lead Magnet below. Lead Magnet: ‘100 Marketing Prompts.’ Do not use the word ‘Lead Magnet’ in the copy; it should be referred to as prompts. Follow the StoryBrand Framework to create the copy.”
 Next, Jeff and Samuel focused on further building out their list by enticing contacts to join a waiting list for their upcoming promotion. ChatGPT was used to generate email copy and social posts for this list- building outreach effort.
 Within days, hundreds subscribed to their waiting list, clearly signaling high anticipation for their AI-powered Black Friday launch.

#### Using Savvy Market Research

###### Rather than just guessing what their audience might want from a Black Friday deal, Jeff and Samuel decided to go directly to the source and survey customers to determine their needs.
 They used ChatGPT to generate a market research survey. Here are the survey questions:

1. _What are your top 3 most time-consuming tasks in your business?_
2. _What are your top 3 biggest expenses in your business?_
3. _What are 1–3 things that would help you grow your business that you do NOT have time for_

_right now?_
4. _What are your top 3 questions about AI?_
5. _What are the top 3 things you want to learn about AI?_
6. _What challenges have you had with AI in the past, if any?_
7. _What is your total budget for the next 12 months for AI training if it helped you save a lot of_

_time and money?_

-----

###### The survey took an open-ended format, allowing respondents to explain in detail their own contexts and interests. Over 140 customers completed the survey, drawn in by the Lead Magnet incentive. While open-ended questions provided richness, analyzing all that qualitative data would be time-consuming for a human. Instead, Jeff and Samuel had ChatGPT take on the job by creating a dedicated data analysis persona.
 “Analyze this research survey with data from my audience. Summarize the data and create a list of the top 3 most common answers in each category.”
 ChatGPT’s persona reviewed all survey responses and quantified key patterns that emerged, capturing metrics like:

The most frequently cited time-consuming tasks
Top business expenses
Budget ranges and willingness-to-pay levels

###### Typically, Jeff sold his training for around $29—$297 in special promotions—but Samuel felt the data told a different story this time. Customers longed for more robust, higher-priced solutions aligned to real pain points versus shallow discounts.
 Convinced by the data, Samuel proposed disregarding conventional wisdom and instead creating a premium, AI-powered bundle packed with value and bonuses that could command top dollar. Seeing the figures himself, Jeff agreed to bet against his Black Friday pricing assumptions and aim higher, designing an irresistible high-end offer anchored at $997.
 (How much money do you leave on the table by your own pricing assumptions, unverified by surveys, testing, or other research? Great reading on the entire subject of pricing is the book NO B.S. PRICE STRATEGY.)

##### The Birth of a “Best” Offer

###### Armed with quantitative data on their audience’s needs and constraints, Jeff and Samuel were ready to formulate an irresistible offer. But rather than just relying on their own opinions, they wanted to tap into time-tested direct response principles. They decided to take the unconventional approach of

-----

###### actually training ChatGPT itself on the fundamentals of high-converting offers. Specifically, they used Alex Hormozi’s acclaimed “$100M Offers” training, uploading transcripts covering multiple hours of video content from his course. This enabled ChatGPT to internalize Hormozi’s proven frameworks on risk reversals, fast action bonuses, stacking value, and more. With ChatGPT now trained on structuring offers, Jeff and Samuel could leverage this training while incorporating their survey data and intended core program to script the perfect promotion.
 But before finalizing, they also ran their draft offer through one more AI-based analysis. They uploaded lead offers from their competitors into ChatGPT and had it compare those to their proposed deal. ChatGPT provided additional suggestions for improvement opportunities, which they used to further refine specifics around deliverables and bonuses included.
 Ultimately they settled on bundling Jeff’s foundational AI Persona Method training with over a dozen hours of supplementary trainings focused on application in marketing, copywriting, social media growth, and lead conversion. These modules directly addressed the time-intensive activities and expensive optimizations their survey data indicated customers needed most help with. With the core offer in place, Jeff and Samuel added limited-time “fast action” bonuses that featured extra incentives for being first-in live 1-on-1 strategy consultations with an AI Consultant, and a bonus live lead generation workshop. They capped these to only the first 10 and 25 customers to further increase excitement and evoke FOMO with those still on the fence. This strategy played a key role in accelerating sales velocity out the gate.
 The final step was to construct two upsells to increase the average cart value. Jeff and Samuel decided to add Jeff’s AI Consulting Program for $1,497, and Jeff’s high-ticket consulting for $9,000. The two upsells would dramatically increase profits during the sale.

##### Creating the Video Sales Letter (VSL)

###### Jeff and Samuel knew that having an exceptionally compelling video sales letter (VSL) would be critical for converting visitors into buyers. But

-----

###### writing an effective 10-minute script and filming high-quality footage would normally demand extensive effort.
 Luckily, AI could automate the heavy lifting as long as they provided enough relevant training data. They leveraged ChatGPT by constructing a dedicated VSL creator persona by training it on VSL Expert Kevin Anson’s proven framework. They also uploaded Jeff’s own materials to help ChatGPT capture his distinct personality, voice, and positioning. After sufficient priming, ChatGPT was ready to script an initial VSL outline. Jeff and Samuel reviewed it, had a few rounds of revisions, and arrived at the final story arc they felt flowed logically while embedding core offer details. With script locked in, recording, at first, followed an unorthodox approach. Rather than memorize lines or use cue cards, Jeff simply read off his computer screen so he could get the VSL recorded before the end of the day. The only catch? This meant that he was staring at the computer screen, and not directly into the camera lens while reading, but Descript and Captions AI tools offered easy fixes. Using footage of Jeff looking directly at the camera for a few seconds, these apps realistically overlaid his glance into the clips to have it appear his gaze held viewers’ focus. Some simple lighting adjustments ensured an even blending for minimal uncanny valley effect.

###### Samuel also used Descript to effortlessly insert pickups, overdub lines, and tweak verbiage after the fact instead of refilming specific parts of the video.
 Expert VSL video editor Spence Thompsett used Envato video elements to spice things up with slick graphics and editing effects in between cuts of Jeff speaking. By blending AI and human creativity into an impactful final cut, the 10-minute VSL went live just days before the Black Friday launch. Using AI tools to write the script and help with editing made creating an amazing VSL in a limited amount of time possible.

#### Generating Traffic

###### With their VSL and Sales Page complete, Jeff and Samuel focused next on driving traffic across media assets powered by AI. They repurposed sections of their VSL transcript into email sequences and social media content. However, rather than just reusing content as-is, they wanted AI to repurpose the content to be formatted for each marketing channel. By supplying

-----

###### ChatGPT with training data on proven copywriting approaches and summarizing key patterns from their market research, the AI could specially tailor emails. This allowed them to communicate their offer’s applicability toward resolving recipients’ precise pain points and challenges for further personalization. These emails Were aimed at progressively warming up the audience, showcasing solutions to pain points, highlighting benefits, and finally driving visitors to the sales page once live. Meanwhile Facebook and Instagram retargeting ads provided supplementary exposure. This crosschannel effort enabled reaching their audience at multiple touch points when visibility and conversion inclination were highest.
 Here is an example of one of the emails we wrote with AI:

 Hey [FIRSTNAME],

 I know what you’re thinking…

 “AI sounds complicated.” “I don’t have time to learn it.” “It doesn’t work for my business.” “AI-generated content sucks and makes me sound like the Terminator.”

 Believe me, I’ve heard all the objections before. But here’s the truth: My method makes AI simple and practical for any business. As a business owner myself, I know you don’t have time for overly complex technology. My method breaks AI down into easy-to- implement steps tailored specifically to your business needs.

 It’s been tested now by a couple hundred business owners. You’ll be able to start small by automating repetitive tasks like content creation. Then build up your AI capabilities as you become more confident.

#### Optimization & Results

###### As new customers purchased the product, Jeff and Samuel kept fine-tuning aspects of the funnel itself, as well as audience targeting across media channels for maximum response.
 For instance, they expanded their retargeting beyond just past site visitors to incorporate look-alike audiences that mirrored their existing customer profile. New visitors from these expanded pools proved highly qualified.
 Just 25 days after originally conceiving this ambitious promotion, Jeff and Samuel leveraged the tireless productivity of AI to achieve their $50K launch goal before Black Friday even commenced. By the time the sale ended, over 50 additional customers were acquired through an AI-powered marketing process generating over $70K in total sales (this includes frontend and back-end sales). This case study clearly validates the power of an AI workforce in building a hyper-efficient marketing machine.

#### AI Tools Used in the Campaign

###### Jeff and Samuel assembled an ensemble of AI tools to streamline their marketing efforts. Here is a brief overview.

-----

###### Claude AI: An advanced natural language model capable of generating long-form, humanlike content with minimal editing needed from raw outlines. Claude is better than ChatGPT for training on large data sets and copywriting.

 ChatGPT: A popular conversational AI that can dynamically understand and respond to multifaceted prompts. Leveraged for ideation and creation across assets and analyses, ChatGPT is great for a fast workflow and handling multiple tasks.

 Descript: An audio/video editing application with integrated AI speech to text allowing seamless voice overdubbing and manipulations to footage by editing the transcript.

 Captions: A cost-effective video service that uses AI to autogenerate text captions and enables footage augmentation like eye/head movements.

 Envato Elements: A stock media marketplace providing readymade digital assets to incorporate in video and other projects. You can use the AI search tool to find exactly what you need for your video project.

 DALL-E: A leading AI image generator that creates original icons, illustrations, and artworks based on text prompts invoking a desired style.

 Facebook Ads Manager: Facebook’s advertising platform features advanced targeting capabilities powered partly by AI, enabling fine-tuned and optimized ad delivery.

#### The Secret Weapon: AI Personas

###### While leveraging an ensemble of AI tools was essential to executing this ambitious campaign vision, none of it would have been possible without one secret weapon—AI Personas. An AI Persona is effectively a simulated “virtual employee” with specialized skills. Just as you would train a new human team member, by supplying AI assistants with customized

-----

###### contextual and experiential information you enable vastly superior performance on tasks aligned to that training.
 Rather than taking a blank-slate generic AI approach, Jeff and Samuel crafted tailored AI Personas for the required workflow needs.

 Copywriting Persona: Fed proven copywriting frameworks, audience data, promotions details, etc. to create marketing emails, social media posts, and funnel copy.

 VSL Persona: Uploaded frameworks from proven industry sources to internalize high-level sales psychology and storytelling frameworks in order to create the script for the Video Sales Letter in record time.

 Data Analyst Persona: Shared survey data so it could quickly analyze and recognize customer patterns and extract insights.

 These specialized AI team members knew exactly how to get the desired output because of the frameworks and data sets they were trained on. These results would have never been possible without properly training the AI. So for anyone looking to maximize productivity via automation, the lesson is clear—invest time up front developing customized AI Personas to match project needs through deliberate training. By creating this capable digital workforce, Jeff and Samuel tapped into the true power of AI.

###### In The Phenomenon[®]—my system for accomplishing more in 10 months than in your previous 10 years—I talk about the SPEED- TO-MARKET FACTOR and the SPRINT FACTOR. Many, maybe most promising business ideas die s-l-o-w deaths. Purpose + Pressure = Productivity & High Performance. This explains how often an NFL team struggling to slowly move the ball suddenly looks like a different, far more potent team in their “2-Minute Drill.” When you use a Sprint, like Jeff and Samuel did, you get that dynamic effect. Then, with Speed to Market, you create far greater interest in a marketplace. The Impending Event is far more exciting than something just happening over a long period of time or in the distant future. Putting these two Phenomenon® Triggers to work for yourself, in your business, is not easy, but it is easier now than just a handful of years ago, in part thanks to the technology discussed in this chapter.
