##### Surveys from the financial services industry from the 1970s, for example, showed that the married women in more than 80% of affluent households had nominal or no involvement in the investment decisions. Fast forward to 2017, and more than 80% of married affluent women make financial decisions jointly. Of those with one making financial decisions, it’s now split almost evenly: 7.9% of these households have the man in charge of the money and 8.3% have the woman in charge. These facts must be heard by marketers to the affluent. Buying decisions once thought of as gender specific no longer are. The interest in one thing or another may be held only or principally by either the husband or the wife, but the decision releasing the money for the purchase won’t be in 80% of the households.* Make a BIG note.
 In the TV show Mad Men, about the advertising world in the 1950s, we see young women going to work for the express purpose of finding a man and getting married—they the unlucky ones who weren’t able to go directly to marriage without a tour around the game board. That was then. This is now. The institution of marriage itself has fallen on hard times and disrepute. As a career goal, out the window. The year 2007 marked the first time there were as many single women as married women in the United States, with no sign of that trend reversing.
 Beginning in 2005, single women became the second-largest group of home buyers, right behind married couples. They do not stay in apartments until they find husbands and get married. Single women buy nearly twice as many homes as single men. Yet when have you seen any real estate advertising specifically aimed at single women? Comparable examples can be found in numerous other product and service categories, where marketers and marketing have not caught up with and are ignoring opportunities in current reality.
 Some single women are single for the traditional reason—not yet (or ever) finding the right man. But there is a growing population of what demographic analysts call the “willfully unmarried,” who consciously and deliberately choose to stay single. Among the willfully unmarried women are two groups of special interest to us: the particularly affluent single women and the affluent boomer single women. In these two groups, and particularly in a group composed of overlap from the two, we find untold spending power, controlled by women who are buying their own homes,

##### doing their own investing, planning and funding their own retirements, planning their own vacations, and so on—for life. These women are permanent heads of households, and can and should be marketed to as such, and hardly anybody is. In fact, my files are lacking any good examples of advertising or marketing specific to this to show you!

 Late-in-Life Divorce as a Spending Event Among U.S. adults aged 50 and older, the divorce rate has doubled since the 1990s. The majority of the divorces that occur after 20 to 25 years of marriage are instigated by the wives, not the husbands. Far from grieving quietly, many of these women quickly re-enter the dating and next-husband- hunting game, find it highly competitive, populated by an insufficient quantity of men, and full of older men seeking younger women. Consequently, a number of self-improvement investments occur within 6 to 12 months of divorce: cosmetic surgery, cosmetic dentistry, weight loss products, new and younger-looking wardrobe, new and younger-looking car. I have several clients who deliberately market to this timing sweet spot, using information compiled from public records combined with other, commercially available, rented mailing lists (see Chapter 23). In short, affluent women age 45 through 60, divorcing after long marriages, tend to go on personal spending binges and be exceptionally susceptible to certain kinds of product and service offers about four to six months post-divorce. Those identified as affluent or, in a way, newly affluent based on their own income no longer shared, alimony, or having secured the principal residence in the divorce, are the biggest spenders.

 Stigmas Gone Cosmetic surgery—derogatively called plastic surgery for years—was once almost exclusively for affluent women, or actresses and models. And it was not openly discussed. Today, its popularity spans age ranges from shockingly young to surprisingly old, from mass-affluent to ultra-affluent. And not only is it openly discussed, but it is something of a status symbol. And discussed in ways that might make many people blush. For example, according to a study published in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal, 81% of breast surgery patients and 68% of other body surgery patients reported

##### improvements in sexual satisfaction. More than 50% of these patients said they were able to achieve orgasm more easily following their surgery. And 56% also noted increases in their partners’ sexual interest and satisfaction following the surgery. You may rest assured that the profession is using this information in its marketing.
 This change in attitudes toward cosmetic surgery is representative of comparable changes in attitudes about just about everything, including but not limited to sexuality. Men, take a stroll through the Self-Help, Psychology, Health, and Relationship aisles at your nearest major bookstore (where most men never tread) or pick up and read copies of Cosmopolitan as well as the historically more staid Redbook. You’ll probably be very surprised to discover the discussions going on.
 What’s most important about all this, from a marketing standpoint, is the willingness of women to confront every imaginable health, beauty, aging, and lifestyle issue head-on, and the willingness of affluent women to spend almost without limitation on themselves, their physical and emotional well-being. Marti Barletta, billing herself “the world’s foremost expert on today’s mightiest market: women,” refers to women age 50 to 70 as “prime time women,” in the prime time of spending. A quick list from her research appears at the end of this chapter. Her book, Marketing to Prime Time Women: Convert and Keep Boomer Big Spenders, provides considerably more depth, and you can also access her information at www.MartiBarletta.com.

 It Isn’t Simple As an example of the complexity required for success in marketing to affluent women, consider the financial services field.
 In their book Marketing to the Mindset of Boomers and Their Elders, Carol Morgan and Doran Levy accuse financial services and investment firms of “conjuring up differences where none exist” in advertising, marketing, and selling to affluent women (investable assets, $500,000.00+) and mass-affluent women (investable assets, $100,000.00+) making their own investment decisions. Assumptions are made by many investment marketers that echo one enunciated by the head of a Charles Schwab initiative aimed at women that “women feel differently and learn differently

##### about investing” so there’s a need to “speak to women in terms relevant to their lives and in language that’s appealing to them.” But in one of her columns, the popular financial writer Jane Bryant Quinn expressed her distaste for financial advertising treating women as “a breed apart.” Quinn describes this advertising as “condescending”—“Who,” she asks, “besides women are told thy need help because they are emotionally impaired?” Quinn cites market research studies confirming that there is no difference in investment patterns by gender.
 So who’s right? I would suggest they are both right and wrong. First of all, lumping the mass-affluent and affluent women together is a serious mistake. Women with $500,000.00 and up to invest have, for the most part, been more involved with their wealth for a longer period of time. They also have, as a practical matter, access to a different level of financial advisor and choices of investment-related services. They are less likely to be paying attention to Suze Orman and Money magazine and more likely to be reading The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and Worth than their mass- affluent counterparts. In fact, the affluent women should be separated into experience categories, such as Savvy Investors vs. Financial Uninvolveds, and then talked to quite differently. This is a distinct difference of greater significance than the affluent vs. mass-affluent tag.
 Some years back, I did some marketing consulting work for the late Joan Rivers, the sharp-tongued comedienne turned super-successful jewelry, cosmetics, and fashion entrepreneur and on-air pitchperson at QVC. When Joan’s husband, Edgar, died, she had the shocking experience many Financial Uninvolved women have: confronting money management for the first time, under duress. She had left it all in his hands and wasn’t even sure how to balance a checkbook. Financially Uninvolveds who, for one reason or another—often the death or incapacity of their spouse—have significant investable assets to manage lack background knowledge and experience and therefore lack confidence. They are most likely to look for a single source of advice and assistance, be far more interested in safety and security than gain or yield, and be most motivated by trust. They will seek someone they can have confidence in, rather than work to have more confidence in their own judgment in these matters. Savvy Investor Women are more likely to collect and consider information from multiple sources,


-----

##### make at least some investment decisions independently, and have direct relationships with multiple vendors such as an online brokerage account, a stock broker, a financial planner, and one or more banks.
 This means: Savvy Investor Women will respond to information. Financially Uninvolved Women will respond to trust.
 This group is best segmented into four quadrants:

 1. Financially Uninvolved, Mass-Affluent 2. Financially Uninvolved, Affluent 3. Savvy Investor, Mass-Affluent 4. Savvy Investor, Affluent

 Second, Quinn is off-base in denying that gender differences affect perception of and responsiveness to advertising and overt marketing. I’m afraid she’s projecting her own attitudes onto all women. Georgette Geller- Petro, an executive with the financial services giant AXA Financial®, states, “Through feedback from our advisors who work with women, we have found that women’s financial goals, as well as how they articulate them, are different than those of men.”
 Gender difference matters. There are words and phrases—like one I use: women with balls—that instantly set many women’s teeth on edge and make them deaf to everything else said or written. I do a lot of advertising copywriting in weight loss, alternative health, and beauty categories, and I have to exercise extreme caution about “sounding male” or using instant- turn-off language. However, Quinn is right when she recoils at ad approaches or language that feels “condescending” to her. Women, especially career women, are hypersensitive to being talked down to, to not being given credit for their intelligence, knowledge, and experience. While the staunch feminist of the ’60s and ’70s seems to be a marginalized minority, there is still a profound difference in the way women respond to language, and the way different women respond to the same language.


### About Prime Time Women


-----

##### • Women in their 50s and 60s report these two decades are the
 happiest in their lives. “Prime Time” is as much a state of mind as a chronological age.

 • In peak years of household income, wealth and spending, they are
 more involved with or in charge of all spending than in earlier years.

 • They are not retiring young as a rule, and many continuing to work
 or returning to work have greater discretionary spending ability than at younger ages.

 • They add to their net worth substantially by inheritance—from
 parents and from husbands, as women tend to outlive men by 15 to 18 years. Relationships established with them as customers, clients, or patients can yield from their “surge spending” after such windfalls.

 • At 50 to 64, they are out-spending those 25-34:

 – 20% more on new cars

 – 30% more on dining out

 – 38% more on travel

 – 113% more on wine consumed at home

 – 250% more on housekeeping and yard services

 • They are a prime source of money for grandkids’ summer camp,
 activities, travel, college, first-time home buying (and need communicated with about such purchases).

 • They are the most generous group supporting charities.

 • 1 out of 5 adults in the U.S. is a woman over 50. (Census Bureau)

#### CHAPTER 5

### Boys Will Be Boys, No Matter Their Age

##### “Man will do many things to get himself loved. He will do all things
 to get himself envied.”

—MARK TWAIN

# No man buys a Lamborghini to get to work.

##### There are Lamborghini automobiles priced from $250,000.00 to $5 million. Significantly, it is the “one off” cars like the Centenario, with a limited production of just 40 and a $2 million price tag, that sell out fastest and for which there is the longest waiting list. But the very fact that such a thing as a Lamborghini exists reveals something very, very important about men and selling to them, which is completely contrary to myth.


-----

##### Myth is that women are emotional, men are practical. Women buy with their hearts, men buy with their heads, with intellect and logic.
 The Lamborghini is designed and built to travel at speeds illegal on every road in the United States. How practical is that?
 Truth is, while women mature, men just get older. Arrested development.
 Another myth is that men are confident. It is my experience, from selling to, dealing with, and associating with hundreds and hundreds of millionaires, that successful men are anything but self-secure. Actually, they live with an underlying anxiety that no amount of wealth relieves. As a result, they spend a lot of money on symbolic validation of their success, status, and prosperity. For example, most men aren’t really clotheshorses. Symbolism aside, most I know could care less about Brooks Brothers® vs. Walmart® as the source of their khakis, sweaters, or socks. But affluent men actually train themselves to appreciate fashion quality and design distinctions, and choose certain purveyors, as a means of self-validation as well as a concern about judgments others will make about them based on their apparel.
 It doesn’t begin or end with clothes. This same buying for validation— buying what they are supposed to buy from vendors they are supposed to patronize—extends to almost every product and service category.

 Status
 While status is not male vs. female, men do seek and get it differently than women. For women, status is often a matter of association. For men, it is more a matter of competition and comparison.
 In an article in Psychology Today, Gregory Jantz, Ph.D., stated the obvious: “Most men are competitive.” He went on to observe that since the battlefield is not available to most, metaphorical battlefields are used to exert competitiveness: sports, betting on sports, marrying well, business and career, and purchased things—who has the hottest car, biggest boat, best located house, most interesting investments. He states that men have a “need for dominance” that underlies much or most of their consumer behavior. This means that a toaster is never just a toaster. Any purchase can and most purchases do relate to filling the need for dominance. The more

##### affluence, the more ability there is to make buying choices driven by this, so the more important it is to advertise, market, and sell into it.
 This means the guy buying the 60-foot yacht may be doing so only because the others at his marina have 48-foot yachts. And, as a matter of fact, many yacht buyers freely admit their size choice was based on the sizes of their peers’ or marina neighbors’ yachts. A very expensive My ____________ is bigger than your __________. From the locker room to the boardroom.
 My highest-level Titanium Business Mastermind Group and my Private Client Group have no members earning less than $1 million a year. Most are in the $4 to $10 million neighborhood, and they are all in the same types of businesses. We have other mixed-breed coaching groups at No B.S. Inner Circle, such as the Peak Performers/Implementation Group led by Lee Milteer and Adam Witty (www.NoBSInnerCircle.com). In my groups, every year almost all are men, not by my design. None of these members have anything to prove, nor do they have an economic need for more money. Many find it difficult to motivate themselves. But they all compete fiercely within this group environment. They compete to bring the best business breakthrough or success report to each meeting. They compete to have the highest-grossing seminar or highest-grossing new product launch. They compete based on who has bought the best new toy, who took the best vacation. They compete against each other for status within the group.
 If you can create such an environment, a world unto itself, in which your customers or clients know and see and interact with each other, competition within that group will drive retention, price or fee elasticity, and purchasing, by the men.
 Competition for status is nothing new. But the plethora of choices has created more competition than ever before, as affluent people find themselves in more environments. If they own two homes, they are living— and competing for status—in two communities rather than just one, and status is won at the country club community in North Carolina through different choices from the high-rise condominium community in Boston. If they are in diversified businesses instead of single, narrowly defined businesses, they compete for status in a number of different business and professional associations, professional groups, and industries.
