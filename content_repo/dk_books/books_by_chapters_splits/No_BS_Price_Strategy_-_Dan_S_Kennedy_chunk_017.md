The Republic of Tea is a storytelling company. Their marketing is both educational and fanciful.
Like Disney, everyone has a clever name. Customers are “Citizens” and the people in the company
are “Ministers” and “Ambassadors.” They have the Minister of Leaves, The Prime Minister, and
The Minister of Distribution to name a few. The Republic of Tea is selling a concept—not a
commodity. They have moved far beyond tea to selling a lifestyle. They make drinking tea a fun and
engaging experience even though you are drinking it in your own home and not in their shop. To
sell at four times the price of their commoditized competition they had better do something special,
and they do. So, the price of tea bags or bottled tea at Walmart is of no significance to them.

## The Dynamic Power of Radical Individualism

I have not personally set foot in a Walmart in years. Dan Kennedy says I should, from time to time,
to keep tabs on what they’re up to, and he’s right, so should you. But I can’t bring myself to buy
anything there. I hate the lines. I hate the ambiance. It is a painful experience to me. In fact the last
time I went there I actually split my head open. I stepped around a corner into a metal post that was
sticking out. It cut a “V” into the middle of my forehead. Maybe unfairly, the impression left in my
mind after the cut and bruise healed is that providing dirt-cheap prices is more important to them
than even their customers’ safety. It may have low prices, but it is just not my kind of place.

I’m not alone in that sentiment. Some people just don’t like the store. Sometimes it is for reasons
like mine. For others, it’s a moral issue. They don’t like what it stands for. This sentiment is not
unique to Walmart. It is growing for all of the big mass merchandise companies. Many people are
looking beyond the low sticker prices and seeing the other costs, economic and societal. Another
factor is what a March 2010 Ogilvy and Mather survey called the “emergence of radical
individualism.” More and more consumers, 73% according to their study, would rather have fewer,
high-quality things, than buy the most bulk they can for each buck. Better a home very nicely
appointed than filled with as much stuff as can be bought at lowest prices and piled high in every
room. This is part of a movement towards more sustainable living, whether it is environmental or
financial. I believe it a hallmark of what Dan Kennedy speaks of as the emerging New Economy.
People are getting weary of being throw-away consumers. Some are influenced in this by the green
movement and concern for the environment. For more, the economic chaos and trauma we’ve
encountered in recent years is fueling this sentiment. The desire to at least feel more financially
responsible and prudent is with many almost to the extent it existed post-Depression, and, rather
than encouraging buying cheap goods at cheapest prices, it is instead inspiring seeking better
products. Many local communities are also re-embracing Main Street merchants and locally-based
companies.

All this plays to the power of radical individualism. It’s the newest consumer revolution.
Rejection of mass merchandise and mass merchandisers, desire for something more special if not
unique, personal, is what really matters. This gives you, the marketer, the perfect opportunity to step
forward and stand out, and call out to these revolutionist customers.

## When Higher Prices Sell More

 Dan Kennedy

**There is an ad in my archives, in which this tag-line appears:**

**REASSURINGLY EXPENSIVE.**

It doesn’t matter what product was advertised this way—wine, snow tires, my
professional services. Any number of things could be advertised this way, and many
should, because there are many cases of more volume of sales achieved by raising prices.

In a price test of $97.00 versus $127.00 per year for a B2B newsletter, conventional
wisdom says crossing the hundred dollar line should suppress response. But, in this actual
case, the $127.00 price pulled 11% higher response.[*] Did the higher price cause prospects
to think the newsletter much more valuable? The higher response combined with the 31%
higher price produces 45% more revenue, a major victory. Another case: a book originally
priced at $24.95 sold just as well at three payments of $8.99 ($26.95 total, $2.00 more
revenue per sale). Point: higher prices do not necessarily mean poorer response. Point:
you can’t know if you don’t test, and re-test frequently. ([*]Source: article by Mark Everett

**Warning: The tendency in tough times is to cut prices, without any empirical**
**evidence that doing so increases profits, and without carefully calculating impact on**
**net profit. Sacrificing margin for volume, even preservation of volume, can be a**
**losing proposition; a dangerous, slippery slope. A good question posed in Mark’s**
article: do you need to cut prices to win more orders from tight-fisted customers or do you
need to raise prices to keep up with rising costs? The second part of that question begs
consideration of a Truth’s application, in your business; there are certain customers who
will buy certain things regardless of price (or price increase). If you offer such a thing to
such a group of customers, all price-cutting does is trade away margin.

One reason that a higher price may move more goods is that it is perceived as the more
appropriate price by the customers. If you got a direct-mail piece in your mail offering
nearly new, fully reconditioned and warranteed Rolex[®] watches for $49.95, how would
you react? Even if from a local jewelry store of good reputation, you would be very
skeptical. Many would never go into the store, presuming the offer was a scam, to lure
people in for some sort of bait-and-switch. If you did go in, you’d be very wary and
anxious. Obviously, $49.95 is a completely inappropriate price for a Rolex[®], and even I
would be hard—pressed to think of a reasonwhy story that could reassure people that they
really were getting a good Rolex[®] at that price. So, add a zero. $499.50. Now what? Some
people only vaguely familiar with the Rolex[®] brand might be lured. But most would still
be repelled. If price was communicated as “from $1,499.50 to $4,999.50,” many more
might be brought in, bargain-hunting within a realm of prices they viewed as possible,
especially if a good reason why is given in the advertisement. Selling Rolex[®] watches for
$400.00 would be a much more difficult task than selling them for $4,000.00.

**In the back of every intelligent customer’s mind is the oftrepeated warning: if it**
**sounds too good to be true, it is. This can be overridden even with sophisticated buyers**
by a combination of extreme benefit—such as extraordinary investment returns, triggering
greed to trump common sense. Think of the Bernie Madoff story. But, usually, many other
reassurances are also needed, such as, in his case, referrals from trusted friends within the
same circles, his exalted reputation including having served in an advisory capacity with
the New York Stock Exchange, and a complex mythology built and carefully maintained,
including active, visible philanthropy. And you don’t want to run a fraudulent scheme
anyway, do you? Ironically, it can be easier to commit fraud than to persuade people of the
value of the legitimate. Because you are unlikely to offer such extreme benefit and trigger
such powerful emotions, you need to reassure your buyers more thoroughly. Price can be
reassuring or anxiety and skepticism producing.

## CHAPTER 8

 The Power of Preeminence as Price Strategy

 Dr. Barry Lycka

**I imagine every business owner or professional longs for** **_one simple thing_** **they can do to be paid**
**what they are really worth, without haggling, negotiating or endless discounting, and to**
develop a secure business with enough profit to sustain itself. I have done that, under difficult
conditions, but not, I’m afraid, with one simple thing. Unless you’d like to classify “marketplace
dominance” as a simple thing.

I operate an independent cosmetic surgery-medical practice in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, up
against government interference and managed care controls more draconian and overwhelming than
everything doctors in the U.S. may face under Obamacare. Here, fees are strictly regulated for all
services so that every doctor is supposedly on equal footing. It is even illegal to bill for something
outside the controls of this health care system, if there is a procedure intended to address the need
covered by the health care system, regardless of the doctor’s judgments about what may be best for
the patient.

Unlike most doctors who surrender and suffer, in 1991, I decided to opt out of the system entirely,
totally control my own destiny, and build a fee-for-service, cash-only cosmetic practice. This was
something virtually unheard of at the time. I knew I would have to be a dominating presence in my
niche and in my market just to survive. My problem wasn’t just price, as is discussed throughout
this book, but asking patients to pay my prices with their own cash rather than with government
health care or insurance forms and their signatures. I’ll quickly say, if I can achieve this here, in
Canada, it can be done anywhere. Today, I have dozens of U.S. doctors with varied kinds of
practices in my coaching/mastermind groups where, together, we work on independence strategies.
I’m proud to be something of a Moses, leading my people to a better place!

Anyway, back in 1991, I made a strategic and daring decision to navigate regulatory and
consumer resistance, and transition from a traditional dermatology practice to one specializing in
certain types of cosmetic surgery. Over about four years, I experimented with different price
strategies, different promotional approaches, discarding many and keeping and building on a few. In
the process, two different Canadian regulatory agencies attacked, and I battled one to a draw, the
other to a reversal of its rulings in court.

All along, I knew that there were certain patients hidden among the masses, who would actually
prefer the ultimate level of personal attention and care, the most advanced procedures and
technology, and would be more than willing to pay top fees to get it. I think this is an important
foundation for all other ideas in this book; that hidden among the masses, there are customers,
clients, or patients who are a perfect match with whatever the best is, that you can deliver, and who
will be happy to choose you over all other alternatives—including lower-priced ones. I took two
approaches to attracting these kinds of patients for my practice.

-----

## Approach One: The Hawaiian Fisherman’s Method

One year, on vacation in Hawaii, I was relaxing at a beach, watching whales in the distance, when a
fisherman, obviously a local, drove up in his pick-up truck. He got out with a dozen fishing rods.
Not one. A dozen. He baited each hook, cast all the lines into the ocean, and set the rods in the sand.
Intrigued, I wandered over and asked him for an explanation.

“It’s simple,” he said. “I love fish but I hate fishin’. I like eatin’, not catchn’. So I cast out 12
lines. By sunset, some of them will have caught a fish. Never all of ’em. So if I only cast one or two
I might go hungry. But 12 is enough so some always catch. Usually there’s enough for me and
extras to sell to local restaurants. This way, I live the life I want.”

**The simple fellow had unwittingly put his finger on a powerful secret. The flaw in most**
**businesses, that keeps them always in desperate need—which suppresses prices—is: too few**
**lines cast in the ocean. The best way for me to be sure that I always had at least a new patient**
arriving of the right mindset and financial capability to qualify for my practice was to cast a lot of
lines in the ocean everyday. A lot of lines at sunrise, never hungry at sunset.

The results have been superlative. I have developed a practice income of millions of dollars
annually, but that still does not require all of my time, so that I can develop the nonprofit Canadian
Skin Cancer Foundation; develop my online portal, [WellAndWiseOnline.com, a consumer/patient](http://wellandwiseonline.com/)
education site; run my coaching/mastermind groups for physicians; and spend time with my wife of
25 years, four grown children and grandchildren—and take those vacations. At age 56, I could retire
if I wanted to. I make my work life easier every way I can, such as flying to conferences and
speaking engagements by private jet. All this created against stiff headwinds of an autonomyunfriendly regulatory environment and a jaded marketplace unaccustomed to paying top dollar for
any health care.

-----

## Approach Two: The Triangle of Pre-Eminence

Dan Kennedy and another celebrated thought-leader in marketing and business development, his
friend Jay Abraham, both speak of the power of preeminence. Preeminence means “surpassing all
others in a distinguished way.” That was the second thing I set out to do. In attacking this objective,
I developed what I now teach as the Triangle of Preeminence: expertise and excellence in
patient/customer service; extraordinarily effective, high-visibility marketing; and generosity in
community service and involvement. With this Triangle, any professional or business owner can
stand out so dramatically from any crowd, that he will attract patients/clients of the attitude and
philosophy that price is the least of their concerns!

If you were to visit my practice, you would find a state-of-the-art facility, first-class environment,
and personable, caring, well-educated staff. I have been doing my signature procedure—liposuction
—since 1986, and as every new advancement has occurred, I’ve evaluated it, studied it, if
appropriate, taken special training in it, and invested in the finest technology. This has partly
liberated me from getting all my patients locally; in fact, patients come for my “Ultimate
Liposuction” from the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia. In the area of wrinkleerasing treatments, I don’t just inject Botox® like many doctors—I combine a number of anti-aging
and skin treatments into my own proprietary procedure, making price comparison impossible. This
is all part of the first side of the triangle: expertise and excellent service. Another way to say it is
_incomparable expertise and service, deliberately designed and presented so it cannot be compared._

If you were to spend any time in Edmonton, you would encounter my high-profile marketing. I
use television, radio, newspapers, and the internet on an almost daily basis. I also pride myself in
“event marketing.” Several times a year, I create seminars, open-house events, guest-celebrity
events. Each is carefully planned, each is preceded by weeks of multimedia saturation advertising
and publicity, each is attended by hundreds of new patients, and each is usually covered favorably
by the local press. I invest to be sure there is no question who is THE leading authority on and
provider of these procedures in my area. It’s important to recognize that this level of use of media
requires a premium price strategy with sufficient, above-par profit built in.

Finally, as the third leg of the triangle, I often tie my events to local charities and organizations, I
lend other support to local causes, and am visibly developing the Canadian Skin Cancer Foundation
with the ambitious goal of eradicating skin cancer from the planet! I also contribute to the literature
and thought-leadership of my profession, and am the author of the book Shaping a New Image: The
_Practice of Cosmetic Surgery (CJSM Publishing, 2001), a speaker at professional conferences, and_
as already mentioned, a coach and mentor to other doctors. Taking activist and leadership roles in
your community and in your industry or profession is a good opportunity to contribute while also
elevating your status and creating additional reassurance of exceptional expertise for your
patients/customers.

When I talk with the doctors I coach about fees/prices—and you can rest assured, the subject
often comes up!—I tell them that it’s a mistake to take it out of context and think about it in
isolation, as a separate matter. Price is interwoven with many other factors, including The Triangle
and the Hawaiian fisherman’s method discussed here.

## CHAPTER 9

 B2B Price Wars and The Way of the Warriors Who Win

 Dan Kennedy

**Most B2B marketers succumb to the idea of competition-driven pricing. By accepting this as a**
**fact of life, they surrender in advance and preclude other possibilities. Real warriors, of course,**
are disgusted by the idea of surrender, so they gravitate to the other choice: controlling the
competitive environment via superior, category of one positioning, more effective marketing, and
unique value propositions. In short, differentiation. When I explain this and get a stubborn business
owner insisting he is in a commoditized category and has no differentiation to offer, I tell him to slit
his wrists and get it over with. After all, if the brain is already dead, why keep the body alive?
