     How Joe Sugarman Discovered a Powerful
       Secret to Success in Direct Marketing
     You probably know Joe Sugarman as the bearded guy on
    television selling Blu-Blockers sunglasses. But Blu-Blockers,
    built from a simple TV infomercial to a multimillion-dollar-a-
    year business, is only the most recent in a decades-long string
    of Joe’s direct-marketing adventures and successes. In 1971 Joe
   Sugarman was the first person ever to attempt selling the then-
    very-new calculator by mail.
     These days, we can buy an electronic calculator at Walgreens
    or Kmart for a few bucks. But maybe you remember when they
    were introduced, bigger, bulkier, and $200 or more. A product
    no one was sure the public would even buy. After all, did people
    really want portable calculators? Would they schlepp them
    around?
      Joe fell in love with this device and believed he could sell it
   by direct mail. He raised $12,000 from a group of friends, or-
    dered some calculators from the Craig Corporation, rented 5,000
    names on ten different lists, wrote his sales letter, prepared an
   accompanying brochure, and launched his direct-mail enterprise.
   The first $240 order arriving in the mail was an exciting event.
    But the rest of the response was not so exciting. When the dust
    settled, Joe had lost half the capital. But then, getting ready to
    deliver the bad news to his investors, Joe Sugarman did some-
    thing that has since become a cornerstone of his success philos-
    ophy: He insisted on learning something from the apparent
    failure. .
     One of the best benefits of direct-response advertising and
    direct mail is that you gain a considerable amount of information
    every time you advertise or mail. Your marketing is your market
    research and vice versa. It is relatively easy and inexpensive to
    test variables: one headline against another, one price against
    another, one media or list against another, and so on. In this
    business, if you have a little staying power and will listen care-
    fully to your market, it will tell you how to succeed. It can be

 marketing is testing.
   Joe went back and looked at the responses from each separate
 list. He discovered that eight of the ten lists had been horrible
 failures, but that two of the eight had worked well. If he had.
 only used those two lists, instead of losing money, he would
 have made a 100 percent profit. In this case, the unsuccessful
 lists were, to Joe, the most logical, likely winners: engineers and
 accountants. The successful lists were made up of corporate pres-
 idents and high-level executives.
   ‘“*When the list broker urged me to test those lists, I thought
 corporate presidents did not have the time to read long sales
 letters and advertising literature. And that the mail would be
 screened by their secretaries. And that they wouldn’t want a cal-
 culator anyway. Certainly an engineer was a better prospect.
 But,’’ Joe admits, “‘I was wrong.”’
   Joe now ‘‘owned’’ a very valuable ‘‘asset’’: He knew what
 type of people would buy calculators by mail.
  Armed with this discovery, and eager to move quickly before
 calculators became commonplace and cheaper as he believed
 they would, Joe marshaled more capital from his investors and
 a new partner, who owned a mailing service, secured lists of
 only the newly defined ideal prospects, and mailed 400,000
 pieces, risking a staggering $100,000. ‘“There were a few anx-
 ious days, as the response started to trickle in,’’ Joe remembers,
 ‘‘but then it started to gush in. More than we could have imag-
 ined. Our home was no longer our home, it was a factory pro-
 cessing calculator orders. We were selling more calculators every
 day than Sears was nationwide.”’
   Joe subsequently made a specialty out of marketing new and
 unusual electronic gadgets, using direct-mail and copy-intensive
 full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal and the airline maga-
 zines. In his JS&A ads he introduced the first liquid crystal
 digital watch, a pocket-sized CB radio—his biggest success, sell-
 ing 250,000 units at $39.95—and the first mass-marketed, easily
 installed home security system in 1977, and employed the very
 first nationwide toll-free 800 number for placing orders in 1973.

    seeing one or more of the JS&A ads packed with copy.
     Unfortunately, Joe lost his entire business in an expensive,
   much-publicized battle with the Federal Trade Commission. (His
   company failed to ship on a timely basis, thanks to an enormous
   snowstorm that shut down his plant and wiped out his computer
    system.) But, he started over with a new direct-marketing busi-
    ness out of his garage, and began creating winning promotions
    all over again. His fascination with new sunglasses that blocked
    out certain types of ultraviolet rays led to Blu-Blockers, a prod-
    uct that has made Joe a multimillionaire for a second time. Even
    if you wanted to chalk up the JS&A success story to luck, Joe’s
   achievements since then have proved that he employs success
    principles that are timeless and reliable.
     I should add that Joe never finished college, never took a
    course in advertising or creative writing, and, generally speaking,
    had no qualifications for his phenomenal success. This happens
    to be another very appealing aspect of direct marketing: It is an
    industry filled with unqualified successes. You can learn it on
    the run. I never went to college, never took a course in adver-
    tising, and entered the direct marketing field with zero qualifi-
    cations. My client, Greg Renker, now head of a $200 million
    direct-marketing corporation, was doing marketing for a hotel
    and resort, and brought no special qualifications with him to
    direct marketing. Gary Halbert was a door-to-door encyclopedia
    salesman. You can succeed here, too.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #39:
          PROPERLY VALUE INFORMATION,
       ESPECIALLY WHEN GAINED THROUGH FAILURE.
      Failure has a bad rap. While many people are terrorized and
    paralyzed by it, most direct-marketing pros live with it as part
    and parcel of their daily existence; just about everybody in this
    field has more losers than winners to their credit. I can show
    you, for example, eight full-page direct-response ads I developed
    in the course of 1992 and 1993; six are dead-bang, irredeemable

 times out of eight, or nearly 80 percent of the time.
  The winners more than make up for the losers economically,
 but of at least equal importance is that each of the six losers has
 immense value to me. I learned from each one. And the infor-
 mation gained from each failure, more often than not, has value
 to future applications far in excess of its cost. You have to view
 your unsuccessful products, ads, sales letters, and promotions as
 investments, not losses, and then take the time and exert the
 energy to extract useful information, so that you get a good re-
 turn on your investment.
    If Joe Sugarman’s $100,000 Gamble Turns
    Your Stomach Sour, There’s a Less Risky
     Way to Get into Direct Marketing
  When I was working on an infomercial about the direct-
 marketing business, featuring Joe Cossman (see chapter 3), I met
 and interviewed many people who had started different direct-
 marketing businesses and mail-order enterprises, many of them
 novices, like Carol Nieman. Carol secured the mail-order rights
 to a product called ‘‘The Calypso Beverage Holder,’’ made by
 a foreign manufacturer—a little doohickey that sticks to a car’s
 dashboard, has a floating disk inside, and keeps your cup level
 regardless of the bumpiness of the road or the quick turns you
 make while driving. Instead of marketing her product direct to
 consumers at her expense and risk, Carol solicited established
 catalog companies to get them to sell the product for her. She
 succeeded in placing the product in just one catalog, and her
 profits for the first three months exceeded $10,400.
  Carol took no risk, paid for no advertising, didn’t even fill
 orders, but she made $10,000 in the direct-marketing business!
 Her story illustrates one of the most tried-and-true, least risky
 paths to profits in this business: providing a winning product to
 established catalog companies.

    in the United States alone. Over 110 million Americans made a
   purchase by mail or phone from a catalog. There are over 10,000
   companies doing all or some of their marketing by publishing
   and mailing catalogs. That group includes everything from 500
    top, well-known catalogs, such as The Sharper Image, Spiegel,
    Lillian Vernon, Herringtons, and Hammacher Schlemmer, to
   thousands of smaller, specialized catalogs serving niche markets,
    such as Bass Pros Shops catalogs or Smith & Hawken gardening
    products catalogs. There is a catalog for just about every busi-
    ness, hobby, recreational activity, or interest. And the two things
    all these catalog companies have in common could make you
    rich.
      How the Catalog Industry Could Make
          Your Million for You
      First, most catalog companies make the majority of their prof-
    its from repeat sales to a core group of loyal, exceptionally re-
    sponsive customers. This is a very important fact for you to
    understand. It creates the need you can fill that could make you
    rich. ,
     Because of this fact, the second thing every catalog company
    has in common is a need to keep coming up with new, interest-
    ing, and different products to rotate in and out of their catalogs
    to keep their customers interested and buying. That means the
    catalog industry’s doors are wide open to you as long as you
    meet relatively simple criteria. In fact, their buyers are eagerly —
    waiting for you to show up!
     When you place your product with catalog companies, their
    established, successful direct-marketing machine goes to work
    for you: Their smart, experienced advertising people rework your
    sales copy; their photographers and graphic artists work on a
    presentation for your product; their capital advertises ‘your prod-
    uct in tens or hundreds of thousands of catalogs; you get en-

 suppliers are required to put up some money against costs, es-
 pecially if they’re trying out an untested and unproven product.
 But in many cases, the catalog company simply buys products
 from you at a discount, resells them, and bears all the risk and
 expense of doing the selling. That discount will range from 50
 percent to as high as 70 percent. That may sound like a lot until
 you consider that when you market directly to consumers via
 space ads, direct-mail, television, or other means, your costs of
 sale may very well exceed 50 percent and go as high as 70
 percent.
   I have had my books, cassette courses, and other products
 sold for me in a number of top business product catalogs, in-
 cluding Day-Timers, Caddylak Systems, Nightingale-Conant,
 Sybervision, and the Miles Kimball Business Book, as well as
 lesser-known, specialty catalogs, like National Response Cor-
 poration’s Insider Report. Although this has been a very small
 part of my business, I’d guess that, over the years, I’ve sold at
 least $500,000 worth of my products this way, maybe more.
 Many of my clients extract huge incomes from the catalog in-
 dustry’s sale of their products. The Guthy-Renker Corporation,
 for example, had over $5 million worth of its products, like
 PerfectSmile, sold through catalogs last year.
   So, how do you get your products into catalogs? Obviously,
 you need to be the prime source (the manufacturer, publisher, or
 importer) or have exclusive rights and be able to afford the ec-
 onomics of this type of marketing. You also need to do your
 homework and select the most likely catalogs for your particular
 product. Then you need to prepare a convincing presentation:
 sales copy, examples of ads that have worked, proof that the
 product will sell, articles that have appeared about the product,
 and anything else that might help command the attention of a
 catalog buyer. You can approach catalog companies directly, in
 person, by mail, by phone follow-up, and by exhibiting at trade
 shows, or you can use the services of any of a number of man-
 ufacturers’ agents or brokers specializing in representing prod-
 ucts to catalogers.

    through other companies’ credit card statement mailings. There
    are over 60 million credit card holders that can be reached this
    way. Companies that accept this type of advertising include Tex-
    aco, Mobil, and most other oil companies, American Express,
    Diners Club, Discover, most MasterCard and VISA programs,
    and a number of national department and clothing store com-
    panies. Tests are usually done in 50,000 ‘‘chunks.’’ Often, just
    like with catalogs, you can get your product purchased from you
    at wholesale and advertised and resold by this method at no risk
    or cost to you.
      Recently, for example, a StairClimber fitness device has been
    sold with inserts in Marathon Oil credit card statements; Michele
    Easter’s video about saving money on groceries is sold by
    Amoco; how-to-dance videos are sold by Amoco; the Microcrisp
    product seen in TV infomercials is advertised in Montgomery
    Ward statement stuffers; and the ThighMaster has been sold in
    many companies’ statement mailings. The directories and con-
    tacts you need to get your products sold by catalogs, stores, and
    other established distribution channels are listed in chapter 13.
        MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #28: :
        GET OTHERS TO DO YOUR SELLING FOR YOU.
      There’s no law that says you have to risk or invest your own
    money in order to make money. When you own or control a
    promotable product and have publicity for that product, success
    with that product in one medium, and other proof that it is a
    salable product, you have assets just as valuable as money. Oth-
    ers whose main assets are in the distribution category—customer
    databases and relationships, catalogs, and other media—need
    you and your products as much as or more than you need them.

   If You Want to Advertise Your Product Direct
    to the Public, Here’s a Secret That Kills a Lot
        of Novice Direct Marketers
   Take a look at these circulation figures and just imagine what
 could happen if you had a hit with an ad for your product in one
 of these magazines:
    PAOdeTH: MGIUTIEN oo cinco a Rho Cale a 22 million+
   DVR ILOO Tee ae pin a ho Nae ae oy 15 million+
    Better Homes & Gardens............. 8 million+
   PODUIOl SUICNCE Ea Sue Ae es ay 2 million
     . even these specialty magazines:

   MOLOTROMER als EF Mie Re iene 140,000+
     . or how about USA Today?
 nes if just one-tenth of 1 percent of those readers Ongar
 I'll be rich, rich, rich!
   That particular dream has destroyed more fledgling mail-
 order entrepreneurs than I can count in this lifetime. Here’s why:
 How you buy your space and what you pay for your space is at
 least as important as your product, offer, and ad, maybe even
 more important. The dirty little secret here is that the successful,
 repetitive, direct-response advertisers are not paying anywhere
 near list price or retail (‘‘rate card’’) for their advertising space.
 If you do, you'll go broke.
   If you naively call the typical magazine and try to negotiate
 your own advertising placements, you’]] usually, be quoted their
 rate card prices, less discounts ranging from 15 percent for acting
 as your own agency, 2 percent for cash, maybe another 10 per-
 cent if you commit to multiple insertions or a flat ‘‘mail-order

```

```
    But you’re not even close to where you need to be.
      Direct-response advertisers need to get space at 50 percent
    to 70 percent off rate card in order to make money. Many
    publications never make those kind of discounts available
    directly to individual advertisers. Instead, there are quantity
    buyers who negotiate exclusive arrangements with these publica-
    tions, buy all their remnant and standby space and guarantee the
    publication a certain amount of revenue, and, in return, obtain
    discounts as high as 80 percent off rate card. These bulk-
    buying groups are, frankly, the closely guarded secret of direct-
    marketing professionals like myself. We help our clients work
    with these bulk buyers.
     However, you can negotiate your own huge discounts with
    many nonmajor publications, such as trade magazines, special-
    interest magazines, weekly or community newspapers, and as-
    sociation publications. For example, I have one friend (who has
    asked not to be named) with a successful full-page magazine ad
    who targets thirty magazines, sends the ad to all of them along
    with a check for 20 percent of their rate card price for a full
    page, with a letter that basically says:
       Keep this ad and check and if you have unsold space in
       any of your next three issues, run my ad and cash the
       check. If you do not have space available on this basis
       within the next three months or you do not wish to hold
        this ad on a standby basis, please return the uncashed
       check ‘in the enclosed, preaddressed envelope.
      In a typical month he’ll get five or six takers out of the thirty.
    A few more will call him, counteroffer, and negotiate.
      Negotiating media gets easier as you go along, too. If you
    have an ad repeatedly appearing in a magazine, other competitive
    magazines’ representatives or, with small publications, the own-
    ers will seek you out. In such situations, you can often negotiate
    a very good “‘test rate’? on your own. We have magazines, card
    decks, and other media agreeing to test rates 50 percent to 60
