   PACKAGING Certainly for products that must sell off the
   THAT SELLS shelf, packaging is a critical concern. A
              fantastic package that has done its job for
             100 years is the Animal Crackers box: a
              circus train car with cage bars, and the
             cookies shaped like circus animals visible
              inside the cage. For years, Pez candy was
                                 | popular because of the dispenser package.
             Right now, Duracell is heavily promoting
               its package that includes its own battery
              tester.

 TERMINOLOGY ‘“Schweppervescence’’ for Schweppes
            tonic water. To describe the unique mar-
            keting strategies I teach, I coined the term
            ‘*magnetic marketing’’—attracting quali-
             fied prospects or customers rather than pur-
           suing them.
 SYMBOLS Think of some of the most enduring sym-
            bols: the Pillsbury Dough Boy, Betty
            Crocker, Ronald McDonald, the NBC pea-
            cock. In the TV infomercial business, Mike
           Levey brilliantly developed a ‘‘franchise’’
            with his Amazing Discoveries format, used
            for one infomercial after another.
 TECHNOLOGY How can you jazz up your business, ser-
            vice, or product with technology? In one of
          my businesses—the publishing of how-to
           materials—the staple has been audiocas-
             settes plus written manuals, but, increas-
            ingly, software diskettes are being added to
            these products. Entrepreneur magazine, for
           example, now includes a diskette with
          many of its famous business start-up man-
             uals. Restaurants accept take-out orders by
            fax.

   HOW PROVIDING A SERVICE
  CAN MAKE YOU A MILLIONAIRE
     hen most people think of ‘‘service businesses,’’ they auto-
     matically think small. The solo operator who comes around
   and cleans your carpets. The guy who cuts your grass. But the
   service industry is booming, with many giant businesses as
   members.
     How an Unemployed Autoworker Invented
         a Revolutionary Approach to
         Advertising in His Garage
    A young, unemployed autoworker, Terry Loebel, was look-
   ing for a way to make some money when he stumbled onto an
   idea that would ultimately change the entire advertising industry.
   With nothing but time on his hands, Terry was hanging out,
   talking to some of the shopkeepers in town, and the complaint
  ‘he heard repeated over and over again had to do with the diffi-
   culties and high costs of advertising to attract new customers.
   Terry figured out that he could reduce each merchant’s costs if
   they all mailed their brochures and coupons together, sharing one
   envelope. He convinced several merchants to try his idea, bor-
   rowed $500 from his mother to finance the printing costs, and
   stuffed the envelopes himself, in his garage.
       1993 business he created celebrated twenty-fifth

 envelopes filled with different advertisers’ coupons to more than
 50 million homes throughout the United States and Canada.
 These days, dry cleaners, carpet cleaners, restaurants, stores, chi-
 ropractors, dentists, attorneys, and countless other types of local
 businesses as well as national advertisers rank Val-Pak as their
 best method of advertising. The company has over 250 dealers
 and an army of more than 1,000 salespeople, bringing in adver-
 tising from more than 80,000 businesses, resulting in nearly 6
  billion coupons delivered to consumers.
   Val-Pak is the largest and fastest-growing company in the
 industry invented by Terry Loebel. Others now nipping at its
 heels include MoneyMailer and Advo. By providing a simple,
 cost-saving service to small] businesses, the company Terry cre-
 ated in his garage with $500 has become a $70 million-a-year
 business.
    I Can’t Wait to Tell You About Rory Fatt
   Inspired by Domino’s Pizza and trends he read about in Faith
 Popcorn’s book The Popcorn Report, a young entrepreneur in
 Vancouver, Canada, started Simple Salmon, home delivery of
 fresh-frozen seafood and gourmet dinners. His is a pure service
 business, competing against ‘‘calling Domino’s and settling for
 a pizza,’’ going out to eat, or going to the supermarket and as-
 sembling a dinner. Rory’s product is convenience without com-
 promise of quality.
   He started his business in his apartment, with a small corner
 of borrowed freezer space at a vendor’s facility, and one 8'2 x
 11" flyer. When he came to my seminar, he was struggling just
 to stay in business, and he said to me, ‘‘Once I get somebody _
 to try my meals, they ail reorder, stock their fridge, and keep
 calling me for more. If I can just get somebody to try it, I keep
 them as a customer.”’
   I said, ‘‘If you’re telling me the truth, I have the solution to
 your marketing problem. If you’re lying, my advice will put you

```
   the concept of a free dinner. My advice was: Give it away
   and get ’em hooked. And he did. Using the theme ‘‘Who said
   there’s no such thing as a free dinner?’’ he launched ads in
   the Yellow Pages, weekly newspapers, and on radio, and
   gave away free dinners by the carload. Since then, he’s used a
   variety of innovative advertisements but, in every case, he sticks
   with the free dinner offer as the means of acquiring new cus-
   tomers.
     In every sense, we have conquered Rory’s marketing chal-
   lenge. He can acquire new customers at a very low percus-
   tomer advertising and promotion cost, and his retention and
   referral rates are outstanding. Because he started with zero cap-
    ital in the first place and still can’t convince any bank to make
   a sizable business loan to such a strange enterprise, he is, as
   I'm writing this book, wrestling with other business prob-
   lems: raising capital so he can maintain adequate inventories,
   employ people, open pick-up outlets, and expand before some-
   one bigger and better financed takes his idea and preempts him
   in the marketplace. If he gets over this hump, I believe Rory
   has an eminently franchiseable business and you may very well
   see his ads in your city soon. His dramatic success to date is
   based on many things I believe in devoutly, including selling
   quality, not price; competing with service above all else; and
   using direct-response, creative advertising featuring an irresisti-
   ble offer.
     The trends that fuel his business can fuel many, by the way.
   The most precious commodity of the 1990s is not money, gold,
    silver, or diamonds—it’s time. That’s what we have the least of;
   that’s what we’ll cheerfully pay to preserve. With both husband
   and wife working outside the home; kids to raise; homes to keep
   up; a new interest in health and fitness motivating use of gyms,
   walking, jogging; an endless variety of leisure activities; anda
   remarkably large percentage of people between the ages of
   twenty-five and fifty involved with spare-time, home-based busi-
   nesses, there’s just not a minute to spare. So people will spend
   money for convenience. If you can give people time, you can

   How to Build a Multimillion-Dollar Business
      Without Spending Even a Penny
           on Advertising
   For years, requests by viewers of TV programs for transcripts
 of the shows were a damned nuisance until James Smith rec-
 ognized the opportunity hidden in all that aggravation. Smith was
 an MIT dropout, operating a small typesetting business in Man-
 hattan when he ordered a transcript of a MacNeil-Lehrer Report
 show and waited three weeks for it to arrive. To demonstrate
 that even his dinky company could do a better job, he taped a
 MacNeil-Lehrer show, stayed up all night transcribing and type-
 setting it, and hand-delivered the product to the show’s producers
 the next morning. He secured an exclusive contract to produce
 the show transcripts and fulfill the requests.
   For TV producers, his oddball business, called Journal
 Graphics, offered a service that relieved them of problems. Smith
 said to the producers: You can flash the Journal Graphics address
 and phone number on the air, we’ll handle the requests, and if
 a particular transcript sells enough copies, we'll even pay you a
 royalty. He quickly captured the transcript rights to most major
 talk shows and about one-third of all of CNN’s programming.
   Of course, most shows do not generate enough transcript
 requests to amount to much money. But, then, keep in mind that
 the costs of preparing a typical transcript for copying are less
 than $100, and copying costs are about two cents a page, about
 a buck for the average complete transcript copy. Journal Graph-
 ics lays a 300 percent or better markup on that, selling each
 transcript for $3 to $5. And the occasional blockbuster bestsellers
 make it all worthwhile. Phil Donahue’s April 8, 1993, show,
 featuring the ‘‘Recipe Detective’s’’ do-it-at-home versions of
 Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and other
 famous food products sold 100,000 transcripts! Bill Moyers’s
 PBS interviews with Joseph Campbell about myths sold a re-
 spectable 20,000 transcripts.

    dition to the individual consumers interested in the Recipe De-
    tective or the interviews with transvestite hookers who want to
   adopt children, Sally Jessy Raphael, law firms, newspapers, radio
    talk show producers, and even government agencies want tran-
    scripts of all the Nightline programs, and they’ll pay extra for
    fast delivery via satellite, computer, or fax. For $1,000 a year,
   Smith will deliver transcripts from 100 different TV shows
   whenever they deal with your chosen subject, so if you are, say,
    a lobbyist for the travel industry, you can get the comments
   about the travel industry as they occur on these shows. Jn these
    cases, Smith is really in a double-service business: serving the
   broadcasters and producers of the shows and serving the user of
    the information.
     To use high-tech terms, you might think of Mr. Smith’s mes
    nal Graphics as a toll booth on the information highway. But it
    is solidly based on the simple foundation of all successful service
   businesses: the ability to do and deliver a desired and needed
    service for less money than the individual customers can do it
   themselves, faster and more conveniently than they can do it for
   themselves.

       Make a Million with Your Hobby!
     How do you choose a service business to start? If you have
    an interest in creating a highly promotable service, but no ideas
    for that service, take a fresh look at ous own hobbies and per-

     Quite a few ‘‘success experts’’ emphasize the idea of doing
    those things you enjoy so much that you would do them for free
    as the most likely path to financial success. For me that would
   narrow it down to sleeping, eating, and hanging out at the track,

   How an Idea for Decorating a Living Room
   Wall Turned into a Unique Service Business
   In 1964 Micheline Massé, a University of Montreal com-
 merce graduate, began collecting old stock certificates with the
 intent of papering a wall in her living room with the colorful,
 often beautifully engraved documents. All of the certificates she
 found, bought for pennies, or got from friends were presumably
 worthless, but before gluing them all up, she decided to research
 a few of them and make sure they were worthless. And darn the
 luck, one of the old certificates had a value of $5,000. That
 screwed up her decorating plan, but it also launched Micheline
 in a new business as a stock sleuth.
        On the Trail of Lost Fortunes!
   According to Micheline, about 2,500 companies change their
 names every year, mergers and reorganizations confuse stock-
 holders, bankruptcies often disburse funds years later, dormant
 companies’ stockholders give up, and people die, leaving stock
 certificates in trunks in the attic or shoeboxes in the closet that
 go unnoticed for years and when found are presumed worthless.
 All this adds up. In fact, she estimates the amount of available,
 ‘‘lost’’ wealth to be in the billions of dollars, and that one-third
 of all households have some seemingly worthless stock certifi-
 cates lying around.
   Just as an example, consider North European Oil Corpora-
 tion, a ‘‘penny stock’’ from the 1930s. The company shut down
 in 1937. But twenty years later, oil was discovered on its prop-

```

```
   stock from 1930, there’s $130,000 waiting today. And there are
   nearly a million of those shares still floating around out there,
   presumed worthless by whoever has them.
     Florence Richards, a retiree in St. Petersburg, Florida, bought
   300 shares of North European at twenty-five cents a share in
   1930 to cheer up a despondent, failing stockbroker she was dat-
   ing at the time. Florence read about Micheline; Micheline got
   her $54,500 in back dividends and capital growth for those 300
   shares!
    Remember the famous capers of Bernie Cornfeld and Robert
   Vesco ‘from the 1960s? If you do, you may remember their
   ‘Fund of Funds,’’ which ended with.a much-publicized scandal,
   Vesco’s disappearance, Cornfeld’s prosecution, and the fund’s
   bankruptcy. Well, it took thirteen years to settle the bankruptcy,
   and now hundreds of millions of dollars await fundholders and
   shareholders who file claims.
      30 Percent of Millions Recovered—Micheline’s
      Hobby-Turned-Service Becomes Big Business
     The company Micheline founded, StockSearch International,
    Inc., has an extensive database in its computers, a network of
   research associates all around the world, and a crew of investi-
   gative specialists, all tracking down the true value of old and
   obscure companies’ stock certificates. The company charges a
   small, flat fee for each investigation (under $100 as of this writ-
   ing), plus 30 percent of the recovered funds if the stock proves
   valuable. '
     And even if the stock is really worthless, the certificates may
    still be salable in the collectibles market. Micheline’s original
   hobby lives on, as she remains active as a dealer in collectible
   stock certificates. Over the years, she has recovered millions of
   dollars for her clients. And she finally found enough truly worth-
    less certificates to get that wall decorated!

    Where Might Your Interests Lead You?
  My friend Carl Galetti is passionately interested in direct-
 response advertising and copywriting, and comes to many of the
 direct-marketing and advertising conferences where marketing
 gurus speak. He listens as one speaker after another, at confer-
 ence after conference, recommends certain books to the audi-
 ences by the old masters of advertising, many of which are out
 of print. Classic books like The Robert Collier Letter Book, orig-
 inally published in 1931, and Scientific Advertising by advertis-
 ing pioneer Claude Hopkins are incredibly valuable to anybody
 interested in creating highly productive ad copy, but these books
 are almost impossible to find.
   Carl correctly saw this as a terrific opportunity. He dug up
 many of these old books, traced them to their copyright owners,
 negotiated new publishing deals, and published new editions. In
 some cases, he found inventories lying in dusty warehouses and
 tied up the rights to sell them. In other cases, he arranged drop-
 shipping agreements with little-known publishers. One way or
 another, Carl built up a catalog of nearly a hundred of these
 hard-to-find but recommended books. Now, just about every
 direct-marketing and advertising speaker refers their audiences
 and clients to Carl. There are at least fifty speakers I know who
 tell people about Carl. By providing an important service to peo-
 ple interested in learning marketing from the old masters and
 providing a service to today’s marketing teachers, Carl has built
 a profitable mail-order business with zero advertising.
   But why stop there? Remember, Carl loves going to all sorts
 of marketing conferences and hanging out with the speakers,
 consultants, experts, and entrepreneurs who gather there. So, us-
 ing his books as the foundation, Carl assembled a speech and a
 home-study correspondence course of his own on the old mas-
 ters’ copywriting techniques. Now Carl goes to the conferences
 as an invited speaker, a recognized expert, and with catalogs to
 distribute and courses to sell, so instead of spending thousands
 traveling to each conference, he makes thousands at each one.
