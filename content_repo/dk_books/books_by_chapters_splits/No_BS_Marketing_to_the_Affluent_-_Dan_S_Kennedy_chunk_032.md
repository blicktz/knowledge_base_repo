##### only a small number. Let’s assume there are only 200 of them. Those 200 names may be very valuable. We know to create and send them a mailing with planes and boats on the envelope, and maybe a line of copy like “Free Voucher for the Adventure Trip of a Lifetime Enclosed.” Inside, we can tell them we know they appreciate the finer things in life, appreciate new experiences, and often fly their own plane or sail their own yacht in search of them. But did they know they could take a trip to one of the finest restaurants in all of France, only a short drive from their own home?
 There is also a list available of people in any ZIP codes of your choice, arranged by birthday. As far as we know, everybody has one, once a year. So, in every month, there are quite a few people in reach of your restaurant having a birthday, and most people go out to dinner to celebrate. You can select from that list only married people, or people who own homes in pricey neighborhoods, or people with certain incomes. A colleague of mine operates a company that does these “Happy Birthday” mailings for restaurants and consistently gets tremendous response and very good return on investment.
 But we could get very sophisticated and merge and purge. That means taking only the names appearing on two or more lists. The yacht and plane owners’ list giving us only 200 names in our area might thin out to only 10 to 20 birthday names in any given month. But they are the quadruple- perfect prospects. So instead of sending them a birthday card or letter and a coupon for a free birthday dinner, we might send them a beautifully wrapped gift box, a copy of our menu, and a fancy certificate on parchment paper. Doing this, we would spend a lot more per prospect, but we would be spending all our money on ideal prospects.
 Let’s try another one. You own an upscale, but not ultra pricey, women’s fashion store featuring one-of-a-kind and unusual items. There’s a response list available of Peruvian Connection® catalog buyers. The catalog sells knit and woven sweaters and other clothes made from luxury fibers native to the Andes. The women buyers range in age from 35 to 55. Their average household income tops $100,000.00. They’re perfect for the clothing store but may also be good for a spa, medicalspa, even a cosmetic surgeon or dentist, a gift shop, or even the French restaurant. We won’t know unless we test.

##### Here is the point: if you can describe your ideal affluent customers —whether ultra-affluent, affluent, mass-affluent, young, old, male, female, and so on—you can go into the inventory of available lists and find them, already rounded up for you. In all cases, you can get their physical addresses. In many cases, you can also get their telephone numbers, fax numbers if they are business owners or professionals, and email addresses.
 The obvious question is: Why not skip all this and just mail everybody in rich ZIP codes? In some cases, that will produce satisfactory results. But it deprives you of several key ingredients of optimum direct-marketing success, notably precision matching of prospects with offers. Getting down to a smaller number of carefully chosen high-probability prospects allows you to invest your money more wisely, market more efficiently, and craft and present a story about your business as well as an offer that is seen as specifically relevant to the recipient. If you are seeking appointments with affluent investors, you could just mail the rich ZIP codes. But if mailing the Investors Business Daily subscribers in those same ZIP codes, you know you are hitting active stock market investors, and you can tailor your message to them—“Disappointed with Your Results in the Stock Market? What If …”

 How Much Do We Know? We know just about everything! One way or another, from one or multiple databases, it is possible for all marketers national in scope and for many only local in reach to obtain and develop a hit list of ideal prospects.

### Recommended Resource

##### Now, I’m going to suggest you do yourself a great favor. The person to learn all about mailing lists, selection of lists, access to lists, and profitable use of lists from is Craig Simpson. Craig’s book, to which I contributed, The Direct-Mail Solution, is a practical crash-course. Beyond that, you can find other helpful resources at www.simpson- direct.com. And if you decide to communicate with Craig directly, you’ll find his contact information on that site as well.


##### I’ve listed only 7 of 34 breakout categories encompassing 130 million names, addresses, and so on, which can also be pulled apart by exact age, gender, geography, mail-order response, marital status, net worth, occupation, even whether they wear corrective lenses! A list compiled from this data could also be over-layered against a specific company’s list of subscribers or buyers. In short, you can drill down with incredible specificity, to identify and reach out only to people perfectly, precisely, and multi data-point matched with your current customer, ideal customer, or product or service offer. And you should.
 Think of the power of combining precision-targeted lists of affluent buyers ideally matched with your business with a marketing system as described in the other chapters here!


### A Sample Affluent List—and What We Know
 About It

# Magellan’s is a leading catalog and mail-order company selling travel##### related products, including luggage, in-flight comfort products, health and safety items, books and DVDs, dual-time wrist-watches, men’s and women’s apparel, and items specifically for globe-trotters, like adaptor


-----

##### plugs and translators. The company’s catalogs can be seen and obtained at www.Magellans.com.

 Their customers are mass-affluent and affluent, with an average household income of $75,000.00. Average age, 55-plus, 59% female. If renting its lists, you can select by age brackets, gender, and geography as well as purchase activity. For example, as of this writing, there were 265,600 customers who had purchased at least once within the past 12 months; broken out, 51,000 of those had purchased apparel.

 Direct-marketing companies that repeatedly rent and mail to segments of this list include obvious ones, like Omaha Steaks®, Orvis®, Grand European Tours®, and Condé Nast Traveler, as well as less obvious ones, like The Wall Street Journal and AARP. These users suggest that any marketer of the obvious—travel, gourmet foods, wine—as well as marketers of financial publications, financial services, investments, and anything related to upscale retirement living could potentially use this list. Had I such a business or a client in such a business, I would definitely investigate further.

##### The Online Equivalents
 Facebook can match your customers with others who “look alike” within their entire database. Facebook can help you retarget people who’ve visited your site and literally stalk them, so that your ad messages show up everywhere they go. Although under intense pressure because of its role in “big data” and privacy invasion, Facebook is the marketing stalkers’ dream ally. Other social media and search engine media offer similar opportunities. It is my belief that all of these should be investigated and used when financial return on investment is proveable. The book in this series, No B.S. Guide to Direct Response Social Media Marketing, is a good start point. Also from Entrepreneur Press, Perry Marshall’s Ultimate Guide to Google AdWords, and Timothy Seward’s Ultimate Guide to Amazon Advertising. But keep in mind, all online media is more connected to where

##### people live online than geographically and physically, and is basically search driven. What you can do with it is almost entirely reactive to their expressed interests and activities. With offline media, you have opportunity to be ahead of their search; to be first, or, better yet, to create their interest and be into a one-to-one sales conversation with them that pre-empts anyone and everyone else.


### Where Should You Drill for Oil?

 Years ago, I got to know a “professional psychic” I met at the bar after
##### his show in the lounge at the Playboy Club in Phoenix, Arizona. He had a home worth more than a million dollars perched high on Camelback Mountain, drove a Rolls-Royce, and seemed wealthier than might be expected for an entertainer working such small venues. He told me he used his performances only to “drill for oil.” By that he meant making himself visible and approachable to a few wealthy patrons who chose to employ him privately for advice on a variety of matters, at substantial fees. He said he named his approach “drilling for oil” in honor of one of his first patrons, a very rich Texas widow who had inherited her late husband’s oil business. She hired the psychic to walk her vast oil fields and choose the next five places to drill new wells and paid him an ongoing royalty on the production of any successful wells. He bore none of the costs of the dry holes. And, as he said, “How psychic must you be to pick one winner out of five—in an oil field?”

### Affluent Consumer Entrapment

##### “Creativity is over-rated. Most business success comes from doing
 boring diligent work. From developing a system that produces
 consistent results and sticking to it.”

—RAY KROC

# You need a direct-marketing system.

##### Here I lack space and time to belabor these points as I do in other works of mine, but here are two vital facts: One, all wealth derived from business is based on systems. Two, most businesses have some sort of operations system but lack the more valuable marketing system. To be successful attracting and marketing to the affluent, you will need to spend more per


-----

##### prospective customer, client, or patient (reasonable in light of their greater value), so you cannot afford to let any of them slip through your fingers. Further, they judge your competence and trustworthiness from the outset, so how organized you are in your marketing influences their willingness to do business with you. For these and other reasons, you need a direct-marketing system.
 What is such a thing? As its name implies, it directly reaches out to, connects with, and brings the desired prospective customer, client, or patient to you.
 All systems use bait to lure the desired creature into the trap. I’ll switch to more elegant language in a few minutes, but for starters, tolerate my being deliberately coarse and simplistic with a basic example. Consider the company Fisher Investments, by my standards and my clients’ standards, it has a primitive and simplistic system, but it will do as the basic example, and if you stop to think about it, you are probably aware of the company. It is a multi-product investment and money-under-management firm aiming at mass-affluent and affluent (but not ultra-affluent) investors. Its advertised floor is investable assets of $500,000.00 or more. You’ve probably seen TV commercials, magazine ads, USA Today ads, or The Wall Street Journal ads, or possibly received direct-mail solicitations. All that advertising does is offer bait to lure you into the trap. The bait is one or more free reports, like The 9 Mistakes Affluent Investors Make, a free audio CD, a free DVD, or a package of all that information. The titles and promises of what you will discover from these things are the real bait. You will discover lies your current broker, banker, financial planners are telling you, taxes you are paying unnecessarily, safe but high-yield investments you don’t know about. You will get this from a highly credible and authoritative source. That’s the bait. Whom is that bait for? Relatively new mass-affluents with little knowledge or confidence about investing. People who are aware they should be investing their money but do not know what to do or whom to trust. Affluent people frustrated with stock market ups and downs or losses.
 My comments mean no judgment, pro or con, about Fisher Investments as an investment firm. I have no firsthand knowledge and no opinion. I am only making observations in my area of expertise—marketing—and using Fisher’s as example. Incidentally, Ken Fisher himself is a featured guest


-----

##### speaker at one of our two member conventions in 2019, speaking not only about money but also about the marketing that has raised his firm to number one. If you happen to be reading this early enough in 2019, you’ll find information about the conference at www.Superconference19.com. If past March 2019, all other, next conferences’ information gets posted at www.NoBSInnerCircle.com in its time. The reason we invited Ken is salient whether the time of his appearance is ahead or behind us: His company is a lead generation monster, and I mean that in a good way. It successfully defies the common but erroneous idea that affluent people won’t respond to straightforward lead generation and direct marketing.
 Fisher’s bait lures those particular creatures into a trap. By design, there are a lot of creatures it does not lure, such as those with less than $500,000.00 to invest, or those cemented in place with existing money advisor relationships.
 The trap is a place where the creature’s name, address, email address, fax number, and phone number are captured and, of utmost importance, permission to use this information is secured.


### Dan Kennedy’s #10 No B.S. Key to the Vault

##### The most valuable asset is a list of high-value customers and prospective
 customers who invite and welcome communication from you.


##### Additional information may also be asked for and captured at a trap, such as age or occupation or income, so as to assign the captured creature to a different sub-trap, to be shown and fed slightly different sales messages appropriate to him. From there, a follow-up process begins. In Fisher’s case, it is simplistic; the package sent more of an excuse for immediate and direct follow-up by telephone agents than anything else. We can do better and be more sophisticated, as I’ll show you. Still, what Fisher does is


-----

##### effective and successful for that company. The website is the ideal trap medium, as it allows us to automate this entire process, even to the point of the customer doing his own data entry work for us. But a recorded message and voicemail, a call taken by a live human, or a reply form or card returned by fax or mail can all serve as traps as well.
 Before going further, there is one very important point to be made. Fisher Investments, targeting mass-affluent and affluent investors, in order to then offer professional money management services, does exactly the same things as, for example, TempurPedic® does to cast a much broader net and then sell mattresses, or the lowest of low-end “burial insurance for just 50 cents a day” companies advertising on TV do to target the very non- affluent and then sell a term insurance policy. Regardless of what they are selling or whom they are selling to, virtually all direct marketers do the same thing structurally: They use bait to lure desired creatures into a trap. The only changes are to the bait. You need the right bait for the desired creature. There is no creature that can’t be lured into a trap with the right bait. Let me say it again: There is NO creature that can’t be lured into a trap. With the RIGHT bait.
 Now, we’ll get more sophisticated, and use more elegant language, with which you may feel more comfortable!
 Our direct-marketing system, just like the previous examples, will extend an invitation designed for a specific audience via a variety of means and media. You might use any or all of these to extend your invitation:

 • Print advertising in newspapers, magazines, newsletters, or other
 publications
 • Banner advertising at others’ websites
 • Buying traffic for your website with Google™ Ads® or other means;
 pay per click
 • Using publicity to get articles about you placed in different
 publications and media
 • Direct mail to rented or compiled mailing lists
 • Email to opt-in lists
 • Radio or television advertising

 And I could list a hundred more options.
