If I decide I want to buy a home in Florida, as I am contemplating, I can find a wide, wide, wide
range of prices. If I’m not terribly persnickety about coast or inland, on the beach or just close,
architectural style, big lot, small lot, in the current market as I write this, I could find a number of
bona-fide bargains. There are very fine high-end, luxury Florida homes to be had at 20 to 30 cents
on the dollar of their owners’ purchase prices, let alone their peak values. But if I pre-determine that
I wish to live in the community of Celebration, Florida, originally designed by Disney, then none of
anything I just said will affect me or the price I’ll pay. Everything going on outside the perimeter of
Celebration is irrelevant. If enough people are pre-determined to buy within Celebration, a greater
number per available property than the number per property outside its borders, then the fundament
of supply vs. demand will push prices in Celebration up higher than for comparable properties
outside its borders, and support those prices despite downward pressures, slumping values, and
recession all throughout Florida. If I pre-determine I want to live in Celebration within walking

-----

distance of Town Square, my choices will be much more limited, which, for the most part, will push
up the price of a four-bedroom box there significantly above the price I might pay for the very same
box at the opposite end of the community. Sounds like the old saying in real estate: the most
important thing is location, location, location. And it is, but it is also more than that; it is predetermination about a location, brand identity, the unique small-town-Americana ambiance baked in
to Celebration, and an affinity for Disney. And if I decide I’d rather live in one of the few, rare
luxury homes being built by Disney, on Disney property immediately adjacent to the parks, for the
first time ever, I will pay the full retail price, from $1.8-million to $10-million with no quibbling
despite a depressed Florida real estate market surrounding that little community.

Donald Trump’s brilliant chief negotiator George Ross observed: there’s never any problem
selling the penthouse. There’s only one. But it’s typically been even easier to quickly sell the
penthouses in buildings bearing the Trump name. Some buyers are pre-determined to live in the
penthouse in a Trump property because it is a Trump property.

Is this product better because it is in Celebration, or bears Disney or Trump identity? Maybe a
little, but not proportionate to its higher price.

**If consumers do not care, for them price matters a lot, and if there are enough consumers**
**who do not care, price is suppressed. Consider this book. Its value to anyone in business who**
makes even a little use of it is considerably in excess of its price. But it cannot be sold for anything
close to its value, because of the context in which it is sold (refer back to Chapter 10), and because
many buyers will not have a strong pre-determination to buy this specific book—instead they’ll be
shopping for an interesting book on marketing or sales or maybe even price. There are others
surrounding this one on the bookstore shelf or at the online bookseller’s site. If there are a number
of people who will be pre-determined to buy this specific book—as there are because I have a
following and I promote a new book’s release direct to that following—its price can be inched up a
little bit above the average or typical price of others in its category, space, and place. If I did not
care about having the book published by a full-fledged publisher or about distribution in bookstores
and with online booksellers—which I care about as a means of gaining exposure to virgins who are
unfamiliar with me—I could print the same book myself, send a letter about it to all my followers,
sell it directly to them for 300% to 500% more than the price on its cover that you paid, and keep all
the money, rather than getting a small percentage of the price as a royalty. If selling only to my
followers pre-determined to get my next book, I could put a much higher price on this product and
everybody would still be happy. So, I pay a price for the book acting as advertising, reaching out to
virgins. My followers get a bargain, as they buy the book for about a third or maybe even a fifth of
what they would pay if I published it privately only for them. You paid about a dollar or two dollars
more than you might have paid, had I not had the floor support of my existent followers who could
be depended on to stampede to booksellers and buy a sufficient number of books to make the
publisher and the booksellers happy, so that the purchases by virgins was extra.

One more example, then the all-important moral of the story. If a florist near the entrance to a
fairly large, upscale community prices a dozen roses at, say, $95.00, and has nothing but those roses
available, he probably won’t sell all or even many of his roses this Friday. Men stopping on impulse
on the way home will judge his price way too high. They will not care enough about their impulse
to pay such a price. But if somehow magic occurred and this Friday was Valentine’s Day and every
man had suffered from amnesia about this life-or-death holiday until the very moment he saw the
florist’s sign, and these men had much to lose by divorce, the florist would be out of roses in no
time, outrageously high price be damned. Now, don’t mess this up. The important variable here isn’t
the Valentine’s Day holiday or the amnesia or the risk of costly divorce. They are just factors that
create the state of mind that makes a high price irrelevant: caring a lot more about getting “x” than
its price.

That is the state of mind you want your customers to be in when you are selling to them. This
goal is everything. How you get to it may not, in your business, involve a holiday, amnesia, risk of
divorce, a celebrity, or any specific item named here. It may very well involve some of the types of
things named here. But the important thing is that you understand and dedicate yourself to the goal.
It is the ultimate price strategy.

## CHAPTER 12

 The Secret to Price Elasticity

 Dean Killingbeck

**I grew up in Michigan, where my family owned a 218-acre produce farm, growing corn, beans,**
cauliflower, and cabbage. When I turned 16, my father delegated the marketing to me—which
actually meant going to market, not the kind of marketing I do now. After the two-hour drive, I had
to set up, display, and price ten different products, and compete with other farmers selling the same
produce, sometimes at lower prices. I quickly learned that some buyers cared only about price and
that I shouldn’t waste time talking with them, but that there were other buyers looking for quality
more than lowest price. Over time, I found that about a dozen key buyers were taking most of my
produce, at prices higher than my competitors. Armed with that information, I began circumventing
the competitive marketplace altogether. I found out where they gathered for breakfast every
morning, I got up even earlier for my drive from farm to city, and showed up at their favorite diner. I
had most of my sales done before I or they ever got to the market.

Today, my farming is on a much smaller scale—for personal consumption. But Dan calls lead
generation and customer development “farming,” and I carried those earliest lessons forward to my
work today, running the leading company in the done-for-them marketing programs field, helping
all sorts of businesses “farm” effectively. We avoid price wars. We preserve our clients’ price
strategy and profits. We focus on bringing the right customers through each of our clients’ doors. At
age 16, I learned that all customers are not created equal. Why not zero in on the best? And
circumvent the competitive marketplace altogether?

Price Elasticity means you can s-t-r-e-t-c-h your prices beyond those of direct competitors, if you
get the right customers, the right way.

## Who Is Your Best Customer?

Most business owners honestly don’t know who their best customer is. They haven’t done careful
analysis, probably because they think they can’t really control whom they attract, and they’re eager
for any and every customer they can get. If it has a pulse and a wallet, c’mon in! But if we know
who a business’s best customer is, we can, in fact, use specific demographics to select the people in
its area who match up well with the profile, and then invest money in marketing only to those best
customers. This makes it possible to stay out of the competitive marketplace, standing right
alongside other merchants, and yelling similar, broad, often cheapest-price-based messages at all
passers-by. It lets us do, on a more sophisticated level, what I did with my dozen power buyers. Go
_directly to them._

**If you build your business by going after anybody and everybody, it’s almost impossible to**
**avoid doing so based on price. 80% of the people you attract this way can only be kept coming**
back the same way. Coupon clippers, internet junkies shopping around for discounts, and others
most motivated by “deals” have to be sold that way all the time. If you are going to entice
somebody to try your business out for the first time with a special offer, you need to be sure you’re
bringing somebody to you who matches your best customers, and can be nurtured and developed
into another “best customer,” with balanced interests other than cheapest price.

**Here’s how it works. A couple clients and friends of mine, Keith McCrone and Gerry Frank,**
both own auto repair shops in the Cleveland, Ohio, area. I should point out that Cleveland’s
economy has not exactly boomed in recent years. Three years ago, both owners decided to increase
their businesses with targeted rather than mud-against-the-wall advertising. Their businesses were
thriving, when competitors’ weren’t, because of the type and quality of the customers they had, so
they reasoned they needed to get more of those customers—not just any customers. This is a very
important principle: price elasticity has more to do with the customer than the product or the
service. The price elasticity of my family farm’s vegetables did have something to do with superior
quality, but a lot more to do with finding the dozen buyers who cared a lot more about that quality
than about price.

Keith and Gerry carefully analyzed all the information they had and could collect about their best
customers—types of cars owned, age, marital status, approximate incomes, areas they clustered in
and lived in, and more. They determined their very best existing customers had household incomes
above $60,000.00, lived within a three-mile radius of the shops, and were married with children. A
good list broker can use that kind of demographic information to find mailing lists that match. You
[can search for brokers and list information online at SRDS.com. You may find a local list broker via](http://srds.com/)
your Yellow Pages. Or, to be self-serving, you might, instead, bring your demographic profile to me
and let me take care of the list-finding and the direct-mail campaigns for you. (Yes, that was a crass
commercial plug.) You can also have your list analysis done for you. If you don’t have a good
customer list and good information about your customers, you’re operating without a very important
and valuable asset. Dan Kennedy says anybody who ever buys a business that doesn’t have this
asset is a dolt, so anybody operating their business without one is a dolt, too. He said it. If you’re
offended, complain to him.

Keith and Gerry found me by doing diligent research into direct-mail marketing, in search of
proven campaigns. Together, we married the good, solid information they’d developed about who
they wanted as customers with proven campaigns and very strong, introductory offers. Remember,
promoting very strong, very appealing initial offers including generous discounts, gifts, or even free
products or services is possible without destroying your prices and ability to charge premium prices
going forward only if the new customers given such offers are very carefully chosen. They were
also able to invest in sending out my top-quality mailings because the waste was removed from the
prospect list beforehand. So, two warnings: don’t settle for just throwing offers out to everybody,
and don’t get bamboozled into sending out cheap, cheap-looking mailers because you’re dumping
them on everybody and anybody.

**By continuing on-going marketing to their existing customers and adding these carefully**
**constructed new customer-getting campaigns, Keith took his shop from about $700,000.00 a**
**year to over $2-million a year, and Gerry took his from about $500,000.00 to $1.5-million.**
They both tripled their sales, and are not working three times as hard for their money. In fact,
they’ve actually increased prices five times in the space of the few years of this growth, while in the
middle of the recession. Neither of them even touches a car anymore themselves except for fun,
because they have the demand and profit needed to employ top-notch technicians. Their shops are

-----

able to sell their services and satisfy and keep customers even though their prices are significantly
higher than competitive chains and other independently owned shops within stones-throw distance.
Why? In part, because of superior service, but in large part because of the customers they bring in
the doors.

In my mind, you can’t separate price strategy from customer acquisition strategy. If you are
bringing in customers of any and every type, interest, and motivation, this has to affect your price
strategy, and will almost certainly drag you into dependence on the kind of price decisions, offers,
and discounts that force your prices and profits down. If you bring the right customers in the right
way, this, too, will affect your price strategy, in positive ways.

## CHAPTER 13

 The Making of Propositions

 Dan Kennedy

**A customer’s reaction to price is colored by the proposition attached to the price.**

Let’s be crude for a few minutes. This is reportedly Frank Sinatra’s favorite Las Vegas joke: a
middle-aged farmer and his wife from a rural area, who’ve rarely traveled beyond their hometown,
save up for years and go to Las Vegas. When checking in, the farmer spots an extraordinarily
attractive, extraordinarily well-endowed young woman in a slinky cocktail dress and impossibly
high heels loitering near the elevators; he tells his wife he thinks he has spotted one of those
working girls and is curious about the price. He goes over and asks her. She takes in his bib overalls,
denim shirt, work shoes, and knows better, but tells him that it is $1,000.00 for an hour or
$10,000.00 all night. He laughs and says “A THOUSAND dollars? Good lord and gee whiz, missy,
when I was in the Navy and went on shore leave we never paid more than $50.00.” He and his wife
head upstairs, he telling her of this amazing situation. Morning comes, and the farmer and his wife
come downstairs for the buffet breakfast—he attired as he was the night before, she in flowered,
well-worn housedress, hair in curlers, no make-up. When the elevator stops on the way down, the
same lady of the evening enters, gives them the once-over and says to the farmer: “See what you get
for fifty bucks?”

So, let’s assume you are single and unencumbered, not morally opposed to prostitution, willing to
pay for a sexual adventure, with sufficient discretionary income and cash in your pocket to indulge
just about any whim. You’re at your hotel bar, one late evening when you are approached by an
attractive but not, to your taste, stunning young woman, who quietly asks if you’d enjoy some
company in the privacy of your room. When you inquire about price, she responds flatly: $300.00
an hour. While you’re mulling it over and she visits the powderroom, let’s replace her with a better
salesperson, who happens also, to your taste, to be stunning. When you inquire about price, she
quietly says: “For the most incredible, mind-blowing, unforgettable sexual experience of your entire
life—including sex secrets passed down through generations back to the ancient Orient—
$1,000.00.” Which price might seem better to you? Clearly one is cheaper than the other. One is
300% higher than the other. Price may make or break this sale if you are one of those rare birds who
only buys by cheapest price. But it’s more likely, if the sale is made, it will be by the woman who
presented the superior proposition.
