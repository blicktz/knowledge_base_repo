   Gary Halbert
   Gary has two publications of direct, profound relevance to the
    task of finding or creating a highly promotable information
    product: (1) the December 5, 1987 issue of The Halbert
    Letter, reprinted as chapter 2 in the current edition of his
   book Maximum Money in Minimum Time; and (2) the
   October 23, 1992 issue of his other newsletter, Hot Stuff.
   Gary also has information available about the CD-ROM
   publishing business. For information, contact Gary’s office at
   305-534-2508.
    Melvin Powers
   Melvin has self-published books and made them into bestsellers,
    including Dynamic Thinking, of which he has sold more than 1
    million copies, almost entirely via mail-order, although many of
    his titles are also distributed in major bookstore chains, as well
   as—depending on their subject matter—health food stores,
    sporting goods stores, pet stores, and toy and hobby shops. Mel-
    vin Powers is one of the few experts in the field of information
    products whom I have viewed as a valid mentor, and have stud-
    ied as a model in bringing my own products to market. My copy
    of his book How to Self-Publish Your Book and Have the Fun
   and Excitement of Being a Bestselling Author is dog-eared,
    yellow-highlighted, underlined, and Post-it-Noted half to death.
   You can and should contact Melvin Powers at 12015 Sherman
      Hollywood, CA 91605.

   How Can I Get Set Up to Accept Major Credit
        Cards from My Customers?
   Obtaining VISA/MasterCard merchant processing for direct-
 marketing businesses, especially new ones, is an increasingly
 vexing problem. The unfortunate truth is there is no really good
 answer. Persistence and patience will often be required. VISA/
 MC and their processing banks clearly discriminate against direct
 marketers.
          NEW HELP FOR START-UPS
    With the widespread use of 800 numbers, few catalog com-
    panies can survive today without offering credit card or-
    dering. But just try to find a credit card processor that will
    take small or new cataloguers as clients. It’s not easy.
      Jean Hill, the founder of start-up food cataloguer,
    Amara Kosher Meats in New York City, says she contacted
    15 processors and banks before she found one willing
     to take her business. Finally, New Hampshire—based
    Litle&Co. accepted Hill’s account under the Alliance Pro-
    gram, a new venture designed to help start-ups and small
    mailers with credit processing needs. [As of August 1993]
    the Program has 34 mailers, 15 waiting to start.
       **Litle has been so nice to deal with,’’ says Katherine
    Ansardi, founder of Indelible Blue, a computer software
    cataloguer. She has only one complaint: ‘‘It’s a little
    pricey,’’ she says. ‘“Litle requires a 10% retainer of sales
    that is causing us cash flow problems.”’
      Catalog participants (in Alliance) must offer a product
    rather than a service and must also pass a stringent credit
    check and site inspection.

      How Can I Handle Fulfillment
         of the Orders I Receive? »
   Many companies, especially start-ups, choose to handle their
 in-bound order-taking and their fulfillment internally, for maxi-
 mum control, maximum contact with customers, lowest costs,
 and loss control. My own preference is to handle as much of
 this hands-on, in-house, as possible. There are, however, a great
 many service companies that offer in-bound call services and
 fulfillment services.

 Joe Cossman’s ‘“‘exploits”—and they honestly can be called noth-

 first read his book How I Made $1,000,000 in Mail-Order and
 You Can, Too over twenty years ago. More recently, it was a
 privilege to get to know him personally, in connection with an
 infomercial project. And, even though in his old age I found him
 to be irascible and difficult to deal with, I have to tell you that,
 in my experience, no one has as much practical experience in
 turning raw ideas, orphaned and odd products, and information
 into fortunes.
