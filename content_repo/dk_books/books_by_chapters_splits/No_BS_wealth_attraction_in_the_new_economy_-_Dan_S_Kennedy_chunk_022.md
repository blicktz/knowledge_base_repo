## A Passion for Wealth

#### “... the claim that people did not set out to get rich, but became rich
 by ‘accident’—‘Oh, I just did what I love to do and woke up one
 day to find myself wealthy.’

 ... the vast majority of the self-made rich worked, secretly or openly, deliberately, intentionally, like billy-o to acquire wealth.”

 “... and now look around you. How many of the people you work with, the people you socialize with, the people you see in the street,
 do you think have DEDICATED THEMSELVES to getting rich?”

 See What Isn’t There

#### W ay back in 1982, I started a company from scratch, with less than $1,000.00, that produced millions of dollars over the next several years, and attracted customers who continue contributing to my income today, all these years later. It was classic entrepreneurial alchemy—nothing but an idea on a Monday, $100,000.00 in income by the following Friday. Before the internet, incidentally. At the risk of distracting you from the point, I’ll give you the specifics, but with the warning to focus on the principle.
 At the time, in the chiropractic profession, information and advice about practice marketing, promotion, and success was being delivered to doctors at two price levels: very inexpensive books and audiocassette tapes, priced at $10.00 to $100.00, or multi-year practice management programs, costing upwards of $25,000.00. There was nothing in between. Further, the way practice management was sold was via small, free introductory seminars, city by city by city. As a result, 30 or 40 doctors in a town would attend, eager for help, but only one might be willing to make the required

#### investment. The business I created stepped into the gap, the empty market space in the middle. We followed the practice management companies, again put those 30 or 40 doctors into a seminar, but offered them a $300.00 to $500.00 alternative. Virtually 100% bought. In 36 months, more than 10,000 of only 35,000 eligible chiropractors in the entire profession bought one or more of our courses—an amazing 30% market share. Now, forget all about chiropractors and seminars and courses. Focus on stepping into the empty or underserved market space.
 When a client of mine created Steak ‘n Ale restaurants, there were a lot of premium steakhouses, like Ruth Chris’ and Morton’s, and a lot of very low-end steakhouses, like Sizzler, but hardly anything in between. He developed a restaurant that combined the ambience, feel, and quality of a premium steakhouse with pricing in between the two extremes. He benefited from a recession. And he got very rich.
 For years, air travel options were fly commercial, coach, or first class, charter a private plane, or own a jet. A few companies, notably including NetJets, in which Warren Buffett is invested, found market space in the middle. Bringing the time sharing and fractional ownership formats from real estate, they created fractional jet ownership. Many celebrities as well as CEOs, executives, and entrepreneurs are “owners”/clients of these companies. Famous names you know, like Martha Stewart, and lots of people you don’t know too. And those companies were well positioned to benefit from the 9–11 tragedy. Immediately after 9–11, they were flooded with new buyers, unwilling to suffer the suddenly heightened inconvenience and time loss of ordinary commercial air travel. (One man’s tragedy is always another’s opportunity. )
 The unused market space is not always in the middle, but there is often space between extremes of price or location. Sometimes, the space is at the top. At Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™, we have a number of top cosmetic dentists with “Taj Mahal” spa-style offices featuring a wide array of patient comforts, from paraffin hand waxes and massage to lattes and freshbaked cookies. Their average case fee is 200% to 500% higher than nearby, competing dentists. We even have a Member, a family psychologist in private practice, specializing in work with autistic children, who competes with free services available from government agencies as well as a number of other doctors in her area—and charges four times their average fees, and has a waiting list. I feature many examples of businesses finding

#### opportunity at the top of pricing and their owners’ thinking and strategies in my book No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent .
 Sometimes the space is at the bottom—although I generally dislike this place. Still, Wal-Mart is, of course, the ultimate example of the moment, of grabbing empty space, both at the bottom of the price ladder and, initially, in locations other chains ignored.
 Sometimes, it’s in a means of distribution. My friend, the late E. Joseph Cossman, a mail-order guru, made ten different million-dollar businesses out of products sold by their manufacturers through only one or two means of distribution. He secured exclusive rights to the ignored distribution channels. My friend Joe Sugarman took sunglasses to TV infomercials, then QVC. Omaha Steaks and Allen Brothers: steaks sold by mail-order, delivered by FedEx.
 Cosmetics, skin care products, and acne treatment products have long been at a number of different price points, from discount to outrageous, via department-store cosmetic counters, free-standing stores, mall kiosks, catalogs, and direct sales and networking marketing organizations like Avon, Amway, Mary Kay. My long-time client, Guthy-Renker, has virtually dominated distribution through TV infomercials for a decade, with its Victoria Principal, Susan Lucci, Cindy Crawford, and other celebrity lines, and the Pro-Activ acne treatment products developed at my urging.
 Looking for “The Gap” ideal for you to fill is a very nuts-andbolts piece of advice, possibly more appropriate for one of my marketing books than this book. But I include it here for a broader purpose; illustration of the kind of thinking that attracts wealth. The cliché is “think outside the box.” But I suppose it is a cliché because it is so laden with truth. Even savvy, clever, aggressive entrepreneurs fall into “inside the box” thinking. It’s easy and dangerous to do. To see our opportunities only in terms of incremental improvements of what we already do and the way we do it, essentially pushing at the sides of the box. I take pride in the fact that clients who come to me for consulting days or are in coaching groups or attend Glazer- Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] events frequently say the same thing—“I came to Kennedy thinking I was in one business; I left in an entirely different, infinitely better and more valuable business.”

#### The challenge is to see what is not there . As example, consider this statement by the CEO of Home Depot, made in an interview in 2005:

 Experts say we are in a $400-billion market, because that’s the market for our products TODAY. But I say we are in a $900-billion market. We’re focusing on selling differently to professional contractors and that’s a $300-billion market itself. The “we-do-it-for-you” market is another $200-billion market itself.

 In 2003–2004, this company experienced a 26% increase in sales of home installation and do-it-for-them services to what they called the “free- spending, do-it-for-me-now consumer.”
 Of course, if you carefully analyze all this, there’s trading of dollars from one category to another, so adding each on top of the other is delusional. There are assumptions worthy of question. Subsequently, the hitting-the- wall of free-wheeling spending on home improvements by tapping ever- rising equity in homes made a mess of Home Depot’s entire business. This CEO, Bob Nardelli, has since moved from Home Depot to the failed turnaround at Chrysler, but was still well enough thought of to be given an important position at Cerebrus, the private equity fund that owned Chrysler and had installed him there. With all that noted, and room for vastly

-----

#### differing opinions on Mr. Nardelli, still, the main point is the vision. The ability to see what was not yet there, to see gaps and opportunities, empty or underserved market space.
 In The New Economy, there are all manner of new gaps, new market space, new opportunities to see what is not yet there that you may get to first.
 In the February 17, 2005, issue of USA Today, there was an article in the Science Section headlined “A WHOLE NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD.”
 Bill Glazer used it as fodder for a sales letter about my Renegade Millionaire Retreat, saying “More important to me than just the millions of dollars I’ve made going in the directions Dan has pointed me is that, quite literally, Dan has shown me a whole new way of looking at the world. ”
 He went on to write: “There are hundreds and hundreds of people who were in ‘small businesses’ who are now superentrepreneurs with multiple streams of income they never imagined, with clientele they never conceived, charging prices or fees they never thought possible, being sought out rather than having to chase business.”
 I have the newspaper clipping up on my bulletin board as my own reminder of the mandate to keep looking at the world, at my world, at my clients’ worlds in a whole new way—frequently .
 How can you keep your thoughts about your own opportunities flexible, agile, outside rather than inside the box? The most important key is exposure, to a lot of ideas, information, news, business success stories, people outside the box of your business and your industry. I wrote another book in the No B.S. series just for this reason: No B.S. DIRECT Marketing for NON-Direct Marketing Businesses . It takes you inside very diverse examples of businesses using direct marketing, that customarily do not. You can’t just read your trade journals; you need to read others’ trade journals. Read good, well researched, cutting edge newsletters (like mine!). You need a lot of ideas, examples, and information flowing to you from diverse sources. I encourage people to be in coaching groups and mastermind groups, ours or others, with forward-thinking, forward-looking, flexible, innovative, and successful entrepreneurs in varied fields, not just their own.
 Most entrepreneurs seem to operate as if Amish, locked away in a closed society. It’s very, very hard to attract wealth working in a vacuum.

## “But My Product IS Ordinary. It IS A
 Commodity.”

#### Want my advice about that? If your product is ordinary, is a commodity, I suggest you just go off into the woods, deep into the woods, find an isolated place, sit, and meditate until life gently slips away and you are liberated from the torture of your banal existence by eternal rest. Or eaten by a bear.

 I stopped adding to it years ago—the list of excuses/reasons why people can’t use “my kind of” marketing, why they can’t find anything interesting to say about their products or businesses, why they can’t come up with a USP, why their business is, in fact, a commodity business and thus they must sell by price, etc. Before I stopped, the list was up over 100 excuses for being boring and failing to capture customers’ imaginations. Well, I wonder if anything might be more of an ordinary commodity than a man’s shirt. Most men don’t like to shop and aren’t that particular—a shirt’s a shirt. Reading the new biography of Ogilvy sent me digging through all my Ogilvy files, which led me to Twitchell’s book 20 Ads That Shook The World and in turn to the ad by Ogilvy from 1951, one of an entire series of ads featuring his fictitious character The Baron (actor/model George Wrangell), the iconic man with the eye patch, wearing the Hathaway shirt. Just as the real Bond would never drink a martini stirred, not shaken, the Baron wouldn’t be caught dead in any but a Hathaway shirt. Of course, a shirt is a shirt, but, to quote Twitchell, when you cannot change what the product is, you have to change what it means.

 In this case, this shirt, the only shirt acceptable to the man in the eye patch, The Baron, was made to mean intrigue and sophistication. At the time—and I suppose still—women bought most of the men’s dress shirts, so Ogilvy’s man had to appeal to women, while also appealing differently to the 50+ executive wearing plain dress shirts for business. Ogilvy found George

-----

#### Wrangell, an occasional actor, and a real baron, a Russian, married into money. Ogilvy admits the eyepatch idea may have been suggested by the Hathaway company’s CEO’s wife, but rejected as too subtle and odd. Then on the way to the photo studio, he ducked into a drug store and bought one for $1.50, took it to the photo shoot, tried it, and decided to run with it after all. Stuck with a stone that could not be romanced—the basic white dress shirt, a staple of its time—Ogilvy focused instead on the man wearing the shirt as aspirational symbol.

 These ads ran—incredibly—from 1951 to 1990 (39 years!!!) invigorating the moribund, lackluster Hathaway brand and making the company millions of dollars. Subsequent ads developed the Baron’s character just as much but with mystery intact, and showed him in incredible scenes—conducting the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall, fencing, sail-boating, and even—humorously— driving a tractor (a nod to Ogilvy’s stint as a farmer), all the while wearing the perfectly pressed dress shirt.

 If Ogilvy had followed the typical ad style of the ’50s, the full-page ads would have shown the shirt—or his man in the shirt—with barely a line or two of copy beneath. But Ogilvy devoutly believed in (relatively) long copy no matter the product, thus brilliant copy like this:

 American men are beginning to realize it is ridiculous to buy good suits and then spoil the effect by wearing an ordinary, mass-produced shirt. Hence the growing popularity of Hathaway shirts which are in a class by themselves.

 Of course, American men weren’t “beginning to realize” anything of the sort until the ad suggested it. But that laid the foundation for the important rationale for this product—not spoiling the effect of the business suit. Oh, and who the devil says “hence,” even in 1950? Nobody. But throughout this copy, antiquated language was used to deliberately sound “high-brow,” to match the mysterious, obviously sophisticated fellow with the eye patch. In the descriptive copy about the shirt that follows, he even claims the shirt’s stitching

#### has “an antebellum elegance about it.” What does that mean? Who knows? Who knew? The pitch concludes with:

 You get a great deal of quiet satisfaction out of wearing shirts which are in such impeccable taste.

 The entire ad has over 230 words of copy, for a dress shirt sold at the department store.

 Now, today, circa 2009, what Ogilvy did for this shirt is more important than ever. Consumers have more choices in every category. Recession-Think has made them much more reluctant to waste their money on anything ordinary, mundane, or unnecessary. The internet has served as a commoditizing force affecting almost every product and service category. If you insist on presenting your business, products, and services as incrementally better options within a range of ordinary and insist on selling with features and benefits (rather than transcending them), you will struggle mightily in The New Economy. My adaptation of Ogilvy’s principles behind advertising like that done for Hathaway is that your business must be about something (other than selling things), about something profoundly meaningful to its clientele. In these times, that needs sharpening all the more. And just who the heck says “all the more”? No one. But me. I tried wearing an eye patch, too, but I kept bumping into things and missing my mouth with my spoon.

 No Boundaries

#### I f you are my age, 50+, or even 40+, may be even 30+, you are very likely to think provincially. You will have a preference for doing business with vendors within easy driving distance. If you own a local business, you will think mostly about local marketing to local customers. If you are under the age of 35, you will have grown up with the internet and that alone will have given you a very different viewpoint. Because I gravitated to what was then called “mail-order,” and I never had a brickand-mortar-only business, I never thought locally. On the other hand, though, because of my age, it’s still more natural for me to think provincially than globally.
 There are no geographic boundaries for wealth attraction. And most businesses can and should be enlarged and expanded to national or international scope. This is easy to understand in businesses like mine; information businesses. We can deliver a newsletter anywhere. The internet has accelerated and eased the global spreading of my persona and
