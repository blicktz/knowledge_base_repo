Rather a grandiose way to describe an amusement park, don’t you think? But that’s the point. Walt Disney and Hugh Hefner both saw and spoke of significance and importance in what they were doing that went far beyond the basic products and deliverables of their businesses. One more from Walt: “Since the beginning of mankind, the fable-tellers have not only given us entertainment, but a window to wisdom, a way to understanding.” Whether you agree with them or not, these men who built great brands believed they were doing something important.
 • Personality-driven brand. Walt was as much the public face of the
 Disney enterprises as was his creation Mickey. He began promoting Disneyland by hosting a show on ABC, and remained a familiar TV host for many years. The public came to know, admire, and love Walt, and masses wept and mourned the day of his death. He was the company’s chief storyteller and salesman. Hugh Hefner used his own TV show early, purportedly a party in his own penthouse living quarters, with his celebrity buddies all there having a good time. Very recently, after decades, he was seen again starring, with his girlfriends, at the Mansion, in a reality TV series. The two individuals and these two brands, inseparable.
 • Cast of characters. Walt and Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Goofy, as well
 as Snow White, Cinderella, Mary Poppins, and the more contemporary Nemo, Belle, and The Beast, etc. Hefner with the Playboy bunnies, the Playmates of the Months, Playmates of the Years, his girlfriends, his celebrity friends. When the Disney company acquired Marvel, its CEO, Bob Iger, said, “You can never


-----

###### have too many good characters.” Hefner has felt the same way about girlfriends.
 • Place. The Disney Parks with Cinderella’s Castle as centerpoint. The
 Playboy Mansion, with its infamous Grotto as its centerpoint. Both sites have a “Fantasyland”!
 • Product as Promotion. For Disney, it began with a licensed Mickey
 Mouse watch and a Disney train, both products credited with rescuing the companies involved from financial struggle. Disney, of course, has become a licensing juggernaut, with its characters and iconic images on hundreds of thousands of products. The Playboy bunny logo is one of the most licensed trademarks of any, of all time, for apparel, cologne, artwork, etc., and just like Mickey and Minnie, caricatures of Playboy bunnies have made their way to statues, dolls, posters, apparel, even custom motorcycles. All this proliferate product not only generates revenues, but it works at promoting and creating and sustaining interest in the brand.
 • Media. Walt Disney literally launched Disneyland with what he first
 considered an unholy alliance with ABC—now Disney owns them, along with ESPN and several Disney-branded cable TV channels and Disney radio stations, but, also, still airs Disney parades and specials on ABC, each an infomercial for the parks, current Disney personalities, and new movies. Hugh Hefner began with his own media, Playboy magazine, but, as noted, promoted Playboy early with TV. To this day, he still uses such media plays—in recent years, there was one reality show, and briefly two, on the E Network, all about the Mansion and his girlfriends. There was a feature film, in 2008, The House Bunny. It was produced by Adam Sandler’s company, Happy Madison, and included stars like Emma Stone, Anna Faris, and Colin Hanks. It debuted at number one at the U.S. box office its first week, number one in the U.K., but ultimately managed just $70 million gross against a $22 million production budget—and it was savaged by critics. Regardless of critics’ opinions or level of success, all these serve as powerful infomercials for the brand, yet Playboy has been paid for them rather than buying advertising. Its own cable TV channel is also both a business itself and continuous, 365-day brand promotion.

##### I’ve Followed the Disney/Hefner Model and You Can, Too

###### Looping back, consider how these two men launched and built their brands. They never spent or had to spend on dopey image advertising. Their brands were built by their own media products and businesses, by profitable advertising selling their products, by stealth advertising imbedded in TV programming they were paid to produce and provide or paid licensing fees for, and by an untold variety of merchandise proliferating in the marketplace, for which they were also paid licensing fees.
 In much the same way, I have built my brands. I have never once spent a nickel on a “Who Is Dan Kennedy?” or “What Is GKIC?” brand/image advertisement. I have been paid to build my business and my brand, in cash —as with book royalties, article fees, revenue from info-products, speaking fees, and on-site info-product sales at speaking appearances, etc., or in free advertising—as with products featured in others’ catalogs, syndicated articles published in niche industry leaders’ newsletters, being interviewed on countless business-thought leaders’ audio programs and tele-seminars, and book tours paid for by corporate sponsors. Through these means, I reach more than one million business owners a year without a penny of out- of-pocket investment. I have also baked in every other strategy shared by Disney and Playboy described in this chapter.
 Martha Stewart is another example of someone who built a powerful and valuable brand from which she has extracted many, many millions of dollars, using fundamentally this same approach, and Rachael Ray has closely followed her model. Incredibly, Martha Stewart’s company has failed to turn a profit for the past six years, and there’s a cautionary tale there for another place and time, but she has personally amassed considerable wealth. And her personal brand had such a strong and passionate following even a stint in federal prison failed to dent her popularity.
 If you have a small, local business you may too quickly disqualify yourself and think that this is above and beyond you. There are two things to consider about that. One is that everybody started and starts somewhere, often small and local. Disneyland was, after all, a local business, and central Florida was picked as the second location based on the population within one day’s driving distance. There was no thought initially of global


-----

###### domination. Hefner began in Chicago, his office in his apartment, his magazine assembled atop his bed, and then with one local Playboy Club. Also, these days, geographic boundaries have been blurred and expanded if not erased by ecommerce and overnight shipping. A local gourmet cupcake store in Hudson, Ohio, has customers in 40 states and 9 countries. A clothier’s shop in London, England, Charles Tyrwhitt, mails catalogs throughout the U.S.—including to me, and ships shirts and ties worldwide. Why must you think small?

 Building Bonfires

 The old joke about there being no such thing as bad publicity is no longer universally true. For celebrities, it’s a very unpredictable thing. Celebrity cook Paula Deen’s publicized use of the “N word” seems, as of this writing, to have severely damaged her brand and business and set endorsers fleeing, but it did also, immediately, spark a huge surge of

###### purchases of her cookbooks at Amazon. Tiger Woods similarly saw his sponsors withdraw en masse, but it appears, at this point, that he may yet be resurrected as a commercial spokesperson. I’ll court danger by saying so, but overall, painting with broad brush, it’s my observation that the media is more eagerly forgiving of black celebrities’ controversial statements and bad behavior than they are of white celebrities who get into similar difficulty. For companies, controversy and/or bad news and bad press can be even more dangerous, yet many brands are surprisingly resilient, and many even benefit from dynamite exploding in their hands.
 One thing that the internet has created, that’s important to understand, is a remaking of publicity, media exposure, public discussion, and gossip as direct-response marketing, because it’s easy for interested people to find you. It’s very easy, for example, to find me, if anything seen or read or heard anywhere piques your curiosity. You just type my name into Google. Or Amazon. Or Facebook. Before the internet, this was not the case. Guests on talk shows, for example, had to fight to get an 800 number given out, and were often denied that opportunity. If you were interviewed and included in a magazine article, there was no easy way for readers to locate you or contact you. They might go to a store and ask about your product, but if it wasn’t there, that ended that. They might go to a bookstore, but if you weren’t the author of a book currently in print, that ended that. Today, you are essentially walking, talking direct-response media. Even a brief mention of your brand in the media can send people on an immediately fruitful search of you. If, for example, there was no contact information of any kind provided in this book for Nick Nanton, but a few sentences I wrote about him interested you, how hard would it be for you to find him and his company online? It takes me longer to microwave my morning cup of coffee.
 With this in mind, it’s vital to understand direct-response and direct- marketing funnels, so that when people do find you on their own, by whatever provocation, or none but organic search, the trail leads them to and through a door, onto a pathway with high walls on either side, to a series of yes/no actions, ultimately converting them to viable prospects and the highest percentage of them possible to customers. Traffic and visitor counts are, frankly, B.S., flung about by fools and social media promoters and charlatans like monkeys at the zoo fling feces. It’s meaningless. Only


-----

###### traffic converted to prospects and customers, converted to sales and profits count. Be very wary of all the “new metrics” gobbledygook. There’s no line for it on a bank deposit slip. If the construction of marketing funnels for lead capture and conversion is foreign to you, it will very quickly be made clear when you accept my free offer on page 261.
 Also, with this in mind, it’s important to understand that there are no longer any protective walls around your brand. It is exposed 24/7/365. And the impact of whatever is said or happens is instant and may spread at the speed of light. There is no news cycle anymore. There’s just news now. You can manipulate and use the talk about you more aggressively than ever before. You can also be damaged by it more harshly and more quickly than ever before.
 Brand protection includes internal law enforcement. My book, No B.S. Guide to Ruthless Management of People and Profits, is the bluntest, toughest instruction manual for brand protection from the inside out ever written by anybody. In it, for example, I recommend full audio and video surveillance of every person who interacts with customers in every place they interact with customers, frequent “mystery shopping” of the answering of your phones, carefully constructed scripts and enforcement of their use, rapid-fire response to mistakes and consumer dissatisfaction, firing fast and hiring slow, and other important measures to protect profit margins and to protect brand. This is the part of business ownership and management people like the least, fear the most, and do the worst. From a brand-equity standpoint, any problem or problem employee not nipped in the bud can bring the entire enterprise to disaster.
 The more successful and visible you are, the more important this is. If you focus on brand-building but neglect brand protection, you will likely see, at some point, all your good efforts and investment turn to ruin.
 With these cautionary notes made, let’s take a look at how we might build your brand with new followers or with loyalists, by taking risks and playing with fire. After all, doesn’t fortune favor the bold?

##### Your Brand and Controversy: Dare You Brand-Build by Being
 for or Against a Mainstream Issue?


-----

###### In July 2012, the president of the Chick-fil-A fast-food chain told a Christian publication, The Biblical Reporter, that the company and its brand “supports the biblical definition of the family unit.” A direct answer to a direct question by a writer for a relatively obscure news outlet made its way into the mainstream, and a major uproar ensued. The mayor of Chicago suggested that the company would not be welcomed if opening restaurants in the city. Liberal TV media like MSNBC attacked the company as bigoted and questioned whether or not its leaders’ religious beliefs were creating a hostile workplace or workplace discrimination. A boycott was promoted. But on the flip side, Chick-fil-A brand loyalists and evangelical Christian groups rushed to the company’s defense, organized “support days” at the restaurants, and overall, the company saw a year-to-year revenue increase from $4 billion to $4.6 billion. It isn’t easy to get that kind of sales boost through regular advertising and growth. Much of it came directly from the heightened visibility and public conversation about the chain, and from the invigorated support of its customer base. If there is any lasting brand damage, it’s invisible to me.
 For the record, their position was no surprise. This is a company very well-known for closing its stores, even its stores inside malls, on Sunday to celebrate the Sabbath, and for beginning all its business meetings with prayer. Thinking they might be in favor of or even neutral about gay marriage is like thinking the Clint Eastwood movie character “Dirty Harry” might be worried over the difficult childhood of a criminal he cornered in an alley. Still, this rather trivial remark became a Major News Media Event, extended over several weeks, and organized warring groups lined up across from each other in Chick-fil-A parking lots and, more so, all over social media. When all the feathers settled, the net result was a substantial sales increase and a cementing of bond between the brand and its base.
 On the other side of this same controversial issue, Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, received applause at the annual shareholders meeting in 2013 when he stated his and the company’s unwavering support for same- sex marriage, reinforcing the company’s already announced advocacy for same-sex marriage legislation dating to January 2012. That created a much smaller media firestorm and far less mainstream media criticism than did Chick-fil-A’s opposing stand, but it did spark an organized “Dump Starbucks” boycott promoted by the National Organization for Marriage.
