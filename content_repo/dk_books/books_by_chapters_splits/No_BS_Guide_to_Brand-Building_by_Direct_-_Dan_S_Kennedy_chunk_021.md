###### An enewsletter is cheap, sure, but it is so much harder to consume a large amount of information. If you insist on doing an enewsletter, do it, but also do the printed version. The printed newsletter is the best way to build valuable relationships. Try sending your mother an e-birthday card and see how that goes for you.
 Here is an example of a cover story for my newsletter, featuring a story of my wife and daughter Bailey’s experience with an auto accident. (See Figure 13.2 on page 138.) The story includes a picture of Vanessa and Bailey with the damaged SUV that hooks the reader. I then pivot to “. . . if you happen to be involved in an auto accident here are the five things you must do.” I could easily have written an article about those five things as laid out on home office boring brochures. Vanessa’s story is real with photo as proof and demonstrates how accidents can happen to anyone. No faceless corporation or clever caveman ad can compete with these real world experiences in my customer newsletter each month.
 We also have a done-for-you newsletter program for insurance agency owners. More info at www.bgimarketing.com.

**DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: Bill’s choice is a vital one. There are two ways to**
present useful information like “The 5 Things To Do If Involved In A Car Accident”: his way
or in a simple, straightforward, factual, and instructional way, as most big companies would
do, probably in a marketing piece plastered with corporate logo. That has two chief
drawbacks. One, any company can do the very same thing. It is generic information. Two,
maybe more importantly, it’s boring. I teach that the ultimate marketing sin is being boring. So
Bill’s way, engaging the consumer/reader with a first-person, personal story, then gradually
segueing to the instructional information, serves to make it proprietary and interesting.
Fortunately, there is no law that dictates, if you have a brand, or operate under the umbrella of
a brand, you must make it the focal point of everything you do.


##### Author a Book

###### If the customer newsletter is the most powerful relationship-building tool, your book is the ultimate positioning tool that elevates you miles above your competition.
 A couple of books I authored and used in my insurance agency were written for a specific audience for a very specific purpose. My first book, A Business Success Journal, which I co-authored, was written for business owners to help launch and grow my referral rewards program. I made this book readily available as gifts to my commercial insurance business owner customers and my COI businesses.
 My main COIs are mortgage brokers, realtors, and various dealerships selling automobiles, boats, mobile homes, and motorcycles. All of these businesses have weekly meetings. I would just call and get on the agenda for five to ten minutes, give them some helpful info about how we could serve them, and gift them my book. The “Wow” factor of the book was the unique positioning I had over every competitor in the marketplace. I must be an expert, right? I wrote this book on success, and I’m offering to serve them with helpful information that can help their business with a little implementation.
 My next book I authored and published myself, Informed and Insured: Everything You Need To Know About Insurance Before You Pay Your Next Premium. It was written for anyone that needs personal insurance, including auto, home, life, and personal recreational vehicles. The purpose of the book is to provide very helpful information for buying personal lines of

###### Informed and Insured suggests using a trusted insurance advisor, not a policy peddler, and who better to help than an author of the book on how to successfully buy personal lines of insurance.
 A book makes a very powerful offer for your direct-response advertising and marketing. We use it constantly in print media, direct mail, email marketing, social media, customer newsletter, and live radio ads.

###### Authorship may seem like a Herculean task. It sure did to me when I first thought of the idea. Basically, I just wrote out the information I constantly share with my customers, prospects, and COIs. I’m not saying it’s easy, because it is not, but getting your content on paper that you deliver on a regular basis is not that difficult. If you are an insurance agency owner or work in an agency, you may qualify to buy the authorship rights to Informed and Insured. You can refer to our website for more information.
 Above are the covers of my two books written for two very different audiences, one for business owners and one for the personal lines insurance buying public. (See Figure 13.3.) Both of these books serve my business well.

##### Free-Standing Newspaper Insert


-----

###### One of the best ways to really stand out in your local market is the use of newspaper inserts. Most newspapers allow you to target certain ZIP codes if you wish, and in my experience the rates are much better than regular newspaper ads.
 Figures 13.4A and 13.4B on pages 143 and 144 are great examples of one of my BGI Elite Mastermind Members using a direct-response ad with a great offer on the front and leveraging the power of the Allstate Insurance Brand on the back. Allstate will even pay for half of this ad because it is one of their co-op approved advertisements.


**DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: One side of this FSI uses an ad created and provided**
by Allstate, and, frankly, it is fairly typical corporate brand advertising. I judge it mediocre and
ordinary at best. But combined with the other side that Jason created, a great direct-response
ad with all the right direct-response elements*, he gets the best of both worlds: the umbrella of
the known and trusted Allstate brand, the effectiveness of direct response. This is a terrific
example of marrying brand and DR. (*The elements used here are benefit-driven headline;
breaking news [first paragraph]; guarantee; testimonials; offer with deadline.)


##### Like All Marriages, There’s Give ’n Take and Tension

###### The marriages of a big, corporate brand and a local business brand with aggressive direct-response marketing hasn’t been a simple or easy one. It has its times and places of conflict. They don’t go together like peas in a pod. As you can hopefully see from the results I’ve shared here, it’s definitely worth the trouble! I can say with rock-solid certainty that I would not have reached the pinnacle of success within the Allstate agency community if I had simply relied on the power of the Allstate brand and their advertising to carry me. I can assure you, I would not have made as good an income or created as much equity in my agency if I hadn’t built my own, local brand, The All-American Agency, as well as my personal brand. As I’ve explained, I would never have achieved anything close to what I have by depending on brand and image marketing. Injecting direct-response advertising into both the upfront attraction of new clients and the back-end retention of clients and mobilizing my referral armies was the rocket fuel.

#### CHAPTER 14


## How to Meld Mass Media
 and Direct Media

###### by Nick Nanton and J.W. Dicks, Celebrity Branding
 Agency


###### o set out to create and build a brand, to make a brand meaningful and valuable, or to leverage and profit from an established brand— whether one that is personal, corporate, or attached to a product

# T

###### either local or global—you must gain access to media and know how to use it to your advantage.
 Imagine a new movie studio starting up with modest means. Anxious to get off on the right foot, they put every dollar into making the most amazing feature film anyone has ever seen.
 Note two critical words in that last sentence: “every dollar.” Because when the studio finishes this amazing movie, they have no money left to


-----

###### market it. They can’t get anyone to see it because they don’t have any funds to tell anyone about it.
 Anxious not to repeat that mistake, they raise more money and put a bundle into hiring the best movie marketing company in the country to sell their next very modestly budgeted film. The marketing company delivers to them an incredibly impactful film trailer and a series of exciting TV commercials that make this movie feel like a “Have to See” event.
 Except, again, they’ve spent everything. Now they have no money to do any publicity—which means they can’t afford to get the movie’s stars to do the critical media events—such as the all-important press junkets and appearances on entertainment news shows and late-night talk shows—that establish awareness and credibility for the film. They also don’t have the funds to hold screenings for important media critics, create press releases that talk about the film’s unique qualities, or create a killer social media presence that could drive the movie into blockbuster territory. All they have is a bunch of commercials that people may or may not see.
 The moral of this story? Simple. There is no one success ingredient that can stand alone. Even a studio with a great brand, say Disney, can make two films—each with its own brand, say, Iron Man and The Lone Ranger—and get two very different outcomes. Brand is no assurance of success. We believe there are three critical success factors that must be given: attention, energy, and investment. We call this the Business Trifecta. If you wager on the Trifecta at a racetrack—Dan Kennedy’s second home—you have to get all three of the top-finishing horses, first, second, and third, on the same ticket from a single bet, and if you do, you usually get a big payoff. But two out of three pays zero. As does one out of three.
 The fact is that you can’t properly build your brand or grow your business without employing what we call the Business Trifecta—the unbeatable combination of media, marketing, and PR that creates visibility, establishes credibility, and effectively sells who you are and what you do. If you’re missing any component of that trifecta—well, it’s kind of like trying to sit on a three-legged stool with one leg missing. At some point, you’re going to wind up on the floor!
 At the Dicks + Nanton Celebrity Branding Agency, we’re very strong believers in using storytelling—or what we call “StorySelling™”—to really


-----

###### build your branding power. We’ve seen the amazing results it brings. But those results only come from using the Business Trifecta to tell your brand story in the proper way and with the necessary impact.
 To better understand how the Business Trifecta combines to powerfully
 StorySell[™], we should first talk about each of its “legs”—and what each of them contributes to the trifecta. We’ll start, naturally, with the first leg . . .

##### Successful Use of MEDIA

###### Most entrepreneurs and professionals create their own media to tell their own story—or they use an outside agency such as ours to do the job for them. That media can be in the form of a branded film, a book, an audio CD, a special report, and so forth.
 This kind of media is usually not a client’s main business, even though media can be sold just like any informational product. For instance, a tax specialist could write a book on tax secrets. That book could then be sold on Amazon, even though the specialist’s main business is, obviously, helping his or her own clients with their tax issues. The book serves as an indirect advertisement for the specialist, who positions himself as an expert in how to pay the least amount of taxes possible.
 Of course, it’s sometimes more worthwhile to give the media away for free to generate leads, establish expertise, and grab contact info for future marketing. Downloadable information on company websites that require an email entry for access to that kind of media is a prime example.
 We also place our clients in such nationally recognized media outlets as CBS, ABC, and NBC TV affiliates, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, etc. These kinds of “Big Media” appearances are enormously important to establishing credibility; not everybody shows up in USA Today, after all!
 There is a strong afterglow to these kinds of media appearances and mentions. The “As Seen On” and “As Seen In” credits have life long after the day of the paragraph’s publication or the minutes of air time occurred. We have a system for guaranteeing our clients these media appearances and mentions, to get these credits, and usually to get them in a hurry. It is certainly possible, though, to make their pursuit a do-it-yourself


-----

###### proposition. Because media appearances tend to create more media interest, a snowball effect can occur.
 Whatever media you choose to work with, it’s important, from our viewpoint, to always provide some kind of value to the viewer/reader/listener. You should either be providing valuable information or just telling a great story about yourself and your business that people will love to hear. Whatever your creative approach, the presentation of the media and the packaging can be the first step in establishing the critical elements of credibility and trust. It doesn’t have to be a high-class Hollywood production, but it does have to feel authentic and demonstrate your expertise.
 But no matter how good your media is, you also need . . .

##### Successful Use of PR

###### Let’s say your media efforts go so well that you end up being interviewed on a popular national show, such as Good Morning America. Well, even though you’ve made an amazing media breakthrough with that appearance, to most people out there you’re just a five-minute segment that goes by and disappears forever . . . unless you use PR to keep the excitement humming.
 PR, or public relations, is all about creating awareness. You know the age-old question: If a tree falls in a forest and nobody’s around, does it make a sound? Well, PR doesn’t really care about the answer to that question—it just wants to make sure somebody is around to hear when that tree hits the ground.
 There are basically two types of PR—pre-PR and post-PR. Pre-PR is the classic form of public relations, when you announce something that is about to happen and hope that you get coverage and attention. For example, you might want to promote the fact that you’re going to be on Good Morning America. Or that you’re about to open another office location, made a major hire, or are expanding your products or services into new territory. It could be a personal achievement, such as receiving an honorary doctorate or being honored as “Business of the Year” at the local Rotary Club. Whatever the topic, it should be something that justifies a press
