###### around a leg thinks he’s found a gigantic tree trunk. The one touching the trunk thinks he’s got the tail of a King Kong-size horse. And so on.
 Let’s be sure you’re not blindfolded, groping, and guessing. A presentation is, above all else, a means to an end. For businesspeople and sales professionals, it can be the equivalent of other advertising media used to establish brand identity, consumer awareness, or more directly, to attract and acquire customers. It can be a means of making an actual sale, whether one-to-one or one-to-many. But it is not anything unique. It is a means to an end in the same way an airplane flight is a means of getting to a destination or a shovel is a means of getting a hole dug. Don’t assign any uniqueness or mysticism to it.
 Because it is a means to an end, the desired outcome has to govern everything leading up to that desired outcome. You start with the outcome in mind, and you never start crafting a presentation without the end in mind.


-----

###### It may or may not surprise you that many people err with this. They begin at the beginning. They have some opportunity arise to make a presentation, or they have the notion of giving presentations for their business, and they dive into crafting the presentation. How to open? What stories or jokes to tell? What information to dispense? The right place to start is with the desired outcome. These other questions then become: How should I open the presentation in a way that sets up and facilitates my desired outcome? What stories should I tell that set up and facilitate the desired outcome?
 If you are crafting a presentation for a specific purpose, to achieve a specific desired outcome, you are deprived of creative liberty. You are not an artist, free to throw any color paint you like in any pattern or arrangement you like onto a blank canvas. You do not get to choose your opening remarks, your stories, your jokes, your key points, your information, or the order it all gets put into. You relinquish all that liberty to your desired outcome.
 I come from a background in advertising. Civilians and amateurs mistakenly think of advertising as a creative exercise, and I initially imagined that this was the case. In the advertising industry, peer-to-peer awards are often given to the most creative ads. But this is not the reality of good advertising at all. One of the all-time legendary leaders of the advertising world, David Ogilvy, said, “In advertising, creativity is what sells.” I carried this with me into my speaking and my crafting of presentations. For me, a great presentation was and is, by definition, one that successfully sells. Every item and element in a great presentation is put there because it serves and facilitates that purpose. Because of that, a favorite story I love to tell and tell well is ruled out, and a different one I have no fondness for gets in. So it is with every line, every sentence, every idea, every story included in a presentation. This is a strict and rigid discipline.
 A lot of people underestimate the value of discipline. For several years, on a multicity pubic seminar tour, the speaker preceding me was General Norman Schwarzkopf, made famous by directing Desert Storm, our march through Iraq to rescue Kuwait, under the first President Bush. Norm had a line: “Shined shoes save lives.” By that, he meant that getting soldiers to be very disciplined about seemingly small things like having perfectly shined shoes every morning automatically carried over to being disciplined about


-----

###### big things, in the heat of battle, with bullets flying and bombs dropping all around them. I think a lot of people are worried and nervous about delivering a presentation to an audience and can be easily thrown off their game while presenting because there wasn’t enough discipline about the crafting of the presentation to start with. They aren’t confident in presenting because they lack confidence in their presentation. The more disciplined you are in your defining of presentation, and the preparation of your presentation, the better off you’ll be when out there with bullets flying.
 By common dictionary definition and thesaurus synonyms, a presentation can be a formal or official proffer of idea, information, or proposal for consideration; a demonstration; a performance. The best ones are all three of these things. A great presentation includes a specific proposition for which acceptance, agreement, and often, a purchase is asked for and obtained. That is the outcome governing everything. Very often, a great presentation includes some physical or evidentiary, even dramatic, demonstration that facilitates the audience’s acceptance of the proposition, and every great presentation is delivered as a great performance. It is never just what is said, but also how it is said. With TV infomercials, I always test them with the sound muted; what “sense of this” is the audience getting just from the facial expressions, gestures, body language, and actions of the performers, making its way into their subconscious by visual intake, absent the words?
 A maximum-effectiveness presentation is not just a means of conveying or communicating ideas or information, unless you are being paid as a professor or schoolteacher in a classroom. For our purposes, it is a means of seeking and hopefully gaining acceptance and agreement for ideas or information conveyed by it, leading to a purchase or other specific action. I would add, teachers who only convey ideas and information are relatively poorly paid, especially if compared to people who craft and deliver presentations that persuade people to buy.
 The upshot of all this is that a maximum-effectiveness presentation is a purposed thing; that is far more scientific than it is creative. You might think of it as analogical to the blueprints prepared by an architect. There is a creative aspect to being an architect. But the blueprints ultimately have to be used to construct a house, and to wind up with a house that “works” for people who are going to live in it. The roof can’t be designed so creatively


-----

###### that it leaks in every corner. The architect is severely limited in how he can indulge his creative impulses and preferences—by the practical purpose that must be achieved and by his client. In crafting a presentation, your client and your practical purpose are one and the same: the desired outcome.
 In simple terms, this is more a pragmatic exercise than it is a creative one.
 This gets us to formula. Most disciplined, pragmatic activities have formulas. Architects, scientists, even novelists approach their work by formulas. It is very useful to do so. If, for example, I give you the task of making up and writing or telling a “great story,” and turn you loose to do so, it’s going to be very difficult to do. You’ll probably draw on some personal experience or memory or that of somebody you know, but you might, instead, make one up out of pure imagination. Or you might “borrow” a classic fairy tale or novel’s plot and try altering it enough to disguise the plagiarism. You’ll make random decisions about the order of things in the story. You’ll be at sea without navigation. But if I give you a copy of the book The Writer’s Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers by Christopher Vogler, you’ll have a formula, a structure, and an architecture for your entire story and for what writers call “the hero’s journey.” This alone will make your task infinitely easier.
 Admittedly, this replaces true, pure art with paint-by-numbers, but it is important to remember that you are not an artist. You surrender your creative impulses to the desired outcome, and that makes paint-by-numbers very valuable and efficient. If you are going to become a master storyteller and a professional writer of presentations and a professional speaker, you will want to study these subjects in great depth and transcend paint-by- numbers and rigid formulas. By all means do so. I do not just own the above-referenced book on story structure and storytelling; I own, have studied, and frequently return to over 100 books just on that aspect of writing. But I do this as my chief occupation and have for 40 years. If you have another business—your insurance agency, your restaurant, your health-care practice—and you are using presentations as ad media, sales media, and promotional or public relations activities, you need a more serviceable approach.

###### In the next chapter, Dave VanHoose lays out the formula for crafting presentations that he and Dustin use most with clients in diverse businesses. It is, by its standardization, rigid, even arbitrarily rigid—very much a paint- by-numbers process. It is not the only way to craft presentations; it is easy and natural to argue against such rigidity. Yet it is that “one way” rigidity that provides high reliability.
 That is, for me, and probably for you, the final defining point about a presentation: reliability. We want a presentation that produces its desired outcome within a small and tolerable range of variability, every time, every place, with every audience.

### The Speakers’ Formula[™]

###### by Dave VanHoose

 here are certain things everybody needs to own.
 Every man should own a navy blue blazer. If you have an empty closet and hire a dress-for-success expert or a clothier or other knowledgeable advisor, one of the first things they’ll have

###### There are a lot of accepted necessities. Toothpaste comes to mind. Participating in civilized society has certain required necessities—for men, pants. What a lot of people don’t understand is that success has certain required necessities, too.
 We put together this book because all three of us believe that owning at least one highly effective presentation is a success essential, owning more than one—possibly for different media—is better, and owning the ability to craft additional ones as needed is best.
 Everybody should own a Signature Presentation, which, at Speaking Empire, we sometimes call your Stadium Presentation, in tribute to the seating in that classroom my partner Dustin ran from.
 This is a message that works for you no matter when, where, or how you share it—speaking, in a webcast or webinar, facing one person across a

###### desk or 100 people from a stage. This becomes the core of any and every presentation you deliver. Our friend and co-author here, Dan Kennedy, has a portfolio of speeches about his Magnetic Marketing® system. They are 60, 75, 90, and 120 minutes in length. There is a generic one for audiences of varied kinds of business owners and salespeople, specific ones for single professions or businesses or sales groups—for real estate agents or for financial advisors, for example—and adaptations for delivery by other presenters such as GKIC.com’s Certified Magnetic Marketing® Advisors, for video sales letters delivered online, and for sales letters delivered by mail (see https://GKIC.com). In all of these, the core is the same. Usually, we discover that our new clients lack clarity and certainty about their core, and this is one of the important things we help them work out.
 Here’s how I started learning the importance of this: When I started my first business, I believed it had to thrive and would be the most incredible business. With it, I was going to help people save time, energy, and money. What could be more attractive than that? So, like many startup entrepreneurs, I pulled out my credit cards and launched my business with a pile of personal debt. Guess how many customers flocked to me the first month? Right. Zero. Of course, I thought that I had such a great idea, the customers would come. A little panicked, I resorted to desperate and frenzied activity, with what I call the Six-Foot Rule: If anybody was within six feet of me, I tried to sell them. I quickly realized that selling to one person at a time, one after the other, with a high percentage rejecting me for one reason or excuse or another, was going to be incredibly difficult. It was inefficient. There was only one of me, and I could run only so fast, work so hard, and take so much rebuffing. I now know, by the way, that this causes a lot of people who enter various kinds of selling businesses or careers to fail, unnecessarily.

 Since there was just one of me and a whole lot of them to sort through, to get a customer, I asked myself: why am I speaking to them one at a time? Why don’t I speak to a bunch of them together, at one time? This is now often called “one-to-many selling.”

 I put together my first audience of prospects in the back room at a Denny’s. I invited many, 12 showed up, I sold to 20% of them right then


-----

###### and there, and made about $2,000.00. It blew my mind. I might have sold to the same 20% meeting with each of the 12 one at a time, over coffee in a booth at that same Denny’s, but it would have taken 12 hours instead of 2, I’d have been personally confronted and fatigued by each of the no’s, and I’d have owed the waitress rent! Or I might not have even sold to 20%, because there is a group dynamic that helps sales, that never exists in person-to-person selling. From that point on, I concentrated on selling to groups, and for a while, I was speaking at a lunch and at a dinner every day, five days a week.
 I was selling, right then and there. A lot of people we help with presentations are, instead, only selling follow-up, one-on-one appointments —like a dentist doing a seminar for invited patients about implants in his office, a CPA doing a lunch presentation for invited small-business owners about cutting taxes, or a travel agent speaking at a civic club about cruise vacations. It doesn’t matter. The process is pretty much the same, and the benefits are absolutely the same.
 The key is the Signature Presentation. If it works, you can do just about anything. You can switch from slow and frustrating one-to-one selling to efficient group selling, in your own office, in a restaurant’s back room, once a month or twice a day.
 Within three years of starting my first business with my credit cards,
 this switch in the way I sold made it the 35[th] fastest growing private company in America, placing on the Inc. 500 List!
 Over time, at Speaking Empire, we have “locked in” a formula for these kinds of Signature Presentations, evolved from the one I used initially in the back room at Denny’s. From acorns mighty oak trees grow!
 As you can see in Figure 5.1, page 31, this Speaker’s Formula[™]
 organizes your presentation into 12 component parts, in a particular order. I say: Success loves sequence. There are, of course, any number of ways a top pro speaker might rearrange these components and add to or subtract from them, creating his own, preferred presentation sequence. Maybe with good reason. If you are not that top pro, rich with successful experience at crafting powerful presentations, I urge sticking with this Formula. Let’s talk a little about each component . . .


-----

##### 1: Grab Attention

###### When most people get up on stage, make a video, or hold a webinar, they talk at people. That’s a pushing energy. It actually pushes people away. It is better to draw them toward and into your presentation so that they give you their attention and get interested in what you have to say. A compelling emotional or dramatic story can do this. This can tie to your reason for making your presentation and for being in the business or for selling the product you are selling. A set of provocative questions is another approach. A set of specific, intriguing promises is yet another. One way or another, the first block of your presentation needs to be about getting and holding attention.

##### 2: Build Rapport

###### People buy from people they know, like, and trust. People don’t just buy things from you; they have to buy you. An excellent way to build rapport is with personal transparency. You may choose to share your personal challenges, an obstacle you’ve overcome, or doubts you conquered that got you to this moment of appearing before your audience and introducing them to your opportunity. Dustin’s story in Chapter 2 is this kind of a story. It is usually a mistake to barrel ahead with a presentation of facts, figures, product features and benefits, and propositions without first establishing some rapport with the audience.
