## What You Speak Reveals What You Are

#### Do you have kids? And how many times, in the past month, did you explain to the kids that money doesn’t grow on trees? Where’s that come from? Maybe you’ve become your father. Maybe you are simply repeating what you’ve always heard. It’s been programmed in. And now, at a particular point in your life, you are regurgitating it and spitting it back out with no thought about what it’s doing to you or what it’s doing to the person that you’re saying it to. When you say this, what belief system is it communicating and reinforcing?
 I am not for spoiling kids; that’s another discussion for another time and place. For now, let’s keep the harsh spotlight focused on you. When

#### something like that spews out of your mouth, it came from somewhere. It came from your own mind, your subconscious, your belief system, the recordings that play inside your head. Whatever you say about money is simultaneously revealing and reinforcing.
 There is a unique language used by wealth-attracting entrepreneurs. I hear it all the time, because I hang out and work with them most of the time. I’ve been surrounded by them for years. They speak one language, the outside world speaks another. I’m not going to hand you a vocabulary list here and suggest you try memorizing it, or suggest you read positive affirmations 20 times a day from 3-by-5-inch cards. That can be useful, but it is a tiny piece of this puzzle, and overly simplistic. Trying to use a vocabulary list won’t cut it. The language has to be an honest, natural reflection of your beliefs about money and wealth; everything in this book has to come together and support the changes you choose to make in your own belief system.
 But make no mistake: What you speak matters. And you can attract more wealth more easily by speaking the language of wealth.

## Trump-Speak

#### Not since Muhammad Ali went around yelling “I AM THE GREATEST” has anybody become so famous for hyperbolic, superlative statements about himself and everything he does, as has The Donald. With almost every breath, he declares something made-by-Trump as the biggest, the grandest, the greatest, the most amazing, the most successful. Listen to him speak about his TV shows The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice and you’d think there were no others. When we had Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, come and speak at one of the Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™]
 Super-Conferences (the name, a bit of hyperbole of our own) and I sat in the backstage “green room” with her, I immediately noticed the exact same Trump-Speak as she described the real estate projects she was working on and her jewelry line. So I asked her about it. She said she’d grown up with it, it was ingrained and natural, and was a way not just of promotion, but of re-affirming

#### commitment to an ideal and a position in the world. “After all, if we can’t make what we’re doing the best,” she said, “why would we choose to do it?” I believe “Trump-Speak” reflects a deeply felt ideal, the more often and consistently spoken, the more deeply felt. A closed loop of extreme confidence construction for self and assertive, pre-eminent positioning to the marketplace.

 Donald Trump has been asked about this himself many times. In his own words ...

 “... key to the way I promote is BRAVADO. People may not always think big themselves but they get very excited by those who do. People want to believe something is THE biggest and THE greatest and THE most spectacular . “Some people have written that I’m boastful, but they are missing the point. If you’re devoting your life to creating a body of work and you believe in what you do, and what you do is excellent, you’d damn well better tell people you think so. Subtlety and modesty are appropriate for nuns, but if you’re in business, you’d better learn to speak up and announce your significant accomplishments to the world.”

 Be Somebody

#### Be a famous somebody. Like it or not, we live in a celebrity-obsessed culture, a celebrity-driven marketplace.
 In recent years, my clients in the seminar and conference business have dramatically increased attendance or total onsite revenues or both by adding celebrity speakers to their events, including Donald Trump and Dr. Phil. At our own Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] conferences, we usually feature a celebrity-CEO or celebrity-entrepreneur, such as Gene Simmons (KISS), George Foreman, Jim McCann (1-800-Flowers), Ivanka Trump, and Joan Rivers. And for 9 years I spoke on the biggest seminar tour ever, in 25 to 29 cities a year, to audiences of 10,000 to 35,000, in arenas, with speakers like former Presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush, Generals Colin Powell and Norman Schwartzkopf, Larry King, Bill Cosby, and dozens more from Hollywood, sports, politics, and business. Stadiums were filled for business seminars as if they were rock concerts because of the drawing power of these celebrities. My client of many years, the Guthy-Renker Corporation,

#### changed the infomercial industry forever when it began using celebrity hosts and testimonials in its TV infomercials. Even Forbes magazine now publishes an annual issue all about the wealthiest and most influential celebrities, and it sells just as well as its annual issue about the richest business leaders. No matter your market—CEOs or ditch-diggers, young or old, poor or super-affluent—it is influenced by and attracted to celebrity.
 So it is smart to make yourself into a celebrity. Not necessarily the kind who appears on Oprah or the cover of People, but a celebrity within your own business sphere, your own market, whether that’s defined geographically, demographically, by particular industry or profession, or otherwise. The smaller the universe, the easier it is to be a celebrity. Arnold Schwarzenegger was first a celebrity in the niche world of bodybuilding, from which he extracted a great deal of wealth, before the general public was even aware of his existence. Many of my clients are famous celebrities in their own industries, quite likely to be stopped and asked for their autographs, or collect a crowd at their industry conventions, yet you would neither recognize their faces nor know their names.
 At a local level, it is relatively easy for a businessperson to achieve celebrity status, in large part merely by making himself a focal point of all his advertising. Quite a few of our Members have successfully created local celebrity status or niche celebrity status for themselves. In Edmonton, Canada, Dr. Barry Lycka is a bona fide celebrity. When he offers an open seminar or special event, hundreds attend. He has long featured himself in extensive newspaper, TV, and direct-mail advertising for both his practice and his spa. My client, Darin Garman, a commercial real estate broker and developer, has attracted investors to Iowa real estate from all over the world by making it all about him, and making himself into a celebrity with his “Former Iowa Prison Guard Discovers ...” story. Diana of Diana’s Gourmet Pizzeria has made a point of competing in—and sometimes winning— national and international chef competitions, generating considerable publicity in her local media and even on The Food Network. In every case, these businesspeople elevate their status by writing books, publishing newsletters, putting on events, and learning to use the media effectively to generate publicity for themselves and their businesses, and feature themselves in their advertising.
 Local celebrity can lead to national celebrity. A one-time client of mine, Dr. Robert Kotler, a Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon, began making himself

#### a ‘“celebrity doctor” with the local advertising of his self-published book The Consumers’ Guide to Cosmetic Surgery and Los Angeles media appearances made possible by the book. Recently, he was a featured doctor in the reality TV series aired nationally on the E network, Dr. 90210.
 Certainly within your own clientele, it is easy to become a celebrity—and doing so will improve customer or client retention, spending, and referrals. To your own clientele, you build your own celebrity status through self- aggrandizement, self-promotion, and association with celebrities. Any association. Any and every photo of you with a celebrity has real value to you. Many of our Members get photo opportunities at our events with the likes of Gene Simmons and Ivanka Trump, and these photos quickly migrate to their websites, newsletters, and with news releases, to their local or niche media, along with their reports of meeting these people used in their blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and so on.
 There are several reasons for making yourself a celebrity in the eyes of your customers, prospects, and local media. It makes you more interesting to them. They are curious about you and about your encounters with celebrities. It gives your clientele bragging rights and cocktail party conversation fodder—they enjoy talking about their doctor, financial advisor, restaurant owner, dog groomer, whoever is the one people have seen on TV, heard on radio, read about in the newspaper or who just came back from the international pizza-making competition in Rome, Italy, or a major business conference where they hung out with Gene Simmons of KISS ... imagine that! You not only make yourself more attractive from a marketing standpoint by making yourself a celebrity, you actually add value for your clients or customers.
