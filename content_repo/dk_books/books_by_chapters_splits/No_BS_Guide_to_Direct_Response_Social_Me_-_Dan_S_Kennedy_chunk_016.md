###### by Kim Walsh Phillips When you know who your best customers are, your next step is to get to know them better.
 Guessing is good. Like when I am trying to help my kids pass the time in line to board a roller coaster at the mall, by playing the “I spy” game. Or when I am putting a few dollars down on the roulette wheel when a speaking engagement takes me to Vegas.
 But guessing is not good when it comes to marketing, especially when the answers are available to you. Guessing then is similar to baking a bad cake. There’s a recipe with all the measurements and measuring cups next to you, but instead you just toss ingredients into a bowl. Sure, there is a chance you’ll get it right, but it would have been better if you’d followed the recipe. And there’s a pretty good chance you’ll just screw up the whole thing.
 Research is good. But it isn’t sexy. So most businesses skip it. But research can be exciting. Seriously.
 You can actually get leads while you are researching your target market. By sending out a simple one-question audience survey, you can gain amazing results that can influence your marketing and generate revenue.

 Sample One-Question Surveys

 • “What’s the number-one question you have about (XYZ industry)?”
 • “If you could change one thing about (XYZ industry), what would it
 be?”
 • “If you had a magic wand, what’s the one thing you would like to be
 different about (XYZ industry or their pain or frustration)?”

 The answers to these questions can provide you with the following results.

 • Factual data about the likes, habits, hobbies, and needs of your target
 market. Effective marketing is based on facts, not guesses.

###### Determining the needs of your target market through research will give you the greatest chance of success.
 • A report you can use to get publicity. Once your survey is complete,
 release your findings to the media as a “State of the Industry” report. Done well, this will not only give you fantastic media coverage, but also establish you as “the expert” in your field to the media, making you the go-to choice for future stories.
 • Provides a plethora of effective copy you can use in your marketing.
 When you ask your target market what they want to know more about in your industry, their answers come in their own words. This gives you the exact copy to use in your marketing and content development. This will not only resonate better with your audience, but will help your Search Engine Optimization—since you will write copy the way your audience will search for it. Also use this copy as subject lines in your emails, headlines in your social media ads, and the opening lines of your email campaigns.
 • Hands you qualified leads (The money question!). Within the answers
 of your target market, you can find new customers, upsell opportunities from current customers, and identify referral sources and other business opportunities. The last time we ran this question, we found a treasure trove of responses, including speaking engagement offers, prospect interview requests, and referral opportunities.

 A few tips on a seamless execution:

 • Use the free resource SurveyMonkey to draft your question.
 • Offer a prize to one lucky respondent or an incentive to each person,
 like an ebook, free report, or video.
 • Distribute the survey through email, your blog, and/or social media
 channels.
 • Give a deadline of only a week to take the survey.
 • Review the results.

 We recently did a rather comprehensive survey about the social media marketing behaviors of businesses. We offered the significant incentive of a

###### $997 video training. Of course, it cost me nothing, but the perception of value is all that matters to increase responses. Through this survey, we were able to discover our audience’s biggest frustrations, in their own words. I used respondents’ exact statements as the bullet points in a webinar following this project.
 We also leveraged the survey to get PR for our firm, as a lead magnet, and as a special gift for our Marketing Insiders Elite Members.
 And we got new clients out of it, generating the only important metric— profit.
 Money, intel, and PR? That is a valuable process.

### Magnetic Leads

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### How to Quickly Create an Effective Lead Magnet

###### As Dan shared, your Magnetic Offer is something your best prospects would pay for, even if it weren’t free. But, of course, all they need to do is give you their contact information. This is an effective way to start lifelong customer relationships with cold Facebook traffic.

 Why Lead Magnets Work When it comes to generating leads online, reaching out to prospects on social media and elsewhere isn’t enough. Merely asking people for their contact information won’t get you very far. You need to offer something of value in exchange, and it needs to be something worthwhile to your target audience. Put simply, you need to develop an assortment of lead magnets to walk your target market toward the sale.
 Thankfully, you don’t have to pour huge amounts of time, effort, or money into developing lead magnets. In fact, you shouldn’t.
 For example, if I am going to offer a free guide about Facebook, I am not going to include every step-by-step on how to run an effective Facebook ad campaign because: 1) There would be no reason for students to continue to learn from me, and more important, 2) they would be completely overwhelmed and most likely run away from the topic altogether. The guide can focus on one aspect of what they need and give real value, but not provide the entire story.
 This isn’t just about selling. It’s about being effective for your prospect.


-----

###### If it seems like too much work either to consume or execute, it generally does not test well as a lead magnet. Brands, speakers, and experts often think it is their obligation to tell prospects everything. But the contrary is true. You are doing a disservice to your target market if you give too much information. They will not be motivated to move forward to take action.
 The reason is in our brain chemistry. Prospects want a quick win, giving themselves a speedy dose of dopamine.
 Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain’s reward and pleasure centers. Dopamine also helps regulate movement and emotional responses, and enables us not only to see rewards, but to take action toward them. (Source: Psychology Today.)
 Dopamine is one of our body’s triggers for motivation. It is what propels us forward. It’s behind all the little actions in our day, such as getting out of bed and taking a shower, to the more advanced actions like achieving goals. It is our reward trigger that makes sure we don’t sit around like sloths all day.
 It is your job to propel prospects forward into action. The moment they consume your lead magnet, they should get a quick dose of dopamine compelling them to continue along the path to a sale. Yes, this is manipulative. But necessary. Your prospect craves it.
 If you have a product or service that meets the needs of your target market, then you have a moral obligation to purposefully use triggers to drive them to action. I believe there is nothing immoral or unethical about using triggers to drive your target market to take action in order to ensure they get what they need.
 Imagine meeting the love of your life while walking down the street in a crowded city. For a moment, you lock eyes while passing by, instantly connect, and within only a few seconds of conversation, decide to get married.
 Other than some movie where there is a fairy godmother doing her thing, this would be impossible, right? Of course, it would.
 Yet that is what most Facebook marketing hopes will happen every single time they run an ad campaign. They launch an ad trying to sell something at hello. Passing by in a crowded space in a split second, they ask the prospect to marry them.
 It doesn’t work that way.


-----

###### The good news is you can take your prospect from stranger to customer in one transaction … all by first picking your “What’s Next” strategy and then by growing your audience.
 You want the “next step” to be free, but so good that if it weren’t, people would pay for it anyway. We call this step the “Juicy Carrot.” You are trying to attract as many bunnies (an animal that loves to multiply) to your offer as possible.
 Here’s how:

 STEP ONE: YOUR JUICY CARROT Before launching any audience-building campaign, always, always, always (and yes, always) figure out what you want your audience to do after they agree to follow you.
 Having a “next step” Juicy Carrot ensures that there is ROI (aka cha- ching). Because you aren’t just getting clicks, you are audience-building, growing your list, and driving in sales.
 A few of the many Juicy Carrot options to choose from:

 1. Join Your List. Powerhouse member and photographer extraordinaire
 Lisa Roberti launched her Wildlife and Nature Guild so her followers could join her list and follow her photography safaris (see Figure 6.1). Her passion is protecting our endangered wildlife and creating advocacy in her tribe.

**FIGURE 6.1: Join-Our-List Juicy Carrot**

###### 2.  Take a Free Gift. Inner Circle Mastermind member David Stelzl
 gives a Free Risk Assessment Template to his prospects, IT firms, which they can use with their prospects to get more clients (see Figure 6.2 on page 89).

**FIGURE 6.2: Free Gift Juicy Carrot**

###### 3. Free Webcast. Right on my Cover Photo, I am promoting our weekly
 webinar: “How to Get 10,000 Facebook Fans in 72 Hours” (see Figure 6.3).

**FIGURE 6.3: Free Webcast Juicy Carrot**

###### 4. Powerhouse members Sabrina and Tristan offer “more information”
 on their certification program as the next step for their followers (see Figure 6.4 on page 90).

**FIGURE 6.4: More Information Juicy Carrot**


-----

###### STEP TWO: SETTING UP FOR SUCCESS When you’ve figured out what your Juicy Carrot is, give yourself a fist bump. You are crushing this.
 Then, put a link to that on all your social media accounts. As you grow your followers, you always want them to know “what’s next.”
 You are now officially a “direct-response marketer”—as in one who cares about not just the sizzle but the steak, too, aka you want your marketing to produce results.

 CONTESTS AS LEAD MAGNETS Why would they enter this? No, really?
 Contests can be an effective way to build your list and sales. We ran one for the first edition of this book and had over 1,000 people apply for a social media package and to be spotlighted in the book. This gave us a lot of content, new contacts on our email list, and hundreds of warm leads.


-----

###### Engaging through a contest is effective. This is the thought process behind “gamification,” defined as the application of typical elements of game playing (e.g., point scoring, competition with others, rules of play) to other areas of activity, typically as an online marketing technique to encourage engagement with a product or service.
 Put another way, make your marketing more “fun” so your prospects are eager to participate. Leverage gamification as a lead magnet to acquire new prospects.
 Run your contest outside of your social networks. If you run your contest on your page, you cannot require people to give you their email address and/or like your page in order to enter. Instead, send your traffic to a landing page outside of Facebook (instead of using the Facebook plugins to host the page on a Facebook tab). Move your prospects to a channel with the greatest chance of entering.
 And importantly, give away a prize that also works as a way to qualify your leads. Instead of a generic iPad or Visa gift card, give away something your quality prospects would like, such as a gift certificate to your business, consulting time, a ticket to an event, merchandise, etc. When I owned the agency, Bath Planet, a bathroom remodeling business, was a client and we gave away a bathroom remodeling package, and for another client, One- Hour Heating and Air Conditioning, we gave away a furnace.
 Whatever your lead magnet/Juicy Carrot is, use it to draw your lead away from social media in order to acquire people’s contact information so you can nurture them into a sale. (See Figures 6.5 through 6.8 on pages 92 through 94.)
 Start with one, optimize it, and move on to the next. See what your audience responds best to in not just opt-ins but in full conversions to customers.

###### Because in the end, the dollars generated through your lead magnet and the sales funnel that follows is the only metric that really matters.

 And nothing has proven to give a higher ROI than social media marketing. Dollar for dollar, day in and day out, over and over again—you get the idea. Social media marketing produces a higher return per dollar spent than anything else.

 How Do I Reach My Target Audience? Once you have your Juicy Carrot ready, it is time to get your perfect prospects to fill it in.
 After new email subscribers join our list, they are offered the opportunity to ask me a marketing question. Frequently it’s for help choosing an exact target market. I’ve been asked, “How do I reach seniors?” “How do I reach an affluent group?” “How do I reach small

-----

###### business owners?” or “How do I reach owners of Sugar Gliders?” (which by the way are the cutest nocturnal flying creatures you ever did see and the niche of one of our coaching members).
 How do you reach any specific market you are looking to conquer? If you don’t have a list of customers to upload to Facebook and create a “look-alike” audience, then you can target other people’s fan pages. Find the pages of the people your people like by going into Facebook Audience Insights and typing in a page name of a guru in your niche. Up will come the other pages those people like.

 Segment Interests to Optimize Effectively We optimize ads daily, and one of the key ways we do this is by narrowing the targeted audience of each ad. If you want to sell tennis racquets, you could target fans of the U.S. Open, Nike Tennis, and Andre Agassi, plus those who like tennis. We typically categorize interests and demographics and put them in different look-alike categories.
 Play around with each of the main options (demographic, interests, and behavior), run some A/B tests, and determine which avenue works best for your business. This is the kind of marketing none of your competitors is doing but can give you an incredible return on investment. Most who read this book won’t take action, but if you do, you will quickly grow your ROI.
 Now go find your equivalent of the Ohio Family with six kids that likes HGTV that converts really well for one of our financial planners.
 You have been challenged. Be different than most and accept.

#### Get Your Target Market to Opt-In

###### I am fascinated by the story of Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos. I am also one of their Prime Members and a company stockholder.
 Jeff Bezos got the idea to start Amazon after he came across the fact that web usage was growing at 2,300% annually. He had just turned 30 years old and been married for a year. When he told his wife he wanted to quit his job and do this crazy thing that probably wouldn’t work since most startups don’t, she told him to go for it.
 Interestingly, Amazon’s initial public offering went nuts in 1997— but then came the crash.
