##### Inherent in your USP must be a deep understanding of your ideal customer and how you make their life better. So my business is 100% focused on a very particular type of customer. We understand them and know them better than most people know their closest friend. We have a deep understanding of them and that allows us to create a business that appeals to them. We build real relationships with them. We know who they really are. And they know who we are, and what we stand for. We believe in the same things. We fit. We know their values, hopes, dreams, fears, pains, and desires.
 We produce a successful monthly print newsletter for our clients called “Jones and Co. LIFE.” Not a day goes by in the practice without clients mentioning the newsletter, commenting on a particular story and sharing their own version of that story, or just saying that they enjoy receiving it.
 The newsletter is one of the ways we show our clients that we understand them and that we are like them. I put a lot of personality into the newsletter, I share stories from my life that are relevant, and I try to strike a chord with the client who is reading it. I want them nodding their head in agreement. I want them thinking, “That’s so true. I feel the same way. These Jones and Co. people are just like me.” It has to be an entertaining read, but what I’m really doing is showing them that my belief system is the same as their belief system in certain, important areas. And that builds trust and stronger relationships.
 (An unintended bonus from this print monthly newsletter has been that I have a stronger relationship with many more clients than before, even though I now work less and less in the practice and I see very few clients. But when I am in the practice I am bombarded with praise and personal conversations from clients who feel they know me even if I have never actually met them. It’s a great strategy for getting free from working “in” the business while still keeping a strong relationship with your clients. They still feel that connection with you even if you are not there, and it also gives them a route to give feedback directly to you, if you choose.)

 Constant Testing If I said we got here in one fell swoop I’d be lying. This wasn’t easy. There were a few bumps in the road. Obstacles we didn’t foresee until they were

##### upon us. But it was all part of the learning and testing process. It also meant when we found a solution, we understood why it worked and also knew five other ways NOT to do it.

 Expect a Few Bumps in the Road The first eyewear style consultation didn’t work. The first funnel attracted mainly time wasters and people that were not a good fit for us.
 Removing stock from display met with lots of resistance from would-be browsers until we figured out effective scripts to lead them along with our sales process. This motivated us to create effective scripts and fast!
 In our attempt to be exclusive the language we used early on in our marketing was a bit too pretentious. I know there are subtle differences in the UK market compared to the U.S. market and it took us a little while to find our sweet spot.
 Generally, every step of the way involved initial resistance, poor results, tweaking it until it was effective, followed by success. But without those first few clumsy, awkward attempts at each new thing, we would never have discovered the successful way to do it.
 The lesson here is that nothing happens with any idea until you try it. Then you get feedback. And by then you’re already moving so it’s easier to adjust and tweak and change direction until you make it work.

#### CHAPTER 1


### The Big Switch

 Why Direct Marketing for NON-Direct Marketing
 Businesses?


# It is an odd sort of title, isn’t it?

##### If you picked it up hoping for huge breakthroughs in your business, you bought the right book. But first, I have to get these definitions out of the way.
 By non-direct marketing business, I mean anything but a mail-order, catalog, or online marketer who directly solicits orders for merchandise. It could be a local dental practice, carpet cleaning business, brick and mortar retailer, B2B—IT consultant, CPA firm, or industrial equipment manufacturer. The owners of such businesses do not think of themselves as direct marketers engaged in direct-response advertising, until I get ahold of them!
 Examples of pure direct marketing businesses just about everybody knows are the TV home shopping channels, QVC and HSN; catalogers like J. Peterman or Hammacher-Schlemmer; contemporary catalog and online catalog/ecommerce companies like Amazon and Zappos; businesses like the Fruit of the Month Club; and mass users of direct mail to sell things, like Publishers Clearinghouse.


-----

##### There are thousands of true direct marketing businesses. Some are familiar to the general public; many, many more are familiar only to the niche or special interest they serve. For example, at any given moment, I have over 50 direct marketers as clients, each selling books, audio CDs, home study courses, and seminars and services by mail, internet and print media, teleseminars, and webinars, which market only to a specific industry or profession—one to carpet cleaners, another to restaurant owners, another to chiropractors, etc. If you are not a chiropractor, you don’t know the name Dr. Chris Tomshack and his company Health Source. If you are a chiropractor, it would be hard not to know of him, thanks to his full-page ads in the industry trade journals, massive amounts of direct mail, and other direct marketing. There are also direct marketers unknown by name but known by their products or brands, like a long-time client of mine, Guthy- Renker Corporation, the billion-dollar business behind TV infomercials for Pro-Activ® acne creams and many other products made into brands. What all these have in common is their fundamental process of selling direct via media to consumers, with no brick-and-mortar locations or face-to-face contact required.
 These are not the folks this book is for, even if they are the kinds of entrepreneurs I work personally with a lot. They already know everything in this book, and live and prosper by it.
 This book is for the owner of a brick-and-mortar business, a business with a store, showroom or office; a restaurant; a dental practice; an accounting practice; or a funeral home that is some kind of ordinary business, one most likely local and serving a local market. These are the entrepreneurs who have populated my audiences for four decades, subscribe to my newsletters, and use my systems to transform those “ordinary” businesses into extraordinary money machines that far, far outperform their industry norms, peers, competitors, and their own wildest imaginations. How do they do it? The big switch is a simple one to state (if more complex to do): they switch from traditional advertising to direct-response advertising. They stop emulating ordinary and traditional marketing and instead emulate direct marketing.
 Most “ordinary” businesses advertise and market like much bigger brand-name companies, so they spend (waste) a lot of money on image, brand, and presence. But copycatting these big brand-name companies is


-----

##### like a rabbit behaving like the lion. It makes no sense. The big companies have all sorts of reasons for the way they advertise and market that have nothing to do with getting a customer or making sales! Because your agenda is much simpler, you should find successful businesses with similar agendas to copycat. Those are direct marketers. You and they share the same basic ideas:

 1. Spend $1.00 on marketing, get back $2.00 or $20.00, fast, that can
 be accurately tracked to the $1.00 spent. 2. Do NOT spend $1.00 that does not directly and quickly bring back
 $2.00 or $20.00.

 Please stop and be sure you get this life-changing principle. Be careful who you copy. Be careful who you act like. Be careful who you study. If their purpose, objectives, agenda, reasons for doing what they do the way they do it don’t match up with your purpose, objectives, agenda, then you should NOT study or emulate or copy them!


### Big Company’s Agenda for Advertising and
 Marketing

##### 1. Please/appease its board of directors (most of whom know zip
 about advertising and marketing but have lots of opinions)

 2. Please/appease its stockholders

 3. Look good and appropriate to Wall Street

 4. Look good and appropriate to the media

 5. Build brand identity

 6. Win awards for advertising

##### 7. Sell something
