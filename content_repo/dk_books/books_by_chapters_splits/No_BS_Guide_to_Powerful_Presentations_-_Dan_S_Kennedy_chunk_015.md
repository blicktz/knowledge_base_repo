###### explained. It has to do with the difference between doing things and owning things. When you are a speaker or presenter delivering a presentation, you are a laborer doing things. It can be high-paid labor, but that’s still what it is. It can only produce income. And it is just as dependent on you being healthy, able, and willing to report to work as the convenience store clerk’s paycheck is dependent on him trudging in on time every day. When you convert a powerful presentation to a webinar and put in place a system to drive an audience to it, you own what I call a Marketing Asset. You get income from doing things. You get wealth, independence, and security from owning things.

###### Returning to the presentation itself, and the relocation of it to online media, there are two big secrets of mine to consider and keep in mind.
 First Secret: When they watch it on a screen, it’s TV. I’ve done a great deal of work over many years with aired-on-TV half-hour infomercials—for information products and courses, for free preview seminars occurring in various cities, for moneymaking opportunities, for skin-care and cosmetic products, weight loss and fitness products, and a wide array of other products and services. My longest tenured client is a Very Big Dog in that industry: the Guthy-Renker corporation, known for everything from the original Tony Robbins infomercials to its biggest, flagship skin-care brand, Proactiv®. I’ve worked with them since 1988. I learned as I went, as I came to writing, developing, and even producing infomercials only with direct-response advertising experience but no experience with TV or video production. I made quite a name for myself. I even have a show entirely of my invention and production that set and still holds the record for the longest uninterrupted airing for a lead-generation infomercial in its category: every day and every night for eight years. What I learned about the viewer and what works best to get and hold his attention, build interest, and get him off the couch and to the phone with infomercials has given me a unique advantage in writing and producing video for webinars. This information can also be used inside offices such as professional practices or on DVDs sent to prospects, and in creating and producing live webcasts. I always think of it as TV.


-----

###### People have certain expectations about TV. There are certain formats they are very familiar with, expect, have been conditioned to accept, and are eager to give attention to. News broadcasts, daytime talk shows, and cable news talk shows have definitive looks, feels, and choreography to them. This makes the set very important. Most news and news-talk shows now have type streaming across the bottom of the screen, graphics—like “Breaking News”—and often big screens where video or charts and graphs are shown. When a viewer finds himself watching that, he knows he is watching a news program. Daytime talk shows like Ellen usually have more of a living room feel to them. Morning programs like The Today Show have different segments at different kinds of sets—news, living room, kitchen. Most TV has a lot of activity and movement to it. The very static two people across a desk show like Larry King or Charlie Rose is nearly dead. You will occasionally see an infomercial done this way, because it’s cheap to do, but you won’t catch any major player using that format. People expect things to happen on TV.
 At GKIC, the company I founded and that is built around me, we perfected a format and formula for new information product launches with a series of brief excitement-building videos, then a four-hour live webcast (often with me), a host, and sometimes other guests. The webcasts are divided into three segments exactly like an infomercial is with prerecorded commercials for the offered product inserted at three breaks. Each of these webinar/webcast “events” has generated from hundreds of thousands to over a million dollars in revenue. Several different sets were used throughout the three-year series, always with an eye to it being watched as if TV.
 It would be very rare for me to simply take a speaker or presenter who has been delivering a stand-up presentation successfully, film him doing it, and air that online as a webinar. It’s done, and I have done it, but there have to be very special circumstances supporting it, notably its use only for a very dedicated audience or with an extraordinarily charismatic and attention-commanding star of the show. I was involved with this with a famous weight loss infomercial, Stop the Insanity! featuring the crew-cut, tall, lanky, screaming Susan Powter. The show was well-produced by a guy named Packy McFarland but simple: a live audience seated in three-quarter- round, Susan on stage, and her frenzied performance. It was hard to take


-----

###### your eyes off of it. In most cases, I’m going to take the proven presentation and take it apart and re-assemble it to be delivered as a TV show.
 The Second Secret about online media delivery in place of in-person, in-a-physical-room delivery is that there are a lot of things you can do online that are impractical or too costly to do in a live presentation, especially if occurring dozens or hundreds of times a year in different locations and venues—but even if it’s an implant dentistry introductory seminar done just once a month for a small audience squeezed into your dental office’s reception room. For example, consider testimonials. It’s great at a live presentation to have your three or four most enthusiastic, most articulate customers, clients, or patients present, to be stood up or brought up on stage, and to be interviewed by you or to tell their before-and-after story. But they probably are not going to get on your bus and travel with you to 20 different cities, and even if they did, they’d tire of performing and become less and less effective. Even for that dentist doing six, eight, or ten in-office seminars a year, getting those same star patients to come and sing ‘n’ dance at all of them isn’t practical. Unfortunately, in live presentations, audiences tend to tune out when made to watch video. Some even resent it. With a webinar, however, they are already watching TV, and cutting away to a brief video testimonial is like having Jimmy Fallon and a guest cut to a clip of the guest’s movie. You can immortalize your star customer telling his story most enthusiastically, possibly on location on the yacht he bought with the money he made with your system or in the kitchen merrily cooking while talking about the classes he took at the cooking school you run in the back of your kitchenware store. You get to have him appear in your webinar 10, 100, or 1,000 times and he never gets tired—fresh as a daisy every time.
 There are also all kinds of on-screen graphics, splitscreen images, PowerPoint slides with voice-over, physical demonstrations filmed in real- life situations rather than inside a seminar room, and other effects we can do to enhance the webinar that can’t be done during a live, stand-up presentation. Earlier in this book, Dave mentioned the seven-minute attention span. He’s probably generous. When I put together a video for airing online or to be sent to a prospect, I like to mix up what they’re seeing on screen every three to seven minutes.
 In videos I produced for a group of orthodontic practices, to be shown in-office, sent on DVD, aired at the doctors’ websites and on YouTube, in


-----

###### different ones, I utilized a Rolls-Royce, a classic sports car, and a stunt dog, as well as two sets and a plethora of on-screen graphics. No doctor is going to bring two cars and a dog into his office or to a local hotel meeting room for his presentation. (These videos are used by www.ExcellenceInOrthodontics.org.)
 Depending on the size and scope of your business, anticipated length or frequency of use of your webinar or video, or anticipated audience size, you can also involve a rented celebrity host. I have produced videos for online and delivery to prospects for a consulting company in the hospital industry using tennis champion Chris Evert, for a health-care practice using Rose Marie (The Dick Van Dyke Show), for a financial services company with football champion Rocky Bleier, and many others.
 Remember, I am creating Marketing Assets—not one-‘n’-done presentations.
 And remember, all of this is about leveraging a proven, powerful presentation that works delivered live and in person to audiences. This is about marrying and merging that presentation with the techniques and formats of direct-response TV infomercials to wind up with effective webinars, video sales letters, or even live webcasts.
 This brings me to a third and final point: leverage. When you have a powerful, effective presentation, you want to use it in as many different ways and as many different media as possible. I love working with a client who has a great presentation. It or pieces of it can become sales letters and literature for direct mail, a book, or books for authority and “thud impact,” and lead-generating bait, audio CDs, DVDs, and more. Material can also be repurposed for lead generation, making a sale, and follow-up in appointment, no-sale situations. The one power presentation becomes the foundation for a plethora of media and the Copy Bank from which, as the copywriter, I can make withdrawals to serve as starting points, themes, or basis for an entire portfolio of Marketing Assets.
 In my consulting and copywriting practice, I am usually developing complex, multimedia, multistep, front-end (customer/client/patient acquisition), and back-end (unconverted lead and customer monetization) systems. Most businesses have operating systems—out of necessity—but few have real marketing systems. Instead, they have random and erratic acts, advertising disconnected from marketing, and marketing disconnected

### StealthSeminar Automate Your Presentations and Profits

###### by Special Guest Expert Geoff Ronning

 op income business owners, private practice professionals, and sales pros as well as authors, speakers, and consultants share a secret: automation. As many things that work for them as possible get put on autopilot. The powerful, effective presentation fits this

# Tperfectly. I built a technology and tech service for this purpose

###### called StealthSeminar. Dustin and Dave invited me to present it in this book because they knew you would get excited about using automated webinars but then wonder: How can I get all this done?

##### What Is StealthSeminar?

###### StealthSeminar is the longest running automated webinar software available. An automated webinar is a webinar that is delivered to your prospects and clients on autopilot. It is set to run automatically so you can be working on other projects, playing golf, cruising the Caribbean with your


-----

###### family, or doing any other activities requiring your attention. The webinar runs automatically—your manual labor isn’t required.

##### Why StealthSeminar?

###### There are a number of benefits to using StealthSeminar, including the following.

 Build Your Lead List

 Collecting lead data is getting harder and harder. Having them opt into a webinar is a great way to acquire your lead information in a simple, powerful fashion. People are used to registering for events. Using a webinar quickly builds your list and allows you to do so effortlessly.

 Scale Your Business

 Using StealthSeminar, you can scale your business with automation. If you are relying on your manual efforts each time to give a presentation or webcast, you are limiting the number of times you can deliver your presentation. Through automation, you can run your webinar as many times as you deem fit each and every day.

 Offer Convenient Times for Your Leads and Clients

 Business is worldwide. Time zones can be tricky to navigate. Allowing your webinar to run at the times your attendees want to watch will increase your registrants and allow you to cater to their needs without working 24/7.

 No Presentation Pressure or Fear

 Many people have a fear of public speaking. By creating a webinar and using StealthSeminar, you remove the public speaking factor. You record the webinar in a controlled, comfortable environment so you don’t have any


-----

###### fears or pressure. You then just upload that video to run as an automated webinar.

 No Relying on Your Health or Mood

 When you present a live seminar, it is easy for day-to-day frustrations and challenges to come through. For instance, if you have a sore throat, it’s hard to hide that while sucking on cough drops. Or, if you had a sick child or spouse that kept you up all night, or if you are ill yourself, the lack of sleep and sickness is easily seen by your audience.
 In addition, if you have had a bad day or are frustrated by something, that can also impact your performance. By automating your webinar, you are providing the same crisp, fresh presentation each and every time it runs.

 Always Present Your Highest Converting Presentation

 With StealthSeminar, you can always be sure you are going to be presenting the most valuable webinar because you do something called “split testing.” Split testing allows you to play one presentation to one group of individuals while playing a second presentation to another group. By doing this, you can look at the statistics and see what presentation converts the highest and achieves the goals you’re looking to achieve. You are automatically improving your success on a daily basis.

 No Technical Snafus

 Presenting live webinars requires a healthy computer as well as a strong internet connection. If there are any issues with either one of those during your webinar, your event is impacted, and potentially, your audience lost. With StealthSeminar, the technical requirements are far less because you are not actually broadcasting your webinar. Therefore, it’s much easier and much more reliable.

 Laser-Sharp Follow-Up to Maximize Your Conversions


-----

###### You can track who showed up for your webinars, as well as how long they stayed and deliver messages that match the needs of each individual attendee. If they register but don’t show up, you speak to that individual. If they show up but leave early, you deliver that message. If they stay the entire time but don’t convert, you give them what they need to convert. If they show up and convert, you deliver a message to ensure their satisfaction. Throughout the entire process, you control and optimize the experience for your attendees so they convert at the highest levels possible.

##### What Does a StealthSeminar Webinar Look Like?

###### A StealthSeminar webinar looks exactly like you would expect a live webinar to look. The key to the highest-converting webinar is the interaction by the attendees, albeit automated. You accomplish that by using a chat box (which is fully controlled through automation), calls to actions that appear and disappear, countdown timers, etc., all under your control and set up when your seminar is launched on StealthSeminar. See Figure 14.1 on page 119.

 FIGURE 14.1: Ronning Webinar Prosperity Segmentation

###### Should you not want to use all those bells and whistles, you can also choose to not do so. You are in full control and can set it up as you see fit.

##### Is Using StealthSeminar Ethical?

###### I would never tell you what is ethical for you. However, I will tell you that there are a lot of ways to present a webinar on StealthSeminar. For instance, some people choose to present a webinar exactly as if it is live and tell their viewers it is live. Others choose to tell people it is not live. I personally choose to deliver the webinar and allow the attendees to come to their own conclusions. I don’t say it is live; I don’t say it isn’t.
 There are a lot of automation tools that I use that do the exact same thing—for instance, with an autoresponder sequence, I do not start off the email telling people that I wrote this on December 4, 2010. I let the message speak for itself.
 By not saying it’s live and allowing them to come to their own conclusions, I feel comfortable. Again, it is a personal decision and you should do what you are comfortable doing. In either case, saying it is live, not commenting on it, or saying it is recorded is fine.

##### Automated Webinars versus Live Webinars

###### A lot of times, people wonder if live webinars convert better than automated webinars. The answer for a lot of people is that live webinars work better. Then again, for some people, automated webinars work much better. It’s no surprise why; an automated webinar allows you to make the same sharp presentation each and every time in any time zone.
 But it gets even better when it comes to leveraging time and scaling a business. When you consider the time freed up by automating your webinar, there is no comparison. Automated is the runaway winner.
 Many StealthSeminar clients are running a dozen or more webinars a day. Some are running hundreds a day. So, even if their conversion rate is slightly lower versus live, the quantity of automated webinars they are
