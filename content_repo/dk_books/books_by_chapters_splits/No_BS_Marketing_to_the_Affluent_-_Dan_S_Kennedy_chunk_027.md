##### Danziger has termed this inching up of price “luxflation.” A form of self-induced inflation, experienced by consumers willing to pay what seems little more for much better experiences—when, in fact, that little more may be a 500% to 5,000% premium. It’s ironic that the government, economists, and the media sweat bullets and display great angst over inflation creeping up by a half of a percent or a percent while consumers cheerfully accept 500% inflation in dozens of purchases every day. This is important to grasp, as it affects every business. Mass-affluent consumers may complain about inflation in general or many items’ prices in particular, yet that can have zero impact on their response to your prices.
 These little indulgences can really add up for you. This is not really new. The story is now legend of how the dime-store soda fountains survived the Great Depression with the point-of-sale strategy, where the counterman responded to the milkshake order by asking, “Do you want yours with one egg or two?” What hasn’t changed is that ATS (average transaction size) is one of the most important numbers to know, manage, and work at improving in many businesses, whether you sell milkshakes to frequent customers or farm tractors to very infrequent repeat customers. To continue the milkshake example, let’s say we own an ice cream stand where the cashier responds to each order by presenting the offer of a double flavor shot and an extra scoop of fresh fruit. If half say yes to the extra $.55, and they serve 50 shakes a day, that’s $.275 added to every transaction. If the shake itself sells for $1.50, we have increased the average transaction size by 18%. But we may have increased the average margin, invisibly, by much more. Of course, if we can alter the whole

##### experience to support a higher price, still add the extra fruit, and add a big chocolate chip cookie, well, we might take our $1.50 average transaction to $3.50. On a grander scale, we may turn our ice cream stand into a much- talked about, much-preferred destination of the mass-affluent rather than just one of a dozen same-as, same-as places in town. Being in the little- indulgence business in a big way can lead to much bigger profits, but even to something more valuable: sustainable unique positioning in your customers’ minds and lives.
 For your own education, pick up copies of The Robb Report and a magazine called Cowboys & Indians at your local bookstore or other newsstand. The latter isn’t really about cowboys and Indians, by the way. Examine every ad. You will see a demonstration of how many indulgences are offered to the affluent and get an idea of how much they spend on them. While you’re at it, pick up copies of magazines about boating and yachting, private aviation, luxury travel. Go to the next big RV Show or Boat Show that comes to your city. It’ll do you good to get out more. Here, I present just a small window into this kind of spending. Some would consider it profligate spending. But, as an early mentor counseled me, denying the existence of cash registers or being a critic of them is guaranteed to be unprofitable. The best thing to do is make sure you are on the right side of them!

 Money Spent on Passions
 I make this point numerous time in this book; few affluent consumers and even fewer mass-affluents buy premium goods and services or spend freely across the board. The greatest dichotomy I personally know of is a person who routinely buys and enjoys expensive, imported caviar but also frequently parks her Mercedes® in the parking lot behind the bread company’s store and there, furtively, buys day-old bread. I know a former Fortune 500 CEO who will pay virtually any price without thought for a round of golf, and fire up the private jet to get there, but buys his khaki slacks at Target®, and has been known to pull out Valpak® coupons at restaurants. Just getting the more affluent customer is not necessarily the golden key to far greater income. Getting the more affluent

##### customer passionately interested in your category of product, service, expertise, or experience is.
 One certain way to connect with affluent consumers is to connect to their passions.
 Read Cigar Aficionado magazine, and you will discover a subculture where people passionate about cigars spend sums shocking to all others on rolled-up weeds you set fire to. As example, consider the elegant yet practical Elie Bleu Coral New Medals Humidor, featuring exotic dyed Sycamore wood, Spanish cedar interior, eight coats of varnish, and a lock and key safeguarding up to 110 cigars. Just $2,799.99.
 In the book Turning Silver into Gold: How to Profit in the New Boomer Marketplace, researcher Dr. Mary Furlong writes in-depth about what she calls “the passion and play market,” where companies and even entire industries are, pardon the pun, booming thanks to Boomers’ and especially affluent Boomers’ willingness to spend without budget and buy without price resistance.
 Consider the wine business. Once, a rather narrow, elite, and quite limited customer base predominantly populated by the affluent and ultra- affluent supported a closeted industry largely invisible or mysterious and intimidating, thus of little interest to the mass public. Today, the major wine aficionado magazines are sold on newsstands, and the huge public food shows attended by tens of thousands in each city have become wine and food shows. AARP has its own wine club, wine events, newsletters, and programs, but the buying of fine wines and expensive wines, the installing of home wine cellars, the joining of wine clubs have moved from affluent to mass-affluent, from 50-plus down to 30-plus. This is luxury democratized. A special interest becoming a widespread interest.
 Passion and play is the surest way to de-link price from pragmatism. The mass-affluent who will grumble about the total charge rung up at the grocery-store checkout counter for a week’s groceries will separately sign up for Gevalia’s® limited edition coffees of the world at $36.95 per month plus shipping and handling, which translates to spending approximately $20.00 a pound (!). And the coffee aficionado will buy pricey coffees everywhere she goes, without second thought.

##### increase in the cost of his advertising, his home’s property tax, even the local deli’s nickel and dime price increases. But, an obsessed Ohio State fan, he had purchased a giant, gas-guzzling motor home painted in Ohio state logos outside, decorated in red and gray furnishings and carpet inside, equipped with satellite dish, big-screen TV, and bar, to travel to and tailgate at every game, home and away, every season. He also purchased season tickets and bought away-game tickets from ticket brokers and scalpers at sky-high prices—all without a peep. Every Friday and Saturday during season, his office was closed, sacrificing whatever income might have been produced, so he could stock the motor home and go to Columbus or wherever the team was playing. Without a thought.
 For tennis fans of a certain generation, it’d be hard to beat a week at John Newcombe’s Fantasy Camp, held on a large ranch near San Antonio. Amateurs play alongside and against some of the game’s most famous living legends. I knew almost nothing about tennis until I wrote and produced a client’s major business video project featuring Chris Evert, and had to study up. But I do understand Fantasy Camps and similar sports star or celebrity experiences. Even on a local level, restaurants/chefs, wineries/vintners, etc., are intriguing enough to some people so that they’ll pay to “be a ______________ for a day.”
 In the September 2018 No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent Letter I reported on a tiny town in Scotland, a two-hour drive from Glasgow, Wigton, known as the nation’s book town. Eleven used bookstores are packed into the seaside burg, population 1,100. The most unusual is The Open Book, which has a store downstairs and a small apartment upstairs, and is rented out to Walter Mittys who pay to be bookstore proprietors for a day or a week. At the time of my report, they were booked solid with guest operators through 2021. If you are taking over, on arrival you are handed the keys and the cashbox and told to do your best.

 I am not above paying for a particular fantasy-camplike experience. In 2012, I indulged my long-held interest in writing a mystery novel with a financial arrangement setting up collaboration with an established author of a mysteries series, with 17 titles in print. The result was two published novels, Win, Place, or Die with Les Roberts in 2013 and Speaking of Murder with Les in 2016. Yes, both are available at all booksellers, and

##### thank you for asking. These were second-chair experiences, with me mostly contributing background information on the two “sets” for the stories, some character development, but mainly getting to see how the sausage is made. Even with a share in the royalties, between fees I paid and the cost of my time taken from business, this was a fairly expensive indulgence. And that is the point: People who can afford to indulge themselves will indulge themselves if offered opportunity of doing so.

 Money Spent Collecting Should you wish to add a life-sized, real, fully drivable antique fire engine to your portfolio of vehicles, you can find bargains in the $10,000.00 to $12,000.00 range. Buying one of the authentic George Barris Batmobiles at a car auction will set you back considerably more. People collect both. And antique motorcycles, lawn mowers, vacuum cleaners, pocket watches, grandfather clocks, medical devices, board games, toys, dolls, jukeboxes, fountain pens, and anything and everything else you have ever seen. They haunt estate sales, flea markets, and auctions, pay brokers, roam the internet, and respond to countless ads in countless magazines and newspapers in search of an elusive item. When they find it, price is pretty much irrelevant.
 I have, in my basement, an antique gambling machine, combining a pinball machine and roulette wheel, with a horseracing motif—horseracing being my passion. It requires old-fashioned picture tubes to function and is frequently on the fritz. I bought it on a whim, for, as I recall, $8,000.00. Some whim. The antique dealer who sold it to me has since kindly alerted me every time any item with a racehorse on it finds its way to his shop.
 Classic car auctions are a great place to see a big population of affluent collectors for yourself. In a magazine promoting one such auction, attended by 200,000 people and selling 5,000 cars in four days, I found an old car I’d want: a 1973 AMC Javelin AMX, a near replica of the 1974 Javelin that was my first ever new car. Inquiring, I was told it had a reserve tag on it of $36,000.00 but would probably sell for more. This is an American Motors, i.e., Rambler sporty car. Good grief. The extremely knowledgeable and helpful lady on the phone with me was quick to point out that bidding live from a distance was possible (they would assign an agent to act on my


-----

##### behalf, with whom I’d speak via cell phone), I could watch via the internet, and 100% financing by a major bank could be arranged in 15 minutes. Or, if coming to the auction, I could buy a Segway® and have it waiting for me or prearrange a golf cart rental to roam the acres of cars comfortably. This is but one of dozens of major auctions and hundreds of lesser auctions for classic cars occurring each year all over the United States.
 Since that phone conversation at the time I wrote the first edition of this book, I have, in fact, acquired a 1972 Javelin AMX, as well as a 1963 Lincoln Town Car convertible with suicide doors, a 1968 Rolls-Royce convertible owned before me by Dean Martin, and my everyday car, a 1986 Jeep Wagoneer. I’ve become an avid reader of car collector magazines, watch the Jackson-Barrett auction on TV, occasionally catch Jay Leno’s car show. And I am now supporting a car mechanic at roughly the same cost as a famous movie star’s alimony.
 Collectors are passionate about this one thing and most willing to spend on it, but often, collectors are collectors so they collect more than one thing. And, of course, are willing to spend liberally on many other things (although not everything).
 Consider the lowly pen. I have a habit of losing good ones as soon as I get them, so I stopped buying even ordinary Cross® pens years ago. My office is littered with Bic® pens bought by the gross and Flair® markers. Nowhere to be found, the designername or antique pen on its own display stand. But visit www.FountainPenHospital.com for a look at some very pricey pens—and repair services.
 It seems that everybody collects something. Affluent people simply have the wherewithal to collect pricier things or to pay more in pursuit of the things they collect. They can and do also spend money on information about what they collect, association with others who collect the same things, travel to places where they can find or show off the things they collect, storage facilities, insurance, and care and maintenance for their collected things.
 Beyond these specific interests, affluent customers are particularly in tune with the very idea of collectible value. So collector’s editions and limited editions of just about anything you can think of—book, artwork, wine, home furnishing, golf club, fishing rod—have added cachet and value.

##### if they choose. Affluent individuals tend to be the person in their families, in their circles of friends, in their various relationships most often picking up the tab. Certainly picking up the biggest tabs. It seems that the accomplished, affluent person is often standing in the center of a big circle of others, turning slowly in its center, handing money or support or gifts to each one each time he rotates past them. Because most affluent people are

 Here are a few such scenarios …
