 companies’ was our product names and labels and our identity.
   For example, we found the manufacturer of a truly superb
 aerosol weed killer. This stuff got to the roots and killed just
 about any weed on contact. You could spray a weed in a side-
 walk crack, come back ten minutes later, sweep away a little
 brown residue, and that was that. This company produced tens
 of thousands of cans of this product, labeled one way for a na-
 tional chemical company that sold exclusively to restaurants and
 hotels, labeled another way for a national hardware chain that
 sold it off the shelf. When we first added the product to our line,
 we piggybacked on those runs and bought plain white cans, just
 144 at a time, and labeled them with our own printed paper
 labels. When our purchase size increased tenfold, we switched
 to having the manufacturer silk-screen imprint our label on the
 cans for us. The product bore our proprietary name (‘‘Kills
 Weeds Dead’’), our label, our company name.
   This same manufacturer provided us with a terrific insecti-
 cide spray that smelled like pink bubble gum, a foam leather
 cleaner, and a waterless car polish. We also dealt with private
 label manufacturers of cosmetics and skin-care products, vita-
 mins, herbal formulas, weight-loss drink mixes, even CS-gas
 keyring spray containers used to ward off attackers, competitive
 with the Mace units you now see sold in stores.
   While working on this project, I got a real education in the
 private label business. The truth is that you can get just about
 any product made or sold anywhere manufactured and private-
 labeled for you, in surprisingly small quantities. Every industry
 has private label manufacturers, and they are easy to find because
 they tend to aggressively advertise in their industry’s trade mag-
 azines and exhibit at their industry’s trade shows. In the begin-
 ning, if you are starting out with small quantities and stock,
 standard formulations, there will be little or no negotiation—the
 manufacturer will have a price list. There are virtually no pitfalls.
 Most private label manufacturers even provide blanket product
 liability insurance that extends protection to your company. As
 you move into volume purchasing, you can negotiate prices, ex-
                       a

    manufacturer’s cost.
     The bottom-line is that it is remarkably easy, pleasant, and
    profitable to deal with most private label manufacturers. If you
    have a clever marketing or promotion plan, a means of distri-
    bution, a chain of stores, maybe even one store, a catalog, or a
    celebrity who’ll work with you to promote a particular type of
    product, you can probably have your own product or product
    line without research and development costs, without starting
    from scratch, and without having to invest in huge quantities by
    dealing with private label manufacturers.

    You Can Also Advertise for Products and
    Product Ideas and Let Them Come to You
   Some years ago, a friend of mine in the business of brokering
 products to the mail-order industry ran this ad in a major city
 newspaper:
       Millionaire consultant seeks inventors,
       manufacturers, importers, authors,
       etc., with unique products suitable for
     promotion to homeowners, do-it-yourselfers,
    gardeners, and hobbyists. Send your information
             in confidence to:
 He ran this ad one time, on a Sunday, in the Business Section,
 in a two-inch box. How many replies do you think he got?
   280.
   If you ran a comparable ad in a handful of magazines or
 newspapers or in USA Today, you’d probably be deluged.
      How Do You Pick a Winner?
   For most people, the most efficient approach is to first lock
 in on a market and a product category. This allows you to focus
 your energies and resources.
  The best way to pick your product category is to consider
 your own educational and vocational experience; your own in-
 terests; the subjects and activities you know a lot about already;
 the size, responsiveness, and reachability of different markets;
 and societal and economic trends. You’ll need to use a combi-
 nation of these to do the best job possible.
  You should also keep in mind that most highly promotable
 products, services, or businesses have at least one of these three

      conditioner is a great example of this type of product, and
      since its invention and early marketing, home and car air
      conditioners have moved from the luxury to the (perceived)
      necessity category. When the microwave oven was first man-
     ufactured it was assumed it would have only a limited market
      in the restaurant industry. But societal changes that made time
      such a precious commodity, and made fixing the evening
     meal fast a perceived necessity, provided the right environ-
     ment for the microwave to become a universally accepted and
      desired household appliance.
    2. They provide a much better way to perform a common task or
     do acommon, necessary job. Just about every kitchen gadget is
      sold with this theme. The ballpoint pen, the calculator, and the
      fax machine all fall into this category. Positioning an in-home
      fitness device against the costly, cumbersome task of going to
      the gym incorporates this idea into a marketing message. The
      self-sealing strip added onto plastic sandwich bags is this type
     of invention.
    3. They have some enormous emotional or impulse appeal that
      transcends logic and basic needs. ‘‘Snob appeal’’ products,
           ‘ the fanciest restaurant in town, and cosmetic products all fit
      into this category.
     Having a Mental, Emotional, and Experiential
      Link with Your Market Can Make You Rich
     A guy at one of my seminars said, ‘‘I just saw that ‘Flying
    Lure’ infomercial on TV, I read about how much money they’re
    making, and I’m going to find a fishing gizmo and do the same
    thing.’’
      “‘Do you fish?’’ I asked. This guy didn’t fish; in fact, he had
    never even gone fishing once, didn’t have any friends who did;
    heck, he’d never even heard of Field and Stream magazine. And
    he was about to dive in and have to swim upstream against some

business, Steve Pittendrigh and his team at InfoCision, feel so
 strong}y. about this “‘link’’ issue that when they’re making calls
 to sell golf products to previous buyers of golf products, they
 hire and staff the phones with telemarketers who play golf on
 their days off. When they’re making calls to solicit donations
 for a particular charity, they use telemarketers who are very sym--
 pathetic to the cause or philosophy of that charity. Why? Because
 a golfer knows another golfer when he hears one. Nothing you
 can do in a sales script can match the power of shared passion.
  Picking a market you are suited to exploit first and then going
 after salable products is a smart approach.

     HOW TO “REINVENT”
    YOUR WAY TO A FORTUNE
     ow would you like to have been the guy who invented the
     microwave oven? Or came up with Kleenex? Or 7UP? Or
    Dixie Cups? Or the Timex watch? Hey, you’d be in Fat City
    now, wouldn’t you!
     Maybe. Maybe not.
      In their first incarnations, every one of these products was a
    dead-bang loser. In his book, Getting It Right the Second Time
    Around, Michael Gershman tells the stories of these and other
    famous products that failed when first introduced to the market-
    place. In one way or another, they were ‘‘reinvented’’ before
    becoming successful. And there are fortunes to be had by clever
    entrepreneurs who creatively reinvent products, services, even
    entire businesses that are almost right.
       There Are as Many Ways to Reinvent
        as the Imagination Can Conceive—
           Plus One or Two More
     Our homes, closets, refrigerators, garages, and offices are full
    of products that had to be reinvented to succeed:

  were put on sale in—horror of horrors—pharmacies.
  Dixie Cups were originally just a component part of a cum-
  bersome water fountain no one would buy. |
  For the first six years of its existence, Kimberly-Clark did ev-
  erything that could be thought of to sell Kleenex as a superior
  makeup removal product. When they finally got around to
  checking up on the few customers that were buying the prod-
  uct, they discovered people were using it to blow their noses,
  not to take off makeup. The advertising was changed accord-
  ingly and sales boomed.
  7UP, originally called Bib-Label Lemon Lime Soda, was mar-
  keted as a means of settling infants’ upset stomachs. Later, as
  7UP, it was positioned as an adult hangover remedy. This
  product struggled for survival all the way into the 1960s, when
  the ‘“‘UNCOLA”’ ad campaigns caught on.
   If you are sitting with a product you passionately believe in
 but have been unable to market, you have to start by giving
 yourself an attitude checkup. You start by getting past blaming
 the stupid, unresponsive public, so you can make changes to the
 product that the public will respond to. The individual who
 brings an idea to the marketplace and gets hammered naturally
 prefers speculating about the idiocy of the public rather than
 looking in the mirror, shoving his bloodied nose aside, and
 squinting through his blackened eyes to look at the guy who
 missed the mark.
   ‘‘Everybody needs this product. How can they not see that?’’
 I’ve listened to countless thoroughly frustrated clients and
 would-be clients stuck on this thought. Then he’ll be off on a
 long celebration of how great his product is and what a genius
 he is, followed by a tirade about how dumb the customers are.
 I’ve heard it at least 1,000 times. I confess, I’ve muttered it
 myself a few times. But if you can set disappointment, frustra-
 tion, and ego aside and, with fresh eyes, find ways to reinvent,
 you can turn losers into winners. That’s the ThighMaster story.

```
  Last year, when I spoke as a member of a panel at the international convention of the Direct Marketing Association
(DMA), I got the inside story of this product’s failure from one
of my fellow panelists, Michael Clark, vice president of Ovations, Inc., the company that reinvented ThighMaster and produced its first successful TV commercials. Originally a Swedish
import invented by medical people, ThighMaster was given a
dull, technical-sounding name, and, after the inventors’ own attempts at TV advertising, was a failure. Here are the three
changes that turned ThighMaster from a loser into an enormous —
winner:

```
```
       So You Thought ThighMaster Was an
        Overnight Success? Think Again.
      Just how famous is ThighMaster? Murphy Brown got one at
    her baby shower. President Bush once joked that Marvin Fitz-
    water had busted his. Jay Leno jokes about it. Phil Donahue
    came out on stage wearing one on his head. The thing shows up
    in the darndest places. And millions of them have been sold.
      But this product was initially a turkey.
      In case you’ve been living in a cave, ThighMaster is a doo-
    hickey for women to put between their legs and exercise with to
    firm up their thighs. It has two blue foam-covered loops con-
    nected by a spring hidden inside a red plastic ball. It is pitched
    on television, in print ads, and on its box by Suzanne Somers,
    best remembered as the ditzy blonde on the sitcom Three’s Com-
    pany, a forty-five-year-old with the fantastic legs of a dancer half
    her age—the living, walking, prancing proof that ThighMaster
    works wonders.
      Last year, when I spoke as a member of a panel at the in-
    ternational convention of the Direct Marketing Association
    (DMA), I got the inside story of this product’s failure from one

    duced its first successful TV commercials. Originally a Swedish
    import invented by medical people, ThighMaster was given a
    dull, technical-sounding name, and, after the inventors’ own at-
    tempts at TV advertising, was a failure. Here are the three
    changes that turned ThighMaster from a loser into an enormous —
    winner:
     1. Product appearance. The original version was, well, ugly.
     The spring in the middle that creates the tension was visible,
      and looked like something you’d see under the hood of your
      car. And there was no mystique—it was just two loops
     hooked to a spring. Big deal.

  engine red plastic ball, now called ‘‘the hidden tension coil.’’
  The whole thing looks sort of space-agey.
 2. Positioning. The original version was designed and presented
   as a multipurpose exercise device. And, in the first commer-
   cials, women were shown in exercise leotards, in a workout
  environment, exercising with the thing. At my DMA panel,
  Michael Clark said, ‘“We decided that the person watching
  the TV commercial, sitting on the couch, might not be all that
  excited about leaving the couch and really working at this.’’
    Their new approach showed the device being used by —
  Suzanne Somers and others while sitting in a chair watching
   television, lying on a chaise lounge next to a swimming pool,
  and sitting in a comfortable chair, talking on the phone. The
  message: This isn’t exercise at all! And, to keep the message
  from being confused, they zeroed in on just one purpose—
  firming up the thighs—and changed the name to match.
 3. Celebrity. A celebrity spokesperson was sought out who
  would really use and benefit from the product, get involved ©
   in the business, and, as Michael put it, ‘‘go the distance’’—
  not only appear in advertising, but put her image on the pack-
  age, go to in-store appearances, create publicity, do inter-
  views, and in every way marry the product.
    The person who signed on was Suzanne Somers, who tells
  anybody who’ll listen that she uses her ThighMaster two or
  three times a day, carries one in her purse, takes it with her
  when she travels, and recommends it to friends. In an ap-
  pearance on The Maury Povich Show, she gave one to every
  member of the audience and they all sat there and Thigh-
  Mastered together while she answered questions.
    ‘*There’s no doubt that Suzanne put this product over the
   top,’’ Michael told me, ‘‘but even she couldn’t have made |
  the original version a hit without the other changes made to
  the product.’’
  Roughly one out of every twenty-five homes has a

   thanks to this clever reinvention.
     This success may—and probably should—pique your inter-
    est in obtaining a celebrity spokesperson for your product, ser-
    vice, or business. On a national level, many celebrities are found
   and obtained for entrepreneurs by professional celebrity brokers
    listed in chapter 13. You can also contact the celebrities or their
    agents directly, as a result of your own research with the Acad-
   emy of Motion Picture Arts Directories (see chapter 13). For
    local businesses, locally popular athletes or TV or radio person-
    alities can be just as effective as a much costlier national celeb-
    rity, and in most cases, you can contact these people directly.
     The costs for celebrities vary widely, depending on your
    product, whether you’re going to use the celebrity in print ad-
    vertising, direct-mail, or broadcast media nationally or region-
    ally, whether they are spokespersons or actually personally
   endorsing the product, and other factors. It’s not as expensive as
   most people think, though. Significant national celebrities can be
   obtained for national campaigns for as little as $10,000 to
   $25,000 a year, often plus a royalty tied to resulting sales.
