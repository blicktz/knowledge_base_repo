## PREFACE

 Price, Profit, Power, and Prosperity

**_(Why and How This One Book Can Be Worth at Least One Million Dollars to You)_**

## Dan Kennedy

**Price bedevils.**

**It lurks in the bushes, waiting until the sale is almost made, to leap out and scream “Boo!”**
Retailers fear Walmart, to such extent some close their businesses at the mere announcement that
Walmart is coming to town. The real source of their terror is price. Grown, mature adults engaged in
B-to-B sales quake in their boots at the prospect of facing a purchasing agent who is known to drive
a hard bargain. Business owners routinely under-price their goods and services to come in below
competitors, surrendering to the fear of losing customers by being judged unreasonably expensive—
oddly unaffected by the more appropriate fears of losing profits in the short-term, losing their
business to bankruptcy in the long-term. (Few lowest-price providers have ever avoided this fate.)
Price is a terrorist.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Walter Gibson, writing as Maxwell Grant, churned out hundreds of pulp
novels featuring the mysterious crime-fighter, “The Shadow.” There was also a radio show, and
more recently, a failed movie starring Alec Baldwin. The Shadow struck such fear in evil-doers that,
often, only his eerie laugh was necessary for their surrender. Living in fear that The Shadow would
suddenly emerge from the dark with cape swirling and guns blazing, they were terrorized by _all_
shadows, virtually driven insane by fear.

Like The Shadow, price strikes fear in the hearts of salespeople and business owners alike—to
such extent it compels business owners to reduce their prices without any real marketplace pressure
to do so or testing to validate their fear-based decisions. To such extent it makes the salesperson’s
voice quiver and palms sweat and body language go sour when he arrives at presentation of price,
telegraphing to his prospect that the price is too high. Like the evil-doers terrorized by all shadows,
business owners are terrorized by their fears about price rather than by any reality.

**Fear is a powerful thing. Another comic hero, Batman, is brought to his knees by the super-**
villain, The Scarecrow, his only weapon is a magic dust that creates unbridled horrific imaginings of
each person’s worst fears. Sprayed in one person’s eyes it instantly triggers that individual’s worst,
secret nightmares. Sprayed over an entire city, it produces mass-hypnosis, filling the streets with
imaginary monsters assaulting the population, sending each person into spiraling horror they will do
anything to escape—including killing others and themselves. The Scarecrow is a brilliant comic
book creation, because he has no real power. His only power comes from the fear he can create in
others, a turnabout of the idea behind his hero enemy Batman, who chose his bat identity and
costume and mystery to “strike fear in the hearts and minds of evil-doers.”

**In business, fear-based decisions turn out badly; feardriven behavior weakens and**
**ultimately destroys. I personally watched the owner of a thriving $100-million-a-year company**
give over a significant share of profits and control of his operations to a bullying, mostly bluffing
competitor who threatened to destroy the business with lower prices and massive advertising if he
wasn’t brought in as a partner. Once a partner, this “terrorist” destroyed the business from within in
order to create a vacuum in the market rather than compete head-on. I and many others cautioned
the company owner against voluntary capitulation rather than battle with possibilities of victory or
at least defeat with honor. There were reasons to believe the well-capitalized and ruthless bully
seeking entry to and instant dominance of this market could be turned back. It didn’t require simple
blind faith or stubborn determination to triumph against a well-capitalized and aggressive but naïve
and historically inept challenger. Still, this company owner was vanquished not by that opponent,
but by his own fear of that opponent.

**Not to say that paranoia is forbidden. Former CEO of the once-giant corporation ITT, Harold**
Geneen, while leading its rescue, said “Only the paranoid survive.” No business owner can skip,
prance, and dance along whistling a happy tune, drunk with his own optimism, in denial of all risks,

hazards, threats, and problems; nor, specific to price, can he merely do as he pleases, as whim
inspires, with no regard for his customers’ abilities and willingness to pay or for competitive factors.
A sense that the ground beneath is truly ice, and vigilance about thin spots, is required of anyone
running a business or his own sales career. One of my pet principles is that, whatever success you
have, you get out of bed and earn it by your own successful behavior each and every morning. But
you can’t let prudent paranoia grow to govern. Fortune favors the bold. Bold with reason, but bold.
Jason Marrs and I have built this book to embolden. To give you good reason to be bolder—and
more creative and inventive and effective—in using price to your extreme advantage, to be as
profitable as it is possible to be.

**Price, Profit, Power, and Prosperity = Choice**

Your prosperity begins with your price strategy.

Decisions about and presentation of price affect a great many things in a business, as you’ll
discover in this book. These include positioning, the kind of customers you attract, the kind of staff
you attract and their attitudes, your own pride, but most importantly, profit. Profit, in turn,
absolutely determines the strength or weakness, power or vulnerability your business possesses.
Profit regulates power as a thermostat adjusted up or down regulates room temperature. Profit
determines how bold and aggressive or timid and constrained you are in reaching out to acquire new
customers or creating brand identity and awareness;how well you can serve and satisfy customers—
which affects retention, repeat business frequency, and referrals; how well you can incentivize and
compensate staff in order to attract and keep the best and make managerial demands. Profit also
determines if your business can withstand temporary adversity, be that road torn up in front of your
store for six months or a recession lasting sixty months. Profit is power, and profit is the result of
price strategy. From this, prosperity or poverty, pride or disappointment, security or endless angst.
Prosperity for the business owner is created by the amount of money he can take out of his business
day to day without leaving it too thinly capitalized, to, in turn, meet his lifestyle needs, live free of
debt, and accumulate good assets and investments, as well as the money he may take out in a lump
sum and/or on-going payments via exit down the road. Profit governs this. In a closed loop, power
enables profit, and it all emanates from one source and one source only: price.

**You choose your prosperity by the choices you make about price.**

Although I am generally regarded as a marketing strategist, I believe I have had more farreaching impact on more entrepreneurs by influencing their price decisions than with anything else I
teach, any other advice I give, any other work I do. To that end, a story: In one of my private client
mastermind groups, where 20 different entrepreneurs met for two days at a time to hash out
problems and opportunities in their businesses together under my leadership, two partners presented
a new service they intended to add to their existing enterprise. It could be delivered only several
times a year, with a maximum of fifty customers accommodated each time, to be drawn from their
thousands of existing customers now buying lesser-priced products and services. They had done
some loosey-goosey research via surveys, focus groups, and analysis of similar or competitive
business and determined they could charge as much as $2,000.00 per person. Most of the others in
my group attacked these fellows instantly, in near unanimous and rather fervent agreement that their
proposed price was way, way too low for the value of the service to the right customer (an important
point) and the supply-demand ratio likely to exist given the pool of thousands to draw from. But
these guys were convinced that $2,000.00 was as far as this price could possibly be stretched. The
meeting ended in discord, despite my siding with the group against the partners’ price belief, and
making my best, reasoned argument.

Three months later, at the next meeting, these two partners presented a more fleshed out, ready to
advertise version of their proposed service, and stated their firm intent to price at $2,000.00. After
another round of heated debate, I left my place at the head of conference table, went into my office

-----

with my checkbook, returned, wrote out a check to the guys for $100,000.00 ($2,000.00 x 50), slid
it across the table, and said, “Enough debate. If you’re locked in and happy with your $2,000.00
price, I’ll buy all 50 customer positions. You deliver the service as you planned. You let me market
as I please to your current customer list, I’m going to sell this at $10,000.00, and make a very nice
$400,000.00 spread. Three times a year. $1.2 million. Take my check and let’s shake hands on this.”
They refused. They went home and rather shakily rolled out their service with a daring, to them,
price of $4,500.00, a 225% higher price than they’d proposed—and sold out the 50 spots quickly
and easily. Today, a few years later, they sell this for $6,500.00, with an $8,500.00 deluxe option,
and, at my urging, also figured out how to accommodate 100 rather than 50, and do it three times a
year. Over five years, the price strategy pushed on them is worth more than $7 million above what
they were committed to settling for. Truly an example of my friend Foster Hibbard’s maxim: Go to
_the ocean with teaspoon or bucket; the ocean doesn’t care._

**_This_** **is the power of price. Throughout this book, you will come to understand why such a huge**
spread existed between what these savvy, successful entrepreneurs believed the maximum possible
selling price was, and what it really was, and how to identify similarly inaccurate beliefs in your
mind and uncover amazing opportunities for explosive profit improvement in your business. In this
way, this book can have million dollar or multi-million dollar importance to you, beginning
**immediately, with collection occurring over the next few years. That is not empty hype. It is fact,**
established by the story I just told you being repeated in hundreds of different businesses, industries,
and professions hundreds of times as a result of my guidance and, at times, insistence.

One such demonstration belongs to my co-author, Jason Marrs, who has a personal price strategy
story that is, in many respects, much more remarkable than the one I just shared. Jason, as
marketing director for his wife’s large, thriving, multi-therapist professional practice in the field of
education and therapy for children, competes with free services very aggressively promoted by
government agencies and in partnership with the public school system, teachers, and counselors, as
well as with solo-therapist private practices charging fees a fraction of his wife’s. Jason has built an
extraordinary, enviable, profitable business with price strategy boldly defiant of a plethora of
government-imposed obstacles and cheaper and cheapest price competition. His success in this
difficult environment has not gone unnoticed. Others in his field and many others outside the
medical profession began asking him for his “secrets,” knocking on his door for consulting, and,
today, Jason is one of the foremost advisors and coaches to small business, medium-sized
companies, entrepreneurs, and professionals on price strategy. After all, if you want certain survival
on a camping trip, who better to recruit as your guide than a battle-scarred but successful survivor of
journeys through the most dangerous jungles on earth?—in this case, the land of “free.”

Together, Jason and I have a mission of liberating you from all fear or timidity toward price, and
of empowering you with both courage and price-strategy competence and creativity so that you can
substantially improve your business’ profitability and sustainability. To this, you need to bring as
open a mind as you possibly can. An intellectual willingness to re-examine your every belief about
price in your business, and to adapt rather than resist proven profit strategy drawn from outside the
narrow confines of your particular industry and your experience in it thus far. Today must be a new
day, not a stubborn re-living of the ones before.
