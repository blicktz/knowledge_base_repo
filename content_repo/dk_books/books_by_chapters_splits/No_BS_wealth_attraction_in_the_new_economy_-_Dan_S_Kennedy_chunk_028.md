## Always Bear Left

#### Quite a few years ago, a friend of mine with very eclectic interests spent a lot of time studying how people behaved in all sorts of situations and circumstances. One of the things that came out of it was his book titled Always Bear Left, so named as advice on getting in the shortest lines the majority of the time. He found that the majority of people move to the right and get in lines furthest away from the line or lines furthest to their left, presumably because more people are right-handed than left-handed, so they habitually think right first. They are drawn to the lines to their right by habitforce . Dr. Maxwell Maltz, author of the original Psycho-Cybernetics, and co-author with me of The New Psycho-Cybernetics, developed the concept of the Self-Image as a navigational device and governor of both behavior and achievement. Dr. Maltz explained that trying to act in conflict with your own self-image by means of conscious, deliberate, teeth-gritted, fists-clenched willpower can only be sustained in short bursts for short periods of time, then a snap-back effect occurs. This explains the dieter falling off the diet drastically with episodes of binge eating. Rather than fighting your own self- image with willpower, Dr. Maltz suggested re-programming the self-image so that behavior congruent with your objectives could occur naturally. He spoke of this as replacing an Automatic Failure Mechanism with an Automatic Success Mechanism.

 If you combine these concepts, you can see just how much we are controlled by habitforce. What we have thought is what we think, what we have done is what we do. Changing your attractiveness to

#### wealth and thus your actual wealth has to be preceded by changing your habits.

 In this context, consider The New Economy. It is more demanding than its parent of those to whom it will give wealth. Old habits of thought and personal behavior and business practice must be replaced with new ones compatible with its new demands.

 Ultimately, habitforce either works for you or against you.

 Consider a simple thing such as getting to work. Most people have the habit of getting to their workplace and then wandering around, engaging in trivial conversation with others while getting coffee in the break-room or from the café across the street, looking at the newspaper, and finally shuffling papers before deciding what they are going to do first. I have developed the habit of organizing my first work of the day the night before, assigning start and stop times to my planned tasks, and going directly from my bed down the stairs to my office and immediately getting into my work. Who do you think has more accomplished by 9:00 A.M. each morning? I give myself advantage. Others handicap themselves. Way back when, when I was in outside sales, I formed the habit of setting up breakfast meetings at clients’ businesses, arriving with coffee and pastry at 8:00 A.M.—which forced me to get to productive work early everyday. Other salespeople putter around and procrastinate most of most mornings. When you commit to highly productive habits, you build up an Automatic Success Mechanism. You put habitforce on your side as an ally.

 Energy From People

#### T here are very practical obstacles to wealth attraction that short circuit your wealth attraction.
 The first big obstacle is incompetent people. Sometimes these are people incapable of handling the responsibilities or doing the jobs entrusted to them. More frequently these are people able but unwilling to do the jobs. They are lazy and uncreative. They have no sense of urgency or initiative, so they will do only the minimum, they will not figure out solutions, they will let their progress be stalled by the slightest challenge, and return everything to your lap. Dealing with such people is a miserable, sadly common experience. Every entrepreneur wrestles with these people. They may be employees, vendors, advisors, others .
 Another, related obstacle: people who waste or abuse your time, what I call “time vampires.” This bunch can just as easily include certain clients or customers as employees and vendors.

-----

#### Another, related obstacle: People who drain or divert your mental energy, who disrupt the flow of your wealth attraction. Negative people, gloom ’n’ doom people, whiners and complainers. Mike Vance, former Dean of Disney University, calls them pissers and moaners. This bunch can just as easily include friends and relatives as employees, vendors, customers, or clients.
 They must all go. The minute you detect their toxic odor, take action to get them out of your business, out of your life, to distance yourself from them. You need to develop a Zero Tolerance Policy about all these people and be decisive, even ruthless in enforcing it. Hesitancy and timidity in doing so will always cost you more than whatever temporary trauma and disruption results from making changes in your staff, vendors, or others around you. Always.
 I’ll give you a very common example. A client with five staff members in his office brought me in, to observe, interview, analyze, look at his business from top to bottom with my “fresh eyes.” I told him that his majorette domo, his key office manager, the employee who had been with him the longest had to go. I told him she was sabotaging his new initiatives behind his back, ignoring procedures he wanted followed, damaging morale, and driving away good clients. I told him she was the equal of an open vat of toxic chemicals. He insisted he needed her, relied on her, couldn’t function without her; at bare minimum, the disruption caused by firing her would be disastrous. It took me over a year to convince him to give the old battleax the ax. Immediately after doing so, sales increased; he made no other changes; no increased advertising; she exited, enter more income. Within the year, the business was 30% more profitable, the remaining employees measurably more productive, my client happier, more relaxed, and more productive. By the following year, his net worth had increased by nearly $500,000.00, and he had enough liberated time to finally launch a second business he’d been back-burnering for years. A “wealth block” had been surgically removed, vibrant health created by its removal.
 Think of your wealth attraction power as electric current. Years ago, strings of Christmas lights could be short-circuited by any loose bulb, any burnt-out bulb or any bad fuse. If there was one of these anywhere in the entire string of lights, it disrupted the flow of power, and the entire string shut off. I remember helping my father unscrew and test bulb after bulb, fuse after fuse, to find the one bad one. The power cord that runs between

-----

#### you and the world supply of wealth and the world supply of wealth and you has a very similar flaw. One disruptive person laying a finger on it anywhere along the line shuts down the entire flow of power.
 I try my level best to operate a Zero Tolerance Policy toward people who disrupt the flow of my wealth attraction power. Be they employee, vendor, associate, or client, I will not tolerate their interference with the flow of wealth to me. I rid myself of them, even if at considerable, temporary cost. I have, on several occasions, stopped projects for clients after I’ve done a lot of work on them, refunded as much as $70,000.00, just to get rid of the client who was a “problem child,” seriously interfering with my flow of power.
 One of my rules:

#### If I wake up three mornings thinking about you, and I’m not having
 sex with you, you’ve got to go .

#### Most people tolerate others causing them undue stress and aggravation, without realizing how costly such tolerance is. I want you to understand: it is very, very costly.
 The opposite of all this is the assembly and organization of your own small cadre of exceptionally competent, highly creative, extraordinarily reliable and trustworthy individuals who are in sync and harmony with you and your objectives, who facilitate and even multiply your wealth attraction power. If you read Lee Iacocca’s autobiography, you saw his description of this as his “horses,” the few key people he relied on. If you carefully observed Donald Trump during his Apprentice television programs, read his books, and read his biography, you realized that George Ross and several

-----

#### other key people make Trump possible. Without them Trump wouldn’t be and couldn’t be Trump. You will find this “theme” true of all incredibly accomplished, successful, and wealthy entrepreneurs.
 In short, the people around you, the people who populate your world, the people you rely on either enhance or sap your wealth attraction power. No person with whom you interact is a neutral factor. Each and every person either drains power from you or contributes power to you. One or the other. Power source or power drain. Ally or enemy. Black or white.
 Refusing to face the black-and-white nature of this, with clarity and accuracy and honesty, is a major obstacle to wealth attraction. Refusing to act appropriately and decisively about what you deduce about a person, about a power drainer, is a major obstacle to wealth attraction.

## How To Build a “Power Team” Around You

#### I have been very, very fortunate in my life to have had a number of people around me who have added to my power. They have changed over time, some left, some came. Change is inevitable. But I have certainly had an enormous amount of support.
 Mine is in tiers . In the first tier have been spouses, close associates, close friends, people I’ve relied on heavily, at different times, in different ways. My second wife, Carla, for example, was an important, chief source of support and power for many of the 22 years of our marriage. After a brief divorce, we are re- married and, in different ways than before, she is a greater source of support than ever before. At present, Bill Glazer, who publishes my No B.S. Marketing Letter, is President of Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™], and his crackerjack staff, and Pete Lillo, who publishes another of my newsletters, are enormously valuable business associates I can rely on without equivocation. Vicky Tolleson, my lone employee, office manager, personal assistant, time-and-access sentry, problem solver, and client services director, is valuable beyond description. These people and a very short list of others, past or present, work with me pretty much on my terms, with the prime purpose of supporting and facilitating my productivity. They view

-----

#### their responsibility and best interests as making it possible for me to function at peak performance. I also have a very short list of people I can rely on for advice, counsel, information. It features Lee Milteer, a close friend and associate, who is a reliable sounding board, encourager but also questioner. The total number of people in this tier, at any given time, is less than a dozen.
 In the second tier are both suppliers and clients. For example, for 11 years, I’ve run a formal “mastermind group” exclusively for information marketers in business akin to my own, all highly successful and innovative, all wealthy. While they pay me well to organize, host, facilitate, and direct the group and its meetings, I also participate as a member and benefit from the exchange of ideas and information. This tier also includes my CPA firm, the person I am most involved with in real estate investments, Darin Garman, and other paid advisors.
 In the third tier are all the other clients I work with, the other vendors I rely on, the other sources of information I access, trade associations I belong to. Included here, for example, is the publisher of this book, its editor, its marketing people, my other publishers, my literary agents, my publicist. Also included are my consulting and copywriting clients who I work for and who support me, but toward whom I must still act discriminately. Also included, editors, graphic artists, web masters, other professionals and vendors I use intermittently, project by project.
 This is “Planet Dan,” a world I create and own and control, populated only by people I permit to be there, governed by laws I legislate and enforce. It’s a small planet, so I have some level of personal relationship with every inhabitant of the planet. Everyone of these relationships is a two- way street. They all influence me as I influence them. That’s unavoidable. They all either enhance or drain my energy. They all either support and facilitate or interfere with my productivity. They all either enhance or disrupt my wealth attraction.
 This is true of every single person you permit existence in your world, too. Rule your world accordingly.

 Courage

#### I have an unpublished book I’ve been working on, off and on, for years with the words “brass balls” in its title. The publishers I’ve approached lack the brass balls to publish it! You can, however, get the gist of its 300-page message just from those two words. The meek may inherit the earth, but not anytime soon. Fortune favors the bold. Courage attracts wealth.
 You have to put yourself out there. I’m not talking about taking unbridled financial risk, although from time to time, you do have to put some chips on the table. This is about your ego, self-esteem, reputation, relationships, dealing with the ever-present “what will he/she/they think of me?”
 You need courage to act on your ideas. Courage to defy conventional wisdom or even the expert advice you solicit when you believe best. Courage to start before you are ready, to fumble around in the dark, screw up. Courage to face embarrassment, humiliation, rejection. Courage to stand by your convictions. Courage to make demands, set rules and boundaries,

-----

#### define the way you will do business, impose your will on the world around you. Courage to end unproductive relationships, fire uncooperative employees or clients. Courage to wrest control of your time from everyone around you. Courage to define and pursue goals. Courage to ask, promote, sell aggressively, forcefully, noisily, visibly. Courage to ignore criticism and to focus on results.

#### “You don’t need experience to do many things. You can learn as you go along.”

## Wealth rarely rewards wimps.

#### In an ethereal sense, I think wealth is waiting, watching the entrepreneur, holding back a while, just to see how big and brassy his balls are—or how small and dull. (And to be gender sensitive, I want to mention that two female fans of mine, both highly successful entrepreneurs, created a company called Women With Balls as paean to this idea.) At some point, wealth’s admiration, even lust for the incredibly strong, certain, unwavering, resilient entrepreneur boils over and wealth comes running toward the entrepreneur, wealth gives herself up totally and completely. (Need a cold shower?)

#### There are very real forces that govern the movement of money. Money doesn’t move around from one person to another, by fate, accident, luck. It moves for reasons, in response to magnetic forces. Money moves because of Authority—that’s why experts get rich, why the top cardiac surgeon at Cleveland Clinic is so much wealthier than the generalist M.D. just down the street. Money moves with Transfer of Responsibility—that’s how financial planners and advisors, brokers, and money managers get rich. Money moves on a base level because of Value Exchange. But most of all, it is my understanding that money moves because of Courage.

 Pace

#### I f you do not live in New York City, when you visit, you will very quickly notice that the entire city is vibrating at high energy and in motion at a very different pace than just about anywhere else you’ve ever been. It is so relentlessly intense that New York businesspeople must engineer frequent weekend and summer escapes to avoid completely burning out. In Las Vegas, big-time casinos like Caesars Palace have a different pace on Friday and Saturday nights than on week nights or afternoons and it definitely influences peoples’ behavior and how they part with their money. People who’ve hung around and observed me at work, in my regular work environment, or on a TV infomercial set or at a multi-day conference, have often commented on observing a distinct difference in pace than they’ve been accustomed to. At Disney World, they have a little trick of altering the pace of the background music playing throughout the park as closing time approaches, to re-energize the weary and move them toward the exits more
