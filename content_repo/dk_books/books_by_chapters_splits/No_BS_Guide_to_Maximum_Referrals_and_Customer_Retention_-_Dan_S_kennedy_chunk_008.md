##### delivery franchise, I chose it because of its apparent exceptional opportunity for customer retention. I had figured out that if I could simply keep every customer I signed up—forever—my business would grow faster, be more secure, and be more profitable. Keeping customers is success. Losing customers is failure. Seems simple, but for many business owners, it’s a revelation!
 One of the reasons I purchased this franchise was because the franchisor said it had great customer retention rates and the logic made sense. The franchise owners would drive by their customers’ houses on a weekly basis and check for a bright green bag on the front porch. If the bag was there, on average, that person had $25 worth of dry cleaning in it, which equaled out to $50 per month because the average person put out their bag twice. There was no extra charge for the pickup or delivery of the clothes. No wonder they had such great retention! Who would drive their clothes to a dry cleaner when they could have them picked up and delivered for free? Surprise. As logical as that seemed to me, every customer failed to agree with me!
 I assumed as long as we didn’t lose or ruin anyone’s stuff, our retention would be off the charts, and I was mostly correct. My goal for this business was to get to $25,000 per month in gross sales. The math was simple: If I had a customer average of $50 and wanted to get to $25,000 in gross sales, all I had to do was sign up 500 customers, assuming once I signed up a new customer, I didn’t lose any of them. In the end, I had to sign up 750 customers to get to 500 using customers. Some 250 people either tried us a few times and never used us again, or left for a variety of other reasons.
 Our primary method for signing up new customers was to go door to door in high-end neighborhoods. Hard work. It took me 12 months of door- to-door sales to hit my goal of 500 using customers. Had I retained 125 more customers, I could have shaved more than two months off of my door- knocking efforts or increased sales by an additional 25 percent or $6,250 per month had I decided to knock on doors for two additional months. Today, I am much more sophisticated in how I build businesses for myself and for clients, and much more focused on creating retention, rather than presuming it is earned just by good service.
 I tell myself and my clients: You can’t keep 100%. But we should find any significant losses unacceptable. We should be hyperattentive to attrition

##### versus retention. Here’s why.
 Back in 2002, I looked at customer retention and used the above simple math to calculate what losing customers was costing me in both dollars and extra time spent growing. Although my math was correct, I was only looking at a small piece of the puzzle. Because I was only using basic calculations, I wasn’t seeing all the money I was leaving on the table when losing previously loyal customers. These numbers became clear, however, once I started using more advanced calculations, which we will walk through in my next chapter. I will also share a case study where we go in- depth on the real cost of a lost customer. You will see, clearly, how financially fatal that retention failure can be!
 Dan Kennedy talks a lot about knowing, doing, and using “Money Math.” There are many different aspects, many of which he explores in his book, No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits, Second Edition. He would tell you that of all the Money Math that you need to understand and manage, none of it is as closely linked to how much or how little wealth is created for you by and in your businesses than preservation of customers over long periods of time—except in very high transaction, once or twice in a lifetime purchase businesses, in which case, retention of customers’ goodwill and interest in order to get referrals again and again over time is important.
 Because of Money Math, I made yet another move away from the pack in business. I do not just think of myself as an entrepreneur. I also think of myself as an investor. By the time we’re through here, you will too!

## Math Class

##### by Dan Kennedy

 he best motivation for redirecting your energy and investment from pursuit of new customers to retaining, better monetizing, and multiplying the customers you have is going to a “money math” class. In this book, Shaun Buck does a masterful job of presenting

# Tthe true math of the lost customer. Frankly, it’s a bit of a slog. You have to

##### stop, think, and calculate. It’s worth it. Please do. Other chapter contributors also point to the math. Here, I’d like to start you with a simple but profound calculation. It requires you to know a number you probably don’t know, and it’d be better if you gathered up some information rather than guesstimating.
 The number to know is: What does it cost you to get a new customer? This is the cost of all your public advertising, marketing, promotion, promotional discounts on first transactions, plus some allocated percentage of your entire overhead—the same percentage as new customers contribute to revenue—added together, then divided by the number of new customers occurring, by month and by year. If, for example, you have three stores of some kind, and you spend $15,000.00 a month on advertising on radio, TV, print, online, plus 20 hours of yours or an employee’s “doing” social media (20 × $50.00 hour = $1,000.00), and your rent, light, phone, payroll, taxes


-----

##### and other overhead is $60,000.00 a month and you find that 30% of your revenue comes from new customers who never return equals $20,000.00 . . . . your total tab for getting new customers works out to $36,000.00 for the month. If you got 300 new customers, the cost is $120.00 each.
 In “big thumb math,” then, the lost customer costs you $240.00, because you invested $120.00 to get him and it’ll cost $120.00 to replace him.
 Getting a grip on these numbers is very important. This is how you make informed decisions about your marketing investments.
 Most business owners are underinvesting in marketing, by the way, thus stunting and restricting their growth and leaving themselves vulnerable to competition—which can be cured by my advice in Chapter 16. If this hypothetical business is par, the $120.00 being spent should be $240.00, thus the lost customer cost is really $480.00. But it’s even worse. Lost customers can’t refer, and beyond an early customer life surge, every customer should at least bring in one a year. So, in the year you lose one, you lose another $240.00 to $480.00, bumping the total to $480.00 or $960.00. This is called: attrition cost.
 The reason a lot of businesses’ profits fail to increase is that these costs of attrition are outweighing the profits gained from restocking with new customers.
 If this business invested $60.00 a year per customer just “making nice with” their existent customers for purposes of retention, it could avoid spending $240.00 to replace a lot of wandered-off ones. But, actually, they’d also recoup the money by increased patronage from the retained and happier, more engaged customer.
 Investing in reducing attrition is every bit as useful, potentially profitable, and valid as is investing in acquiring new customers, but few business owners treat the two as equals.
 I’ll stop. There’s more math to come. You were already interested in retention and referrals when you got this book. But I want you exiting it persuaded, convinced, and determined about it. So, this book is, in part, a big, long, fat sales presentation for investing in your own very, very robust retention and referral systems. As if we had them out in the back seat of the car in boxes and were in your shop or office selling them.
 It’s not that simple.


-----

##### But, also, pretty much everything you need to construct those systems is here, in these pages, and at online resources you’re directed to, that expand the book.
 It all starts, though, with commitment and determination. My speaking colleague of many years, the famous Zig Ziglar, frequently used the old chestnut that to breakfast a chicken contributes, but the pig is committed. The sports term is: all in. Constructing, implementing, and maintaining a retention system and a referral system requires investments: attention, interest, desire, time, energy, and money. If you had $100,000.00 to spend, which would you be more likely to do: Hire a salesman to go out and get new accounts or hire a retention and referrals director tasked with reducing attrition and boosting referrals? If your schedule got re-arranged to cough up ten hours a week, would you be more likely to invest in marketing, prospecting, and selling to get new customers or in marketing to retain and raise the value of existent customers? Truthful answers are revealing.

## The 5% Solution

##### by Shaun Buck

 his chapter is about how big an impact a small number can have.
 Business owners tend to focus on growth in gross revenue terms. That’s how the pack thinks. For that reason, small numbers

# Tdon’t interest or motivate them. There’s a lot of passion for THE Big Idea

##### that will produce BIG Growth, preferably overnight. This is the same sort of pack thinking that keeps hordes of overweight people trying one new pill or one new “trick” diet after another after another after another, in place of organizing a sensible eating plan and a basic exercise regimen and sticking to it.
 Of course, there’s nothing wrong with a single, big, epic, magically transformative breakthrough, if you can find or invent one. But most success and wealth in business, especially in established businesses, doesn’t happen that way. Profit growth tends to come from small things combined or multiplied. What McDonalds’ founder Ray Kroc called “grinding it out.”
 Here, I’m going to demonstrate how an apparently small number—5% —can have a big impact.
 My first customer ever at The Newsletter Pro is still with me today. I want to use him as a case study. He is a dentist in a suburb of Boise, Idaho.


-----

##### Don’t allow his profession or location to send you down the path of thinking “my business is different” and this case study doesn’t apply to you. That’s how broke business owners think. Those specifics do not matter. What I want you to focus on are the numbers.
 Dr. Taylor opened his practice two years before he and I met. His practice was located in the southern section of a small but very affluent part of town. Less than a mile away was West Boise, and directly across from his office was the northernmost town of Meridian, Idaho, one of the fastest- growing cities in America. To say his location was prime real estate for the area is a bit of an understatement.
 Dr. Taylor’s office building was massive. It had room for at least a dozen operatories where they could clean patients’ teeth and provide other services. Only six operatories had been equipped at the time; three were ones Dr. Taylor rented to another dentist whose primary location was on the opposite side of the county. In other words, he had enormous unused capacity. Or less optimistically said, he had a vastly overbuilt facility. I’ll credit him with vision and ambition.
 When I met Dr. Taylor, it was obvious he was a highly skilled dentist with a good chairside manner and no ego, which is not always the case when you are dealing with doctors of any kind. His practice was very small personnel-wise. At the time, he was employing one full-time front desk person and one part-time hygienist. He was his own assistant, and when the hygienist was not at the practice, Dr. Taylor did all the hygiene work himself.
 As I previously mentioned, Dr. Taylor had a good location and wanted to grow, so we started working with him and put two campaigns into place simultaneously. The first was a multistep direct-mail campaign designed to get new patients in the front door. The second was a monthly print newsletter meant to decrease the number of patients Dr. Taylor was losing annually as well as to increase referrals. Regarding the first campaign, hey, more new patients were needed and would be exciting. But I knew that there was more opportunity than met the eye from growth by retention and referrals, rather than by costlier and more difficult new patient marketing to strangers. This is the opposite way from the pack. Most people assume they’ll keep customers just by providing good products and services, and


-----

##### get their share of referrals automatically, so they hunt for new customers in the wild.


#### RESOURCE

##### If you want to check to get examples of the multistep direct- mail campaigns and newsletters used by Dr. Taylor, just head to www.nobsreferralbook.com. This is a free website I have set up to provide you with additional free resources.


##### At the time, Dr. Taylor was losing about 17% of his patients per year. That number is very average. Most businesses we work with, prior to starting with us, tend lose between 15% and 33% of their customers annually. For Dr. Taylor, our goal was to simply decrease his 17% loss to 12%. In a professional practice, 12% is about as low as you can get because regardless of how great your service or how strong your relationship with patients, people still move away and still die.
 Considering how small Dr. Taylor’s practice was at first, it may surprise you that he invested any money in patient retention at all. To be honest, many less sophisticated dentists skip patient retention and end up dumping 100% of their marketing money into new patients, but Dr. Taylor knew that his current patients were the ones keeping the lights on and were the ones feeding his kids. They were the lifeblood of his business and were therefore not to be treated as second priority.
 So, we began with the 17% fact—we developed the 5% solution (see Figure 3.1).

**FIGURE 3.1**


-----

#### 5% Matters—More Than Most Think
##### In this chapter I want to take you through a case study of Dr. Taylor’s business’s numbers (see Figure 3.2). This chapter is filled with math and numbers, which I know is not a strong area for everyone, but stick with me here, these numbers can literally change your life.
 Let’s look at Dr. Taylor’s numbers today:

 • Dr. Taylor has 3,800 active patients.
 • The average cost to acquire a new patient is $213.00.
 • The revenue for each new patient is broken down over the first three
 years they do business with the practice. Most patients stay much longer than three years, but for this case study, we stopped at year three for average patient revenue.
 • Average first-year revenue: $893.00
 • Average second-year revenue: $1,215.00
 • Average third-year revenue: $1,596.00

 Now, before I go on, I want to point out that in some dental practices, first-year revenue can be skewed on the high side when compared to similar businesses because of the patient who comes in and needs thousands and thousands of dollars in dentistry to fix years of neglect.

**FIGURE 3.2**


-----

##### As you can see from the numbers, the longer a patient is with this practice, the more money they spend on average. This trend of longevity continues with the average patient at this practice being worth $1,900.00 per year in year five. See Figure 3.3 on page 16.
 At a 17% attrition rate, Dr. Taylor was losing 425 patients per year or 35 patients per month. According to a 2014 Dental Economics survey, the average dental practice adds 26.39 new patients to their practice per month or 317 new patients per year. With a 17% patient loss rate, if Dr. Taylor was simply adding this average number of patients to his practice each year, his total patient revenue and his patient base would be declining year over year. Most try fixing this by substantially outperforming the average for acquiring new patients, as if that were the only fix available. But attracting and seducing strangers is hard work. In business, it tends to be difficult and expensive. Investment in retention, by comparison, can be a bargain. Simply, there is often more profit in retention than in acquisition.


-----

**FIGURE 3.3**

##### Of course, Dr. Taylor did focus on patient retention, but if we spend a minute on this hypothetical example, we would see that he needed to get 108 new patients, on top of the average 317, at a cost of $213.00 per new patient, for a total additional investment of $23,004.00 just to stay even. Of course that $23,004.00 comes straight off the bottom line, and frankly, it is demoralizing to work all year and spend a ton of money on marketing, only to end up in the exact same place you started. You can find yourself a hamster running on a wheel, stuck in place, yet running very hard!
 Let’s get back to the case study. If we invest in patient retention and are able to bring the percentage of lost patients down from 17% to 12%, a bit of magic starts to happen. The 12% patient attrition equals 300 lost patients per year or 25 lost patients per month, which, compared to losing 425 patients, is a huge difference of 125 people! But that doesn’t tell the whole story.
