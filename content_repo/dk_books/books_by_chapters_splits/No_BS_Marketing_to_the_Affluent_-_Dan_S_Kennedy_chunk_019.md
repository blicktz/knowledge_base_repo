##### Any marketer who finds ways to convey comparative and competitive status to his affluent male customers and clients has advantage.
 This is why visible tiered pricing and attached privilege is such a powerful price strategy in catering to the affluent in general, and affluent men in particular. Many will choose the higher price option, some the highest price option purely because of its conveyed status, whether they actually want the differential goods or services in those higher level options or not.
 This works best when a customer’s “level” is visible and seen by others. As a piece of “inside baseball,” if you explore www.NoBSInnerCircle.com, you’ll discover different Member levels, and you’ll discover two major Member conventions/conferences each year. For the conferences, I created the Diamond Members’ Lounge, a glass-walled, very visible lounge area with comfortable seating and always-present free beverages and snacks. A refuge from the crowds outside. Lower-caste Members see it, but can’t enter it. At these same conferences, there is usually one celebrity speaker, and only Diamond Members get a meet and greet photo opportunity with that celebrity. Because all this is promoted and visible, it drives a significant number of membership upgrades during conference registration and on-site. The upgrade from the level closest to Diamond (Gold) to Diamond is worth about $2,300.00 to the company the first year alone. 100 upgraded by this status-seeking is $230,000.00. 400 is nearly a million dollars. I’d add, Diamond Members tend to take everything provided to them more seriously, and apply themselves to it and apply it in their businesses more assiduously, so the differential value they gain far exceeds their differential cost.

 Men and Their Toys In Chapter 15, I talk at length about spending on personal passions.

##### and training with this thing. You can also buy one for $150,000.00. Golfers are notorious for trying anything, going to any extreme, or paying any sum to shave a few strokes off their games. But they are not unique. Fishermen, hunters, other sportsmen, as well as collectors, cigar aficionados, wine connoisseurs—if there’s a competitive passion, there’s indulgence. I call these ideal customers “irrational, affluent buyers of The Slight Edge,” meaning they’ll buy into and pay any amount for anything promising a competitive edge over their friends in a shared activity. It’s important to understand that their career or business success providing their spending power is linked to this philosophical approach and ingrained behavior: investing as necessary in obtaining even the slightest of competitive advantages, at every opportunity. To see it carried over into their hobbies and recreational pursuits is no surprise, nor an oddity.
 Personally, I get it. I own and drive Standardbred racehorses, and spend, let’s say, aggressively on it. I also own and drive several classic cars at any given time, collect certain authors’ rare and first edition books, and collect Disney memorabilia. Price rarely enters these buying decisions. In a way, this is a giant toy chest and playroom. Only the racing is obviously competitive. But in reality, it is all in context of competition, with other bidders or buyers, with time itself—to react and get the one-of-a-kind item before anyone else, even with self, by achievement or ownership above and beyond prior benchmarks.
 Everything for the accomplished, affluent man is a competition. It’s never just about having a toy; it’s always about having a toy others don’t or can’t have, and/or about having the newest, hottest, coolest, biggest, and best toy.

### Marketing to Affluent LGBTQ Consumers

##### “When it is a question of money, everyone is of the same religion.”

—VOLTAIRE

# If you are going to go where the money is, pursue the greatest spending
##### power, then you will be joining an ever-increasing number of companies (still somewhat quietly) reaching out specifically to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer consumers.
 In many cases, you have a two-person household, each of its members with above-average education earning above-average incomes—many with no children to raise. They have a lot more money left over every month than their heterosexual counterparts across the street, who have a tricycle and


-----

##### two bicycles lying in the driveway, signifying the existence of three eating, clothes-growing-out-of, medical-emergencies-having, college-fund-needing little monsters living inside.
 I’m willing to say here what hardly anybody else is: The vast majority of readers of this book—and of marketers, period—are heterosexuals who may profess having no problems with LGBTQ people but are, in truth, uncomfortable and squeamish about the very idea of designing advertising and marketing programs to attract them as customers, clients, or patients. This chapter may even be making your skin crawl. You may have religious or morality-based beliefs that interfere with tolerance, let alone acceptance. You may simply find “these people” foreign, incomprehensible, and unfamiliar, making you uncomfortable for no other reason than that. Some of those issues are more easily manageable than others. I am certainly not here to tell you what you should or shouldn’t believe or feel. And I happen to be in favor of a business owner managing their business to suit their personal preferences. If, for your own nonbusiness reasons, you have no interest in or willingness to deliberately and specifically market to affluent gays and lesbians, and be of service to them, now would be a good time to skip ahead to the next chapter. Just know it is a bad business decision and, if you’re running a business in which there are shareholders other than yourself, a fiscally irresponsible decision.
 And, whether you like it or not, it is antiquated. In a New Yorker cartoon, two obviously gay men are seen in their apartment, one talking on the phone, responding to a question: “No, we’re not going to the Gay Pride Parade this year. We’re here, we’re queer, and frankly, we’re tired of making a big deal out of it.” Mainstream America includes gays and lesbians. Time to get over it.
 This does not, however, mean that they are a fully absorbed group unresponsive to targeted marketing and specially directed messages. To the contrary, they consistently reward those marketers who make a special point of designing unique advertising to appear in the publications only they read and creating especially gay-friendly sales and business environments. The trick, as it is when appealing to any specific group, is not to be condescending or clumsy.

##### The Facts of This Market

 • Research verifies that 80% of gay people have incomes above the
 national average; 40% earn more than $100,000.00 a year. (Source: Community Marketing)
 • The combined buying power of LGBTQ adults in the U.S. exceeds
 $915 billion and is rising. (Source: Witech, 2016)
 • LGBTQ consumers spend over $64 billion a year on travel. (Source:
 Community Marketing) The travel industry has, for good reason, been one of the earliest and most progressive and aggressive industries to develop product offerings, advertising, and marketing specifically aimed at the LGBTQ consumers. Way back in 2007, The Wall Street Journal carried an article headlined “Las Vegas Goes All Out to Attract Gay Travelers.” It reported on numerous resorts’ and casino companies’ marketing strategies and initiatives directed exclusively at gays as well as products and experiences designed for them. For example, it mentioned that at the trendy Palms Casino, there’s a line of mostly straight men, some couples, and a few women waiting for entry to the Playboy Club’s® party, featuring the iconic Playboy Bunnies® in push-up bras costumes. Only steps away, there’s another line awaiting entry to another club, with a dance floor filled with gyrating, shirtless men dancing with each other. Harrah’s Entertainment started aggressively marketing to gay men 18 months after the extensive research it commissioned revealed that they spend an average of 30% more than straight men when traveling. To put a bit of money math to that statistic, you could have 1,000 straight customers at your resort each spending, say, $2,000.00 or 1,000 gay customers each spending $2,600.00. The net difference is $600,000.00. Multiply that by 52 weekends, and you get $31.2 million. As you can see, who you bring through your doors matters a lot. This applies to you regardless of your business category—travel, restaurants, clothing store, furniture store, financial planning, whatever—both as a general principle and, specifically, regarding gay and lesbian consumers. In many categories, the gays are worth more than the straights. Marketing to the gay and lesbian population is, in


-----

##### its essence, taking a shortcut to a more affluent, more freely spending clientele.

##### • Gay consumers are twice as likely to buy a vacation home, six times
 more likely to buy and have installed a home theater system, and even eight times more likely to own multiple mobile devices and computers than heterosexuals. (Source: Simmons Market Research Bureau)
 • LGBTQ households make 10% to 20% more shopping trips to malls,
 stores, and other retail locations than the average U.S. household. (Source: Nielsen)
 • In B2B, business spending, 30% of LGBTQ employees and
 executives control budgets or purchasing decisions. 60% of those people surveyed say that the reputation of a vendor company for being LGBTQ-friendly affects purchasing decisions. (Source: Simmons Market Research Bureau) Corporate America is gradually becoming more open to and about having LGBTQ in high places. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, comes to mind, having officially come out in 2014. In 2018, Land O’ Lakes made news as the first Fortune 500 company to appoint an openly gay woman as CEO.

 Marketers ignore or resist all this to their detriment.

 How to Match Media with This Market


-----

##### The top three ways the LGBTQ consumers are likely to learn a business is LGBTQ-inclusive are: advertising specifically in LGBTQ media—49%; articles and news stories—47%; sponsorship of LGBTQ charity events or organizations—41%. (Source: Community Marketing & Insights Survey 2018)
 LGBT and LGBTQ, incidentally, are terms that can be used in these environments, across all generations, without risk of offense.
 The affluent LGBTQ consumers are more engaged online than the general population, so reaching them requires more attention to and use of online and social media. Versus the general population, they are 1.8X more interested in receiving advertising via their mobile phones, 2X more connected by hours in a day, and 1.5X more likely to post and consider online reviews.

 Can Outright Target Marketing Work? Yes.
 The automaker Subaru turned their struggling company around by advertising to a group of consumers other car companies were ignoring: lesbians. Internal research showed that a surprising number of their customers were lesbian, so they doubled down with advertising crafted for those buyers. Subaru ads featured captions like “It’s Not A Choice. It’s The Way We’re Built,” and utilized openly gay celebrities like tennis star Martina Navratilova. Mercedes-Benz quickly followed suit, advertising specific car models to the LGBTQ community. Obviously, neither of these is “an LGBTQ company,” so there is no exclusivity or owner or CEO affinity involved.
 In an experiment I observed closely, by a client in financial services, the same kind of targeted advertising failed, but his is more of a person-to- person service business than is an auto brand. This is definitely not as simple or easy as simply aiming advertising and tweaking messages, but Subaru is proof it can be done, and Mercedes is even more evidence it can be done with aim at particularly affluent LGBTQ.

 Careful Message-to-Market Matching


-----

##### Just as a growing number of companies are careful to reach out to and make welcome LGBTQ clientele without turning their businesses into LGBTQ places and alienating their other, larger customer bases, any marketer must walk the same tightrope and create the same degrees of separation, including use of LGBTQ-targeted media and direct mail that remains invisible to the straight population.
 Any such outreach to a particular group begins with striving for understanding of the target audience and organizing it into manageable subgroups.
 Community Marketing & Insights (CMI) has been conducting LGBTQ research for 29 years. They divide the marketing into three identities and three generations, producing nine sub-markets:

 1. Gay and bisexual men (46% of the market) 2. Lesbian and bisexual women (also 40% of the market) 3. Gender-expansive including everybody else but heterosexual (8% of
 the market)

 The generation divides are:

 A. Millennial (born 1981–1999) B. Gen X (born 1965–1980) C. Boomer (1942–1964)

 A closer look at the identities, in brief:

 •  Gay and bisexual men. Twenty-six percent are legally married,
 another 17% in a relationship and living with a partner. Highest incomes of any LGBTQ group; more than half earn upwards of $100,000.00 a year. Concentrated in urban/big city ZIP codes.
 • Lesbian and bisexual women. Thirty-nine percent are legally married,
 another 18% living with a partner. About 30% with incomes above $100,000.00. Broader geographic distribution, adding in medium- sized cities and suburban areas.
 •  Gender expansive. Thirty-one percent are legally married, another
 15% living with a partner. They rank lower in income, net worth, and


-----

##### home ownership than the other identities.

 Age brackets obviously matter, as they do with the entire population, and in much the same ways as with overall population. Of course, affluence tends to rise with age automatically, as the next chapter illustrates.

#### CHAPTER 7

### Affluent Boomers’ Spending Boom

##### “He’s living beyond his means, but he can afford it.”

—SAM GOLDWYN, HOLLYWOOD MOGUL

# Seventy-five percent of Boomers have household incomes of
##### $100,000.00 and up. They are the wealthiest generation in history, with a median net worth of $913,000.00, almost twice that of affluent Gen X’ers. From 2007 through 2012, they inherited an enormous transfer of wealth from their parents, with more to come. By 2030, Boomers are expected to inherit $8.4 trillion. For marketers, the good news is: They are spending their money! They are responsible for more than half of all consumer


-----

##### spending in the U.S., outspending their children and grandchildren by two- to-one or more, and in virtually every spending category.
 They have from 8 to 12 years of this level of active spending ahead, so companies from financial firms to cruise lines to Disney have been scurrying to build products and services for these customers, yet, surprisingly, only 5% to 10% of all advertising and marketing is specifically aimed at them. There is a common mistake in much of that: being condescending, a crime committed by Gen X and Millennial ad and marketing people when usually grudgingly addressing this group. There is a decade of great opportunity here for the business owners and marketers who can and will match themselves to this market.

 The Big Wave We can argue about the exact ages or the beginning of the Boomers’ wave of spending and investing, fueled by lifestyle changes. We can’t argue that it’s here. Back in November 2005, Newsweek ran a cover proclaiming “Ready or Not, Boomers Turn 60,” featuring photographs of the famous turning 60, including former President Clinton and President Bush, now President Donald Trump, Sylvester Stallone, Goldie Hawn, Susan Sarandon, Suzanne Somers (who is making an industry out of being 60+ herself), and Cher. In 1946, 3.4 million Americans were born—a million more than in the entire previous decade. This bunch has led the way in social, political, and economic change. And they are the early or leading- edge Boomers, now leading a wave of enormous potential prosperity for savvy entrepreneurs, CEOs, and marketers. Of the entire U.S. population, 35% will hit 60 to 70 over the next two decades. The largest number of births in any one year in U.S. history occurred in 1957: 4.3 million; they turned 50 in 2007. In total, this is a slightly moving target; a leading edge passing 60, a huge population just hitting 50, each evolving from here. Within, all kinds of sub-segments.
 About one-third of Boomers range from financially secure and well prepared for retirement to financially independent. About half of that third qualify as wealthy. But the amount of money they have needs to be put in the context of the very different attitudes they have about it than did the previous retirement generations. Within the boomer population, there is a


-----

##### historically unprecedented percentage of affluent and ultraaffluent consumers coupled with a historically unprecedented willingness on their part to spend their money on themselves. This is a terrific dynamic for us marketers!
 The affluent boomer nearing, at, or sliding past 60 is a very, very different creature than was your father or grandfather at age 60.
 I was 53 when writing the first edition of this book. I’m 63, a couple months from 64, as I’m completing this third edition. My father and his friends at 60 to 65 were:

 • eager for full retirement at age 65
 • considering relocation to one home for the rest of their life (Florida
 and Arizona were the retirement places)
 • set for income shrinkage and fixed incomes
 • shrinking spending
 • accepting of aging
 • moving into the retirement phase as a group in lockstep
