• Do this a lot. Once you have presentations that work and the ability
 to deliver them, you want to leverage this to the max. I push the home inspectors we coach to average one presentation per week or, if they have full-time marketing persons, to get them up to two presentations every week. This activity alone can drive a business like a home inspection service to heights most inspectors don’t even think possible.

 • Prepare for each office. If you have an agent you are already doing
 business with, you should talk with him or her in advance about giving a brief testimonial. Try and know who’s who, so you can recognize the leaders the rest of the pack follows by name and accomplishments. Take these opportunities seriously.

 • Worry, a little! If attendance is voluntary and uncertain, deliver
 promotional flyers to the office to be distributed to all the agents several days to a week in advance. Do not take attendance or interest for granted. Earn it.

 • Never neglect your “commercial” within your presentation. You
 should have a direct call to action, offering a handout they’ll want, coupons or vouchers giving discounts to their customers, etc., to bring them to you. You are there to impress, inform and make friends, but you are also there to get business. Don’t forget your purpose.

###### There are many kinds of fuel for business growth. Most business owners think in terms of getting their customers directly, through advertising, marketing, and promotion, and ignore opportunities to get those customers brought to them one after another after another by Connectors. Establishing your own circle of Connectors can fuel your business like nothing else. The effective presentation can make that happen.

 What You Don’t Know Can Hurt You

#### Perceptions and Reality


## B


###### efore you even think about selling, you need to know what your potential clients and customers know, or think they know.


###### If you read the introduction, you understand where noise fits into the communication landscape and how damaging it can be to your strategic efforts. In the current economy, we are inundated with information (and misinformation). This is noise that can impact your communication strategy.
 There is more information accessible today than at any point in recorded history. I, personally, think that is a good thing. I’m a fan of being able to access information. But with great power comes great responsibility. The problem with the amount of available information is that people are conflating information with knowledge. I call this the knowledge gap, and it’s bigger now than ever. Acknowledging that this gap exists, though, is the first step to understanding how to communicate through the noise.
 Let’s take a deeper look at the knowledge gap and how it presents both challenges and opportunities to entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial thinkers.

##### The Knowledge Gap


-----

###### With the number of websites nearing a billion, and search volume reaching more than 50,000 searches per second, the world is inundated with information and the ability to access it.
 The phrase “information at your fingertips” is even outdated, as voice searching and commands increase our ability to search and retrieve information on any subject.
 What this presents to our society, and to your business economy, is an employee, public, and consumer base that can view as much information about you and your company as you can. But, as we are aware, not all information published is accurate. And simply reading something does not mean that you know something.
 There is a widening gap between information and knowledge. The gap itself isn’t the problem; it’s that people confuse information for knowledge. When people mistake information for knowledge, they often make decisions based on misreported or misrepresented data, or from only a small spectrum of information that they’ve retrieved. A key example of how this often plays out? Media.
 The media perpetuates the information and knowledge gap when it reports only part of the information picture. This is common practice and is not likely to change. But the reporting of information is not the real problem. Again, the problem comes when viewers or readers mistake the information for a complete picture or for knowledge.
 Information is data—facts, figures, statistics, anecdotes, testimonials, etc.—that is used to inform decisions. Knowledge is verified information placed into a context, which can be applied to make decisions.

 Knowledge Is Information, Applied

 The difference between being informed and being able to apply that information lies in one’s ability to put theory into practice. Many college students can pass a multiple choice test on game theory from reading a textbook, but ask those same students to use game theory to help foreign policy officials solve a conflict between two feuding nations, and you’re likely to get a lot of stumped looks.
 That’s the difference between information and knowledge.


-----

###### Helping people bridge that gap can help you win friends and influence people (a nod to Mr. Carnegie there). Not to mention it can bring you more business. But how do you know if the gap exists, and, if it does, how do you need to address it? Moreover, how do we bridge that gap without offending or patronizing someone by telling them they don’t really know what they’re talking about (although in many cases you want to)? The answer: education and empowerment. By empowering consumers to educate themselves, we all win. We bridge that gap. We rise above the noise.

 RESULTS


##### Jay Baer

CEO and Founder, Convince & Convert, Author of Youtility and Hug Your Haters

###### Every Instance of Communication Does Not Equal a Sales Opportunity

**The biggest communication mistake that business owners make is the belief that every**
**piece of communication is a sales opportunity. Stop trying to be amazing, and start**
**being useful. Stop trying to create something that magically creates virality. Start**
**trying to be useful, creating things that add real value. That’s Youtility.**

###### Youtility Equals Useful, Valuable Marketing

**_Youtility is marketing so useful, people would pay for it. It’s marketing with so much_**
**intrinsic and inherent value that people would kick in a few bucks to support it. It’s**
**marketing that people actually want instead of marketing that people simply tolerate.**
**There’s an enormous difference between marketing people want and marketing people**
**don’t hate.**

###### It’s Not About Speed and Virality


-----

**People think the secret to marketing is to be faster, but the reality is the relationships**
**that we build with prospective clients develop more slowly in a series of micro-**
**interactions that take place consistently over time. You have to embrace the power of**
**eventually. Youtility is about help, not hype. It’s giving information snacks to sell**
**knowledge meals. Take everything you know, and give it away in small pieces.**

###### Give Everything You Know Away

**Many people worry that if they give away all this they won’t get hired. That’s just not**
**true. A list of ingredients doesn’t make someone a chef. Holding on to your knowledge**
**and putting gates in front of it is a self-defeating proposition. It’s self-defeating to hold**
**your cards that close to the vest. Give away information snacks to sell knowledge**
**meals.**
