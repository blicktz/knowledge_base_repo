###### Whatever application you have for a web form, every form starts with a data field. To create a field or a form, you must first create a permanent field property in your core CRM system. Most software limits how many “custom fields” you can have. For example, Keap allows you to create 100 additional custom fields beyond its default ones. Once you hit that 100, you’re at capacity. So, if you use Keap, you have to stay within these limits. For many small businesses, this is fine. They will never reach the limits of this program and can generate web forms that meet their needs without missing a beat. For others with unique needs requiring tailored responses, HubSpot has what you need.
 HubSpot gives you:

1,000 custom fields for contact records.
1,000 custom fields for company records.
1,000 custom fields for deal records.

###### This is a very long runway. With this platform, you can use web forms on funnels in ClickFunnels, web pages, WordPress, or landing pages in HubSpot. The possibilities are virtually endless.

#### The Objective Is Immediate, Relevant Response to Every Inquiry or Action by a
 Potential Customer

###### I hope you are getting the idea of full-throated, multi-media, multi-step, immediate response, and I hope you are thinking about places where this is not happening now in your business. The nature and the immediacy of your response builds or harms trust, furthers and increases interest, or loses it. We live in Instant World. Amazon delivers the same day. Alexa or Siri answers our questions instantly. We can draw a circle around an object we see on our screen, in a TV show or movie, and our mobile device will instantly take us to merchants who sell it. We live in Feedback Land. Uber tells us how many minutes away our car is. We can see on a map where the driver is and monitor his progress. Social media IS feedback. You post, people Like, post and comment, forward your post. You know how many Likes. In business, in direct marketing, split-tests by print, mail, or even broadcast that took weeks to provide results can now be done in a day by driving traffic in rotation to 2, 4, or 40 sites. CEOs and marketers can know things at the speed of Now. And, when somebody is interested in you and your company, they are interested now. If you will use Marketing Automation to accelerate the speed of your relevant response(s), you will capture customers and sales that now slip past you, probably unknown to you.
 When a lead is captured, it’s time for action. You have a fish on the line. You don’t just let it dangle there; you reel it in. Maybe you send an email. Make a phone call. Send a text. Ship an info kit. Maybe you do all of the above. With HubSpot, all of this is automated. Even print-on-demand and shipping of your package can be automated. Simply integrate HubSpot with Mailboxpower. com, and voilà! Like magic, it’s all done.
 (Mailboxpower.com is one of my favorite vendors. You should look them up.)

 One of my prime examples is my benchmark campaign, “Business Kamasutra.” This campaign consists of digital and tangible assets delivered to prospects and handled at HubSpot. Business Kamasutra assets include:

-----

**A New Lead Sequence. This series consists of seven emails delivered every 3 days. The aim**
is to persuade a prospect to book an appointment.
**Pre-appointment Sequence. Two or three emails that remind my prospect of their**
upcoming appointment. These set the stage for what they can expect during the call. And
most importantly, it makes it far less likely that they will cancel or forget about the
appointment the day of.
**Appointment No-Show Sequence. Four to seven emails. Not everyone follows through.**
Sometimes, it’s simple because life got in the way. This is my chance to say, “Hey, I
understand. Things happen. Let’s reschedule for a better time.”
**Appointment No-Sale Sequence. Four to seven emails. Not everyone is instantly ready to**
buy. The No-Sale sequence offers valuable information they may not have considered. It’s a
second, third, and seventh chance at making the sale.
**Reactivation Emails. These are quick personal notes. “I’ve been reading my notes from our**
call, and I have an idea I’d like to run by you. Please book a time we could talk.” These are
personal. Effective. And easily implemented with HubSpot.
**Long-Term Nurture Email Sequence. This is 52 emails delivered once a week for a year.**
They offer valuable information or insight into something that benefits your reader and ties
into your product or service. These are soft sales. They promote top-of-the-mind awareness.
Build trust. Establish you as an authority in your field.
**Welcome Sequence. This is a great onboarding tool. Set the expectations for what this new**
client, patient, or customer can expect. Let them know from the beginning what you expect
from them. Set the stage so that the rest of the relationship plays out with everyone’s
expectations met.

###### HubSpot facilitates all of this. Once a prospect books an appointment, a “trigger” is created in HubSpot automatically, and sales automation begins. This is marketing automation at its finest. Some or all of the above sequences may be “beefed up” with mail, books, or other physical items sent out, and this, too, happens automatically a pre-set number of days after initial contact.
 HubSpot’s automation technologies are a micro-step below pure magic. But automation is not the only trick up this platform’s sleeve. At eLaunchers, we routinely use HubSpot prospecting tools for non-automated outreach efforts.
 These include:

**Telemarketing. This is where we have warm bodies coldcalling and following up on leads.**
HubSpot facilitates this with lead management and sales content generation that allows even
an average salesperson to produce above average results.
**Manual Social Media Outreach. We personally make contact with prospects through social**
media. This personal one-on-one interaction can help build relationships and trust and allow
us to customize the sales experience.

-----

**One-off (Not Bulk) Direct Mail Outreach. A personalized letter that directly speaks to**
your prospect’s needs, wants, and desires. Delivered in a FedEx envelope and laced with
TLC. This is an effective (and in today’s digital age, unique) way of standing out from the
rest of your competitors and engaging someone in a meaningful way.
**Snippet Tools. These are great ways to store and insert commonly used text or information**
quickly. These timesaving tools also help with consistency in the delivery of your message.
Snippets are easy to use. They all start with a #, so all the user needs to do is put in a
#KEYWORD, and Snippet fills up their screen with the next steps.
1. Conversation Snippets can be used by everyone on your sales team so they know what

to say to your prospects.
2. Email and chat snippets quickly generate text when sending something to a prospect.
**We use Playbooks to deliver predefined instructions, guidelines, and scripts that guide**
office staff and the sales team through interactions with prospects and customers.

Here’s how it works. A prospect picks up the phone and calls. A member of our staff
answers and engages in a conversation. They have a Playbook in front of them the entire
time. Our staff member begins to ask specific Playbook questions. They type the answers.
And the Playbook helps them know what to say next. This keeps the conversation going and
the sales experience on track. At the end, a detailed call journal is automatically created and
kept in the contact’s record.

A staff member then creates a follow-up task to call back, send a FedEx, or send an
email. This is then assigned to someone else on the team. Playbooks mean that appointment
setters don’t need to be physically in your office. They can be anywhere around the world,
and with your Playbook, they know exactly what to say. Once they resolve the call, they
simply pass instructions to your designated manager, who then packs and ships a sales letter
and a Shock & Awe package with the click of a button on HubSpot.

#### The Customer/Client/Patient Experience Facilitated by HubSpot (or Other Automation)

###### We have a thorough, choreographed prospect-to-client experience. You should, too. Yours may need to be different from mine, but here is my main client experience:

**A Strategy Session Is Scheduled. This is the catchall stage where all deals are set up.**
**Disqualify/Delete. This places “bad prospects” in a queue for my office manager to read,**
journal, and delete. Having my office manager review these prevents me or anyone else from
accidentally deleting something that shouldn’t have been deleted.
**Strategy Session No-Show. When someone fails to show up on a call, they go into this stage**
of the pipeline. Automation triggers tasks for my office manager to reach out to them and
persuade them to rebook.
**Strategy Session Complete. This stage is for conversations that end without a clear next**
step. The conversation went well, but not well enough for the prospect to say yes right then.
These deals will die on the vine if not tackled appropriately. At eLaunchers, my wife and I

-----

review these monthly to verify they are being managed properly or determine what should
happen next.
**Please Book Another Call. Maybe there is a need for some follow-up. Perhaps the**
conversation was not resolved within the allotted time. This stage triggers automation for my
office manager to reach out to the prospect and persuade them to book a call.
**Follow-up Discussion Scheduled. This is the most desirable scenario. To have the prospect**
show up on the call as intended, get qualified for further conversation, and have a new call
booked before they leave.

Estimate Requested. This stage is for a prospect when it’s time to discuss the details of
how we will work together. A prospect is placed here to discuss scope and budget at a higher
level. Nothing is finalized yet, but it’s close.
Estimate Submitted. This stage is for a prospect who is ready to sign. We create a QUOTE
using the HubSpot Quote tool. Then, we use the HubSpot products tool to add line items to
the quote and edit line items in the section as needed.
Losing Interest. When you get a soft no, the prospect is placed in this stage. This is reserved
for those on the fence. They are not ready to commit. They are not ready to say no entirely.
This is for the “Let me think about it” crowd. Once a month, we review these prospects and
decide what to do with them. These deals may be dead already, but will surely die if not
tackled directly.
Closed—Lost. This is for our firm NOs. The ones who ended the call certain they would
never be able to afford me. The ones who seem almost hostile at the mere mention of a
monthly charge. These prospects are placed in the Closed-Lost Stage…still, they are never
deleted.
Closed—WON! The finish line…at least as the sales process is concerned. The deal moves
to this stage when a prospect digitally signs the quote. We create an invoice in our
QuickBooks from HubSpot through an integration between the two apps. This takes the
HubSpot quote and converts it into a QuickBooks invoice. Then, all financial transactions
happen through QuickBooks.
Support and Service. Customer service and support automation in HubSpot are robust
ecosystems. We paid for the professional-level service hub because we want to use certain
features of this hub as our business grows. This is to “future-proof” our business and build a
runway for larger deals.

###### We do this because I believe in investing in technologies you may not need right now, but will likely need in the future. This allows you to build infrastructure functionalities BEFORE the deals arrive.
 It is important to understand that all of this has “triggers,” automated instructions and alerts to my staff, automated follow-up in each stage of the experience, and information for me to personally inspect. Holes are all plugged. No one is left wondering where we are or why they haven’t heard from us yet.

#### Dan Kennedy Says

###### The core message of this chapter is GOLD. Parthiv very accurately describes the expectations of the potential customer for instant attention and engagement. When “hot,” they go “cold” if left waiting for any length of time. What seems like a perfectly reasonable, slight delay to you in responding, providing information, or fulfilling an information request is, to them, an unbearable eternity that puts your trustworthiness and reliability in question. This is why I and many of my clients invest in FedEx rather than USPS delivery of requested reports, info-kits, books. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING you can do to speed up your responses as well as to make them more personal and relevant to the prospect is essential to do.

 Now, a word about Parthiv. As you can tell by now, he is a very deep thinker about “process.” An engineer of the highest order. But he understands something vital, that you need to understand, too, when you go down the rabbit holes of technology, automation, and process. If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to have some bigname consulting firm like Bain or Booz Allen work with you and your company, and you are too small of a fish to interest them, you aren’t missing much. I have seen some of them at work, and it’s comedic. Consider this quote from Amrah Darnaby, a senior consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton: “I generate productivity by celebrating the small wins and I am most motivated by seeing success within the process and NOT solely on the outcome.” This comes from somebody who never signs the front of a check. Sure, you want to take notice of making any piece of anything work. Yipppee. But this is like celebrating the jockey gracefully getting up onto the horse on the first try. Wow. Pop a cork. In the real world, the only purpose of process IS outcomes. An old mentor went further with “Don’t tell me about

-----

###### the labor pains. Just show me the baby.” Do you really want to pay giant fees to turn somebody “motivated by process” loose in your company? No. And you must be cautious of process for the sake of process. And wary of process providers in love with process, not outcomes. If you can’t write it on a bank deposit slip, it doesn’t actually matter.

 A popular saying in the tech world is “data is the new currency.” As I write this, Salesforce.com is running TV ads with that statement in them, rather inexplicably by the actor Matthew McConaughey, dressed up as a cowboy. But it’s not true. Data has to be converted to currency. So does automation. In and of itself, it is worthless.

 All of the processes described here by Parthiv and demonstrated with examples from his own businesses are potentially extremely valuable, if diligently, fully implemented in a way and with tools (software) appropriate for your business.

 I also want to point out something obvious, yet missed by many. ALL of this doesn’t replace humans. It can reduce the quantity needed. It can make them more effective. But let’s take note that Parthiv’s company and just about any software/automation company you can name—including Salesforce, HubSpot, Keap, etc., have human sales representatives. Online, however well automated, does not replace offline either. Tech companies advertise a lot on TV, in print media, even with direct mail, printed, in envelopes, with stamps. What is being presented to you here is meant to be integrated with diverse media and with human salespeople and other staff.

###### In the cutthroat world of sales, marketing, and entrepreneurship, the daunting task of market research looms like a relentless, insurmountable beast. Picture this: A sea of ambitious individuals, eyes glazed over, staring into the abyss of data, trends, and customer profiles. They’re seeking the “Holy Grail” of insights that will magically transform their words into weapons of persuasion. Yet, more often than not, they find themselves lost in a labyrinth of information, with no Theseus to guide them out.
 Think of the hours spent poring over data, reading reports that feel like they’re written in a foreign language. It’s a jungle of numbers and trends. Your eyes glaze over, but you press on, knowing that somewhere in this
