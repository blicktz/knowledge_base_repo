##### Please stop and be sure you get this life-changing corollary principle. Find somebody who is successful, who shares your purpose, objectives, agenda, and pay great attention to what he does and how he does it.
 I believe some call this sort of thing “a blinding flash of the obvious.” Well, you can call it obvious if you like—but then how do you explain the fact that 99% of all businesspeople are operating as if ignorant of this obvious logic?
 I might add this principle has power in places other than marketing. You can eventually get south by going due north, but life’s easier and less stressful, and business more profitable, if you actually get headed in the direction that leads directly to your destination of choice. Emulating inappropriate examples is the equivalent of trudging south to get to the North Pole. Odds are, you’ll get lost, tired, or eaten by a giant iguana long before seeing snow.

 Why Is There so Much Lousy, Unproductive, Unprofitable Advertising
 and Marketing Out There, Anyway?
 No B.S. truth. Most business owners are just about clueless when it comes to advertising and marketing. They are, therefore, often Advertising Victims, preyed on by media salespeople, ad agencies, website developers, social media wizards, and others who don’t know any more about how to actually produce a customer or make a sale than they do. Anytime you are being guided to decisions and investments that are not fact based, and instead driven by popular fads, trends, opinions, and monkey-see-monkey- do pressure, you are being victimized. Direct marketers insist on facts and live by data.
 If you try to get a business owner to accurately tell you where his customers and sales come from, what it costs to get a customer from source


-----

##### A or source B, what results specifically come from this ad or that one, he can’t. He’s guessing. Consequently, he’s often grumpy and unhappy about things he shouldn’t be, but also wasting money he needn’t be.
 The reasons for the cluelessness and vulnerability to victimization are many. Here’s a big one: Marketing Incest. When you got into whatever business you’re in, you probably looked around at what everybody else in the business was doing and copied it. Gradually, you’ve tried to do it better, but not radically different, just better. So you have everybody in an industry standing in a circle looking inward at each other, ignoring anyone or anything outside the circle. It’s incestuous, and it works just like real generational incest: Everybody slowly gets dumber and dumber and dumber.
 This book dares you to turn back on the circle and deliberately go far afield from your peers in search of different—not just incrementally better —different ways of marketing.

 Yes, Salvation Is within Reach

 Now, here’s the good news: most business owners, clueless as they may be about profitable advertising or effective marketing, do know a lot about how to sell their products or services. That’s very good news because DIRECT marketing for non-direct marketing businesses is really not about traditional advertising or marketing at all. It is simply “salesmanship multiplied in media.” So you actually already do have a firm grip on one- third of the KENNEDY RESULTS TRIANGLE that you’ll master with this book. You know the Message. It’ll get tweaked, as I’ll explain. But you do have this component part.

##### The Ten No B.S. Rules of Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing
 Businesses (My Ten Commandments)
 I’ll lay our foundation first. (A radical idea itself!) Please copy these and post them somewhere you’ll see them often until you get them memorized. Doing so will keep you on track, save you a lot of money, and dramatically improve your marketing.
 From now on, every ad you run, every flier you distribute, every postcard or letter you mail, every website you put up, every/anything you do to advertise or market your business MUST adhere to these rules. To be fair, they are simplistic and dogmatic, and there are reasons to violate them in certain situations. But for now, sticking to them as a rigid diet will work. You can experiment later, after you’ve first cleansed your business of toxins.


##### Rule #1.
 Rule #2.
 Rule #3.
 Rule #4.
 Rule #5.
 Rule #6.
 Rule #7.
 Rule #8.
 Rule #9.


##### There Will Always Be an Offer or Offer(s)

 There Will Be a Reason to Respond Right Now

 You Will Give Clear Instructions

 There Will Be Tracking, Measurement, and Accountability

 Only No-Cost Brand-Building

 There Will Be Follow-Up

 There Will Be Strong Copy

 It Will Look Like Mail-Order Advertising

 Results Rule. Period.


-----

##### Rule #10.


##### You Will Be a Tough-Minded Disciplinarian and Put Your Business on a Strict Direct Marketing Diet


##### We’ll tackle each Rule in-depth, in the next eight chapters. I once wrote an entire book about breaking rules, and generally speaking, I think rules are for other, ordinary mortals—certainly not for me, and not for you either if you are a true entrepreneur. So you’ll chafe at rules here just as I would. However, when you are attempting to undo bad habits and replace them with new ones, some hard and fast rules are necessary, temporarily. Once you fully understand these and have lived with them for a reasonable length of time, then feel free to experiment if you wish. But get good at coloring inside the lines before ignoring them altogether.
 Finally, a word about these aged rules and the newest of the new media and its promoters of new metrics. Try putting views or likes on a bank deposit slip. You will be told that no old rules—the time-tested, time-proven ones—apply to new media like Facebook or Snapchat or etc., etc., but be certain to take into account who makes that argument. It will come from young people on your staff or in agencies spending your money, not theirs, unable if pressed to prove profitable return on investment from their chosen media and made-up metrics. When pressed on this point, they won’t argue facts, because they can’t; they will only stigmatize and label you as a dummy and a primitive stuck in the past’s old ways. It will come from people caught up in a dumb cattle stampede. You have to do it and throw harsh reality accountability aside because everybody else is doing it and ignoring financial accountability. It will come from peddlers of it for profit. Of course, the bald man should never ask the hungry barber if he needs a haircut. When all you have to sell are haircuts, everyone needs them.
 If a media can’t be used with these ten rules applied to it, my advice is: skip it.

#### CHAPTER 2


### An OFFER They Can’t Refuse


# There is a certain mindset in direct marketing folks. We are result
##### oriented. We find it difficult to just go out for a drive for the sake of going for a drive. We want a definite destination, an estimated time of arrival, and a purpose for the trip. Most direct marketers have trouble watching a sports telecast unless they’ve wagered on the game. We want to KNOW if we have won or lost, succeeded or failed, achieved something definitive or just wandered around. While this tendency gets in the way of a friendly family game night, it is extremely useful in avoiding the vagueness and lack of accountability that permeates most business owners’ marketing activities.
 It is this habit of thought that informs.

 Rule #1 There Will ALWAYS Be an Offer or Offers A key distinguishing characteristic of direct marketing and Direct-Response Advertising from all other marketing and advertising is the presentation of a very specific offer or offers. Ideally, yours is a Godfather’s Offer—an offer that the appropriate prospect or customer for you can’t refuse! We’ll get to the architecture of offers in a few minutes, but first the overarching ideas: one, to make your every communication actually ask somebody to do something, and two, to inject new disciplines of selling and accountability


-----

##### into all your communication with prospects, customers, and the marketplace at large.
 If you begin paying attention to advertising and marketing, you’ll see that most of it merely shows up and talks about the marketers and advertisers, but does not directly offer something specific to be had by immediately and directly responding. A lot of print ads and TV commercials and brochures now include websites or Facebook sites where you can go like ‘em, etc., but present no Offer as a compelling reason to go there. All this is undisciplined. It is sending money out to play a backyard game with no rules, and worse, no score-keeping, no clear means of judging victory or defeat. A chaotic mess. When you take this undisciplined approach and simply spend and hope and guess, you’re at the mercy of opinion about your marketing—do you like it? Does your mother-in-law like it? Do your customers say nice things about it? Try paying any of your bills with that sort of feedback.
 This all changes with direct marketing. Direct marketing imposes discipline. That discipline may be as important and valuable as the benefit of direct response itself. For some mysterious reason, business owners are willing to let advertising and marketing off the hook, but tend to hold everything else accountable for results and return on investment. If they tie up money in certain product inventory, they expect it to sell—or they refuse to restock it. If they employ a sales representative, they expect him to make sales. If they buy a delivery van, they expect it to start and run so it can make deliveries. If they pay a laborer by the hour, they expect him to clock in, be there, and work for the hour. Yet investments made for marketing are permitted to skate. Only direct marketing imposes discipline, by always making an offer or offers, so response to those offers can be tracked and measured, injecting factual accountability.
 My old speaking colleague, one of the all-time greats, Zig Ziglar, always described salespeople who wimped out at closing sales and directly demanding orders as “professional visitors,” not professional salespeople. Since you will be doing selling in print, online, with media, you rarely want to let it be a professional visitor on your behalf. Fire all the wimps. Demand real performance. So your task is to incorporate a direct offer each and every time you put out a message, of any kind, by any means.


-----

##### I mean of any kind. By any means. We teach most business owners to use Thanksgiving greeting cards and/or New Year’s greeting cards, with past and lost as well as active customers, clients or patients, and, often, with unconverted leads too. We also teach no greeting card should arrive without being accompanied by an offer. Typically, the offer will be a gift with visit to showroom or store, gift with purchase, gift for referral, etc., placed in a printed piece inside a separate envelope, inside the greeting card itself, to preserve some separation between the thank you or new year sentiment and selling. But we are not shy about our purpose in life either, and it is not merely being professional visitors.
 In short, you have a fundamental governance decision to make. Will you let yourself be persuaded or bullied into wasting money on marketing that cannot be directly held accountable for results and return on investment? Or will you insist on accountability?

 “Shined Shoes Save Lives” My speaking colleague of some 40 events or so, the late General Norman Schwarzkopf, famous for Desert Storm, said, “Shined shoes save lives.” He meant that establishing and adhering absolutely to minor disciplines ensured soldiers could and would adhere to vital battlefield disciplines. Norm believed that a person can’t be undisciplined about some things but disciplined about others any more than an alcoholic person committed to sobriety can occasionally have a few drinks. You either are or you aren’t. Your business is either run in a disciplined way, or it isn’t.
 Discipline is a central theme of all business success. Last year, 2017, was the 80th anniversary of widespread embrace by successful entrepreneurs of Napoleon Hill’s works Laws of Success and Think and Grow Rich, the summary of findings from his 30-year investigation into key commonalities of over 500 of the industrialists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and financiers who built America. In Laws, he detailed 17 such principles; in Think and Grow Rich, 13. Two of these are: accurate thinking and organized effort. Of a more contemporary nature, you might be familiar with Michael Gerber and his E-Myth, which is all about organized systems in business. One of the most successful of all buyers of and investors in businesses, Warren Buffett, has an absolute discipline for evaluating


-----

##### companies, and he has stuck to it with religious conviction. Top-performing athletes in every sport always exhibit a far greater level of discipline for everything from study to practice to actual playing of their game than the mediocre majority. The most successful authors past and present do not write whenever they’re in the mood—they have a self-imposed discipline mandating a set number of hours or completed pages every day. Anywhere you find significant success, you will find imposed absolute discipline. Undisciplined, unorganized advertising and marketing “effort” is not going to defy this fact of success.

##### Two Types of Offers There are basically two types of offers. There is an offer requesting purchase. There is also the lead-generation offer, asking only for a person to, in effect, raise their hand, to identify and register themselves as having interest in certain subject matter and information or goods or services, and to invite further communication from you. Often, although not always, the lead-generation offer is free. There are times and places for both kinds of offers, but no communication should be devoid of some offer.

 The Direct Purchase Offer


-----

##### Online media like Groupon or hybrid offline+online media like Val Pak coupons deliver some of the simplest, most straightforward direct purchase offers, like “Buy One, Get The 2nd One Free”—used by everybody from pizza shops to window replacement companies. I am not a champion of discounting as strategy, and a co-author, Jason Marrs, and I provide much more sophisticated approaches in our book No B.S. Price Strategy. But for illustration purposes, this is a direct purchase offer you’re very familiar with and may be using now in your business. Another common direct purchase offer, in place of or combined with discounting, is gift with purchase. These were birthed by direct marketers but have migrated to retail, service, professionals, and B2B, so they are commonplace. They should be and usually are married to a hard deadline. They certainly provide easy opportunity to accurately measure their effectiveness and production, although out of ignorance or sloth, many business owners fail to measure.
 Direct Purchase Offers have several significant disadvantages. One is that they tend to sacrifice price integrity and profitability, and if relied on too frequently, train customers to only respond when a “great deal” is offered. Two, they can only be responded to by people ready and able to buy right this minute—they fail to identify people likely to buy in your category in the near future. Third, they can be easily and quickly comparison shopped, especially if you are conveying the offer online. Still, business does revolve around Direct Purchase Offers.

 The Lead-Generation Offer This is a more interesting kind of offer, because it can substantially reduce the waste factor in advertising, convert a sales culture to a marketing culture, and provide opportunity to build trust and create a relationship.
 You see lead generation done by direct marketers routinely and regularly. You may not have given them much thought, but now you will. They are commonly used by national direct marketers, but rarely used by local, small businesses—even though the national and local firms may be in the same product or service categories. For example, a company like Premier Bathtubs, which sells walk-in bathtubs that are safer for elderly people, advertises just about everywhere, offering a free information kit with brochures and a DVD. Once somebody raises their hand and registers

##### themselves as interested in making a home’s bathroom safe for themselves or an elderly parent, the company has a marketing opportunity. Oddly, you will almost never catch a local remodeling company duplicating this strategy. Instead, they tend to leap to offering an in-home estimate for work to be done. This is often A Bridge Too Far.

 The Important Concept of Threshold Resistance Arnold Taubman, one of America’s most successful mall developers, spoke and wrote at length about the concept of Threshold Resistance as it applies to entrances to retail stores and window displays of retail stores. I find it applies even more broadly to direct marketing (see Figure 2.1 on Page 18). All offers fall somewhere on a continuum between Low-Threshold Offer and High-Threshold Offer.

**FIGURE 2.1: Threshold Resistance**

##### Here are examples of offers that would fall to the right of the middle, toward High Threshold:
