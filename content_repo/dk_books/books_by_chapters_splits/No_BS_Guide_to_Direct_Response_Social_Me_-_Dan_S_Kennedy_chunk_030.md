###### Mike Ski (see Figure 14.12) was a Private Investigator working for someone else, until he got the gift many of us entrepreneurs get … He got fired. So, he started his own firm working with the brands he loves and developed a way to land work with virtually any company he wants. Time and time again, other PIs were asking him how he grew his business. In order to help more of them at a time, he decided to launch a digital course. Not only has he sold multiple courses (one time he only had four people on the webinar, and sold two of them … this guy can close!), but he just launched his first in-person live event for PIs and sold tickets simply by doing a free Facebook Live!

###### Magda Casteñeda (see Figue 14.13) was a nurse who was tired of seeing patients come in for Kidney Dialysis treatment, a symptom of Type Two Diabetes, that had gone untreated. She wanted to get in front of the problem and help Latina women escape their dependence on sugar. Magda set off on her own health journey, losing 34 pounds and documenting her success. She then invited friends and family to take a free challenge to give up sugar, then invited those in the challenge to join her membership. Right away, she brought nine women into a coaching group, without spending any money on advertising. And that’s just the beginning! Since then, she’s grown her private Facebook Group by hundreds each week, and it just keeps growing and growing. She’s changed her life and gets to see her students’ lives changing every day.
 Donna Crenshaw (see Figure 14.14) started off helping her daughter Melissa get sponsors for a conference. Melissa teaches bloggers how to monetize their sites. Donna was so successful getting Melissa sponsored by big brands for the event that others started asking if she would do it for them. Her book of clients quickly grew to more than what one person could manage, so she figured she could either say “no” to increased business or teach others how they could get paid to garner brand sponsorship for others.

###### She launched a course and sold it right away without having to spend a penny on ads. She now has help for her private clients and is making passive income! Sometimes from our mess, we get our message.

###### After spending years teaching martial arts and self-defense classes, Tristan Truscott’s back could take no more. For close to five years he was barely able to walk and even after trying many alternative therapies and a $90,000 surgery, his back didn’t improve.
 While they had met earlier and become friends, Sabrina and Tristan became closer during this time, as partners in business, life, and love.
 They sought out other ways to bring Tristan healing and discovered mind-body-energy work Tristan could do that would not only bring pain relief but improvement. Tristan calls it his Mind-Body-Magic process (see Figure 14.15). He was able to recover fully and be back to where he was decades ago.


-----

###### As mentioned earlier, they wanted to help others the way he was helped, so Tristan and Sabrina began developing healing programs to teach others how to heal from chronic pain. They started with Qigong courses, joint mobility, and meditations for overall wellness but recently created a program specifically for back pain!

**FIGURE 14.15: Satori Method Happy Back Program**

###### With a heart to serve as many as possible, they launched their new course, Your Happy Healthy Back, for only $97 (Early-bird pre-sale price).
 They sold the program before it was filmed—since people knew the results they got from other programs and were anxious for more.
 They increased the price over time to $127 and then to $297. Two hundred and three people enrolled right away. Not only are Sabrina and Tristan saving lives, but they have generated $22,381 in revenue.
 And they haven’t even really launched it yet! Scott Whitaker (see Figure 14.16) was in charge of growing the membership of one of the largest membership organizations in the world. He helped lead the organization to go from 72 members to over 3,127.


-----

###### He kept track of the questions he was often asked about member growth and retention and created a course to help other membership organizations multiply. Since launching, he has served 4,312 people and generated $501,617. A highlight for him was taking his wife and two daughters on a first-class trip to NYC to celebrate hitting his sales goals.

**FIGURE 14.16: Scott Whitaker**

###### Not only is he helping membership groups grow, he is getting to enjoy the success of his new venture with his family because he finally has the time to do it.

#### From Sales Funnels to Income “At Will”

###### by Dan Kennedy A business that obtained a mailing list of over 100,000 well-chosen potential customers launched a major marketing campaign, with high hopes. The list was targeted to match the demographics of its current, avatar clients. There was significant disposable income to be had. The copy was good. And the open rate and click-through rate were high.
 The campaign was a total bust. A mystery, but not one without clues. To borrow from a Sherlock Holmes tale, it’s about what was missing, not what was there. The dog that didn’t bark.
 The one thing not known and certain about these 100,000 was whether or not they were buyers in this product category who bought by the means through which this marketer was selling. Matched demographics do not equal matched behavior.
 One of my best rules is that buyers are buyers and nonbuyers are nonbuyers. Offline, with direct mail, lists available in the rental marketplace are divided into compiled and response lists. A compiled list contains people chosen by age, gender, geography, household income, and other demographic facts and statistics. A response list, which costs considerably more to rent, has that information but also only assembles people who have responded, that is, they have requested information or purchased.
 An example of the difference is women, age 45 to 60, married, with household income above $100,000 vs. women, age 45 to 60, married, with household income above $100,000 who have purchased a $100 to $200 collection of anti-aging skin-care products within the last 90 days from a direct-mail piece or catalog. The first group has only potential customers eligible to buy; the latter group has buyers. It’s the difference between fishing where we hope there are fish and fishing where we know there are fish.
 For more about mailing lists, I recommend the book The Direct-Mail Solution (Entrepreneur Press, 2014) by Craig Simpson, to which I

###### contributed. Craig is my “go-to guy” for lists, and, beyond that, an expert freelance direct-mail project manager, handling hundreds of campaigns for hundreds of clients, totaling many millions of pieces mailed each year. His clients include Beachbody, which you’ve seen on TV; a “brain doctor” frequently seen on PBS; groups of local financial advisors; a 23-store chain in the pet industry; and many others. You can meet Craig at www.Simpson- Direct.com.
 Online you are more often building your own list, rather than renting lists others have already built. Social media plays a big role in this. That’s the source of the list of 100,000 that so bitterly disappointed its owner.
 So, what went wrong? It’s one thing to attract people and arouse their interest. It’s another thing to extract money from them. In fact, the entire culture of social media (and a lot of other online media) is all about “free” and “cheap.” It acts in conflict with a marketer’s desire to convert visitors and wanderers and freebie-loving citizens into paying customers. These 100,000 were drawn from that population, then this marketer spoiled them rotten by giving them enormous amounts of free content for more than a year before attempting to move them into a sales path or funnel.
 Yes, during that time, the marketer included blog links to other people’s products and services (to earn affiliate commissions) and occasionally showcased some of their products and services, ever so gently. But they never once opened a door and asked the potential buyers in this population, the gold needles in the giant haystack, the ready-to-buy-now folks in the giant herd of casual window shoppers—to come on in and then to sell them something. It put a store in the mall, then kept its doors locked for a year, hoping to build fascination and desire. Too long. Too slow.
 A key strategy you need to put in place is an open door (with more doors opening frequently), through which real buyers can step to separate themselves from all the rest. By doing so, they identify themselves to you as legitimate potential buyers so you can aggressively sell to them. If your media and social media approach lacks this, you are at high risk of winding up with a low-value list that’s damnably difficult to monetize. In fact, the ready-to-buy-now buyers tend to be impatient about not being invited to a good sales presentation and an offer to buy now, so they wander off and are lost forever.


-----

###### You also need to teach people to respond. People need to be told and shown how they are supposed to behave with you, in your world. That’s why specific Lead Generation Magnet offers (see Chapter 6) are so important. They teach people to step forward, raise their hands, ask for, and say yes to something. It’s a very bad idea to push all the information you can share out to everybody. It’s a much better idea to offer some of the best of it only to those who say yes to a specific offer.
 Much of this is contrary to most of what you see in social media or are advised to do by social media promoters who care only about bragging- rights—numbers like likes, views, retweets—but not about money in the bank. Don’t let that bother you. The majority are wrong about everything, particularly money. And the majority are definitely wrong about this. Marketing is mostly made up of monkey seeing, monkey doing, with no real knowledge of direct marketing, split-testing, or harsh accountability. Just money spent. Don’t copy that. So:

 • Do not leave everybody together in one space, free to wander.
 • Do not create spoiled-brat children by overfeeding them for free, for
 very long, without at least asking for some action and indication of responsiveness.
 • Segment your list by areas of expressed interest and by
 responsiveness.
 • Speed up the sales cycle by opening doors for the ready-to-buy-now
 buyers.
 • Create well-structured sales pathways or funnels leading to a buying
 decision.
 • Last, don’t be overly afraid of repelling or alienating non-buyers.
 Don’t be overly sensitive to criticism from non-buyers. The votes that really count belong to the buyers.

##### CHAPTER 15

### Transformation through

## Optimization

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3: The Number-One Way to
 Prevent Wasted Marketing Dollars

###### I have no desire to throw away a single dollar of my hard-earned money. And I am sure the same is true for you.
 Another reason why social media should be a tool in any sophisticated marketer’s arsenal is the ability to test theories and optimize accordingly at a moment’s notice. Unlike direct mail, print advertising, or other media channels, there is no need to invest significant dollars or wait 30, 60, or 90 days to see if version A, B, or C of your ad works. Tracked correctly, in a day or two you will know exactly what the results are of your different ads and can scale up or down accordingly.
 I attended a conference a few years ago and sat in complete disbelief. During an awards program, no one was told why the winners had been selected or how it had anything to do with the dollars-and-sense results of the ad creation that caused them to win.
 Nothing. And this was a major advertising conference. It did not matter one bit how much money was spent on the ad campaign vs. how much was earned. Accolades and pretty crystal statues


-----

###### were served up regardless of ROI.
 Of course it is much easier to operate this way. Fluffy awareness-based campaigns can be based on assumptions, guesses, gut instincts, or even on the artistic whims of a quirky creative director. They are campaigns that are “fun” to put together and stress-free as they don’t have any level of accountability. But they should only be used if you are also willing to light your money on fire.
 Put the match away. Foolish companies allow their money to be spent on whims. Great marketing that produces monetary results is based on facts, not guesses. Optimized results are developed by examining data and changing campaigns accordingly.
 In comes the power of social media. In real time, you can optimize an ad campaign based on an audience’s behaviors, likes, habits, and hobbies. You can instantly scale advertising spend up or down depending on the results you are getting.

 Split Testing The reality is, though, that very few businesses use even 20% of social media’s power. So they are wasting their dollars time and time again in this channel. They guess instead of test. They assume instead of research.
 One rule of marketing that I have found to be true time and time again is assumptions are usually wrong. When I am speaking to an audience or presenting online training, I share some of our top split tests. And 90% of the time, the audience gets it wrong.
 Nine times out of ten, they are wrong. This means that if ads are only created on assumptions as to what will work the best, then ads will never be optimized. Just think how much money is wasted! Just think of all the vacations at the beach with a hot sun, a cool breeze, and an ice-cold drink in your hand could have been taken with this money. Stop assuming and start testing.
 On the following three pages are some split tests to challenge your wits. Guess which one you think won. The answer for Figures 15.1 and 15.2 is on page 297. The answer for Figures 15.3 and 15.4 is on page 297. The answer for Figures 15.5 and 15.6 is on page 298.
 How many did you guess correctly?


-----

###### If you are like my audiences, not many. Do you know the one thing I am 100% sure about in marketing? That is, I don’t know all of the answers (or even most of them). In my career I am blessed to be able to do a lot of professional speaking and am often asked questions about the best ways to execute strategies. I get questions such as how often to post a new Facebook status, the best times to send out an email, or the most effective headlines to generate the biggest response. While I can offer general best practices (post at most once per day, don’t send out your emails on a Monday, and make the headline about the target audience’s pain), I can’t offer specific strategies without one very important step—testing.
 Testing communications strategies to a small segment of the target audience before launching to the entire audience is a way to gather data on the most effective method of communication.
