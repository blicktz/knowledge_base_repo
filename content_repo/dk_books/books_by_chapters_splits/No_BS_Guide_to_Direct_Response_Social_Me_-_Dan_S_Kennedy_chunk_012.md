6. RESULTS RULE Results Rule. Period. Consider the simple agreement: You want your car hand-washed and waxed outside, vacuumed inside, for which you will pay your neighbor’s teen $20. If he does not wash or wax or vacuum the car but wants the $20 anyway, what possible “story” could he offer in place of the result of a clean car that would satisfy you? I would hope none. You didn’t offer to pay for a story. You offered to pay for a clean car. The same is true with advertising and marketing investments in social media. Do not let anyone confuse, bamboozle, or convince you otherwise. Further, no opinions count—not even yours. Only results matter.

#### Breakthrough Moments

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips If you are going to reach your destination, you have to take your first step. Of course, it does help if you have great shoes.
 When I first read Dan’s No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing for Non- Direct Marketing Businesses (Entrepreneur Press, 2018), I was hooked. I felt like I did as a kid when I was finally able to ride a bike beyond my driveway by myself. The possibilities were endless.


-----

###### I couldn’t wait to try the strategies I learned from him to see what improvements I could make for my company and financial well-being.
 I recognized that what I was doing before wasn’t working and it was time to make a change. If I ever wanted to sell my company, it had to first stop losing money and I had to stop losing the joy of running it.

 What I Needed to Change First

 1. Positioning. This is your place in the marketplace.
 I had to change my position as a consulting firm that was in demand instead of “in desperate need.” I needed to stop competing in a crowded marketplace of local “full service” marketing agencies that could do everything for everyone. I had to stop being a commodity. Commodities compete on price, and the cheapest one wins. That is what working really hard for free looked like, and I couldn’t survive that way any longer.
 I had to become the expert in my industry so that when prospects came my way, I was the only firm they were going to talk to. It needed to become more of a privilege for them to meet with me vs. the other way around. It wasn’t all smoke and mirrors though. I am the industry expert when it comes to direct-response social media marketing with a high ROI. There is no other person with the same expertise as me. (Guess what, the same is true for you.) 2. Pricing. Being the cheapest wasn’t paying the bills, and that needed
 to change. I slowly started to increase new-client pricing. Admittedly it wasn’t until two years later that I finally raised prices with some of my long-term accounts. A lot left, but some stayed even though their monthly services fee was triple what it was when they started. Because even with the price increase, they were still making money hand over fist. This gave us fewer clients but more profit. Everyone was happy. Our minimum monthly fee to work with private clients went from $350 a month to $3,500 a month when I sold the agency. Ten times what it was when I started this process. Being fluff-free is very profitable. 3. Target market. My clients had been confined to the area in which I
 lived at this point. And that wasn’t working. Local brick-and-mortar

###### businesses in my community couldn’t afford to pay what we needed to earn in order to survive, or for the level of service we really needed to get tangible results. My target market had to grow beyond the five-mile radius of my office to a national and international stage in order to reach those who understood direct-response marketing and were hungry to expand to the digital marketplace. Thankfully, we knew the media channel that could reach a larger audience. (Hint, you are reading a book all about it.) 4. Media. First, I needed to actually use media. Up to this point, my
 marketing centered around my hand reaching out to someone else’s as I shook it. I owned a marketing company, yet grew my business by prospecting personally. In fact, it was all person-to-person, and I needed to scale quickly. I had to grow my list to include those I was targeting and to go beyond those I knew. I started in a channel I was most familiar with, LinkedIn, and then moved on to Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ (remember when that was a thing?). My results were astonishing. But more on that later.

 Of course, I had no money, so I couldn’t start by buying media. I also had limited time balancing the baby and my business. So, I started simple.
 I began by writing a weekly email that I also posted on my blog. I then distributed links to the blog through my social media channels. I focused my messaging on “marketing equaling results” and shared that anything else was pointless. I tried to be a little controversial to stand out in a crowded marketplace. Dan’s advice of “trying to be everything to everyone results in being nothing to anybody” stuck in my head. I had to focus on working with those who wanted results beyond just awareness. I had to focus on those who wanted measurement of results, accountability for their marketing, and a high ROI. Those who just wanted “branding” were no longer my target market. I was making a commitment to show clients not just our work, but their results… and I was all in.

 THE RESULTS The amazing thing was that my social media and blog strategy started to work. My strategies were producing results. I began to get prospect inquiries from businesses I had not met at a networking event. They were


-----

###### coming to me because I was the social media expert on getting a high Return on Investment. I used these same strategies in my clients’ businesses, and they worked there as well. At contract renewal time, our contracts weren’t being cut. In fact, clients were increasing their budgets.
 I landed some large accounts and cash flow improved, then I started to be able to choose my clients, instead of taking anyone with a pulse and a checkbook. I admit, saying “No, thank you” to someone who proves to be difficult during the sales process became one of my greatest joys. I love having the ability to prevent future pain for my team (and myself, for that matter) from someone who would obviously be a tyrant. (In case you were wondering, tyrants do not make great clients.)
 During this time, I also got more involved in the organization Dan Kennedy started, the GKIC Insider’s Circle. Unfortunately, I learned that Dan doesn’t have an affinity for women with hyphenated last names and also despised social media. Both were because he had never received much ROI from either.
 But I persisted. I would test all the direct-response strategies I learned in the channel I knew best—social media. I would try out these strategies first with my own business and then use what worked best to benefit our clients. Through this process, I grew my email list from 1,200 names (all of which I had received by going to a networking event, getting a card, and then entering it manually into my database) to more than 21,000 in just over one year using Facebook as our primary lead source.
 I also grew our revenue over 327%. We went from a company struggling to make payroll to a seven-figure business. I woke up every day with gratitude and kept up the strategies I was learning—and they kept paying off.

 My Lucky Broken iPad About a year into this large company shift, I was driving home one night after picking up my iPad from a repair shop. My then 1-year-old daughter had shattered its glass doing what 1-year-olds do. That happened to be one lucky iPad because as I drove home that night, I listened to the previous month’s audio program I received for being a Diamond member of GKIC.


-----

###### Listening, I discovered I could apply for a contest. The prize was a Mastermind Weekend with Dan at Disney World.
 The day I learned of this potentially life-changing opportunity also happened to be the last day of the contest. Never being one to shy away from a challenge of time, I raced home, helped my husband put the girls to bed, and with him cheering me (thankfully I am blessed to have a supportive husband, who also happens to be very cute, I might add), I set to work.
 I opened an e-fax account (did I mention Dan doesn’t use email?), wrote my application, sent it in, and waited.
 Waiting is my least favorite! But winning is my most favorite. The day I received a fax from him about being chosen as a finalist, I did an extended happy dance. Being a finalist meant that I was able to compete in a live phone-in program where I would share with others what I discovered through my time with GKIC and Dan that had changed my business and life. I would speak about the strategies I learned and the practices I put in place because of them. Independent judges would choose the winner, and Dan would announce the results live on the call.
 I was born for this challenge! I went into the contest believing that even if I didn’t win, this was my chance to share my gratitude with Dan for all I had learned through him that had changed my life.
 I spent a lot of time preparing for the competition. Thankfully over the course of the year of change, I became friends with some brilliant and kind entrepreneurs. I consulted dear friends who had competed as finalists in the past. They offered some poignant insights.
 I prepared by writing a script, buying the domain www.ILiveOnPlanetDan.com to post all my examples, and spent some time praying before the call.
 I was sooooooooo nervous. I sat alone in the most quiet space of my office building—our nursery. I provided child care for our staff members’ children along with my girls, but on this day, none of them were in. So, there I sat among jumpers and dolls and pastels bearing these young folks’ names, waiting.

 FINALLY IT WAS MY TURN


-----

###### My hands shook. My voice trembled. My heart beat so fast I thought Dan could hear it. But I kept reading my script. And reading. And reading. Dan, who had a reputation for being a curmudgeon, was supportive throughout and encouraged me to keep going.
 I finished my presentation and took a deep breath. Breathing was something I didn’t do much of back then.
 I had to wait to listen to the other callers. That was torture. Don’t get me wrong, they all had great stories, but waiting is my least favorite. It seemed like forever until they were done.
 Then it was time for a decision. The judges had chosen their favorite, and Dan was going to announce it after a few housekeeping items.

 AND THE WINNER WAS … Not me. Dang!
 Dan was kind to share that I was the other person he was debating on, but the judges felt strongly about awarding the contestant who was a manufacturer who successfully put direct-response marketing practices in place.
 But wait, all was not lost! In an act of delight and surprise, Dan announced that for the first time ever he was going to allow all the finalists to come to the Mastermind. We would have to pay our way to come, but if we did that, once we were there, we could participate in all activities for the weekend. We just needed to fax him and let him know if we were in.
 I couldn’t send in my acceptance fast enough. Two months later, I had my chance to present at the Winner’s Weekend Mastermind at Disney and get to know Dan better. We each had a hot seat, and I brought my A-Game. Afterwards at dinner, Dan approached the table and said, “I have a client I’d like you to work on. Send me a fax after this.”
 When he walked away, a friend I still have to this day, Steve Sipress, said, “You’ve just been called up from the Minor League to the Majors.”
 And major, it was. I landed the organization he started as a client and ran all their lead generation for over three years, generating millions of dollars for them and significant notoriety for my firm. I got to work with celebrities in our niche like Rich Schefren, Ron LeGrand, Jim Lange, Chris Cardell, Nick Nanton,

###### Pamela Yellen, and Robin Robins. It’s through knowing Dan that I got to work with Josh Turner who eventually made an offer and purchased my company.
 And now, of course, our partnership has produced the book you are reading and the updated version. Two years into working together, Dan Kennedy wrote a book with a woman with a hyphenated last name about social media: Me.
 A 20-year “overnight” success story of preparation meeting opportunity and going the extra mile, because my friend, it is a lot less crowded there.

 WORK SMARTER. NOT HARDER. Amen.

### From the Bottom Up,

## Direct Response

#### Six Direct-Response Marketing Principles that Have to be Applied to Social Media Marketing or
 You Might As Well Set Your Money on Fire (As
 Most Companies Do)

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Some marketing facts according to the Chief Marketing Officer Council:

 • 28% of marketers have reduced their advertising budget to fund more
 digital marketing (February 2015).
 • Worldwide social network ad spending reached $16.10 billion in
 2014, a 45.3% increase from 2013 that pushed social’s share of overall digital ad investment to 11.5%. Combined social network ad dollars from North America, Western Europe, and Asia-Pacific represented 93.7% of global expenditure (January 2015).
 • Marketers spent $4.4 billion on mobile advertising in the U.S. in
 2012. That figure doubled to $8.5 billion in 2013, and is projected to quadruple to $31.1 billion by 2017. Search advertising represents about half of the total (November 2014).
 • U.S. marketers spend an average of 2.5% of their total company
 revenue on digital marketing activities, according to a new report by


-----

###### Gartner Inc.
 • Social media advertising spend in the U.S. is expected to reach $18.4
 billion in 2019.
 • Marketers are increasing social ad budgets (up 32% in 2018 alone)
 and producing more ads than ever before. One of every four Facebook pages now uses paid media, and Facebook already accounts for 23% of total U.S. digital ad spending.
 • Emarketer estimated that the ad spending on social video in the U.S.
 increased by 38.1% during 2018, reaching $7.85 billion.
 • Facebook controlled 84.9% of this social video ad growth.
 • Social media is the most relevant advertising channel for 50% of Gen
 Z and 42% of Millennials.
 • 57% of Millennials feel that ads are becoming more relevant.
 • 45% of Gen Z and 41% of Gen X-ers feel the same, while only 27%
 of Baby Boomers feel this way.
 • Noncustomers are three times more likely than customers to visit
 retailers from social media ads.
 • 50% of consumers said that seeing user-generated content would
 increase their chances of buying products through a brand’s social media.
 • 49% said that easy payment systems (like Amazon Pay) would
 increase their chances of buying through social media.
 • Social Media Examiner conducted its annual survey of 3,000
 companies on their use and results from social media marketing, and the outcomes are horrifying, yet not surprising. While 86% of marketers indicate that social media is important for their business, 89% said “increased exposure” was their number-one benefit, and only 37% of marketers think their Facebook efforts are effective. Over 75% of them don’t know how to measure their results.[1]

 How This Way of Thinking Is Dead Wrong But here’s the thing: Anyone who either doesn’t know if their marketing is working and/or thinks the focus should be awareness building and not revenue generation could make some small but significant tweaks to their efforts and drive huge results.
