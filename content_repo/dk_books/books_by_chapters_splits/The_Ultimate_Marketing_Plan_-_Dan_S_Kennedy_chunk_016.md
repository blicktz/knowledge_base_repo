##### I don’t know about you, but I enter all those darned magazine company sweepstakes. I go for the Reader’s Digest sweepstakes and I buy my weekly lottery tickets—after all, as a character in the movie Let It Ride said, “You could be walking around lucky and not know it.” In a lot of years, though, I have gone winless. The guys with the balloons and the giant-sized check have not shown up at my door. So the headline FINALLY—YOU ARE A SWEEPSTAKES WINNER! got me. I read that letter. And if you send a letter to every one of your customers with that headline on it, every one of them will read it.

 What should the letter say? Here’s an example, courtesy of the late, great copywriter, my friend Gary Halbert:

 Dear Valued Customer:

 I am writing to tell you that your name was entered into a drawing here at my store and you have won a valuable prize.

 As you know, my store, ABC Jewelry, specializes in low-cost, top-quality diamond rings and diamond earrings. Well, guess what? The other day we got in a small shipment of fake diamonds that are made with a new process that makes them look so real they almost fooled me!

 Anyway, I don’t want to sell these fakes because they could cause a lot of trouble for the pawnbrokers around town. So I’ve decided to give them away to some of my good customers whose names were selected at random by having my wife, Janet, put all the names in a jar and pull out the winners.

 So, you’re one of the winners—and all you’ve got to do is drop in sometime before 5:00 P.M. Friday and you’ll have a 1-karat “diamond” that looks so good it’ll knock your eyes out!

 Sincerely,

 John Jones

 P.S.: After 5:00 P.M. Friday, I reserve the right to give your prize to someone else. Thank you.

 With some variation of this idea, you can get all your customers to flood your store within a short period of time. Then, if you have new products or special offers ready and waiting, the cash register will ring happily.

 The Red-Tag Sale

-----

##### “It’s inventory clearance time and we’re closing all day Friday to go through the stores and place new red tags on as many items as possible, each with the lowest price ever offered on it. Only a certain number of each red-tag item will be available, on a first-come, first-satisfied basis. The red-tag sale starts at 10:00 A.M. Saturday morning. Red tags will disappear all day long. The later in the day, the fewer the red tags.”

 That’s the basic pitch for a red-tag sale. These tend to work well once or twice a year for retail businesses.

 Coupons, Double Coupons, and Checks

 Lots of people buy the newspaper on certain days just to get all the grocery store and manufacturers’ coupons inside. They carefully go through all this coupon-driven advertising and inserts, scissors in hand, with buying on their minds. You can capitalize on this with an ad or insert on this day that is made up of coupons and looks like all the other coupon advertising.

 If I had a shoe store, for example, my Sunday newspaper insert might be a page of coupons: one for boys’ shoes, one for girls’ shoes, one for men’s, etc.

 There’s usually at least one supermarket in each area that advertises a “Double Coupon Day,” when all manufacturers’ coupons are accepted and doubled; a fifty-cent-off coupon becomes worth one dollar off.

 If you accept manufacturers’ coupons, this is a promotion worth considering. If not, there may be another way you can use the same idea. You might, for example, send a letter to your customer list in advance of your coupon-type newspaper ad advising them of its impending appearance and giving them a card or certificate that doubles the value of the coupons.

 I saw a fast-food chain put up signs outside all its stores while Burger King, its competitor, was running a big coupon promotion:

-----

#### WE ACCEPT BURGER KING COUPONS AND GIVE DOUBLE VALUE!

##### If mailing to customers for a special sale, consider enclosing a “real” check, made out to your own store, with the customer’s name on it where the signature belongs. The check is redeemable at your store but otherwise useless. There’s something psychologically challenging about throwing out a check.

 The Premium Makes the Difference

 Find a good source for one or more very desirable, appealing premiums and you can build a surge around the “free gift” you offer.

 “Gift with purchase” was invented by cosmetic industry pioneer Estée Lauder. It remains the staple of that business. Visit department store cosmetic counters and you will find just about every brand has gift with purchase offers. In the retail menswear industry, where the norm is discounts, Bill Glazer frequently relied on appealing premiums instead, for his stores and the thousands following his lead, and by doing so protected profits better and put forward more interesting promotions. Televisions and other electronics are very effective premiums, particularly around Christmas. Getaway weekend packages work well for car dealers. The most interesting one I’ve ever seen: a free Mustang convertible with purchase of a Rolls Royce. One outstanding source of low-cost premium merchandise is the closeout merchandise industry. This industry has its own trade shows, newspaper, and catalog companies.

 Many of my clients in sales fields, such as financial advisors, insurance salespeople, real-estate agents, and business-to-business sales professionals, also use the gift-with-appointment tactic to get to the desired decision makers. Some years ago, I encouraged a sales rep for a software system for dentists to send out a prospecting letter with a toothbrush enclosed to gain attention, the letter offering a six-foot-high giant toothbrush as a gift just for twenty minutes to demo the software. He got nine appointments for every ten letters sent—and they called him!

 I often advise not giving away what you sell as incentive. It risks undermining your price integrity, it may not be all that motivational— just “more of the same”—and it may cost you more than appealing premiums and gifts can be obtained for from wholesale sources. If you are going to use gift-with-appointment or gift-with-purchase a lot, it’s worth fully familiarizing yourself with a wide variety of wholesale sources.

##### In some cases, you may be able to get appealing premiums provided to you for free. The owner of several upscale jewelry stores in one market got a local gourmet restaurant to give him $100.00 gift certificates, free, to gift-with-purchases of certain jewelry items. In return, obviously, the restaurateur got promotion to customers known to have a certain level of affluence.

 Premiums can and do drive sales. They can flush customers out of the woodwork who’ve been inactive and encourage regular customers to buy or renew earlier than their need or buy different items or services than they usually buy. Thus, they can be used not only to create a cash flow surge but also strategically to influence and alter customer behavior.

 For Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™, I am often writing copy to promote our next major conference, and many Members attend regularly year after year, but it’s important to get as many as possible to register early, months in advance, in order to reduce the outlay of marketing dollars and boost profits and permit logistical planning based on reality rather than guesswork. Because the same people see these promotions event after event, year after year, I’m charged with figuring out a new and different premium/bonus gift to motivate that immediate, early registration. Over the years, I’ve had good luck with offering fees waived for the after-event Bonus Day on a specialized topic, invitations to private receptions and photo opportunities with celebrities, an opportunity to participate in competitions, and, most recently, special “take-home blueprints” matched with every workshop session. But I’m not above also using far less valuable but more beguiling items like collector-edition souvenir logo apparel and even a Dan Kennedy bobblehead!

 The “My Accountant Thinks I’m Crazy” Sale

 Sometimes humor works in marketing. I’ve used this myself, in sale promotions for my mail-order company, and I’ve seen both retailers and service providers use it effectively.

 A tongue-in-cheek ad or letter talks about your annoyance at your nagging, domineering, penny-pinching Scroogeish accountant; how he bullies you, pushes you around, and watches you like a hawk … but now that he’s out of town on vacation for the week, you’re going to have some fun with the wildest, most generous offers in the history of your business… .

 Sports-Related Promotions

 America loves its sports activities, and sports are always on the minds of a lot of people, so tie-in promotions get favorable attention. For several years in a row, I’ve run a “triple-play” promotion for my mail-order company, offering a “buy one, get two free” deal to my best customers. This is the same as a 67 percent discount, but three-for-one sounds a lot bigger. And I tie the whole thing to baseball, either early in

-----

##### spring or at World Series time, with free baseball cards, baseball terminology and clip art, and so on. IT’S TRIPLE PLAY TIME has pulled as much as a 70 percent response from my customers.

 Trade-Ins

 Trade-in promotions are, of course, standard in the automobile business and common with sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, and automobile batteries—but there are lots of other businesses that could use this technique, including office equipment; television, stereo, and electronics; even clothing, with the trade-ins going to the Salvation Army. A spa selling memberships could accept old exercise equipment.

 Easy Payment Terms

 If you cover your costs, why not finance your profits? Let’s say you want to feature and sell a $300.00 item that costs you $100.00. You might offer your customers this deal: $100.00 down, then four monthly payments of $50.00 each, no interest, no carrying charges. Just have them place their VISA, MasterCard, or American Express card numbers with you and sign a simple statement authorizing you to charge their credit cards each month automatically.

 You can apply the same structure to hitting a certain size of purchase: buy $500.00 or more and we’ll finance two-thirds of the sale.

 Cash in Accumulated, Unconverted Leads

 Often businesses have prospects who’ve called, visited websites, and even come in for appointments and not purchased who receive only a few after-the-fact attempts to persuade them to buy then are given up on. Sometimes there is a lot of dormant, untapped value there, especially if you are in a business where the purchase is likely to be a subject of procrastination due to money or timing or other reasons. At worst, periodic, aggressive marketing campaigns to old leads will usually provide enough new customers to justify the investment, but sometimes the results can be much more exciting. The following example produces between $20.00 to as much as $80.00 for every $1.00 invested in it, every time.

#### Great Example!

##### A very active Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Member, Dr. Brian Bergh, an orthodontist, has used the following three-step direct-mail campaign for the past four years with consistent success.

 This three-step letter campaign is sent to people who have had an initial consultation with Dr. Bergh for orthodontic treatment but have yet to commit to treatment. The patient or parent is given a call to action, a deadline, and a benefit for responding to the letter. This campaign offers a “birthday present” in the form of a courtesy amount off the total treatment fee as a gift from Dr. Bergh’s son, Bryley. Each year, the offer has changed slightly to be relevant to Bryley’s age and has been in the form of a percentage of the total fee or a hard dollar amount.

 The letter sequence starts out with the first letter sent from Bryley letting the patient or parent know about the great idea he had for his birthday—to give patients in his dad’s office a birthday present from him. At the end of the letter he introduces his two dogs, Rex and Scamp, as a prelude to the second and third letters that are forthcoming.

 The second letter comes from the two dogs, Rex and Scamp, wondering why the patient hasn’t responded yet. This letter gives the patient an excuse for being distracted and encourages him or her to take action before the deadline.

 The third letter comes from one of the dogs, alluding to the fact that the patient has not responded and therefore must be lost. Sending his bigger brother, Rex, out to look for the patient didn’t work, because now he’s lost, too. And more drastic measures may be necessary in sending out the St. Bernard.

 The first two letters are sent in colored envelopes with handwritten addresses and just a return address, no name. The third letter is sent in a brown paper bag and has a couple of dog treats included to get the extra discount. The letters are also printed on fun, festive paper to tie in with the celebration at hand.

 Using children and animals appeals to many and gives Dr. Bergh an opportunity to contact patients in an appealing and fun way.

 Yes, people respond to letters like this, even from a professional office.

##### What Do You Need for the Ultimate Cash Flow Surge Plan?

 You’ve seen it all here. Ideally, you have a good list of present, active, past, maybe lost customers, and possibly a list of unconverted leads—prospects who’ve expressed interest, visited your store, attended your free event, and gotten information from your website but not purchased. Next, you need to construct the most compelling and appealing offer that you can. Remember to attach a satisfactory reason why. Definitely consider use of premiums. Put together a multistep, multimedia campaign to carry the offer to the list(s).

### Ultimate Marketing Plan Success
 Factor #11

##### Profitably Using Marketing Technologies and Online/Internet
 Marketing Media

 No Ultimate Marketing Plan could be complete without making profitable use of the current technology (which exists and is proliferating to speed up and automate the delivery of your marketing messages) and at least integrating some use of the Internet and all of its media. The key word in all of that is profitable. That must be your watchword. There is enormous temptation to use technology just because it exists and you can or because all the cool kids are using it, but you are a businessperson and now a savvy marketer, so you must demand each and every technology earn its way with measurable, provable profits. There is enormous pressure to be everywhere, use everything, and keep expanding your use of the Internet and all its wonders, even as each category has a wildly multiplying population. Not long ago, as example, social media was MySpace. Now it is Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, StumbleUpon, Reddit, and on and on and on, and it has many spreading their attention thinner and thinner and thinner desperately trying to be active in every such place. But you are a businessperson and now a savvy marketer, so you must demand each and every online media, place, and activity earn its way with measurable, provable profits. You must insist on “Show me the money!”

 I begin with two confessions. One, I detest the Internet personally and stubbornly refuse to have anything to do with it. I happen to believe it is an extremely dangerous evil that the Pandora of technology foolishly let out of its box and that despite the enormous opportunities it brought and brings and wealth it has created and is creating, it is still far more destructive to the economy and to society than it’s worth. It is the

-----

##### first industrial/technological revolution to erase far more jobs and small businesses than it creates, at a dramatically accelerating pace, making it the driving force (hardly anyone acknowledges) in the making of a permanent 10 to 15 percent unemployed and larger underemployed underclass and a more vicious concentrator of more wealth in fewer hands than anything we’ve ever seen. As the whole world is sucked into smartphones, entire industries providing hundreds of thousands of jobs each are disappearing.

 It is also a dumbing-down force, creating a less intelligent, less informed, less active, less healthy, and less civil population—a retreat to living in caves and communicating in grunts. I am not alone in these opinions; numerous academic experts and business realists agree.

 I do not have my computers hooked up to it (I use them as typewriters) and, in fact, personally have no Internet connection period. I have never personally surfed, Googled, or purchased anything online. I personally have no presence on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or anywhere else online. And for the record, I also refuse to own a cell phone, and if you are at lunch or dinner with me and take yours out, I’ve begun the practice of yelling for the check and leaving. Rude to rude, eye for an eye. It is my conviction we have permitted technology to go from servant to master, now directing humans in reverse evolution. We have ceased growing our capabilities in favor of an ever-growing dependence on technology for even the most mundane and simple of tasks.

 So, to finish this first confession, in this chapter, you are going to get Internet marketing advice and technology advice from somebody who despises just about all of it and sees it having turned a corner from assisting business and society to at least retarding it if not destroying it.
