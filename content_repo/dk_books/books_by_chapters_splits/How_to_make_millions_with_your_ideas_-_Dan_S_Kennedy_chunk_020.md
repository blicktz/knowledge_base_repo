      All you need to be in this business is information people will
    pay for and access to something as simple as a photocopier.
    These days, personal computers with desktop publishing capa-
    bilities have made the preparation of printed information prod-
    ucts easier than ever, but there’s still a lot of money being made
    with simple products prepared on an ordinary typewriter.
      This is the business I work in the most with my own com-
    panies and with clients. In this chapter, I'll tell you more about
    the types of information products that make fortunes, the mar-
    keting of information products, and introduce you to some re-
    markable successes.
     The diversity of successful information products is amazing.
   Many of these products have to do with hobbies and recreational
    interests. Several years ago, Patti Carlson sold millions of dollars’
    worth of her How to Play Piano Overnight kit via direct-response
    television. Today, Robert Laughlin sells a home-study course,
   How to Play Your Favorite Songs on the Piano in Just 3
   Hours—Without Reading Music or Taking Piano Lessons. 1/00
    Delicious Hawaiian Recipes You Can Easily Make at Home is
    a simple booklet advertised and sold through classified ads in
    tabloids and women’s magazines.
     Many information products are business- and occupation-
    oriented. Joe Sabah has sold thousands of his 104-page booklet
   How to Get the Job You Want and Get Employers to Call You
   by being a guest on radio talk shows (see chapter 10). There are
    three different entrepreneurs I know who successfully sell book-
    lets, plans, and kits on the topic Making Money at Home as a
   PVC Furniture Manufacturer. The least expensive booklet sells
    for $10; the most expensive kit for $150. Hume Publishing Com-
    pany built a huge business selling its Successful Investing course
    as a subscription, using direct mail. Many information products
    focus on health and fitness, privacy protection, travel, beauty and
    fashion, and games and gambling.
     As you can see, the only thing these products have in com-
    mon is that they are information. They deal with very different
    topics and interests, they have different price points, they are
    comprised

   The Incredible Financial Leverage Secret of
        Publishing on Demand’
   I first started to print my own money in earnest in 1978.
 Shortly after I became a professional speaker and joined the Na-
 tional Speakers Association, I discovered that, with my back-
 ground in advertising, marketing, and sales, I knew more about
 how to get bookings and clients than many people who had been
 involved in the speaking business for -years. I created an ugly,
 cheap, homemade four-page catalog of Special Reports on dif-
 ferent topics appealing to my speaking colleagues, with titles
 like:
   How to Find Hidden Markets for Your Speaking Services
   What to Write in a Simple Letter to Get Meeting Plan-
      ners Eagerly Calling You (Never Make a Cold Call
      Again)
   How to (At Least) Double Your Fee Every Time You
     Speak With After-the-Fact, Follow-up Product Sales
    17 Most Common Mistakes Made by Speakers with Their
     Brochures and Demo Tapes—and How to Avoid
     Them
   I can’t even find this old catalog or any of these reports now,
 but as I recall there were about twenty different titles priced from
 $3 to $15 each. Each one was four to no more than twenty
 typewritten pages. And I used what we now call publishing on
 demand; I never printed up any inventory. I had the typewritten
 originals in plastic page protectors and, when an order came in
 for a particular report, I took those originals off the shelf, stuck
 them in the photocopier at the Kwik-Kopy down the street, made

```
    with my simple, dirt-cheap catalogs sent out to only about 2,000
    speakers, brought in over $11,000 in about a month. Some or-
    dered one report, most ordered two, three, or four, a few ordered
    ten or even all of them. A report I sold for $3 cost about 40
    cents to photocopy and 20 cents to mail. A big chunk of that
    $11,000 was profit.
      I learned three valuable lessons Fornt that simple, primitive
    experience very early in my career: (1) The value of targeting a
    particular specialized market and creating information products
    of great interest exclusively to those people; (2) that what you
    can charge for information products has virtually no relationship
    to what they cost to make, only to the value of the content to
    the buyer, which means you can build incredibly high markups
    into these products; and (3) that you could make them as needed,
    avoiding tying up even a penny in inventory, so all your avail-
    able financial resources could go into marketing (where, in my
    opinion, they belong).
     Now, I have a confession: today, eighteen years later, my
    (part-time) million-dollar-a-year collection of information prod-
    ucts publishing businesses isn’t a whole lot more sophisticated
    or complicated than my first primitive reports project. In one of
    my businesses, I have twenty different information products,
    ranging from a simple spiral-bound manual (that sells for $69)
    to kits including six to twelve audiocassettes, videotapes, 200 to
    300 pages of written instructions and examples in a three-ring
    notebook, divided into. sections, and separate reports (the kits
     sell for $399). In another business, I publish a monthly business
    newsletter, a monthly travel newsletter in another. And, in a third
    business, I develop information products for sale by other pub-
    lishers. Of all of these products, only a few are manufactured in
    substantial quantities in advance of their sales and warehoused.
    Most are published on demand.
      Consider one of the kits on a very specific topic. Depending
   on what I’m doing and how I’m advertising, in any given month
    we may sell 20 or 30 copies of this particular product; in other
    months we may only sell two or three. I have no interest in tying

 come in. The masters of the audiocassettes are taken off the shelf
 and, in a tabletop high-speed duplicator, three copies are made,
 then labeled. The originals for all the written materials are put
 through the photocopier and three copies are made. Universal
 notebooks with clear plastic sleeves on the cover, which we can
 use for many of my products, are taken out of inventory and this
 product’s cover is slipped into the sleeve. The parts are then
 assembled and the product is ready to ship. The cost of publish-
 ing on demand this way versus producing hundreds of copies in
 advance and holding them in inventory is only about 15 percent
 higher. This particular product costs me about $20. I could save
 15 percent of that, $3.50, if I produced, say, 300 of these things
 in advance, and tied up $6,000 in inventory for six months to a
 year at a time. To do that with twenty similar products, I'd have
 $120,000, more or less, permanently sunk into inventory, turning
 over sluggishly and slowly. By publishing on demand, I’m able
 to use all that money for marketing, and turn it over every month
 or so.
  This is less important to me today than it was eighteen years
 ago, but for someone starting out, or someone who wants to offer
 a large number of titles to a specialized market, this can make
 all the difference in the world. Too many people make the mis-
 take of investing months, even years, of effort in writing their
 information product, tie up all their money in a garage full of
 beautifully published books or audiocassette programs, and only
 then start wondering: Who will buy them? How will I reach these
 people? Where will the resources come from to do the mar-
 keting?

    foot facility with a refrigerator in the corner, and an office in
   my home, with both a shower and refrigerator just down the hall;
    with nothing more than a phone, answering machine, fax, and
    typewriter; with manufacturing facilities, with a retail storefront,
    with salesforces. Out of all that, I have arrived at several con-
    clusions, for me. They may not all be just right for you, too, but
    they have proved important to me, so here they are:
    1. Many people build businesses that are the antithesis of their
     desired lifestyles, and wind up trapped rather than liberated,
     frustrated rather than joyful, bored rather than creative, and
     often asset rich but cash poor. I have made this very mistake,
     and have spent years extricating myself from the results. I’m
     frequently tempted to make it all over again and have to fight
     the temptation.
    2. Many people feel that they are not really ‘‘in business’’ unless
     and until they surround themselves with the physical trap-
     pings commonly and customarily associated with being in
     business, so they pile up overhead and fixed expenses to the
      detriment, not the facilitation, of achieving their most impor-
      tant goals via the shortest and most direct path.
    3. The more your available financial resources, time resources,
     and energy resources are consumed by managing and taking
     care of and paying for things and employees, the fewer re-
     sources you have to devote to efforts that clearly and directly
      create sales, revenue, profits, and customers, and, secondarily,
      the less money you can extract from your business for your-
      self and your family. Generally, the more of your resources
     you liberate from things and employees and invest in pro-
     ductive advertising, marketing, promotion, and sales, the
     more money you’ll make and the faster you’ll make it.
    4. The development and marketing of information products is a
     business endeavor that lends itself perfectly to avoid items 1
     and 2 above, and to do item 3.

    Can a Big Business Be Built with Simple
   Information Products and Direct Marketing?
      Meet the $200 Million Man!
  My good friend Ted Nicholas started in the publishing busi-
 ness with a simple inspiration. Ted was a hyperactive entrepre-
 neur who started a number of corporations; each time he
 incorporated, he was annoyed by giving the lawyers hundreds of
 dollars just to get a few forms filled in, usually by the lawyer’s
 secretary. It occurred to him that this probably irritated a lot of
 other entrepreneurs, and for some people starting on really tight
 budgets who wanted to protect themselves through incorporation,
 it might even be too costly and stop them in their tracks.
  A little research revealed to Ted that incorporation was ac-
 tually very simple for most small business purposes, and any-
 body could fill out and file the forms. There was no requirement
 that a lawyer do it. Further, he found that there were significant
 tax, privacy, and other advantages from incorporating in Dela-
 ware, regardless of where a person lived and operated his.
 business.
  Ted wrote all this information down and turned it into a very
 simple, straightforward how-to book. He added all the forms
 needed to incorporate in Delaware, one blank set to use and one
 sample set completed as a model. Finally, he added the phone
 numbers and addresses of the incorporation offices and other
 contacts useful for incorporating in Delaware and every other
 state. He turned it into an 82 x 11" 100-page book that cost
 him about a dollar to produce in quantity—although this same
 information could have been put in a number of different for-
 mats. (Today, form-your-own-corporation kits are commonplace,
 sold on computer diskettes, as books or manuals, or just the
 forms in an envelope. But at the time, Ted was plowing new
 ground.)
  Ted titled his book How to Form Your Own Corporation
 Without a Lawyer for Under $50.00, and started promoting it

```

```
    erating out of his living room, Ted went on to sell over 1 million
    copies of this book. In total, he sold over $200 million worth of
    thirteen different business books, manuals in three-ring note-
    books, and reports he wrote, plus a number of other authors’
    products, before selling his company, Enterprise Publishing, to
   Dearborn Press, a New York book publisher, in 1992. You prob-
    ably saw Ted’s full-page ads for How to Form Your Own Cor-
   poration in airline and business magazines.
     Ted has become something of a legend in direct-marketing
    industry circles. He is very much in demand as a lecturer at
    publishing and marketing conferences (including mine), and
    picks and chooses a consulting project now and again, but he
    spends most of his time at his retirement home in Switzerland,
    skiing, enjoying fine wines, traveling a little, writing a little, and
    relaxing a lot. The $200 million man is a very relaxed fellow.
       If You Think Ted Nicholas’s Success Is a
        Fluke You Could Never Duplicate,
            Think Again
     Chase Revel started the business that ultimately became En-
    trepreneur magazine with classified ads, selling ‘‘Insider Re-
    ports’’ revealing the profits made in different types of businesses.
     My client John Mortz earns a high five-figure annual income
    selling his reports, manuals, and courses about making money at
   home with your computer through classified and small display
    ads in a handful of magazines. John doesn’t even have a single
    helper! His customers either mail in their orders or leave their
    orders with credit card information on John’s voice mail. He
    publishes most of his products on demand, and ships from a Mail
    Boxes Etc. In my opinion, John could multiply his business ten
    times almost overnight if he devoted his full attention to it, but
    he enjoys doing consulting work in the computer programming
    field, so his information products business is still spare time.

 single-family homes and apartment complexes during the last
 huge real estate boom in California and Arizona. Then, a dra-
 matic change in interest rates and tax benefits tied to real estate .
yanked the rug right out from under his empire. One month, he
 was riding around in limousines, flying his own plane from city
 to city to buy properties, enjoying a millionaire’s income and
 lifestyle; the next month, his properties were all in foreclosure
 and Ted was fighting to pay the rent on a cheap one-bedroom
 apartment. As a result of his crash, Ted learned a great deal about
 the hidden profits in foreclosures. Ted fought his way back to
 personal wealth by buying, trading, and reselling foreclosure
 properties. Gradually, he arrived at a system for making money
 that he believed anybody could learn and follow, which he wrote
 about in his first self-published book, which he began promoting
 with small ads and by speaking at real estate investment semi-
 nars. To avoid risking his own money, Ted developed unique
 joint-venture promotions with big names in real estate and in-
 vestment training, like Howard Ruff and Robert Allen.
   With virtually no investment of his own money, Ted quickly
 sold tens of thousands of his first book at the stiff price of $89
 each. He expanded his information product line with several
 other books, audiotapes, and a home-study course all on fore-
 closure investing, another set of information products on nego-
 tiation, and, recently, yet another set of information products
 dealing with the how-tos of joint-venture marketing. His lowest
 priced item is $19.95, his highest priced $1,700!
   The impressive success Ted has had with his own informa-
 tion products led him to contacts and working relationships with
 many other experts in this field, myself included, and in 1994
 Ted hosted a three-day information marketers’ conference in Las
 Vegas, with over twenty different speakers—including Ted
 Nicholas and me—over 500 people in attendance at an average
 of $200 each—$100,000 in registration fees—and, yes, he filled
 this conference through joint-venture marketing, without spend-
 ing a cent of his own money.

    without notes, and recalling phone numbers and addresses, facts,
    figures, statistics, even chemical formulas. He created his rep-
    utation through old-fashioned work: going out and giving
    speeches and seminars, at first for small businesses and sales
    groups and then gradually working his way up to large audiences
    and major corporations. Bob developed a number of audiocas-
         . sette information products, including memory-training programs,
    vocabulary-improvement programs, and a course for salespeople,
    How to Create Endless Referrals. As a speaker, Bob sells over
    $500,000 a year of his information products personally. And his
    success with that method of marketing enabled me to obtain a
    contract for him with the Guthy-Renker Corporation, for his own
    TV infomercial.
     From my own client base alone, I could give you dozens
    more examples, and I know of hundreds. But here’s how to
    prove to yourself that you can do it, too: Pick up just about any
    magazine, and take note of everything from the classified ads to
    the large, full-page ads either directly selling an information
    product or offering free literature. Check issues of those same
    magazines at the library that are six months, a year, even years
    old—and you’ll be able to find many of those same ads. Pick
    out'a few dozen and answer them, and study the sales letters,
    literature, and information products you receive. You will soon
    see patterns that you or anybody could follow to achieve success
    in this field. Basically, if you know something that will be of
    interest to a certain group of people, and those people can be
     efficiently reached, you have the basis for this kind of business.
      For Every Success I Tell You About, I Can
        Also Tell You About 100 Failures
      Quite frankly, making a million selling information isn’t as
    easy as I’ve probably made it sound so far. Oh, everything I’ve
    told you is true, and every component of success I’ve pointed
