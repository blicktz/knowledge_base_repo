One great opportunity is to reach prospects and customers in new ways and possibly reach people via one of these ways you might not reach otherwise. Another great opportunity is to be more diverse, expansive, and aggressive in marketing with relatively low-cost media. The biggest advantage is that tech media tends to democratize marketing opportunity, to level the playing field between the well-capitalized Goliaths and the tiniest Davids. After all, a tweet is a tweet, and McDonald’s really can’t do it any better or any differently than can the two partners with the Korean BBQ taco truck. For these reasons, you have to pay attention, seek information, learn, evaluate, assess, and choose to use at least some of it in some ways.

 The hazards are severe. The biggest is becoming too easily distracted and seduced, chasing after one shiny object after another but never really locking in a foundational Ultimate Marketing Plan you stick with and systematically, doggedly implement with consistency and constancy. Another is permitting yourself to be overwhelmed and spread too thin trying to do too many things or, worse, everything and every new thing. You have to rank and rerank opportunities, and act realistically within the context of your resources, time, willingness to work, and willingness to learn. Better to do five marketing activities very well for maximum impact than fifty poorly with minimum impact.

 Tech is incredibly seductive. Visit an Apple store on a Saturday to see its seductiveness in action. Watch how fast the masses line up to buy the next new gizmo, even if the gizmo already in hand is meeting all their needs with immense capabilities left over. Observe people abandoning thought for dependence. People use handheld GPS to direct them step by step to the nearest Starbucks. Incredible. This seductiveness extends into the small business and into the corporate boardroom so that too much behavior mimics that of the people lining up outside that Apple store at 4:00 A.M. to be in the first few thousand to get their paws on that next gadget. Distraction, diffusion of resources, and neglect or abandonment of what works are all hazards to be vigilant of.

 Reality Check on Media

-----

##### These days, many businesses struggle with too many media choices to manage, financial pressure not to use them all and to choose the cheapest, and peer pressure to favor trendy media over old media. Here are a few facts to add to your pondering:

-----

#### Print Versus Online

##### A major university, not eager to be named but reporting to one of the research groups I subscribe to, was thinking about saving money by discontinuing its six-times-a-year alumni magazine and delivering it only online. A survey of alumni showed that 78 percent favored the move and indicated a preference for receiving it online. But, 63 percent of the donors expressed strong disapproval and wanted to continue receiving the printed magazine. Along the same lines, the director of an animal rescue charity told me that their print newsletter always generated more in immediate donations than it cost, brought donations from people who never responded to their e-mail campaigns, and, in 2009, brought in over a dozen new big donors—me included. And, like me, most had been receiving it for many months before writing the first check.

#### Still Using Mail

##### If you’re used to your mailbox stuffed with catalogs, you’ve undoubtedly noticed a reduction in bulk and frequency. However, few successful mail-order companies have abandoned print catalogs—most have just gotten better at list management. Frederick’s of Hollywood, for example, is building more “value offers” into its catalogs, putting two or three items together in “buy 2, get 1 free” packages, then mailing more catalogs to its better customers. The formula is better offers to better customers by proven media. To their credit, they did not respond to sales headwinds by refusing to build better offers or by discontinuing use of the media that has supported them so well in favor of cheaper choices.

 Another cataloguer, SimplySoles, merchandiser of high-priced designer shoes, has added lower-priced bags, jewelry, and other accessories; promoted pairings of items in its catalogs; and reports that their catalog “has had the best performance (in 2010) in 3 years.” Sprint, a company providing cell-phone service and with an obvious ability to communicate with its customers via texts to drive online, is using direct mail profitably to promote loyalty and referral programs, and it sends a new-customer welcome package by mail, and a newsletter by mail. They also give each member a personalized website where they can monitor use, modify plans, and redeem rewards, but they are communicating with customers for retention by mail.

#### Reality Check on Social Media As Marketing Media

##### Okay, so everybody is tweeting friends and family and uploading their entire lives to Facebook and is obsessed with it all. And everybody in business is devoting their lives to using it as a marketing media. One of the types of small businesses I’ve believed was using social media profitably was restaurants. But, here are the results from Nation’s Restaurant News’ annual survey of restaurant customers and restaurant owners, which this year asked about social media. Look at the remarkable differences …

 Only 8 percent of consumers follow a restaurant on Facebook,
 but 61 percent of restaurant owners have a Facebook site and do active Facebook marketing for their business.

 Only 15 percent of consumers anticipate following more
 restaurants on Facebook, but 78 percent of the restaurant owners have plans to increase their use of it as a marketing tool.

 Only 3 percent pay attention to a restaurant or restaurants via
 Twitter, while 53 percent of restaurants use Twitter for marketing purposes.

 Only 9 percent expect to use Twitter more regarding restaurants
 they patronize, while 66 percent of restaurants intend doing more with Twitter.

 More than one-third of the consumers surveyed are younger than
 age thirty-five.

 What can be made of this? Years back, I consulted with a chain of clinics spending 80 percent of its ad budget on the Yellow Pages but, when pressed to track, found less than 15 percent of its patients coming from there. Nearly 60 percent came from referrals, on which they spent less than 5 percent of the budget encouraging, incentivizing, and rewarding, and 15 percent came from radio, which they were on the verge of discontinuing. To be entirely fair, the 8 percent who follow their favorite restaurants may very well be such high-value, exceptionally responsive customers that committing greatly disproportionate resources to it may be wise—but you’d better be very aware of the ratio.

 I have an idea. Try it out. Let it roll around.

 Resources should be earned by and allocated in proportion to performance.

-----

##### Resources might mean prime shelf space in a supermarket, advertising dollars, the sales manager’s coaching, leads distributed to salespeople, or time spent on social media.

 Resources should be earned by performance.

 The old Physicians Weight Loss operating principle regarding their inbound telemarketers was three strikes and you’re out; take three calls, fail to schedule any appointments, and you are fired—next batter up. ‘Cuz each call costs money to get. If it’s only 8:20 A.M. on Monday, your first day on the job, and you started at 8:00, it doesn’t matter. You’re out. Next.

 Resources should be allocated in proportion to performance.

 I have a client famous for its TV advertising and thought of by most as a TV advertiser, but over the past three to five years, they have quietly shifted more and more dollars away from TV into print and direct mail as evidence has shown the total return on investment is better with customers acquired by these means. They would prefer using only TV. More TV.

 Extension of this idea: Black holes cannot be permitted to consume resources. No, never stop testing and retesting regardless of past performance because most facts do change. But you can’t let yourself be where the restaurant owners likely are, overinvesting attention, time, and money and increasing that investment disproportionately to social media’s actual performance and their customers’ use of it as means of making buying decisions. You can’t get confused about the goal here. It’s not how many friends or fans the tavern has on Facebook; it’s how many customers it has in it drinking and eating every night.

 Watch Your ROI

 Lest you get the wrong lesson: I am not opposed to any marketing media. None. I am a financial pragmatist very capable of divorcing personal preference from these kinds of choices and decisions, as you need to be. I am no more or less against antisocial media than I am against paid displays of logos and websites as tattoos on boxer’s foreheads or bikini bottoms of babes playing beach volleyball. It all has moral equivalency in my book. I just want to clearly see and account for the return on investment, then make the next week’s investment choices based on hard data, on harsh reality, and proportionate to each media’s contribution to sales and, ideally, net profit.

 I have preferences, but I do not indulge them as investor anymore than I choose the horse to bet on in a race based on which driver I like best or least personally. There are entire businesses I choose, and am fortunate in being able to choose to eschew based on preference—but in a business, my enthusiasm or lack thereof for any particular media or

##### methodology is earned. So don’t go discrediting the facts of the above survey nor my comments based on the presumption I’m indulging personal bias. I take no joy in finding failure in any media; I’d rather another new one was invented every day and they all performed well and equally well, so we could all make even more money. I would rather pizza burned off calories, dogs were calibrated to die the exact same minute as their owners, and Johnny Carson was still the host of The Tonight Show.

 I have even, very recently, personally spent about $25,000.00 on media and its use that I am fervently skeptical of because professionals I respect made a compelling case and I am willing to test against my own instincts (honed over thirty years in direct marketing)—and I hope have my expectations proven wrong and such big ROI demonstrated that I will make much use of this for myself and my clients. Could I be wrong? Sure—that’s why I’ve taken $25,000.00 out of my pocket to find out. Will I be proven wrong? Sadly, I doubt it. If I can, I’ll let you know. But I know the mind, like the parachute, is most valuable open. So don’t just write my curmudgeonly cautions about new media off as biased. And specific to restaurants, I’ll be happy to share a Member’s fact-based report of profitable use of the social media that belies the NRN survey. Specific to fundraising, if 65 percent of the donors had preferred online, I’d have told you. Regardless of that, the point, the principle remains: Guard your money and time against individual or mass delusion, blindly following popular fads or false prophets or seductive fiction, and insist on evidence. Invest prudently. Be an independent thinker.

### Bonus Chapters

##### The following two chapters showcase two business owners using most of the Ultimate Marketing Plan Success Factors in their businesses —use the lists and identify as many at work as you can. One is a consumer service business (Grant Miller’s), the other a retail/food business (Diana Coutu’s). I have not included a B2B example purely because of page-count limitations and a decision to show you two of the best examples I have. But do not fall victim to “But My Business Is Different” narrow-minded thinking and excuse making. By this point, you should realize that every business needs to be a marketing business and that any doing a great job at it can and should be studied and emulated, regardless of the direct similarity or dissimilarity to the deliverables in your business.

### Making an Ordinary Business Unique

##### I was so impressed with everything I learned about Grant Miller’s business, I went to see it for myself and reported on my visit in one of the Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ newsletters, the No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent Letter. This is a recap of that report. Grant and I spent the day together, with a tour of the flagship location of his five Sun Your Buns tanning salons, then reviewed all of his outstanding advertising and marketing materials.

 As background, you should know that his home city, Erie, Pennsylvania, is fundamentally a blue-collar population center, but Grant is a premium-price marketer—his average prices are significantly higher than local competitors or national averages in his industry. In fact, his salons rank in the top dozen or so in the entire country. The five locations combined deliver over 200,000 tanning sessions per year, and business is up year to year, including in 2008 to 2009 and 2009 to 2010 in defiance of the recession.

 I’m going to take you through a partial list of everything Grant does, does differently, and has in place that is making this company such a standout success, but you should also visit the website to see a lot more: www.sunyourbuns.com. Candidly, very few businesses (including upscale ones) actually impress me, but this one does. You will see much of The Ultimate Marketing Plan demonstrated, but you’ll also discover additional strategies not mentioned previously in this book. The core idea, though, is to take an ordinary business that is relatively easy to commoditize and tends to battle cheap-price competition and make it unique and uniquely attractive to a chosen clientele.

 Multiple Product and Price Presentations

 The customer base is diverse—including very young women, even teens, to professional career women and affluent-but-not-desperate housewives, so the idea of different prices for different customers definitely applies. The business centers on monthly continuity, not per- tan purchasing, and on reoccurring revenue from members, not random revenue from walk-ins. To that end, Grant has different monthly continuity levels, each tied to a different “product” or tanning booth(s), from a no-frills, slow tan booth (think: Kia or Holiday Inn) all the way up to the most deluxe, comfortable, state-of-the-art, computer- programmed unit (think: Bentley or Ritz-Carlton). The staff presents this

##### via a scripted and choreographed tour, showing the best first, and via a sales card (shown in this book, see Chapter 1). While new, first-time customers are brought in by many different promotions, including single-tan offers, the objective is conversion to membership. His product/price strategies include:

 Tiered Pricing: from low to very high, with membership and
 with ancillary products, such as lotions—which go all the way up to $100.00 a bottle.

 Membership-Continuity. Notable: comprehensive retention
 strategies, including a “put membership on hold” option (as the business has a seasonal factor)—this allows members to pay just $5.00 a month not to use the facilities but keep their membership intact and avoid initiation fees when restarting. There are, at any given time, hundreds paying this fee! They form a list segment all their own, getting periodic mailing campaigns to get them to restart and come in.

 New Packages. Grant frequently changes things up, adding a
 new, improved tanning machine and creating a new package for it. As I was writing this, he’d started experimenting with a different form of membership, “Keys to the Salon,” which entitles the member to use any of the different tanning booths at any time, and to unlimited use.

 Free Trial Offers. Many promotions feature a free trial or $1.00,
 $5.00, etc. trial offers. As I was writing this, he’d been experimenting with a $19.00/30-Days’ Unlimited Tanning introductory offer that was bringing in better quality customers and providing better opportunity for them to get hooked on the tanning experience. You can only do these kinds of free trial offers if your sales/membership conversion process is effective.

 Advertising/Marketing Media

 On the following pages, I have shown you a small assortment of his advertising and marketing pieces. Grant relies very heavily on newspaper inserts and ads, Valpak, and his own solo direct mail, predominately postcards. He has mailing campaigns for present customers, past/inactive customers, and to selected neighborhoods, “farming” for new customers, all occurring very frequently. The reprints here do not do justice; most of this is printed in full color, with bold graphics, and, often, sexy photographs. Some, however, feature him, use humor, or have seasonal tie-ins. Keep in mind, this is a partial list.

 Monthly print newsletter: customers, members, lapsed members

 Postcards 1×–2× per month: different offers

 List segmentation: different lists get different offers.
