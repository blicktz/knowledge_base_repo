##### Applebee’s tries to look like a neighborhood joint, and tries calling itself that, but it isn’t. Local is owned by global. You are attached to a number in just about every relationship you’re in as a consumer and, in most, managed as a number, too.
 How much easier would retention be if you had a relationship on some level with every single person you did business with? You would have a near 100% close ratio. Imagine how much more likely a customer who sat across the desk from Jim at the bank and knew Jim and his family was to stick with that bank and not be seduced away by a new promotion or a half- point difference in rates. Of course we don’t live in the early 1900s anymore, and things have changed, but people haven’t.
 If anything, a longing for connection, relationship, friendship of a real nature, not (just) in cyberspace, is greater than ever in business because it is rarer than ever.

#### How We Make Decisions Today, about Staying or Going, about
 Telling Others about a Business We Patronize
##### A recent study done by McCombs School of Business marketing professor Raj Raghunathan suggests that the earlier you can make a connection with your prospects and customers, the better. Once someone has decided that they connect with a particular option, the more difficult it is to get the prospect or customer to change his mind. After the connection is made, the customer or prospect will use logic to justify the connection.
 Forget the fact that he’s a professor, not an entrepreneur or marketer. His academic research, however it was done, probably with statistical models and mountains of data run through computers, simply verifies what really good, high-achieving salespeople have known and frankly exploited since selling began: humanity. After all, we don’t do business with customers. We do business with human beings. We don’t sell to robots programmed to think and act analytically and logically. We sell to humans, who are emotional creatures. So, for example, affinity connections very often matter—even though they usually shouldn’t. In the book No B.S. Trust-Based Marketing, Dan Kennedy and his co-author Matt Zagula, an ultra-successful financial advisor, point out that almost any point of affinity

##### works as a point of entry. A military veteran has an edge with other veterans. A dog owner with other dog owners. If a person born and raised in Iowa now doing business in Los Angeles meets up with a prospect born and raised in Iowa, he has an instant edge. But what works as a point of entry can also work as a lever for retention. It’s why we encourage business owners to use and share as much about themselves personally as they will, because different customers identify with different points of affinity, and the more they know about Bill’s violin playing or other hobby, his volunteer work with orphaned kids or dogs, his time as a fighter pilot, his cabin in the woods, etc., etc., the deeper their connection—the human connection—with him gets, and the less likely they are to leave him just because they got a great coupon in the mail or they find themselves on the wrong side of town and might more conveniently purchase whatever Bill sells there. The less likely they are to let friends pick Friday night’s restaurant and the more likely they are to advocate for Bill’s.
 Once people are emotionally and personally connected, they will, as the professor found, torture and twist logic in order to justify the choice they’re sticking with, come hell or high water. That’s how politics works, with 80 to 90% of voters. Once a voter is a decided voter, they almost never change their decision. Most can’t articulate reasons for favoring their candidate, let alone defend their choice when confronted with a barrage of damaging facts. They just “get their back up” about it. If the debate gets heated, the other person may abruptly end it by saying, “Well, that’s just how I feel about it.” They may add, “And you can’t tell me how to feel.” That is an argument you can’t win. With your business, it’s an argument you don’t want to lose! You want to win the “how I feel about it” competition each and every time.

#### The Power of Trust
##### Humans naturally seek safety and security. Even the bravest hunters returned to protected caves at night, where they had a mate, siblings, maybe a few friends they felt they could trust not to kill them and eat them if they slept.


-----

##### Humans need trust. Trust is the same thing as the cave. It is the way we get to feel safe and secure. Trust allows us to have relationships. Without trust it would be nearly impossible to love, or to foster friendship, or actually conduct much business either. Sure, everybody knows they’re supposed to trust but verify. Trust but cut the cards. Caveat emptor. We know it—but do we do it? No. Do you read and make sure you understand all the fine print on whatever insurance or mortgage or bank or product warranty documents you sign? No. For the most part, you tell yourself it’s okay not to, because you trust the person, company, or institution you are dealing with. How many times have you gotten a pile of paperwork with little yellow sticky arrows at the places you’re supposed to sign—and obeyed, with little or no question? We actually crave to trust. It isn’t just laziness or hurry or the incomprehensibility of the mumbo-jumbo in a set of documents. We crave to trust. When we really feel that with a business or person, it’s a connection that is very, very hard for any competitors to break.
 Being a trusted refuge, a provider of safe haven, a secure cave, or a real relationship a person feels means something can go a long, long way with customer retention, and with stimulating referrals.
 Of course, when we trust others we are taking a risk. We risk that that person will violate our trust and hurt us. Many people are timid about trust because of the risk. But they are also eager to justify trust when they are made to feel safe, valued, cared for, and connected with. Once over that Rubicon, a customer is reluctant to reverse his decision or to once again take the risk of trying a replacement.

 The object is to remove or reduce the person’s sense of risk or uncertainty, and provide confidence and security.

##### When I think about the process of getting people to know, like, and trust someone, I think of dating or courting in high school. This is the approach I took when trying to find a date or girlfriend in my school of about 1,200 kids.
 I first had to start off by identifying my ideal girl. Once I found a girl I was attracted to, I had to get her to notice me. There were a lot of ways to do this. I could walk up and simply say “Hi.” I could ask a friend to introduce us. I could wait until I saw her talking to someone I knew and leverage the relationship I had with that person to force the introduction. There really were a number of ways for me to pop up on her radar. Once this girl knew my name, I would go out of my way to get to know her. I would say “Hi” any chance I got—in the halls, at lunch, whenever. I would also strike up a conversation from time to time. I’d find out about her, and I’d let her know a little about me. With any luck, we would have a few things in common, and I would ask her for her phone number and make a plan to call her. We would chat a bit on the phone, and if there seemed to still be a connection, I would ask her on a date or to a dance. If the date or dates went well, maybe we would become a couple. Pretty simple, really. All about creating and developing connection, then a relationship.

#### In Business, You Build a Relationship in Exactly the Same Way

 Step One: You Find Your Target Market
##### When asked who their target market is, I’ve heard business people say, “Well, everyone is.” The thing is, that is true for no one. Let’s say you are a chiropractor; just because everyone has a spine doesn’t make everyone in the world your target market. Even the IRS has a target market: people who actually earn an income. My six-year-old, Jeremiah, doesn’t fall into that category, and as of now, is not their target market. Lucky kid. Just as I had to pick 1 out of 1,200, you have to somehow reduce the size of your target market or audience to a number that is practically manageable. Local businesses often do it by geography. When you can, you might do it by affinity. Dan Kennedy talks about the two critical factors to consider and know when investing money or time into a prospect or group of prospects: 1) Ability to Buy, and 2) Willingness to Buy. He also talks relentlessly


-----

##### about the appropriateness of a particular customer or type of customer for a particular business.
 This is all important for two reasons. First, to make acquisition of new customers as efficient as possible. Cost efficient and time efficient. Bringing in a mix of appropriate, able-to- buy, and willing-to-buy customers with a lot of inappropriate, unable to buy —by financial impairment, lack of purchasing authority, etc., and unwilling to buy—by cheap price orientation, chronic indecision, and procrastination, etc.—is a very expensive exercise. Consider our friends who own Gardner’s Mattress and More. These guys are amazing because they sell mattresses priced from $4,000.00 to $40,000.00, surrounded by competitors selling at average prices of about $800.00. If they bring a lot of people into their store who have low or modest incomes, are renters living in small apartments who have no special reasons for getting a superior mattress—like back pain —and are looking for a bargain or a deal, all they do is wear out their salespeople. To sell mattresses at $4,000.00 and up, it is mission critical to bring the right customer into the store. Similarly, in my business, which is B2B, I need a business owner who is an appropriate client. He has to have a certain mindset about investing in customer relationships and retention, not just lust for the next new customer or fast buck. He has to have the financial ability and authority to make a commitment to one of my newsletter-based marketing programs. He has to be ready to make improvements in his marketing right now. If those things aren’t present, I’m wasting my time. If I’m sloppy about this, I might suffer through 20 futile initial phone consultations to secure one client. If I’m smart about it, I need only two or three such conversations to secure a client. Whether I’m doing those calls or I have an account manager doing those calls, our willingness to do them and our attitude about doing them will be damaged and at risk with the painful inefficiency of 1 from 20, but can be sustained and even motivated with the efficiency of 1 for 3.
 The second reason this is all so important circles back to the core subjects of this book—retention and referrals.
 One of the biggest secrets I learned from Dan Kennedy has to do with the difficulties of retaining inappropriate clients. It’s tough for a lot of business owners to grasp this. If they have a retention problem, they try to fix it with things they do or offer. They’ll try lowering prices, giving away


-----

##### more of what they charge for, piling on benefits, being better, and doing more. But no matter how much you know, do, or deliver, or how much more you do and deliver, you won’t move the retention needle much if dealing with inappropriate clients, because it’s about them, not about you! That shouldn’t be a blanket permission slip to just blame your customers, but you have to strongly consider it. Not only is it difficult to keep the wrong customers, it’s also not really very valuable even if you can.
 It’s also not very valuable to multiply them. When you get referrals from a customer, they naturally tend to be much like the customer referring them, or a notch lower in quality of attitude and behavior. If you have a cheapskate customer, and he refers, it’ll be another cheapskate coming in the door. If you have a constantly complaining, inordinately high- maintenance client who refers, you’ll get another constantly complaining, high-maintenance client. That’s the way it works.
 If you are going to shift from growth of external advertising or prospecting more to internal marketing for referrals, you’d better have the right customers to multiply.
 So, Step One is making decisions about who you want to bring in, to be your customers.

#### Step Two: Get Your Ideal Customer’s Attention
##### Just like with dating, you may need to pop up on someone’s radar many times before they take notice. Once they have noticed you, you need to secure a small commitment from them. Depending on your service, this could be a small sale, an exchange of information, an appointment, a consultation call, or some other similar step. They have to have opportunities to get to know you, get comfortable with you, and trust you. Back in high school, I couldn’t just spot “the one” and zoom in on her like a swooping bird and immediately suggest a date or, more crassly, a date with benefits. I needed to be noticed, create some curiosity and interest, be seen in friendly conversations with some of her friends, engage in casual conversation, find some common interests, letting nature take its course at least a little.


-----

##### One of the biggest mistakes I see people make here is that once they get noticed, they instantly go for the sale. It would be like getting introduced to a girl and immediately asking her to marry you. That is a good way to stay lonely. In business, trying to make such extreme leaps is a good way to have skinny, hungry kids. Extreme timidity is just as harmful, though, so you need to find the right pace for you and your potential customers for moving forward. But trying to jump from “Hello, come here often?” to “Let’s go to my house—my parents aren’t home” in the same breath is probably too fast, even for fast-minded people.

#### Step Three: Connections and Relationship
##### In building commitment, start with a first transaction. Depending on the type of transaction or commitment you’ve secured, your relationship could be strong or weak. For example, if someone opted in and just gave you an email address, that isn’t a huge commitment. It’s something. It’s a start. If someone gives you all his contact information, that is more of a commitment. If he gives you that information, and ask you to send him some information, that’s more. If he makes a purchase, even something as small as paying a shipping charge to get something free, that’s more. The first real, significant purchase is a giant step. A second purchase is serious commitment. Consistent repeat, recurring purchases or entry into a contract, a subscription, a membership, or an autocharge arrangement is a very serious commitment. Referring others to you is serious commitment, too.
 The best businesspeople never take this evolution of customer commitment for granted. They do not expect it or hope it will happen by itself.
 Like any new relationship, you have to nurture it or it will end as quickly as it started. This includes delivering on and providing value— having good customer service. If you have an appointment, be on time. If a customer asks a question, answer it promptly. All of that is a must, but if you really want the relationship to grow and ultimately get to the point where your customer is committed to you, you have to let him get to know you on a more personal level. Let him peek behind the curtain a little. Tell him what is going on in your life both personally and professionally. That is


-----

##### how all good relationships work. They’re not transactional. They’re not one way—like a customer sharing more and more about himself with you but never really getting to know you.
 If you want the highest possible retention and referrals, you will work at having your customers feel that they are in a relationship with you, not just a paying customer.
