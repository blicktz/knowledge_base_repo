###### independently buying and flipping real estate properties. These kinds of brands and ideas established themselves by their owners actually selling things.
 To get the kind of speed to success and speed to a brand that Jim and I have achieved with Iron Tribe, you have to, in the short term, ignore the brand advertising examples and focus on direct response.

##### I Answer an “Odd” Ad and I’m Shown the Different Road

###### I’ll never forget the rainy night in November 2002, when I was reading a personal training trade journal and my life was changed forever. Now, of course, I had no idea that my life was about to change or that I was being introduced to direct-response marketing and a new way to think about, market, and grow my business.
 My eye was drawn to a quarter-page ad that stood out because it was so different from every other ad in the publication. The other ads were pictorial and graphic, flashy, and visual. Most had sparse, short copy. Big logos. Many made no direct request for any sort of response, instead just showing a product, presenting a company, advertising a brand and its idea. Think Nike® and Just Do It®. This ad stood out like the only red convertible in a funeral procession of black limousines. Or, more like an ugly mutt in the middle of the Westminster Dog Show and its magnificently groomed purebreds on parade. It was plain. Its headline said, “Free Audio Tape Reveals The Ultimate Fitness Marketing Success Secret,” then it went on to instruct me to call an 800 number for a free recorded message for more information.
 Although I thought this was weird, I felt compelled to call the number and listen to the short three-minute elevator speech. I was further instructed to leave my name and full mailing address so that I could be mailed an audiotape and a free report called “How to Get More Clients in the Next 90 Days Than You Now Get All Year . . . Without Networking, Hard Selling, or Begging for Referrals.” I complied with the instructions and went on about my busy life of building my (then) three personal training studios.
 Up to that point in my career, my business partner at the time, Aaron Crocker, and I had opened three of our own brick-and-mortar one-on-one


-----

###### personal training locations. While we were growing, getting great results for our clients, and experiencing some good internal referrals, I was unhappy with the results of my external marketing.
 I was a fitness guy at heart. I had spent my education and career up to that point learning everything there was to know about helping my clients get into the best shape of their lives. I knew next to nothing about how to attract clients who were predisposed to doing business with me, and I was quickly learning that my glossy oversized image-driven postcards were ineffective and that trying to book appointments with “suspects” and then educating them during the consult process was not working well for me.


**FOR A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING**

###### This was leading me to sell out of weakness, getting low closing percentages and small average customer contracts—if they even decided to purchase.
 That simple ad was the perfect message at the right time in my life. It began a relationship that I maintain to this day with the author of that free report, Eric Ruth, and it eventually led me to a long-standing and prosperous relationship with Dan Kennedy himself. However, it almost didn’t happen at all.
 I got that free report about three days after leaving my information on that recorded message, but I put it in my read-later pile. Things got busy at work, business was picking up a bit, and I didn’t have time to read. But then, while cleaning up my desk at home a few weeks later, I came across the report. It was literally in my hand to toss into the trash. I read the headline one more time, which drew me into the subhead, which drew me into the copy.
 I felt like this guy was talking directly to me! My third studio was open, and I had just spent thousands of dollars on an image-driven, completely branded external marketing campaign that hadn’t generated one single


-----

###### client. I was fed up and knew that there had to be a better way. So, I sat down on the couch, albeit pessimistically, and read the 22-page free report from cover to cover.
 Surprisingly, the report had my undivided attention, and some of the things that I learned in the report I knew could help me. I was eager to begin trying what I later learned to be direct-response marketing. I felt that if there was this much value in the free stuff, there had to be major value in the information for sale.
 I called Eric and asked him what he would recommend for me with my three locations and the fourth in development. He asked me tons of questions about my business, our target market, demographics, and everything else he would need to craft a perfect message for my target market. I was a little perturbed by all of the questions and really just wanted him to hand me the magic marketing bullet.
 Later I would understand that he was simply working Dan Kennedy’s Marketing Triangle (Market, Message, and Media). Once he had all the appropriate information, he promised to build me a campaign and said he would be back in touch soon.
 A few weeks later, he sent me a direct-mail marketing campaign that had a three-step letter sequence (which I later learned was classic Kennedy Magnetic Marketing style), with some of the most bizarre instructions I had ever received!
 First he wanted me to take a picture of myself literally icing a cake and then paste it on the front of the letter right next to a bizarre headline that said, “I Want to Put the Icing on Your Cake!” Both Aaron and I were immediately indignant and said, “Eric, do you realize I’m sending this to the most influential community in our city? My parents live in that neighborhood. What will they think? I’m not doing it!” He asked me if I was willing to continue to mail my postcards and waste my money. I reluctantly agreed to having my picture taken and pasting it on the letter.
 Then he gave specific, seemingly insignificant instructions about what size envelope to use, the type of stamp to apply to the envelope, and the need to get my trainers to hand address each and every letter!
 On top of all this, he went on with his instructions for me: when to mail each letter, what day of the week the prospects should receive it, how many days apart each letter should be mailed, and how to create a deadline, an


-----

###### irresistible offer, risk reversal, and a “B” offer with more information that could be requested to help build my list.
 I didn’t know if this guy was brilliant or a lunatic, but I was desperate for a winning campaign so I followed each and every detail exactly how it was laid out for me. Again, I didn’t know I was being introduced to Dan’s 10 laws of marketing as found in his No B.S. Direct Marketing for Non- Direct Marketing Businesses book.
 Once the letters were all created and ready to go, I dropped them in the mailbox and said a quick prayer that I would not become the laughing stock of Birmingham, Alabama! We mailed to a wealthy community called Greystone, containing about 1,000 high-end homes located just outside our newest location.
 The results were absolutely amazing. The phone started ringing off the hook! First of all, I couldn’t believe the phone was ringing, and secondly, I couldn’t believe how presold these prospects were on the program we provided. Because the letter was so well crafted and did the heavy lifting for me, I was having higher quality conversations and then an incredibly high closing rate with much bigger contracts once I got them into my location.
 All in all, I ended up generating 41 new one-on-one personal training clients in one month, just from that three-step letter campaign. With an average contract value of more than $2,500.00, this represented the best new business month in my then six-year career in personal training!
 I ended up automating the entire campaign through a mailing house, including the live stamp, handwritten addresses, and goofy head-shots. I ran it month-in and month-out in each of my locations. The campaign was so strong that I opened up three more locations that I owned and operated in Birmingham as well as an additional 49 locations that I would develop and oversee throughout the Southeast.
 It worked like “gang busters” each and every month. I had a very healthy return on investment (ROI) every month, my business was rocking, and we were opening new locations every six months like clockwork. For almost three years, I literally built my businesses on the backbone of that one three-step letter campaign. Before I ever officially knew the direct- response marketing axiom of selling customers to build a brand instead of trying to build a brand to sell customers, I literally lived it. Every time I


-----

###### hear Dan talk about the value that one single sales letter can have on your business, I know that it’s gospel truth!
 With my single direct-response letter campaign, I thought I had found the magic bullet. In fact, I’m pretty sure I thought I was bulletproof at that point! Until it stopped working. Painfully, I learned another one of Dan’s primary lessons about “the danger of one.” One message. One campaign. One media. I only had one bullet in my marketing arsenal.
 I had no other campaigns lined up ready to go. I had not been split testing headlines or offers. I had not been developing another campaign to beat the control, so that I could simply roll out the new one when my old one started dropping in returns.
 This is really when my journey to understanding direct-response marketing began. I had to know why those stupid letters worked in the first place and then why they, just as mysteriously to me, stopped working. By that point I learned that Eric was studying under some guy named Dan Kennedy, so I started to learn as much as I could about Dan. I subscribed to the No B.S. Marketing Letter and read a few of his books. I ended up buying Aaron out of those first three locations. He had been so impressed by his first interaction with direct-response marketing that he went on to become an independent business advisor with GKIC, the company built around Dan Kennedy.
 I slowly started to realize that the entire process, from the stamps, to the headline, to the deadlines, were all part of a choreographed process that was only scratching the surface of the options available to me. I dove in deep to “Planet Dan,” and started attending some of his events, which eventually led to joining his Platinum and then Titanium Mastermind coaching groups and hiring him for his Private Coaching Group consulting days. But that would be years down the road from this initial experience with Eric.

##### The Second Bite of the Apple

###### Out of all this experience came my unique education and new orientation. I wanted to start with a clean slate and build a powerful, meaningful fitness brand fueled by the kind of direct-response marketing that had worked so well. This time, I wanted the best of both worlds; the direct inflow of good


-----

###### customers and fast-rising revenue that direct response had delivered but also the aftereffect of something built to last. I knew I did not want to just be dependent on either one good promotion or one promotion after another.
 In late 2009, I was in the process of selling all my existing one-on-one personal training businesses and creating a new group fitness brand from scratch that I intended to franchise from Day One. I knew that I wanted direct-response marketing to be at the core of what we did as a brand, and I resolved that I wouldn’t make the same mistake I had before by becoming too reliant on only one campaign or media.
 I also knew that I was going to focus on selling customers to build the brand and not try to build the brand to sell customers. That may seem like semantics to some, but I was laser focused on evaluating every marketing action I took with a trackable direct return on investment (D-ROI), and not focusing on the by-product of brand awareness. I hired my former business partner, Aaron, to serve as copywriter and implementor of direct-response marketing. Although we were just a startup business, I knew that this was a position that I couldn’t be without.
 In short, I was committed to a direct-response marketing effort.

#### CHAPTER 4


## We Build the Brand—By
 Selling

###### by Forrest Walden


###### ow I’m going to show you, step by step, piece by piece, how we raised up our brand by selling memberships.
 The new company I was building had started in my garage as

# N

###### an underground “fight club” type workout scene, where you basically had to be one of my close friends to get in. However, when I started to see the amazing results and tight-knit community that this intense, group workout format was generating for my close buddies, I got extremely excited about developing a new concept that I was confident could fill a niche in the industry and become an excellent franchise opportunity.
 The only thing I was struggling with was overcoming the “cult” word that kept popping up when people tried to explain what was going on in my


-----

###### little 400-square-foot garage. I knew I had an especially tight community being built, but I really hated the connotation of the word “cult.”
 The more I played with the concept, the more I realized that what I was building was a “tribe,” not a “cult.” I knew that the most important asset of a business is its list and that I would have to continue to focus on the community and the exclusivity of belonging to what would be known as “Iron Tribe Fitness.”
 The next thing that I had to address was the fact that most people simply believed that they couldn’t do these intense, group-based workouts. I needed social proof in a hurry, and I also needed a strong “B offer” for all the people that I knew would raise their hands with interest but might be too intimidated to actually walk in and give it a shot.
 This led to creating space ads with provocative headlines like “Don’t Envy Us, Join Us In The Ultimate Lifestyle Fitness Community,” or “If A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words, Then What Do These Pictures Say About Iron Tribe Fitness?” I came across an old picture of my group at the garage, and I felt like it communicated everything that I was trying to sell, fitness that was fun and effective and being performed with an amazing community of like-minded people. (See Figure 4.1 on page 37.)
 That old garage gym picture became our control, because it continued to pull an amazing response every time we ran it. It also led to creating an in- depth free report that was loaded with social proof from people of all walks of life espousing the benefits of the program. The name of the free report was “Why All These Frustrated Men and Women Canceled Their Gym Membership and Started Working Out At Iron Tribe Fitness . . . And Why You May Want To As Well.” We made sure that each and every space ad and advertising medium we used gave the option to request the free report so that we could acquire the prospects’ mailing addresses and get this valuable information into their hands as quickly as possible. (See Figure 4.2 on page 39.)

**FIGURE 4.1**

Figure 4.1: DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: Here is one of those early ads. As you
can see, it featured a staple of hard-core direct-response advertising for weight loss or fitness:
before and after photos and specific results. More importantly, in the letter from Forrest, it
made two offers and a strong guarantee. The Iron Tribe Fitness logo is small, paper-clipped to
the little letter (not taking up a third or half the ad space as in most brand-driven ads).


###### I knew that we needed to create urgency in our marketing message and compel our clients to get started quickly in becoming a part of our new gym community. We decided to focus on premium pricing and the fact that we would have a limit to the number of clients that we could serve (300).
 Once that number of memberships was sold, then we would no longer bring on new clients and would place all prospects on a waiting list. We focused on the fact that we were a premium, small, niche, group-training facility and were the complete opposite of the big-box gyms that want to sell as many memberships as possible in hopes that the customers never come!
