of blowback from his mostly elderly patients. After letting the dust settle for several months, he
imposed several new fees itemized on patients’ bills but never mentioned: one, a “lab services fee”
added underneath the price of lenses; another, a shipping and handling fee, also added underneath
the price of lenses; and a one year warranty fee for replacement of damaged frames (which he did
anyway). From this, no blowback and few questions. In total, this averages out to about a 7% price
increase on glasses. To his exam fees, he added a “records maintenance and insurance
documentation for reimbursement” fee of $7.00. That’s added over $30,000.00 yearly of clear
profit. As he said to me, “that doesn’t sound like much until you calculate that I’ll probably be in
practice for at least another ten years, so it’s $300,000.00, which pays off my mortgage.”

**Accepting Your Role and Responsibilities**

Oh, you’re an entrepreneur? Greedy bastard! Surely you know that’s what some people
think about you, say about you behind your back.

A successful entrepreneur drives down the street in his Rolls-Royce or builds his mansion.
If not to his face, behind his back, many grumble about his greed. But if they hit the
mega-millions lottery they might very well do the same things—most lottery winners do.
It’s not a moral objection to greed they’re expressing. It’s the sin of envy.

Too often, achievement, accomplishment, ambition is defined as greed.

Here’s my clarification: greed is attempting to get something for nothing, to take without
exchange.

Is getting the most money possible for the goods or services you deliver greed or
intelligence? Is it greed or ambition? Are you a better person if you voluntarily get less
money than you could for the goods or the services you deliver? No—in fact, you are
derelict in your duty as business owner. You have a duty to yourself, your family, your
investors or partners or shareholders, your lenders, your vendors, and your customers, and
that responsibility is to attain the absolute highest and greatest profits possible, so you can
stay in business successfully to honor every commitment to every one of these
constituencies. To settle for anything less than the most is absolute dereliction of the
responsibility of business ownership and leadership. To settle for anything less is to leave
your business vulnerable, possibly fragile. And you should be fired.

_Now, here’s my question for you: What is your entrepreneurial responsibility? What is the_
entrepreneur’s responsibility? What must you do in order to deserve and earn your place
on the planet? Your success, prosperity, security, wealth?

A lot of people think your purpose, your responsibility in life is to provide jobs. You see
that reflected in the communities that are busily trying to pass laws and, in some cases,
communities and states suing companies to keep them from moving or closing; because
their responsibility is to provide jobs to the community.

Is your responsibility to provide jobs? I hope you don’t think so.

-----

If providing jobs makes your business successful, if adding jobs makes it more successful,
that’s terrific. But if operating the business with fewer employees makes it more
profitable, then it is your sworn responsibility as its captain to operate it with fewer
employees.

A lot of people think your responsibility is to pay taxes.

Personally, I’d be a little happier with my gigantic income tax bill if the IRS sent me
pictures, maybe of citizens of the foreign countries we support and of welfare recipients
here in the United States; like when you send money to the starving orphans organization
and you get the photograph and a letter once in a while about how they’re doing. I think
every taxpayer should get some of those and have people assigned to them. So for your
money, you get a picture of 17 people in Iraq or Afghanistan or Gooblesedyburg where
we’re building roads and schools and providing food—which we do even for the
populations of countries openly hostile to us, like North Korea—and of 4 welfare
recipients and 1 retired guy, maybe from GM, so you can put photos of all the people
you’re supporting up on the refrigerator. And they should all have to write you notes
every once in a while, to let you know how they’re doing. I’d feel better. Wouldn’t you?

You have a legal responsibility to pay the minimum taxes required of you.

But your responsibilities as entrepreneur do not include paying any more taxes than the
minimum legally required of you. If you can arrange your business structure or affairs
differently or relocate your business in order to pay fewer taxes, it is your sworn
responsibility to do so.

Is it your responsibility to improve your customers’ lives? No, it is not. Now, it’s pretty
smart to sell them things that, if they use them as you intended, will improve their lives.
That’s smart. But it’s not your responsibility to see that it gets done. Nor should you lose
any sleep over the customers who do not use what you sell them to improve their lives.

I had to come to grips with that in my businesses very early on, or I’d have had my wealth
attraction severely suppressed. A lot of my wealth has been derived from writing and
recording and publishing information products intended to help people better their
attitudes, thinking, skills, businesses, and finances—just like this book. Frankly, the
shrinkwrap never comes off a whole lot of what I sell. And you will kill yourself in my
business if you worry about making them take off the shrinkwrap. The books never get
read. The ideas never acted on. My clients very successfully sell perfectly good exercise
equipment that gathers dust in buyers’ garages, bottles of health-producing nutritional
supplements that age unopened on closet shelves, business opportunities never worked on,
heck, even vacation homes they rarely visit.

Should I feel guilty about the majority who pay their money but then never do anything
with what they bought? Should I follow them home and refund their money? When I take
a cruise, stay at a top-flight resort, or buy another racehorse, I give no thought to whether
the money paying for it came to me from someone who used what they bought or from
someone who has never benefited at all. That’s not my responsibility. It is theirs.

My preference is for you to actually read this entire book and extract from it ideas you act
on and derive benefit from, but frankly that preference is based at least as much, if not
more, on my profit motive, rather than your profit. Readers who do act on ideas turn out
to be much better long-term customers.

Earlier in this book I mentioned having had a client who builds and installs deluxe,
premium-priced backyard sheds. If his customer puts the shed in his backyard and never
moves the crap out of the garage into the shed, and still can’t park the car in the garage—
or, more probably, he moves all of the crap out of the garage, into the shed, and then
restocks the garage with more crap and still can’t park the car in the garage—should my
client go out there and give him his money back?

-----

Of course not. In fact, he should go out there and sell him a second shed. Sell him garbage
removal service. Sell him a how-todo-a-garage-sale kit. Sell him something.

The entrepreneur’s responsibility is this: maximum profit and wealth to his shareholders.
If you’re the sole shareholder, that’s you. Then your responsibility is just to play fair, not
lie, cheat, or steal. Integrity for the entrepreneur is optimizing sales and profits and value
in the business he captains.

Just as the boxer who pulls punches in a championship fight lacks integrity, just as the
quarterback who does not thoroughly prepare for the Super Bowl game lacks integrity,
just as the lawyer who does not thoroughly prepare for trial and do everything he can for
his client lacks integrity, just as the doctor who operates hung over lacks integrity, the
business owner who “pulls his punches” also lacks integrity.

## CHAPTER 20

 Beware of Staff Sabotage of Price Strategy

 Jason Marrs

**Imagine head coach and quarterback agreed on an aggressive passing attack, but offensive**
coordinator and linemen committed to blocking schemes appropriate for a running game of three
yards and cloud of dust, and the defensive coordinator and his players disgusted at the discord and
dysfunction. How far will this team get? In working on the book, Dan Kennedy reminded me this
actually happened—leading to defensive coach Buddy Ryan punching the team’s offensive
coordinator in the nose, on Monday Night Football, for all to see.

**Most business owners or executives assume that their staff will implement their strategies**
**like good soldiers. They forget that almost every army has suffered from “fragging”—grunts**
**actually shooting their own generals in the back. We recently saw something not as violent, in the**
disagreement between the general in charge of the war in Afghanistan and the current Commander
in Chief, played out in, of all places, the pages of Rolling Stone magazine. Assuming and relying on
good soldiership is, like all assumptions, dangerous.

Considering its size, I have spent what could be called a god-awful sum of money in my
backyard. Among other things we’ve removed a half a dozen trees, brought in one of those high-end
custom built sheds that looks like a real house, and we replaced the existing chain link fence with a
giant “privacy” fence. We also ripped out our side yard and upper patio to install two new patios
that blend bluestone with two different kinds of high-end Cambridge pavers. You’d really be
amazed at the difference between the before and after in our yard. I imagine we have spent more
than all of the rest of our neighbors combined on their yards. And it shows.

Aside from being in my yard and an example of my blatant disregard for common sense, care to
guess what all of these things have in common? In every single case the price was negotiated down
without a single attempt at using value to stop the disappearance of profit. The first, last, and only
answer to a price objection was to lower the price. This let us save thousands of dollars off the retail
price while costing the business owners thousands of dollars in profit.

Other guys I know in the business have seen the work and were stunned at the low price I paid.
They could not believe I got it for such a small sum. The patio is stunning. I am well aware that
from a quality perspective it is worth more than I paid. And I would have cheerfully paid more. I
didn’t purely because I didn’t have to. The company who installed it could have collected more
profit had they taken the time and energy to use value selling. This happens all the time: the
customer who would cheerfully have paid more, paying less.

They didn’t get the price from me that I would have willingly paid because, in their minds, low
price was the only tool they had to close the sale. They so feared losing a sale because of price, they
negotiated privately with themselves, and came in low. Instead of really selling value, they took the
approach requiring little thought or skill and sold on price. This is the sad reality of most business
owners, but definitely most salespeople. They will throw away the business’ profit easily, anytime
there’s opportunity to do so. If you depend on your sales staff to safeguard your profits on their own,
you’re doomed.

As a consumer, I confess, sometimes I make a sport of this, but I usually don’t. It is just too time
consuming to negotiate or price shop. When I walk through a grocery store I have absolutely no
concept of the prices I’m paying. I don’t look. Same goes with a lot of my shopping. I am there to
buy what I want and get out. Just tell me what I owe you so I can get back to doing things that need
to be done. Still, that doesn’t stop countless employees on countless occasions giving me deals that I
did not ask for and did nothing to deserve. One store I go to on occasion has a few checkers that pull
out coupons from their aprons or pockets and scan them to save me money. Never mind that I didn’t
know the coupon existed and was ready to hand them money for the full price. There is the garden

-----

store where I go to buy flowers for our yard that has a checker who gives a significant “cute girl”
discount for my daughter. There have been countless bartenders feeding me free drinks and
waitresses discounting my tab. There is any manner of discounts, freebees, and bonuses that are
given to me for no reason at all. I’d like to think that this is all because of my dashing good looks,
but the bags under my eyes and the bulge in my belly tell me otherwise. Don’t get me wrong, I
enjoy them, but the gratuitous discounts given me by these employees are not helping the businesses
they work for. And it is wrong to assume I’m the only guy who has such good luck. I’m not. This
happens to a lot of people and it only represents a few of the ways employees sabotage your success
by stealing your profit.

You might think that these are disgruntled employees. Occasionally that is true. However, in most
cases it is not. Their people are not trying to hurt their employers. It is far more likely that they
actually think they are helping and doing the right thing. In other words, not only do they not know
that what they are doing is wrong, they think it is right. Often, the staff feels the prices you’re
charging are too high, so discounting if they can, or giving away free goods seems fair, just, and
appropriate to them.

This is such a common occurrence I have to wonder if anyone actually takes the time to teach
their employees where their paychecks come from. Not everyone understands business. In fact very
few people do. It is one of my reoccurring complaints with our school system. Business needs to be
taught and not demonized. Commerce is the root of society. Everyone is a part of it. It does not
matter if you are the employee or the boss, professor or CEO, if you are being paid you are in
business and you depend on a profit being made _somewhere. Even the government can’t survive_
without someone making a profit. If they continue to shackle businesses with burdens that cannot be
met, we all suffer the damage. Profit is necessary, not evil. Society cannot survive or progress
without it. As the boss it is your responsibility to make sure your employees understand all that.
They can’t get paid if there is no profit, and every cent they give away affects your profit and their
ability to get paid. They need to understand this. You may even find that this is something you need
to show them specifically. You may need to show them exactly what a buyer is worth, what all the
costs of obtaining a customer are.

Try this experiment: ask each employee to write out a list of what they understand to be their ten
most important responsibilities on the job. You’ll discover very few if any of your staff members
include “protecting and maximizing profits” or, for that matter, “preserving price integrity” or
“implementing my boss’ price strategy” on that list. There’s no understanding of any of this, so
there is bound to be both unintentional and intentional sabotage.

Your employees also need to understand how those you serve profit from buying your goods and
services, and if your price strategy is focused around premium prices, how paying premium prices
benefits the consumer. When someone is selling on price alone they do so because they do not
realize that the buyer is actually making a profit. They assume that the seller is the only one making
a profit. This is absolutely false. If the buyer does not believe that they will profit, they will not
purchase. To take that a step further, the buyer will not purchase again if they do not believe that
they made a profit the first time and will again this time. That is a fact. For the consumer, of course,
“profit” may not be financial. It may be superior service, product reliability, a better environment,
even better staff to serve them. These things all cost money and must be reflected in price, but
employees who have not thought about this and are aware of other businesses in your category
selling at prices lower than yours may simply think your prices are too high.

How your staff thinks about price and profit will greatly influence their attitudes and behavior,
and either discourage or encourage unintentional and intentional sabotage by salespeople and other
staff members of your price strategy. Given good education about this, any staff members still not
on the same page and caught engaging in any sabotage—from undermining your authority and
strategy with fellow staff members to failing to sell on value to theft, in form of unauthorized
discounting or gifting—must go. For a lot more about these management issues, I recommend
Chapters 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, and 41 of Dan’s book in this series, _No B.S. Ruthless_
_Management of People and Profits_
