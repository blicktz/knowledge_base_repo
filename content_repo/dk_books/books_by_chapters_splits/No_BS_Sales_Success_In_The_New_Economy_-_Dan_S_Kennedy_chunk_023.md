HOW TO USE “LEAD GENERATION ADVERTISING” TO ATTRACT HIGHLY
 QUALIFIED PROSPECTS

## For more than 25 years, I have been teaching a very specific method for sales professionals of every stripe to end cold prospecting altogether, and only go where invited, only call those who’ve called them first. This method has been adopted, taught, and proliferated in over 250 different sales niches, by my students-turned-masters, practitioners-turned-teachers themselves. These niches include obvious sales businesses like life, health, property and casualty and business insurance, financial services, residential and commercial real estate, mortgages, home furnishings and interior decorating, automobiles, RVs, yachts, fractional jet ownership, technology products and services, as well as professional practices—health, law, accounting, and unobvious sales businesses, such as restaurants, resorts and country clubs, art galleries, charitable and nonprofit organizations, universities, and even funeral parlors. In every one of these categories there are not only thousands of business owners and sales professionals using this very specific method, there are experts who’ve learned it from me and now teach it.
 In this chapter, I want to introduce you to this method and try to sell you on using it. It can revolutionize your experience in selling.

# Never the Pest, Always the Welcome Guest

## Business-to-business sales professionals are always worrying about “how to get past the gatekeeper,” and I’m often asked, when hired to speak to sales groups, to answer that question. I refuse, because it’s the wrong question. It suggests both artifice and difficulty, and I like neither. Instead, the superior question is:

 “How can I get sought after and invited in by the decision
 maker?”

 Regardless of whether you sell B2B or to consumers, my underlying premise is to engineer a situation where you are sought out, invited in, and welcomed as an expert advisor.
 Any sales trainer who is still directing you down the “101 tricks for sneaking past the gatekeeper” path should be studiously IGNORED!

# The “Welcome Guest Process” in Brief

## The process, presented here in very abbreviated form, is actually quite simple. It begins with Step One, one way or another, getting the qualified, interested prospect to raise his hand. Step Two is then to send him information that raises his interest level and “pre-sells” you and sells the value of the appointment itself. Step Three is not to call him, but only to go and sell to him after he calls you and asks you to do so.

# Welcome Guest . . . Process

## 1. Get qualified prospect to ask for information from you. 2. Send him information that sells you and sells the appointment.
 3. Wait—follow-up if you wish by mail but wait until he calls you.
 4. Go in as Welcome Guest (NOT Annoying Pest).
 Successfully implemented and religiously adhered to, this changes the entire life of the sales pro. It multiplies income, because your time is not wasted, your energy not wasted, stress is replaced with pleasure, closing rates skyrocket, transaction size increases, referrals are easier to obtain. In The New Economy, life for the unwelcome, uninvited pest is going to be even more miserable than in prior years. There will always be salespeople grinding out a living in this role, pests so persistent, with stamina so super

## human, they cannot be stopped. But do you really want to make your living thanks to high tolerance for pain?
 The Welcome Guest Approach is ideally suited to the “mind-set” of The New Economy Customer. He is more resistant than ever to the salesman literally or figuratively knocking on his door, striving to be more circumspect in choosing what he buys and who he buys from, and conditioned by recession to spending reluctance. The arrival of “another salesman” is therefore perceived as a threat. The salesperson who pushes his way past guards and resistance to pitch a product is going to start out with enormous disadvantage to overcome. Conversely, this same New Economy Customer is less confident about his decision-making, purchasing, and investing thanks to his recession experiences, and more receptive than ever to valid, valuable advice from someone he feels he can trust and who he views as a bona-fide expert, a highly competent professional. The salesperson invited in, in that role, begins with enormous advantage.
 To begin, then, Step One is called “lead generation.” Through an ad, a letter, a postcard, or other means, a qualified lead is produced. That means, a person qualified to buy has stepped forward and asked to be provided with information.

# How a Lead Generation Ad Works Like a
 “Personals” Ad

## If you’ve ever read, written, or responded to a “personals” ad, you know that they are written to do two things: attract responses from carefully described people and discourage responses from those who do not meet the desired qualifications. The ad might run something like this:

 SINGLE WHITE FEMALE seeks single or divorced man, 35 to 49,
 confident, established in his career, who enjoys travel, theater,
 cooking, cuddling. No smokers or heavy drinkers, please.

 This same approach works for most products or services. You can target your prospect with a lead generation ad. For example, a financial planner might place the following ad:

 WARNING FOR MARRIED OWNERS OF BUSINESSES, EXECUTIVES, AND ENTREPRENEURS WITH TAXABLE
 INCOMES OVER $250,000.00 PER YEAR: YOU are the government’s # 1 target. Your net, combined tax load could as much as
 DOUBLE in the next 12 months. Your pension fund or retirement
 savings is at new risk. Do you know the TRUTH about the government’s plans for your hard-earned money? MY FREE REPORT: “FINANCIAL ALERT!” reveals the details in plain
 English (NOT financial gobbledygook) and provides important strategies and tips. If you earn over $250,000.00, own a business, own
 your own home, and have a pension or retirement savings plan, this

-----

## report is for you. CALL: a free recording message at 000-000-0000 or
 request your Report online at www.TaxAlert.com

 Clearly this ad “telegraphs” to certain people, and excludes many others, just like a personals ad. Notice the ad does NOT talk about the planner or about products, services, or a particular company.
 The person who responds to this ad tells the planner several very important things. He or she is married, owns or runs a business, earns over $250,000.00 a year, owns (or is buying) a home, is saving for retirement, is concerned about taxes, is no fan of the current government administration, and is anxious about his finances. The person responding to this ad meets demographic qualifications and a mind-set profile. And most importantly, the person responding feels he is taking the first step.
 Given all this knowledge about this prospect, the financial planner can create a free report[*] that directly “hits” this person right where he feels it most. The planner then sends the report with the package of promotional materials[2] (see Chapter 17, where such a package is described in the example of the security system salesperson). This establishes the planner in the right role I’ve described in this chapter, with the right positioning, described in the previous chapter. Importantly, it avoids the normal salesperson behavior: jumping on the phone with the prospect the instant he shows himself, pushing for an appointment immediately.
 When the phone rings—and it will—you can be sure that this financial planner is already well-positioned. The prospective client won’t be looking at “just another salesperson”—he will be seeking out this planner as the expert most likely to solve personal financial concerns.

# Where Do You Run Lead Generation
 Advertising?

## If you sell products or services to businesses, you may use local area business journals and legal newspapers, the business section of your city’s daily newspaper, or the trade magazines that serve your clients’ type of business. As you probably know, there are national or international trade magazines for virtually every type of business and industry, from aluminum manufacturing to zebra breeding. Also, just about every business has at least one association that publishes and usually offers advertising in a newsletter that goes to its members.
 If you sell products to the general public, you might use your city’s daily newspaper, weekly community newspapers, local “shoppers,” broadcast media (radio or TV), or coupon packs delivered to residences, like Money Mailer or ValPak.
 You can also do this kind of lead generation advertising online, in many venues. Here is a secret to keep in mind: the highest productivity comes from treating the website or sites, purchased traffic, everything done online only as another lead generation media, then doing follow-up offline, via paper ‘n ink direct mail (not by e-mail).
 The real answer to where to do your lead generation advertising is: where your ideal prospect frequents, in what he reads, watches, or listens to.

# The Postcard Technique

## Many salespeople get great results putting their lead generation ad onto a simple postcard and mailing it to lists of likely prospects. The postcard is just about the simplest, least costly advertising vehicle you can find when you consider the cost of a postage stamp.
 If you sell to consumers, there are all sorts of mailing lists readily available to you from the very simple, such as all the homeowners in a particular postal region, to something quite complicated, like a “merge- purged” list of subscribers to home decorating magazines who have credit cards, own the homes they live in, and fall into certain age and income ranges, in particular postal regions.
 Lists are also available for business buyers including subscribers to certain trade magazines or other publications, compiled lists of business owners or executives by size of business, type of business, annual sales, number of employees, and other criteria.
 In most cities, you’ll find List Brokers as a heading in the Yellow Pages; one of these local brokers can probably handle simple, local list needs. If you’re interested in something more sophisticated, it will pay you to learn a bit about all the lists and list-related services that are available, at SRDS.com. Spending an hour or so going through SRDS will open your eyes to a whole world of opportunity! Basically, if you can describe ideal prospects, you can find available lists to match. And, generally, money spent in list selection is money well spent.

# Headlines Are Important

## Here’s a simple “copy secret” for making these ads, letters, websites, and postcards work: The headline is the single most important part of the postcard. For example:

 CONGRATULATIONS! YOU’VE ALREADY WON:

 Then you continue:

 You’ve been selected to receive a fascinating FREE REPORT about

 (insert your title).
 Then you drop in the rest of your lead generation ad’s message. Here’s a complete example:

# CONGRATULATIONS! YOU’VE ALREADY
 WON:

## You’ve been selected to receive a copy of automotive expert Bill Gizmo’s informative book, How to Keep Your Car Alive & Kicking at Minimum Cost, Without Ever Getting Burnt by Repair Rip-Offs, absolutely FREE.

# Who Uses Lead Generation Advertising?

## Look around. Big, brand name companies that sell by appointment or by bringing customers into showrooms use it a lot. Tempur-Pedic and “Sleep Number” beds, for example. I dare you to pick any magazine off the newsstand and not find these kinds of ads. But not nearly as noticeable, the continent is full of observant, savvy salespeople who have taken note of this model and applied it to their own businesses and careers.

# Lead Generation Message Tips

## • Don’t try to do too much.
 • Use a compelling headline
 • Keep it simple
 • Target
 • Fish where the people you want to attract are
 Here are the secrets to making lead generation advertising work for you, too:

 • Don’t try to accomplish too much. The only job of lead generation is to produce leads. Do not try to “pre-sell” your product or service, build business name recognition, or otherwise achieve multiple objectives. Focus 100% on getting the right people to respond. Simply getting the right people to step forward, raise their hands, and identify themselves to you is enough.

-----

## • Use a powerful, attention-grabbing headline. Remember that the headline must be clear, bold, and simple. It usually should telegraph the promise of a great benefit. And it’s very hard to beat “free” as a component part of what you are offering.

 • Keep it simple. There’s no need to complicate this at all. Focus on a straightforward offer such as a free report, booklet, book, or CD, all of which work very well. Sometimes a free consultation of some kind will work.

 • TARGET! Write your message to exclude many and attract the relatively few who are perfectly matched with what you have to offer.

 • FISH where the people you want to attract swim.

# How to Use Lead Generation to Force Prospects to Give You Information and Grant Your Control
 of the Sales Process

## One of my longtime Members is a marketing and sales consultant for technology and industrial companies, marketing business-to-business, and he specializes in online lead generation. He sent me results from a “split- test” conducted for a manufacturer selling to engineers. If you aren’t familiar with the idea of splittesting, it means changing only one variable in an ad, letter, website, phone script, etc. and trying version #1 on half the leads, version #2 on the other. On the internet it’s easy to do, as alternating site visitors can be automatically split up and sent to different versions of the same landing page or complete site without them knowing it.
 Anyway, one version of this company’s site provided a typical brochure online, featuring a Q&A presentation of the company’s capabilities and technology applications. The radically different version offered only a “tease” page with a barrier to entry to more information. This page offered basically the same information repositioned as special reports for the engineers, but required the site visitor to provide complete contact information and answers to a few key questions before they could get to the special reports.
 You might think this would suppress response and in many instances you’d be right, although that might not be a bad thing. Disqualifying only casually interested prospects is often very desirable. But in this case, the opposite occurred. The traditional site was converting only 3.5% of the visitors to prospects requesting more information and/or appointments. The new site converted 36.9% of the visitors to real leads. And the ultimate conversions to sales were also higher with the second group than the first.

# The Last but First Thing You Need to Know
 About Lead Generation

## Lead generation is about “bait.”
 It requires a match of the right bait to attract the right critter. If you want a backyard full of deer, do not put a big 500-pound block of cheddar cheese out there. Your backyard will soon be overrun with rats and mice. If you want deer, try a salt block. However if you want rodents, nix the salt, use the cheese. You can attract any critter to your backyard with the right bait. Similarly you can get anyone you desire to respond to lead generation advertising, direct-mail, and other media—Fortune 500 CEOs, surgeons, stay-at-home moms—if you get the bait right. If you fail, you’re using the wrong bait.
 Special Note: The following story from guest contributors Jimmy Vee and Travis Miller illustrates the principles of Chapters 16 and 17 in action. These principles are so powerful these business partners were able to go from struggling to successful sales professionals to owners of thriving companies to expert advisors and trainers in this field, even authors of their own book, Gravitational Marketing. I’m pleased to say that they have been “Kennedy students” and Members for many years.
