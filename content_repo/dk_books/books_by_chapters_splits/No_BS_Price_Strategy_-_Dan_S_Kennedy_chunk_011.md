## CHAPTER 1

 Price and Fee Failures

 Dan Kennedy

**There are many ways to fail at price strategy. Here is a short list:**

1. Pricing by textbook formulas, industry norms, or other “standard” means
2. Excess concern about competitors’ lower prices
3. Attracting customers who buy by price
4. Pre-determined belief system about “what they’ll pay”
5. Permitting apples-to-apples comparisons
6. Insufficient differentiation
7. Not offering premium price options
8. Ignorance or stupidity about “business math”
9. Poor self-esteem/business-esteem; feelings of not deserving more

These and others are explored throughout the book.

One of the most unpleasant discoveries to be made here has to do with your own thinking, rather
than with specific price strategy. After all, what war strategy could be useful to a true conscientious
objector, opposed to killing for any reason, under any circumstances? That’s a guy you do not want
in your foxhole, watching your back! You don’t want a conscientious objector to highest-price-andprofits-possible running a business for you either. Hopefully, that’s not you!

If you came to these pages hoping for little tricks, like whether to say 50% off, half off, or 2 for 1,
you’re in for disappointment, or hopefully, a change of heart. [That sort of thing is tactics, not
strategy.] We are about something much bigger than that. This book is, first and foremost, about
challenging all your preconceived, present ideas about price—most importantly, about the limits of
the prices you can successfully command. Second, based on the first, our objective is to have you
alter your strategic approach to price, and view it within the context of marketing, not as a separate
task tied to price-book and calculator.

Most business owners are failures at price strategy, to an extent they are unaware of. That
ignorance might be bliss, but it’s very costly and hazardous to one’s wealth.

**When I say they fail at price strategy, I mean that they fail to use price as a positive**
**marketing tool and path to advantage. I also mean that they fail to create the greatest possible**
**profit in their business. The reasons for these failures group into attitudinal and practical; into fear-**
based ideas and self-imposed limitations; and into marketing and selling mistakes. The most
important thing to know going in is that your prices are your choice and your responsibility. Even in
situations where most would believe price was imposed—like Jason’s business, where he and his
wife compete as a premium-priced, private provider against free services funded for consumers by
the government—there is always opportunity for liberation and control, by acceptance of
responsibility.

There’s an old, not very funny joke about two construction workers perched side by side on a
girder, at lunch break. One opens his lunchbox and cries out in frustration and rage, spews curses,
and says “Damn, damn, damn, I can’t stand this—cheese sandwiches again. All I ever get are cheese
sandwiches!” The other guy says: “Why don’t you ask your wife to make you something different?”
Sadly, the first fellow mumbles “I pack my own lunch.”

If you are self-employed, a business owner, in professional practice, or a sales professional, you
write your own paycheck. If you’re not satisfied with it, you know who to complain to. But the
amount on the paycheck is pre-ordained long before it is actually inked. It begins with your price
strategy. And that is preceded by your belief system about price. That likely affected by your belief
system about money and wealth and success.

-----

I hope you’ve arrived here with an open mind, a creative spirit, and a sincere determination to
write yourself out much, much bigger paychecks.

**Be careful of argument with or hasty rejection of anything you read here that is in conflict**
**with your existent beliefs, but is about pursuit of bigger paychecks. You can’t expect to stay**
married to the exact same thinking and beliefs about price, and to the same strategy about price, but
somehow magically see larger dollar amounts on your paychecks. You will be tempted to argue and
quickly reject what is presented here. The temptation is perfectly understandable, yet you must be
alert for it and then fight it with all your will. Force your mind to be open. Nothing less will do!

## The Ultimate Failure

Other than going out of business entirely and slinking off into the sunset, tail beneath your legs, in
search of a hiding place—such as an ordinary j-o-b—the next worst failure is staying in business but
still slinking about with tail beneath your legs, settling for table scraps-level income when a king’s
feast-type income was within reach.

To be fair about this, there are a lot of people who own businesses who are there because of nonfinancial motivations, typically an interest in the work in the business and a distaste for having a
boss. To these folks, adequate income is perfectly satisfactory, maximum income of no interest.
They can hoist the banner of “Mission Accomplished” and declare themselves successful as long as
the bills are paid at the shop and at home. But a great many more settle for only adequate rather than
exceptional income, and just making a living rather than developing wealth because they believe it’s
all they can reasonably expect their business to provide, and in doing so, they sell it and themselves
very short—and, whether they have clarity about it or not, they are failures. I know that is harsh.
But if you have scaled back, down-sized, and surrendered your original and early ambitions to a
lesser level of achievement, you live in failure. If you leave profit and other opportunity capable of
fulfilling the original ambition lying right on the table in front of you thanks to poor, uncorrected
vision, or fear and timidity, or just about any other untreated but treatable handicap, sorry, but you
live in failure.

I am a devoted, dedicated, passionate champion of the independent business owner and
entrepreneur, and of the sales warriors. Without us, it’s all over. Almost any other occupational
groups could take a few months off and the nation might survive. If we all slept for a week, collapse
would be complete. Because we risk while others trade all for seeming safety; because we invest
while others squander; because we innovate while others are complacent; because we work twice
the hours and with ten times the intensity than the overwhelming majority who prefer 9-to-5;
because we take on infinitely more responsibility; because we get bruised and bloodied and knocked
down and get back in the game while others sit in the bleachers; because we pay a grossly
disproportionate share of all taxes and act as Atlas carrying the rest of the population on our
shoulders; and because we create and organize and deliver goods, services, experiences, and value
while others consume, we deserve ultimate prosperity, which requires making our businesses and
business activities as profitable as they can possibly be, letting not even a cent that might have been
in our coffers somehow escape. You have both right and responsibility to get all the profit-produced
prosperity you can squeeze from your business. Not a drop less.

**This is** **_not_** **greed. Greed is defined in the dictionary as** _selfish desire. There is profound_
difference between self-interest and selfishness. If you are unfamiliar with the distinction or, worse,
inhibited by that misunderstanding, I urge you to read three books as quickly as you can: the novel
_Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, the book Thou Shall Prosper by Rabbi Daniel Lapine, and my own_
_[No B.S. Wealth Attraction in The New Economy. I am advocating to you the proper, appropriate,](http://www.amazon.com/B-S-Wealth-Attraction-Economy-ebook/dp/B004RUGVWU/)_
deserved obtainment of all that is for you, to be derived by fair exchange of value—recognizing the
admittedly uncommon but demonstrable (and demonstrated in this book) fact that there can be value
to the consumer in a merchant’s premium, above-par prices. If you live the ultimate failure of
deriving less profit than possible from your providing goods and/or services of value, you do not
win a merit badge for reduction of greed by self-imposed restraint. There is no such merit badge, as
the act is without merit.

I lack the space and time here to even try to convince you of this liberating, empowering
philosophy—this is a book of mechanical, not philosophical instruction. That’s what you bought and
that is what you are going to get. But the tools in this toolbox will be of greatly diminished value to
you without the wholehearted embrace of a capitalistic, self-interest-based, guilt-free philosophy
about prosperity. So, again, I urge reading the above-mentioned books in tandem with this one.

The opposite of the ultimate failure is the ultimate success of living your life exactly and entirely
as you choose, facilitated by your business working for you (not you for it) as needed, and as part of
that, manufacturing every possible profit.

## CHAPTER 2

 Discounting Without Damage

 Jason Marrs

**I wasn’t raised like most kids. Even from kids who grew up in business like I did, my family had a**
different way of doing things. It is not surprising though. My mother was not very far removed from
tremendous wealth. To put it into perspective, my grandmother went to college in California during
the Great Depression. Considering that was a time before college was popular, that she was female,
and that she came from rural New Mexico says a lot about the family’s financial resources.

Our family was not highly motivated by the advertising of a SALE! A lesson that I was always
taught was not to get overly excited about sale prices because nine times out of ten, you can always
buy the item for that price. That has been a good lesson for me. I have found it to be the case. Sale
prices are often nothing more that statements of what you should really be paying for something.
And that is the downside to discounts. They can destroy price integrity with blinding speed. On the
other hand they can bring a stampede of buyers through the door faster than just about anything
else.

It is no wonder discounts and I have such an uneasy relationship. On one hand I hate them
because they can be such a destructive force. On the other hand I love them because they are such
an effective way to drive sales. I think you should share my uneasy relationship with discounts, even
if you don’t share my childhood-ingrained skepticism of them as a consumer. Most business owners
use discounts too casually and thoughtlessly, and too often, because they like the positive effects
and do not fully understand the negative effects.

**The thing to keep in mind is that offering discounts is a form of selling on price. When you**
offer a discount you are taking the focus from the value you provide and placing it squarely on your
price. There is no way to escape that. To maintain higher prices you have to be adept at selling
value. Discounts erode your ability to do that. Any reduction in prices can damage your price
integrity. Later, getting the same customer to stop thinking about price and re-focus on value can
prove difficult.

Not only that, studies show that discounts actually reduce the effectiveness of whatever is being
discounted. By that I mean that the discounted offering literally does not perform as well as it did at
full price. That sounds impossible, but double blind studies using prescription drugs and OTC health
products, cosmetics, and other products have shown this to be true. A study conducted by a group of
resort properties matched their most glowing comment cards to the guests paying full price or nearly
full price, the most critical comment cards to guests who had bought at deeply discounted rates and
knew it. Part of the explanation for that may be that the discounted rates drew a poorer quality
customer. That would not surprise me—in my health care business, I deliberately try to repel clients
concerned with price and discounts. But it also suggests that in the same way that people told they
were taking a more expensive drug expected and got better outcomes, the guests paying
substantially higher rates expected a better experience and molded their assessment to their
expectation.

## Price Orgasms

-----

**The folks at the California Institute of Technology hooked 20 people up to MRI-type**
brain scans while having them taste wine. They told them that they were tasting five
different Cabernet Sauvignons, each priced differently. In truth, they were given two
twice, one once. A $90.00 wine was served marked once with its real price but once as a
$10.00 wine, while another served twice was marked once as a cheap $5.00 wine, and
again marked as a $45.00 wine. The test subjects’ scanned brains unanimously displayed
more pleasure when tasting the wines they believed to be higher priced than when tasting
the wines believed to be lowest in price. Their expectations based on stated price—and
belief in the truthfulness of the prices—influenced, even controlled the relative pleasure
experienced. (And later, when given the same wines with no price markings just to sample
and choose, they all rated the $5.00 wine as better than the others!) Your tax dollars at
work—funding from the National Science Foundation. I have always thought the ride of a
Mercedes terribly hard and uncomfortable and figured people believe it’s better than it is
because it has to be, since it’s a Mercedes, but I’ll bet if you blindfolded ‘em and drove
them around in a Mercedes and told them that it was a Ford, and in a Ford and told them
that it was a Mercedes, you’d get a different reaction. (Dan Kennedy. Source: Yahoo News

Ironically, discounts can also lead to dissatisfaction in your clientele. Discounts can lead your
clients to ask themselves why your price can be discounted. They look at the price they have been
paying, and then they look at the discount and smell a rat. They wonder why they can’t get that
price some other time. If they recently paid full price for a product now put on sale, they feel
cheated. This is why it is so imperative that you always give a good reason for a discount and that
your rules are solid. Unless you plan to compete on price continuously, then you can’t have
predictable sales or flexible terms. If there’s a sale, it has got to be for a specific reason with specific
rules.

Discounts can be a great way to modify behavior. Volume discounts are an example of this. They
make sense in the buyer’s mind. We are trained to expect that the more we buy the cheaper things
will get. So customers are generally not skeptical or resentful if you give this type of discount. The
same goes for prepay discounts and bundles. Prepay will help to keep your accounts receivable
current while bundles can increase your transaction size. Businesses with seasonal slumps can
disclose that as a reason for discounts at a specific time of year, with few negative ramifications. A
good “reason why” can mitigate damage to overall price integrity, reputation, and relationship with
regular customers, and can create the kind of behavior you want from the customer—such as buying
now, not later; during off-season; bigger quantities.
