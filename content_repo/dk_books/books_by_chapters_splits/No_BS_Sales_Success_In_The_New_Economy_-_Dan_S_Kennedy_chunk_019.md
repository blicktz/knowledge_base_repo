# CHAPTER 12

STRATEGY 12IN SEARCH OF THE FREE
 LUNCH

## There’s an old story about the king who commissioned a group of the brightest scholars in his kingdom to assemble the wisdom of the ages. They first came back with a truckload full of stone tablets. He told them to condense and simplify. They came with an encyclopedia. He demanded that they condense and simplify. Finally, ultimately, they returned with a single sentence: there’s no such thing as a free lunch.
 Every sane, sensible logical person knows that to be the truth. However, we all still love to believe there might be! That’s why premiums work so well in selling. A premium is a free gift or a free bonus: something the buyer gets free when purchasing something else. Everything from books to Buicks have been given away at one time or another as a premium with a purchase. Every single time you hear “free,” logic says it’s a lie. If you hear it from an advertiser, marketer, or salesperson, it’s a lie. If you hear it from a politician, it’s an even bigger lie. Yet it’s still a very sweet and seductive thing to hear. Politicians keep right on giving Huey Long’s “chicken in every pot, car in every garage” speech, and it actually seems to be more and more effective with each election. The gift-with-purchase gambit credited by most as invention by Estee Lauder continues to be a staple not just in the cosmetics field, but just about everywhere. Some people actually believe they get free drinks in casinos!
 I personally love to use premiums in selling. I’ve given away cameras, vacation trips, books, reports, subscriptions, collectors’ art prints, free consulting services, jewelry, and many other things in personal, group, and mail-order selling over the years. Here are some tips on using premiums:

 • Don’t give away the same things you sell. In most cases, this is a bad practice because it devalues your merchandise or services.

 • Offer premiums that people want for themselves. Even if you’re in the business-to-business marketing environment, it’s best to offer a

## luxury personal-use item, at least as one of two or more options.

 • Give away things people want but rarely buy for themselves. I’ve found that people will often buy something as a premium that they ordinarily would never buy on its own. A day at the spa is a compelling premium when selling to women who do not ordinarily buy such an indulgence for themselves.

 • Make the premium relevant to your offer or to your customers or clients. It doesn’t have to necessarily be related to what you are selling. It can be. But it can be relevant to your customers yet unrelated to your product or service.

# How to Close the Difficult Sale with a Very
 Desirable Premium

## For many years, the direct selling companies in the home security and fire alarm systems businesses have relied on desirable premiums. Although everybody needs and should have a fire alarm system in their home, nobody wants one, and so it is a difficult sale. Typically, these companies will offer a beautiful set of crystal and dinnerware, or a gorgeous collection of jewelry, or an all-expenses-paid vacation as the free bonus gift to close the sale. This lets the buyers get something they really want while doing the right thing and purchasing something they really need. The gift may very well be something they would never buy for themselves, but they love the opportunity of getting it “free.”

# Premiums and “Big Ticket Selling”

## You can even use premiums in negotiating. With one big consulting contract I closed, I “threw in” a complete library of my books and audio learning programs. The retail value was well over $2,500.00, but the cost to me was less than $300.00. I once gave away a certain amount of consulting time to an individual, for his business, as a “bonus” for his investing in one of my companies. In selling a business, I included consulting time as a bonus. I know a businessman who secured the services of a top lawyer by including free use of a private plane in the agreement in addition to the normal retainers and fees.
 A Member of mine, a commercial mortgage broker dealing only with commercial real estate agents handling large apartment building transactions, periodically gives away a Palm Springs golf resort vacation to the broker bringing him the most business—highlighting this in his direct- mail has brought many new brokers to him.
 In the recent recession, one California builder of luxury beachfront homes began giving away one of his downtown condos as a free bonus with purchase of a home.
 Another client of mine provides investment-related services to affluent M.D.s and surgeons. His “new client welcome gift” is a week’s stay in the luxury beachfront condominium he owns in the Bahamas. He vacations there himself four weeks a year, leaving forty-eight weeks to give away to new clients.
 You can use the “free-lunch technique” many different ways in business. Do not make the mistake of overlooking or discounting how powerful and universal the appeal of this approach is. Do not make the mistake of thinking it does not apply to high-priced products, professional services, or complex negotiations, or to sophisticated buyers or investors.

# Perception Is Reality: The “Story” Is the “Secret
 Ingredient”

## McDonald’s special sauce. The formula for Coca-Cola. Colonel Sander’s secret recipe for KFC. These things preserve some mystique in otherwise mundane products.
 Nowhere is this more visibly at work than in the cosmetics and skin-care products field, where I’ve done a lot of work as an advertising copywriter, with infomercials, with both private label products and retail salons. If you haven’t paid much attention to this business, the next time you’re at a department store, stroll slowly past the cosmetic counters. You will be astounded at how many different brand names, colors, scents, and mystifying products there are. The ingredients are incredible: dew collected only from tulips growing on the sunny side of the Swiss Alps, volcanic ash, seaweed from an exotic locale, even sheep sperm!
 Yet, as much as the consumers of these products hate hearing this, all of it is pretty much the same. In fact, there’s only one manufacturer for every 50 to 100 different brands, labels, and product lines—all with the same ingredients, the only significant differences being the packaging, price, and “story.”
 If you took away the mystique created by the stories, the celebrities, and the advertising, you’d have one generic line of cosmetics, warranting price points 50% to 500% less than today’s going rates. But nobody would buy it, and everybody would hate you for revealing how the magician did the trick.

# Creating Your Own Mystique

## Developing mystique is possible for anyone. One technique is what I call “Takeaway Selling,” which is explored in detail in Part V of this book. Learning to use Takeaway Selling has had greater impact on my personal earnings than any other single thing I’ve ever discovered or learned, so be sure to study this section of the book. You’ll find that some of the ideas regarded as “gospel” about success in selling are challenged.
 Another “trick” is to create your own mystique terminology for what you do, just as the cosmetic manufacturers do. In the self-improvement industry, the all-time bestselling books Psycho-Cybernetics and The New Psycho- Cybernetics utilize language borrowed from missile guidance technology and robotics to describe human psychology and behavior, and use created, proprietary terminology like ASM, Automatic Success Conditioning and Theater of the Mind to organize and present information about fairly universal self-help activities, such as visualization. The once hugely successful and famous EST program built mystique around its unique language and terminology. In EST, you only knew if you had “it” when you got “it” and otherwise you couldn’t understand what “it” was. EST’s Werner Erhard learned this mystique-creating tactic from his earlier experiences in Mind Dynamics, the human potential seminar arm of the controversial cosmetic sales/pyramid marketing company, Holiday Magic. At introductory seminars for such programs, those already “in” would be talking enthusiastically and happily with one another in a language largely incomprehensible by the new guests. Because “outsiders” are naturally motivated to become “insiders,” this situation alone helped sell these programs.
 In my own development of and teaching of advertising, marketing, and selling strategies, I’ve coined a great deal of unique terminology, such as Message-To-Market Match, Shock and Awe Packages, Marketing By Values, 3-Step Letter System, and many, many more, for the express

## purpose of making concepts mine, and adding mystique. Clients in every imaginable field have followed suit: carpet cleaners, dentists, real estate agents, real estate trainers, financial advisors have all learned from me to name their concepts and processes, illustrate their concepts and processes, in some cases actually trademark their terminology, and use it all to convey an air of mystique, to proffer secrets.
 One of the things I’ve learned in marketing as wide and diverse a variety of products and services as I have is that “I’ve got a secret” is one of the most powerful of all positioning statements. People at all levels, CEO to broom-pusher, desperately want to believe in secrets—that there is some piece of information that has been kept from them, that others know but they do not, that will resolve their biggest problem or fulfill their greatest desire. If you can reposition yourself as a seller of secrets, you instantly gain power.

# How to Unmask and Still Create Mystique

## More than 18 years ago, I wrote a book, The Ultimate Sales Letter, which is still available in bookstores in an up-dated edition, in which I reveal and demonstrate each of the 28 steps that I go through as a professional direct- response copywriter to create powerful sales letters or ads for my clients— at fees starting at $50,000.00 up plus royalties. I revealed every step I take, but still, many people read the book and choose to hire me anyway. Why? Because there’s enough intangible creativity and mystique in what I do that even when you know the steps of the process, you may not be able to do it as well as I can. Also, the very fact that I have a systematic, proprietary process influences many clients. This is an example of how you can reveal what’s behind your curtain yet still have people more convinced they should hire you to do it for them than to do it themselves.
 A number of years back, I watched Chuck Daly and Brendan Suhr conduct a practice and a coaching session with the Detroit Pistons, and then coach a big game. I’m a quick learner, so I think I understand the structure of what they did and why they did it. But I still couldn’t duplicate their experience and talent at applying the process. In fact, I left with a greater appreciation for what they do than I had before. And were I to own an NBA team, I wouldn’t be so foolish as to take its head coach role. I’d find and hire the best.
 If what you do creates that kind of awe and respect, then you can create mystique by revealing your process rather than concealing it. If what you do doesn’t create awe and respect, you ought to go to work fixing that!

# Everything Old Is New Again—at Least It Better
 Be!

## One related matter that messes up a lot of people in marketing is “what’s new?” A sales rep in one of our companies was once overheard complaining that we hadn’t introduced any new products for a long time. “Have all your customers seen all of our products?” I asked. The rep freely admitted they had not. “Then you’ve got new products,” I said.
 A funny thing occasionally happens in the advertising business: a client will cancel or change an ad campaign that’s working perfectly just because they got bored with it and assumed everybody else was, too. That’s a bad assumption. There are ad campaigns that sustain success for five, even ten years. These campaigns are old hat to their owners but are new to new customers who are paying attention to them for the first time. If it’s unknown to someone, it’s a secret—regardless of how routine it may be to you.
 I had to learn that in my consulting activities. I charge fees for disclosing knowledge that to me is quite ordinary. To those who need to know it and don’t, it’s exotic and valuable. For example, I know quite a bit about how to select and obtain mailing lists for just about any purpose. If you need a list of middle-aged dog owners who live in Philadelphia, subscribe to Better Homes and Gardens, and have at least one credit card, I know how to get that list. To me, there’s nothing to that. To those who don’t know and need to, it’s worth a lot, and is quite mystifying and impressive.
 The New Economy doesn’t demand everything successfully sold in it actually be new. In fact, many New Economy Customers are more sensitive than ever to “proven.” Trustworthiness and reliability matter. However, whatever you sell needs to be presented in a way that feels timely and current and, to some audience “hip,” to some customers “cutting edge.” Customers want innovation, they just don’t want to be guinea pigs and lab rats.

## You cannot permit yourself to lose interest in or enthusiasm for your most tried and true products and services that have proven themselves appealing, satisfying, and valuable to customers. But you do need to freshen the presentation of such things frequently. In truth, hardly any product, service, person, place, or thing has inherent mystique. Paris, France, is no more inherently interesting than Paris, Kentucky, absent its romantic reputation, image, story. If you feel deprived by not having something to sell with mystique and, worse, waste energy looking for such a thing, you need to change your thinking about this and accept the responsibility of the masterfully persuasive sales professional—to provide the mystique.
