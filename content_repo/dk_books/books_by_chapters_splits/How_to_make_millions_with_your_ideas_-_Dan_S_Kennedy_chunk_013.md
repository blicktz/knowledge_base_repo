      EVEN IF YOURS ISN’T A TRUE SERVICE BUSINESS,
       ADD AND EMPHASIZE A SERVICE COMPONENT.
     Carl’s book business is a mail-order business, but by posi-
   tioning himself as the provider of the service of tracking down
   and providing these difficult-to-find, rare, or out-of-print books,
   he built his mail-order business without a cent of advertising.
     Earl Nightingale once observed, “‘If, instead of working on
   making more money, the average businessperson would spend
   an hour each and every day in quiet contemplation of how to be
   of greater and more creative service to his clientele, he and they
   would be the richer for it.’’
     A Related Moneymaking Secret Is to Go
        Where Your Talent Takes You
     I started in speaking, as many do, giving talks and seminars
   on self-improvement, motivation, and general success subjects.
   And I took just about any and every speaking opportunity that
   came along. ‘“‘Can you speak about the mating habits of the
   New Zealand bumbarabbit?’’ Certainly. It just so happens that

     You can get good at speaking that way. I did. And you can
   make a living that way. I did, and many do. But my speaking
   income and the demand for my services really took off as I
   moved further away from those common, universal topics and,
   instead, focused on speaking about marketing and _ direct-
   marketing strategies and systems, where my greatest talent is,
   and where my greatest interest is. For me, devising the right
   marketing strategies for different products, services, or busi-
   nesses, and teaching people how to select and use the best strat-
   egies for their purposes, is not only easy, it’s fun. I’d rather do
    this than play golf, to the constant consternation of my wife. The
   line between work and play is blurred.

       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #21:
       TURN YOUR PASSIONS INTO PROFITS.
   The entrepreneurial path is, at best, a very rocky one, with
 landmarks like long hours, frustration, fear, financial worries and
 woes, and, quite literally, one obstacle placed in front of you
 after another. If you are going to have the persistence necessary
 to travel very far on this path, it'll help to be involved in an
 activity that genuinely interests you and stirs your passion. It is
 much easier to make a million dollars doing something you enjoy
 and are excited about for its own sake than to make a million
 purely to make a million.
   FOUNDATIONS FOR A SUCCESSFUL SERVICE BUSINESS
    1. Need-driven (examples: oil change shop, computer
     repair)
   2. Want-driven (examples: interior decorating, portrait
    photography)
   3. Time savings—driven (examples: mobile oil change,
    lawn and garden service)
   4. Money savings—driven (example: furniture re-cover-
     ing and reupholstering)
   5. Unique or incorporating a strong competitive advan-
     tage (example: 1-Hour-by-appointment appliance re-
     pair: We set a definite appointment and guarantee to
     arrive within one hour of the appointment time or
    your repair is free.)
   6. Linked to personal interest, preferably a passion
   7. Linked to a personal talent, eee or specialized
    knowledge

  HOW THE AMAZING POWER OF
   DUPLICATION TURNS EVEN
  SIMPLE IDEAS INTO IMPRESSIVE
       FORTUNES
  dBi premise is simple: Create a means of making money,
     building and operating a business, or something similar that
   has unique features and can be taught to and duplicated by oth-
    ers, and then charge others for the privilege of using your
    “*system.”’
     Yes, I’ve just described McDonald’s and virtually the entire
   franchise industry. But there are a number of other, less com-
    plicated, costly, regulated ways of getting paid for others’ use
   of your proven system. So, after just a few words about fran-
   chising, we’ll move on to more interesting opportunities.
      Franchising Just Ain’t What It Used to Be,
          but It Still Might Be Your
         Million-Dollar Opportunity
      In its earlier years, franchising was a way for the little guy
    to get into business for relatively little investment and minimal
    risk, thanks to the proven system, training, and continuing sup-
    port of the parent company, the franchisor. Over the years, fran-

 business owners at all; they are sold to established, successful
  franchisees in another franchise network. McDonald’s franchis-
  ees own Domino’s franchises, Dunkin’ Donuts franchises, Al-
 phagraphics franchises, etc., and the entire industry has become
 somewhat incestuous.
   Of course, if you do have a business right and ripe for fran-
  chising, you may still find your fast fortune as a franchisor. As
  a starting point, you might obtain some information from the
  International Franchise Association in Washington, D.C. How-
  ever, just the cost of getting ready to sell your first franchise,
  notably including legal fees and complex, costly federal and state
  registrations, can be prohibitive. In response to the increasing
  costs and complexity of becoming a franchisor, and the related
  high costs and barriers to entry for ordinary folks as franchisees,
  new, different, innovative, and simpler formats for putting peo-
  ple in business have come to the forefront, and it is these that I
 want to focus on in this chapter.
       Could You Get Rich Selling a
          Business in a Box?
   Consider my clients and friends, Len and Sandy Shykind,
  their company, U.S. Gold Chain Manufacturing, and its main
  business, ‘‘Gold By The Inch.’’ An inveterate entrepreneur, Len
 Shykind had been in over twenty different businesses, some
 modestly successful, some gut-wrenching disappointments, when
 he got the idea for Gold By The Inch. The idea is a simple one:
 Display gold chain in different patterns on spools, uncut; let the
 customer choose the pattern; cut the chain to the exact length
  for her wrist, neck, or ankle; and then add the hoop ring and
 clasp, providing made-to-order jewelry instantly, on the spot.
 The first Gold By The Inch display was a clunky, homemade
  unit, which Len and Sandy, kids in tow, schlepped out to swap
 meets and to a location in front of a buddy’s gift shop to test

```

-----

```
   Phoenix in July, in just six months, working only on weekends,
   Len and Sandy personally sold over $40,000 of Gold By The
   Inch. And, incidentally, the markup in this product category is
   enormous. Comparable chains in jewelry, department, and even
   discount stores typically carry markups of fifteen to twenty
   times, so Gold By The Inch Dealers mark their products up eight
    to ten times (800 to 1,000 percent) and still offer customers
   bargains! With $40,000 in sales and nearly $30,000 in profits in
    six months from a part-time business, Len and Sandy realized
   they had a duplicatable, marketable business opportunity that
   other people would be thrilled to have access to.
        From a Tabletop in a Swap Meet to a
           Growing, Global Business
     Eleven years later, Len’s company, U.S. Gold, has started
   nearly 10,000 Gold By The Inch distributors in business through-
   out the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, England,
   Africa, Arabia, Greece, and Japan. Most have part-time or spare-
   time businesses. Many take their portable business to swap
   meets, fairs, and bazaars, some sublet space from host stores in
   malls and shopping centers, and a few operate kiosks or carts.
    All together, U.S. Gold distributors sold over $25 million at re-
    tail in 1994,
     The product line has expanded to include a wide variety of
   rings manufactured in U.S. Gold’s own factory, even imported
    pearls, but still the entire ‘‘jewelry store’’ requires only a table-
   top of space and relies on the shiny, beckoning spools of gold
   chain to attract customers. People can get started in the business
    for as little as $399, although the average new Dealer starts with
   about $1,000 worth of inventory at cost. It’s not uncommon for
    a Dealer to turn that entire inventory over in just a couple of
   weekends, and be back for more.

```
   The fortune that Len has made in just ten years is largely
 thanks to the appealing simplicity of this business. Len says that
 the key to the success of his business could be copied by many
 others. “People understand the product, its appeal, and how the
 business works instantly. It’s easy to do and the product just
 about sells itself, so just about anybody can see themselves doing
 it successfully. And the high markup means that only a few sales
 a day can still put a couple hundred dollars—maybe $30 or $40
 an hour—into the Dealer’s pocket.’’ Len created a successful
 business-in-a-box anybody can do, anywhere, anytime.
    How Television Created Quantum-Leap Growth
              for U.S. Gold
   For years, U.S. Gold recruited almost all of its new distrib-
 utors from advertisements in national magazines like Money-
 making Opportunities, Income Opportunities, and Entrepreneur,
 but the company’s big breakthrough came with its first TV in-
 fomercial. With a simply and inexpensively made half-hour TV
 program describing Gold By The Inch, with interviews with Len,
 Sandy, successful Dealers, and industry experts, the number of
 people requesting information about getting into the Gold By
 The Inch business skyrocketed, and the advertising costs of at-
 tracting those people actually dropped. The infomercial I pro-
 duced for U.S. Gold has now set a record as the longest
 continuously airing lead generation infomercial for a business
 opportunity. It has aired almost every week on national cable
 networks like Discovery and The Family Channel and hundreds
 of local stations in cities and towns throughout the United States
 for over five years.
   At the time that we put together and started airing this in-
 fomercial, there were no other lead generation infomercials of
 its kind. We pioneered a new approach, since copied successfully
 by others. The infomercial has been directly responsible for mil-

```
    for the company and its jewelry. The infomercial was even spot-
    ted by an executive at the huge MGM Grand Hotel and Theme
   Park in Las Vegas, which has led to the first Gold By The Inch
   permanent location store, The Gold Mine, in the MGM Grand
   Theme Park. The store is managed by Len and Sandy’s son, who
   worked his way through college selling Gold By The Inch at
   swap meets. His store should easily sell more than $500,000 of
   Gold By The Inch in its first year.
     The Booming Business of Business Start-up
            Boot Camps
     As the prices of franchises climbed out of many people’s
    reach, a number of entrepreneurs came forward to fill that gap
   with business start-up seminars, often marketed as ‘‘boot camps.”’
    Essentially, the participant receives the same training and edu-
    cation he would get if buying a franchise, usually in a five- to
   seven-day crash course, but then he is turned loose to start his
   own independent business based on what he has learned. He’s
   provided with a system of doing business, but no continuing
   parent-company relationship.
     One of the pioneers and leaders in this field is Laurence J.
    Pino, an attorney by training, an entrepreneur by experience, and,
    in recent years, a teacher by preference. Over a twenty-year pe-
    riod, Larry started and operated thirty-five different businesses,
    created and marketed The Desktop Lawyer software program,
   and has spoken to over 300,000 people in seminars in 125 dif-
    ferent cities. Along the way, he founded The Open University,
   based in Orlando, Florida, a stone’s throw from one of the ul-
    timate monuments to entrepreneurial guts and glory: Disney
   World and Epcot.
     The Open University currently sponsors start-up boot camps
    for two different types of white-collar businesses: the mortgage
    aftermarket business, discounting, buying, and brokering real es-
    tate mortgages, and the commercial

```

```
 specialized lenders and investors who buy or lend against re-
 ceivables. ;
   Each boot camp lasts a full week, and costs about $7,000 per
 person—a fat price for a seminar, but a cheap price for being
 put into a business. The camps are all conducted in Orlando by
 a team of Open University instructors, outside speakers who are
 successful in the businesses being taught, Larry Pino himself,
 and supplemented with reference manuals, audiocassettes, and
 videotapes.
   Most students learn about the two business opportunities by
 attending free or low-cost preview seminars put on in fifty to
 seventy cities a year by a traveling team of Open University
 instructors and enrollment representatives. In Orlando, there’s a
 team of “‘student counselors’? who talk with potential but un-
 convinced students by phone, answer their questions, help them
 with financing, and, overall, are responsible for two-thirds of the
 enrollment activity.
    “‘T decided to use my experience and contacts to find and
 select only the most exciting, unusual, little-known, and excep-
 tionally profitable home-based businesses,’ Larry explains,
 “and then assemble formal, standardized, quality training in
 every detail of starting and operating that business, on par with
 a mini-MBA and with a franchise. American colleges and uni-
 versities provide very good information, but it’s not always prac-
 tical or clear how to use it in a practical way in the real world.
 When I thought about forming a comparable institution of higher
 education, I wanted to make sure it would teach people how to
 become successful in their lives, and be accessible to just about
 anybody. That’s what we’ve done.”’
   Essentially, The Open University has two different, proven
 A-to-Z businesses that it has made easily learnable and dupli-
 catable by most people, and that is the asset they leverage, to
 the tune of millions of dollars a year. Larry Pino is certainly not
 alone in this approach. A quick flip through all the advertising
 in a current issue of Entrepreneur magazine, for example, will
 reveal over fifty different companies using this same nonfran-

     Network Marketing Is Another Way to Profit
        from the Power of Duplication
     The granddaddy of this often misunderstood, sometimes
   mocked, but nonetheless giant industry is the Amway Corpora-
    tion. Started in 1959 by two boyhood friends, Rich DeVos and
    Jay Van Andel, with a single product, an all-purpose cleaning
    liquid, the Amway Corporation has grown into a billion-dollar-
    a-year empire distributing hundreds of its own products; a sec-
    ondary catalog of brand-name merchandise, including clothing
    and appliances; MCI discount long-distance; and other services
    through a network of independent, mostly spare-time distributors
    radiating from the small-town home base of Ada, Michigan, to
    literally every nook and cranny of the world. In the process, it
    has endured a lengthy battle with the Federal Trade Commission
    over representations of its compensation plan and earnings prom-
    ises made to would-be distributors, and ultimately become the
    standard of stability and integrity for a very volatile industry. It
    has also made its founders, along with many distributors, very,
    very rich. A few years ago, at the beginning of his retirement
    from Amway, Rich DeVos cheerfully plunked down the price to
    buy the NBA team the Orlando Magic without blinking an eye.
    But it’s instructive to look underneath all this to the very foun-
    dation of Amway’s success through duplication.
     The Amway empire is based on a few profoundly basic
    premises. First, simple products anybody can understand, use
    personally, tell friends about, and easily demonstrate and that,
    in many cases, everybody uses, so the distributor need not
    ask a customer to buy something new, revolutionary, or unnec-
    essary, only to switch sources for products already regularly pur-
    chased and consumed. This made the retail side of the business

 of sales aptitude.
   Second, the adherence, almost exclusively, to word-of-mouth
 marketing, so that the monies customarily spent by household
 products, cosmetics, food, and service corporations on expensive
 mass media advertising could be redirected and used to gener-
 ously compensate the independent distributors.
   Third, the idea that each distributor would earn some money
 from selling products to consumers at retail, but make the big
 money through duplication, by showing another person how to
 get into the business, sell products, and duplicate all over again.
 Amway calls this process ‘‘sponsoring,’’ because it has many
 similarities to sponsoring someone in a 12-step recovery pro-
 gram, fraternal club, or association. A relatively complex struc-
 ture of ‘‘overrides,’’ tracked by a massive computer system,
 provides each distributor with compensation based on the activ-
 ity of each person he personally sponsors, and each person those
people sponsor, virtually ad infinitum. The idea is that each dis-
 tributor learns a set of simple skills, then duplicates those skills
 in each person he sponsors. When such a structure is subverted
 in one way or another, most commonly with a practice called
 ‘‘inventory loading,’’ it crosses the legal line from legitimate
 network marketing to an illegal pyramid scheme. There are sub-
 tle but important differences.
    How Gary Haiser Married Multilevel
     Marketing to an Offbeat Collection of
          Business Ideas
  There are always new, young, ambitious network-marketing
 companies starting up, but most fail for a variety of reasons. As
 of this writing, of 1,800 known network-marketing companies in
 America, fewer than 20 have survived for five years or longer.
 One of those is led by Gary Haiser, who considers himself a new
 breed of network marketing entrepreneur.
