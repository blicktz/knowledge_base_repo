 on the door of this possible opportunity,’’ Mark recalls, ‘‘even
 though it was a long shot. Many people stop short of exhausting
 every possible opportunity. I didn’t. So I called this doctor, con-
 vinced him to meet with me, went and told my story, and got
 him excited about my plan.’’ The doctor arranged meetings for
 Mark with celebrities and the doctor became an investor, pro-
 viding much-needed financial backing. Of the celebrities Mark
 met with, Joan Rivers was the one that stood out as right. And
 Joan bought into the new idea of building an entire marketing
 business around a celebrity.
   Joan Rivers is known for comedy, and for bouncing back
 from very difficult career and tragic personal life circumstances,
 but she is also known for style. She frequently makes media
 “Best Dressed’’ lists, and has an almost obsessive interest in
 fashion. Mark’s research revealed that jewelry was a top-selling
 product category in the home shopping medium. All of that came
 together in the decision to provide home shopping viewers with
 classic, quality jewelry at affordable prices with Joan as the
 line’s on-camera, sincerely enthusiastic spokesperson.
   It’s important to note that, exactly as Mark intended, Joan
 has been much more than just a celebrity spokesperson. I’m for-
 tunate to have Joan Rivers Products, Inc., as one of my clients,
 and I have seen firsthand how thoroughly involved Joan is with
 product selection, jewelry design, and decisions in every aspect
 of the business. The huge success of this enterprise has a great
 deal to do with their working together this way, so she can hon-
 estly talk about her products.
   Joan Rivers Products began in the spare bedroom of Mark’s
 house in Los Angeles. Mark and his wife had to learn the jewelry
 business from the ground up. And they had to risk: Joan invested
 only her persona and her time. So Mark and his wife tapped
 their savings and mortgaged their home to provide their share of
 the capital. They personally guaranteed credit lines. And, in Sep-
 tember 1990, Joan Rivers went on the air, on QVC, for the very
 first time, with thirty jewelry designs to present. No one had any
 idea what would happen.

   Mark says, ‘‘but more than enough reason to break out the cham-
    pagne that night. QVC had never successfully sold costume jew-
    elry before. There can be only a few things in life sweeter than
    the moment when a nerve-shattering risk like this one pays off
    in such a big way.”’
     Mark and Joan have since sold as much as $6 million worth
    of jewelry in one eight-hour period and, in total, well over
   $100 million worth of jewelry. New products, new catalogs, and
    a new series of self-improvement seminars, books, cassettes,
    and an infomercial are all on the horizon. I’ve been privi-
    leged to work with Joan and Mark on the development of these
    ‘*You Deserve to Be Happy!’” seminars and self-help materials.
    (‘‘You Deserve to Be Happy!’’ is based on Joan’s own experi-
    ences in recovering from grief and adversity, creating career,
    business, and personal breakthroughs, and achieving happiness
    and peace of mind.)
     As I worked with Joan on this new product, it was interesting
    to see that many of the principles for happiness and success that
    she believes in and uses parallel those Mark has used to create
    this business in the first place. For example, Joan tells people to
    ‘*break the rules’’ in order to achieve great things—Mark broke
    a whole book full of rules about how you start a new business.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #36:
        YOU MUST FIND WAYS TO USE THE POWER
           OF TELEVISION. IT IS THE MOST
        POWERFUL FORCE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY.
      It is arguable that no other media have greater influence,
    impact, and power than television. A single appearance on a talk
   show puts an author’s book on the bestseller list. A politician’s
    career is made or destroyed. You cannot ignore the growing
    power of television, so isn’t it incumbent on you to find a way
    to use it to your advantage?

   Now, What About the Really High-Tech
   Opportunities? Information Superhighway or
         Super Hype-Way?
   Publishers and marketers are in a mad scramble to find ways
 to profit from the much-publicized explosion of the so-called
 information superhighway. A considerable amount of advertising
 and direct marketing is being attempted, with varying levels of
 success, via the on-line services, CompuServe, Prodigy, and
 America OnLine. Of even greater interest to the entrepreneurs I
 deal with most is the vast network of independent computer bul-
 letin boards and the enormous linked network of people on the
 Internet. One consultant described this to me as an opportunity
 to do the equivalent of printing and mailing and delivering a
 million sales letters at the push of a button at no cost.
   Quite frankly, it ain’t that simple.
   For example, readers who use computer bulletin boards will
 immediately be familiar with what these folks call “‘flaming.”’
 When someone inappropriately delivers unwanted advertising,
 everybody blasts them back with negative messages, and broad-
 casts their displeasure to other users of that bulletin board or
 service. This is sort of like having a few thousand people you’ ve
 sent sales letters out to all show up on your doorstep as an
 angry mob.
   I confess that I am computer-inept. I grudgingly use one as
 a word processor, and travel with a laptop I use in the same way.
 But I do not have a phone modem, I don’t use any of the on-
 line services, my eyes glaze over at computerspeak, and I have
 to force myself to learn about new opportunities where the com-
 puter stands between me and access. The truth is that I dislike
 computers so much that if we had a gun at home we’d be getting
 new computers at least once a week.
   Fortunately, I have a consulting colleague who is my oppo-
 site in this regard, and who has been making a very detailed
 study of all this for some time. Ken McCarthy spent several

    also a savvy, successful direct marketer, so I trust his opinions.
    I asked him to provide a brief contribution to this book about
    what we are calling ‘‘on-line marketing,’’ and here it is:
       With all the hype surrounding this entire area of opportu-
        nity, getting straight answers isn’t easy, and most of the
       practically accessible marketing opportunities are only
        visible on the horizon, not yet here. But you’ll need time
        to prepare yourself to take advantage of them, so I'll
       make some suggestions about that.
         Everything that is currently available in hard form—
        print, audio, video, and interactive disk—will be available
       on demand through the personal computer. For example,
      _a prospect will be able to dial in and see your demonstra-
        tion video with the same ease they now call an 800 num-
       ber to hear your recorded message. That’s where we’re
      headed.
        There will be instant on-line delivery of advertising,
      much of it on request, of actual purchased information,
       and extensive on-line ordering. I would emphasize that
       those who are going to profit the most from these new
       Opportunities are going to be the people who’ve mastered
       good, old-fashioned selling skills and can translate them
        into any media.
        To prepare and stay in step, there are five things you
       can do right now:
        1. If you don’t already have one, get a personal computer
        and a modem.
       2. Join one or more of the major computer on-line
        services—Prodigy, CompuServe, or America OnLine
       —and begin to familiarize yourself with the on-line
        environment.
        3. Learn how to use E-mail, and start including your
        E-mail address in your ads and business communica-

```

```
     phone, the fax, and ‘‘snail mail’’. for routine messages.
    4. Subscribe to Boardwatch Magazine and seriously con-
      sider attending one BBSCON, the annual gathering of
     computer bulletin board operators. You can learn more
     about the reality of the information highway and make
     more useful contacts by attending this one conference
     than from a year of reading and study.
    5. Above all else, start making friends with the technol-
     ogy and the people who understand it. It’s not neces-
      sary to become a computer expert to profit from new
     technology any more than it is necessary to know how
      to make your own ink to be a successful copywriter,
      but you do have to have reliable people you can work
     with and who will steer you in the right direction.
     What’s the payoff for all this effort?
     Every time a new media has emerged, the marketers
    who figured out how to make it work first enjoyed tre-
    mendous, once-in-a-lifetime, windfall profits. It happened
    with radio. With broadcast television. With cable, info-
    mercials, and TV home shopping. It will happen with
    computer bulletin boards, too.
      It’s already beginning in a few niche markets.
     Take Paolo Pignatelli, for example. He’s the proprie-
    tor of The Corner Store, a company based in Connecticut
    that specializes in selling software. In 1993 he had sales
    of over $1 million without spending a nickel on advertis-
    ing. His method of promotion is simple: He makes him-
   self available to answer software questions on
    CompuServe. He ran his last traditional print ad in 1992
    and has never looked back.
   HOW A FLORIST HAS SALES BLOOMING AT OVER
           $100,000 A WEEK! —ON-LINE
    Bill Tobin and Peter MacMurray of PC Flowers have

         clever on-line marketing. Using Prodigy as base,
        their ‘‘order it online’’ florist service became the tenth
       largest retailer in the 25,000 FTD system in its first five
       months in business. They now do well over $100,000
       worth of business per week, and have started a second
        business, PC Balloons.
        One of the ways they keep in touch with their cus-
       tomers, by the way, is with a newsletter that offers
       flower-care tips and arrangement suggestions. It’s
       delivered every month electronically—no printing or
       postage costs!
        These pioneer-examples will suggest obvious opportu-
        nities and applications to many people who read this
       chapter. And, by the very nature of a rapidly emerging
       technological environment, we’ll all be behind by the
       time this is published. Entrepreneurs, small business own-
        ers, and big companies will all find many ways to profit
        in these ways. It is here, and it is coming, that’s not open
        to question. The only question is how soon you’ll be
       involved.
      Three of the Best High-Tech Marketing Tools That
              I Do Understand!
      Okay, so I’m behind the times with computers. Ken and
    some of my other friends are dragging me, kicking and scream-
    ing, onto this superhighway thing, so don’t worry about me. In
    the meantime, there are three readily available, semi-high-tech
    marketing tools that I do understand that you should know about:
     1. The simple but incredibly powerful ‘‘free recorded message.”’
     Here’s a marketing insider’s secret: The offer of a free re-
     corded message in an ad or sales letter, either as the means
      of response or an optional means of response, can increase
      response by as much as 500 percent. The theory I have to
      explain this has to do with nonthreatening first contact. Many

   end is going to ‘‘sell ’em.’’ But if that person knows he’s
   calling and getting more information from a recorded mes-
   sage, he’s safe. The free recorded message also allows you,
   in some cases, to run smaller ads—you wait to deliver much
   of your message in the recording, only to those interested
  enough to call and get it, rather than paying money to deliver
   it to everybody.
    There are other advantages, too. Such a message lets you
   deliver your message in a warm, friendly, reassuring voice,
   with enthusiasm and inflection. If you like, the message can
   be recorded in more than one voice, include testimonials, and
   even utilize sound effects. If you use a celebrity in your mar-
   keting, the message could be done in the celebrity’s voice.
   The listener can’t skim; he either listens or he doesn’t. Most
   services handling these calls for you can track and tell you
  how many calls you get, how many hang-ups at one minute,
   at one and a half minutes, at two minutes, etc., so you can
  make adjustments to the length and content of your message.
  The services will take calls to hear your message twenty-four
   hours a day, seven days a week, and they have multiple-line
   capability, so callers do not get busy signals. Most can do
  name and address data capture for you. And it’s all relatively
   inexpensive.
    At the conclusion of such a message, you can refer the
   listener back to calling your regular office number, or you
   can use voice prompts to let him leave his name, address,
  phone, even credit card numbers to order or request literature
   electronically, or you can give the caller the option of in-
   stantly switching from the recording to a live person by push-
   ing a button.
   . Fax-on-demand. Let’s say you have twenty different products,
  each requiring a four-page sales letter. You can create twenty |
  fax-on-demand numbered ‘‘boxes,’’ and put those twenty
   sales letters on file in them. Then anybody with a fax machine
   can call your number, enter the code number for the product
   that interests them, enter their fax number, and instantly re-

```
     using this as a means of making a variety of technical support
     information available to their customers, conveniently, on de-
     mand. But I believe there will be more and more marketers
      finding ways to use fax-on-demand.
         . Broadcast fax. With broadcast fax, you can OORT have the
     same fax sent and simultaneously delivered to 10 or 10,000
      different fax machines anywhere in the country. However, my
      limited experience warns against using broadcast fax on an
      unsolicited basis. Junk fax is such an annoyance to recipients
      that they often fight back by faxing you 100 blank pages, for
     example, or complaining to regulatory agencies. But if people
     give you their permission, then broadcast fax is fast and ef-
      ficient, and has the impact of delivering by Federal Express
      but costs pennies instead of dollars. For example, a group of
     VIP subscribers to my newsletter have furnished their fax
     numbers and asked to receive special bulletins and offers by
      fax. If I’m putting on a seminar, I can fax the invitational
     brochure to those people.
       Last year, one of my clients had a new product to intro-
     duce to their customers, and they needed some fast cash flow
     with nominal investment. We devised this strategy: A cheap
     one-page sales letter was sent to all the customers, briefly
     describing the benefits of the new product, and offering them
     advance notice and a discount offer by fax, but they had to
      call and ask for it. The response to the mailing was about 3
     percent; the order rate from those then faxed an eight-page
      sales letter was 90 percent!
      I experiment with and use technology, but am careful to
    avoid being seduced by it. The smartest marketers and entrepre-
    neurs wili devote a carefully determined amount of time, energy,
    and money to learning about and testing each new technology-
    driven media and opportunity as it comes along.

 HOW TO PRINT AS MUCH MONEY
   AS YOU WANT, LEGALLY:
  THE INCREDIBLE WEALTH-
   PRODUCING SECRET OF
  INFORMATION PRODUCTS
  here is one type of product that is the perfect product for
  direct marketing and for mail-order. Fortunately, it is a prod-
 uct anybody can learn to create, inexpensively develop, manu-
 facture, control, and exploit.
     I Print My Own Money Every Day
  As you hopefully know, making your own money on the
 copy machine in your office or the printing press at your buddy’s
 quick-print shop is illegal. The U.S. government is pretty firm
 on the idea that they should be the only ones allowed to print
 up more money any time they need some.
  You can, however, do the next best thing, legally: Turn or-
 dinary paper into information products people will pay for. What
 is an information product? It can be a book, like this one, or a
 manual in a three-ring notebook, or a spiral-bound book, or a
 simple report, copied on a photocopier and stapled in the corner.
 Or audiocassettes, videocassettes, software disks, or any com-
