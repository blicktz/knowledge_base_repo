##### CHAPTER 12

### Why Micro-Commitments

## Matter

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

 It is fairly obvious that those who know you will be more likely to respond to an offer than someone who has never heard of you before. The same is true of your social media audience. They see so many messages in a day from people they don’t know, connect with, or care about that they completely ignore. They don’t have time for nonsense or to figure out why they should buy from you. After all, that’s not their job. It’s yours.
 Before you go for the sale, start from a position of value with your target market. First, let them know why you are a good match for their needs, why you are an expert in your field, and why they should pay attention to what you have to say. They will care because you are leading with messaging that is all about them.
 And that’s all they care about.

#### The Year of the Blog

###### Each year the media declares it is the “Year of the Blog.” When researched, we found articles spanning back to 2004. This is so misguided.
 Some of the titles:

###### • 2004: “The Eyes of the Nation: The Internet; Year of the Blog? Web
 Diarists Are Now Official Members of Convention Press Corps”
 • 2005: The Daily Whim: “Another Year of the Blog”
 • 2012: Non-Profits, Year of the Blog. Here’s Why You Can’t Afford to
 Wait Any Longer
 • 2015: Blogging Isn’t Dead. But Old-School Blogging Is Definitely
 Dying.[1]

 • 2019: 8 Reasons Why You Still Need to Blog[4]

 A blog is just a channel. It is your content in a digital medium. You still need to have effective messaging in order to get a high ROI. Remember, for every channel, your customers and prospects are the ones holding the remote control. Do not give them a reason to hit the mute button.
 What is true now is that your social media marketing efforts will crash and burn if you don’t offer content as part of the equation. And there are many reasons to develop great content.

 How to Draw in Leads with Your Blog Great SEO (search engine optimization), aka how people can find your blog, can no longer be manipulated by using tricks of the past. Internet “experts” used to teach cheat methods of using thousands of hidden pages or meta tags. Trying this will get you in trouble with the biggest search engines and cause you to lose time and money.
 At one point, German car manufacturer BMW was blacklisted by the search giant Google. Google’s top rule is that companies should design websites for users and not search engines. BMW admittedly used “doorway pages” in order to boost its web traffic. For this offense, the car manufacturing giant saw its top-ranking numbers dive drastically to a zero ranking.
 When it comes to ranking higher on Google for content, some of the things they are looking for include:

 •  Click-through rates. Once people come to your site, do they click
 around? Do they engage with your content in any way?


-----

###### Tactic: Offer links in your blog posts, and ask for comments and questions at the end of the post.
 • Scroll rate. Do your visitors go below the fold, below what they see
 on their first screen, when they visit your site? Tactic: Break paragraphs and images up on your blogs so they are only partially visible on the top third of your web page. Entice your viewer to scroll down to see what else is on the page.
 • Time on page. How long do they spend engaging with content on your
 page? Tactic: Include multimedia resources, such as audio files to listen to or videos to watch that support your blog content.
 • Bounce rate. (Obvious sign for Google that your stuff stinks.) This is
 if someone comes to your page and immediately leaves. Tactic: Make sure your ads match what viewers will see on the landing page you are inviting them to visit. Speak directly to viewers, letting them know that this page was meant for them.
 • Spelling and grammar. Proofing does matter! Google is scanning for
 content churned out by robots by checking the grammar and spelling to make sure it is good. Tactic: Make proofing part of your blog strategy. And do yourself a favor … have it be someone else. We are never good at seeing our own mistakes. We have a proofreader contracted and someone on staff, too, but if you don’t produce enough content for that to make sense, use a freelancing resource or site like Grammarly or ProWritingAid to get your content checked.

 While those are Google’s goals, your goal in writing content should go beyond simply “ranking high.” Writing a blog establishes trust and authority in your niche. You are the expert sharing content, securing you as the leader in your industry. It gives a chance for your prospects to get to know you before being asked to buy anything. And it can introduce them to concepts and frameworks that lead into sales down the road.
 Plus, if you encourage commenting on your blogs, those comments create social proof for others to see folks who agree with your thought leadership. This alone goes a long way in building trust with your tribe.
 So, a blog? Yup, it’s not optional. It is the core foundation of an effective direct-response social media marketing strategy.

###### To turn marketing into revenue, engage your audience in content that is useful before you start to sell. Use your content to build trust, bring attention to a problem, agitate the problem, and then sell your solution. This works much better than agitating first, which more closely describes Thanksgiving dinners with an ex-boyfriend’s family, and not how you want to market on social media. Creating a content plan is not difficult if you first set some goals, stick to a schedule, and commit to it throughout the year.

#### Set Goals

###### With an integrated content plan, setting goals for what is to be sold requires a specific and detailed approach. It is important to begin with a clear vision of your desired outcome, then create content that supports it.
 Do you want to fill a workshop or seminar? Encourage prospects to schedule a sales conversation? Book your catering orders? Decide first your overall goal for your content. In this step, also determine the date the sale request will take place and any incentives you will offer to drive the sale home.
 We use our blog (https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/) to offer value to our audience, establish ourselves as experts and authorities in the marketplace, share case studies to build trust, and to get more leads for our business.
 Our blog and daily emails are both the first and final step of a lot of our prospect requests. They come in through reading the blog, stay on our list for a few weeks, months, or even years, and then make a purchase of one of our courses or join our Coaching.
 Some of my most popular blog topics were all of the how-to variety:

 1. “The Social Media Cash Machine Landing Page Template”:
 https://powerfulprofessionals.com/?s=Cash+machine+ 2. “582,825 Facebook Fans and Counting.” https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/ 3. “One Strategy Snarky Tea Is Using to Close More Sales This
 Weekend”: https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/ 4. “How to Quickly Grow Your Audience & Sales … in Just Four
 Steps”: https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/

###### 5. “How to Create an Endless Supply of Free Leads from Facebook and
 LinkedIn”: https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/

 After you develop your goals, create a schedule and stick to it. Whether it’s once a day or once a week, consistency and commitment are key. Create your schedule based on what you can stick to in order to build your audience and generate those all-important raving fans.

#### Creating an Effective Blog

###### To blog in a way that is most effective and will give you the best end result, begin with the end in mind.
 First, think of a blog as the editorial in your media channel. This is your owned media. You control it, and you can use it any way you like, no matter how big or small your audience is.
 This is where you can appropriately express your opinions on a subject matter as they might affect your target audience. Content should focus on your prospects’ interests and pains, to zero in on what they find important. The following are steps to creating an effective blog.

 Create a Blog Brand Voice A blog should have an overall tone or theme, or be presented in one person’s voice. Focus your brand around your Unique Selling Proposition to reinforce why you are different from everyone else and how you can help solve your prospects’ pain.
 Do not spend time trying to be everything to everyone. That will not create raving fans or turn traffic into buyers. Align yourself with a specific message that reaches a specific market.
 All of my blogs are in my voice and true to self … meaning I mention my love of marketing, God, wine, family, and occasionally coffee. It isn’t stuffy or formal. And while the tone may not be for everyone, I am not trying to be for everyone. Just my people—those who get me and are drawn to me.
 Side note … being authentic is not only more effective, but it is easier. When you always tell the truth, you don’t have to try and remember what


-----

###### you said. Be clear who you are marketing to and who your messaging is for, and be yourself while talking to them.
 Create an editorial calendar to plan topics that are complementary to your overall sales goals and communications strategies. Entice the reader of each blog post with a sneak peek into next week’s blog topic. Make sure to stick to your schedule and post consistently.
 After you have established your goal, move to the next step and write your piece.

 Create a Theme Related to Your Sales Topic For example, look at magazines. Many have a monthly theme. A sports magazine might have a preview of March Madness in its February issue. That February issue has lots of other things in it, but it has a whole bunch of material related to college basketball.
 In order to achieve your ultimate goal of a sale (or many sales), your role will shift to one of publisher and content provider while your prospect gets to know you.
 When I wanted to sell tickets to an event focused on customer retention, I developed a monthly theme around this topic: “Why Customer Retention and Growth Marketing Is Important to the Success of Your Business.”

 Create Weekly Subtopics That Fit Each Monthly Theme Your next step is to develop four subtopics that relate back to the overall theme of your monthly topic. Each week will focus on a different aspect of your overall theme, and all will lead toward week four (or day four, if you conduct this for four days in a row) when you will make the offer to your audience with a call to action. This weekly content planning will ensure fresh, relevant content is always being added to keep readers interested and engaged up until the point of sale. Like two of my favorite TV series, Billions and Blacklist, each episode leads into the next. Here, too, each blog will lead to the finale of the item you are going to sell.
 For our series example, the four subtopics I chose were:

 • Your customers are 66% more likely to buy from you than
 noncustomers.
 • There are no costs in selling to your current customers.


-----

###### • Those who currently give you money should not be treated the same
 as those who don’t.
 • How do you thank your customers each year?

 Develop Supporting Content One of the first things to do before writing any content is to make sure you do some research. Take a look at Quora, LinkedIn Answers, Yahoo! Answers, Answerthepublic.com, or other similar Q&A networks where you can find lots of people asking questions that relate to your specific industry. Identify their frustrations, objections, and pain points to address in your content creation. Bonus: You will get the exact copy that people use when describing their pain points. This is usually quite different than the way those in your industry refer to it.
 Researching these questions may create some ideas and directions for content. Also, take a close look at the links to content within the answers to these questions. Follow these links to see what others in your industry are doing with their content online. (Spying can be fun and profitable! Just keep those dang binoculars hidden.)
 You may also want to set up and conduct a survey, or call your existing customers and prospective customers to find out what needs are unmet. When you begin to write your content, keep those unmet needs in mind. Use the information you collect to create a veritable library of remarkable content that is designed to help your customers get what they can’t get anywhere else. Storytelling, testimonials, and providing something of value that meets people’s needs should all be included in your content.
 Each post can be anywhere from 350 to 2,000 words. The length should depend on how long it takes to fully get your point across. I have found my shorter blogs perform better with email list opt-ins and driving calls to action, but the same isn’t true for some of our clients. Test what works best for your specific market, and be very wary of anyone who tries to tell you there is one end-all-be-all for every market.

 Write Social Media Posts Once you have your content written, use this content as the source for your social media posts for the month. Engage your social network in an ongoing


-----

###### conversation focused around your topic theme on LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other networks.
 This way, all of your content is created with your sales strategy in mind. All of your posts and articles are about walking your prospect toward the sale.
 You can use the same three-line post method used to promote your Juicy Carrot (see page 102) for promoting your blog.

 Automate Publication On-time and consistent delivery is an essential part of making the plan work.
 To ensure this, schedule all content in advance. The last thing you want is to have a blog post or social media deadline sneak up on you with no idea of what content you’ll need. You can use a service like TweetDeck or HootSuite to pre-program all your content on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Schedule your blog posts and emails ahead of time in your application as well.
 For blogs, you should post new, relevant content at least once or twice a week. Your readers should also know the day you typically post, and keep to that schedule. Alert readers via email about any new posts on your blog and promote these posts in your social media network.
 We use a project management software called “Basecamp” to manage our blogging process. Our procedure looks like this:

 1. We map out our content a month ahead of time in a set content planning meeting held each month. 2. I write the weekly blog post when I batch our emails and social
 media posts for the month. 3. Our internal and external proofreaders review the piece. 4. It is then given to the designer who formats and places it on the
 website. 5. Then another staff person sends out an email with a link to the blog
 post. 6. I create several social media posts that link back to the blog and
 share it a few times during the week.


-----

###### Whether it is just you on the team—as was my case for a long time—or you have a full team in place, scheduling time and being consistent are key to multiplying the results from your blog.

 Publish Content This is when it starts to become fun. Launch your content and start to analyze the results. A/B test different times of day to send messages and post content, different subject lines to get your emails opened, etc. Tweak your remaining content appropriately.
 Ask yourself if your content is useful to customers before publishing. While your goal is the sale, the process of getting there includes being useful to your audience.

 “Youtility is marketing so useful, people would pay for it. It’s a necessity for all businesses now, forced to compete for attention, not just against other companies selling the same stuff but also against everyone and everything. In this hyper-competitive era, you don’t break through the clutter by shouting the loudest, you get noticed by being truly and inherently useful.”

 —Jay Baer, author of Youtility: Why Smart Marketing Is About Help Not Hype (Portfolio, 2013)

#### How to Run a Micro-Commitment Campaign

###### 1. Develop blog content that would appeal to your target market. 2. Develop a “Juicy Carrot,” giving your target market something of
 value, such as a free report, ebook, video series, etc. (For a step-by- step “how to” on creating a Lead Magnet, visit www.NoBSSocialMediaBook.com.) 3. For at least two weeks, run your blog content and lead magnet to
 your perfect prospects, targeting your list and followers. 4. When you start to run your main offer, focus on the warm leads you
 have created:
 • Followers
 • Website traffic (retargeting using Website Custom Audience)
