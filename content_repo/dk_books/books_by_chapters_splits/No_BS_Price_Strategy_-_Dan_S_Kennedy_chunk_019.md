deliver. So, as soon as you truly disconnect price and product in your own mind, the easier you’ll
find it to make a lot more money; the more successful you’ll be in selling up, to the affluent; the less
competition will matter.

**This is easier said here than done. You have been firmly conditioned ever since entering**
whatever field you are in that a profound link exists, that there is a very, very, very short chain
between product and price and price and product. Yet all around you there is abundant evidence of
the error of your conditioned belief. Consider something as utterly commoditized as a head of
iceberg lettuce. Surely there’s no price elasticity in this lump of vegetation! In the area where I live,
I can buy a head of lettuce at a Giant Eagle supermarket—where I have a choice of “organic” and
ordinary at two different prices, or a third choice (shredded, in a bag), for yet a different price. Just
down the road, I can buy it at a small, independent, presented as fresh-from-farm grocery, for yet a
different price. Five miles or so, in summer, I have choices from a roadside stand where I can buy it
direct from the farmers. Close by, I can go to a Whole Foods store and find different choices at
different prices. Not here, but where my daughter lives, the farm-fresh head of lettuce will be
delivered to her home along with other produce, by pre-arranged, regular, weekly delivery or by email or phone order anytime—at yet another, different price. I can also go out for dinner and get
half a head of iceberg lettuce with blue cheese crumbles, dressing, and bacon served as a wedgesalad, and pay varying prices—all multiples by the ounce vs. buying at the grocery and making my
own salad—depending on which restaurant I choose. Geez, there are a lot of different prices for
lettuce.

The exact same thing is true for ice cream. I invite you to take a look at a business I’m deeply
involved in developing as I’m completing this book, that delivers farm-fresh, homemade ice cream
by air, in freezer chests, to consumers all over America, from the Idaho farm and dairy, at
[ReedsDairy.com. You have, of course, ample opportunity to get vanilla ice cream at widely varying](http://reedsdairy.com/)
prices close to home—the grocery, the convenience store, a Baskin & Robbins, a Dairy Queen, a
Cold Stone Creamery. But you can’t get _this_ ice cream anywhere but
[ReedAndKennedyIceCream.com.](http://reedandkennedyicecream.com/)

The conditioned belief in price-product/product-price link is utterly discredited B.S., yet most
businesspeople cling to it and are dominated and controlled by it as if their deepest religious belief.
That thinking is very much in your way.

## The Three Best Chain-Cutters

The product-price chain is best cut clean by …

1. Who is buying the product.
2. Who is selling the product.
3. The context in which the product is being sold.

Good news: you can control all three, to your advantage, if you will.

-----

## 1: The “Who Is Buying” Matters a Lot

I’ve addressed one variance-of-who in great depth and detail in my book No B.S. Marketing to the
_Affluent Different people buy the same product or service at different prices because of who they_
are, rather than what the product is. My example above, about being seen at the office with a
thermos of coffee or a cup from Starbucks, is as good an example as any. The up-and-coming,
ambitious midlevel executive at many kinds of companies dare not be seen with a thermos or a 7-11
cup. Because I sell “success” and must be a demonstration of my “product,” I never arrive at a hotel
where I’ll be speaking to a group via an airport shuttle or cab, even if there’s a free shuttle direct
from the private air terminal I fly into, or it’s a five-minute ride; I dare not be seen in anything but
luxury sedan or limo with driver. I know a lot of people who swear they’ve never set foot in a
Walmart store—including, famously at the time, Senator and then-presidential-candidate John
Kerry’s wife. Why? Because for them it’s inappropriate to be there. For some, unimaginable. Even
though Walmart likely carries the very same Kleenex[®] and light bulbs bought for their homes
elsewhere at double Walmart’s prices.

I sell professional services B2B. My clients range from small business owners to CEOs of billiondollar companies. They are all very much aware there are many Walmart-like options to me, at
dramatically lower fees, not to mention easier to work with, yet they hire me and I have no shortage
of repeat clients and eager, patiently waiting new ones. This has less to do with what I do than who
they are, and how they perceive themselves and their businesses.

**Timing + Who also matters. Parents spend considerably more money on their first baby and**
child than on #2 and #3, so price is automatically separated furthest from product if you are selling
to them while she is pregnant with and they are raising #1 than if you’re there for #3. The star
athlete is much more unfettered in his spending right after signing his giant new contract and
pocketing a fat signing bonus than after ten years in the league, negotiating what his agent has
cautioned him will be his last deal. A person diagnosed with a disease who has a “self-help”
mindset will spend more on books, CDs, online information, multiple expert opinions, and
alternative health products in the first six months immediately following diagnosis than in the
ensuing six years. A corporation’s spending fluctuates over time in response to many factors, both
internal and external; crisis or opportunity. When in a spending mood, the corporation may de-link
product from price in order to get immediate rather than delayed delivery, a higher level of expertise
from the vendor, or a need to make some sort of visible demonstration. The price BP was willing to
spend for top Google[®] search engine placement leapt up dramatically immediately after the oil spill
vs. before. The product: search engine optimization and placement did not change one iota, but the
price BP was willing to pay for it changed overnight.

Profiting from changes in your chosen Who’s can occur at any time, as often as your own open
mind, ingenuity, and willingness to change permits. Profiting from changes in Timing + Who
requires more alertness, agility, and at times, a willingness to be predatory.

## 2: The “Who Is Selling” May Matter as Much or More Than the “Who Is Buying”

With many things, what I call “leadership position” is very powerful. People prefer the trendy,
talked-about restaurant because it is trendy and talked about—to the extent that their prices and
others’ prices are made irrelevant. In financial services, for most investors, normal levels of anxiety
have been exacerbated in most recent years by the wipe-out of wealth in the markets and by
government-chicanery (as with Bear Stearns, AIG, GM, etc.), bank failures, and the recession; so
“who can I trust?” now has far more caché than “how much can I make?” for many. Thus
reputation, evidence of stability, actual cash reserves, and leadership position have been made more
valuable as assets in competition than they were several years before. A friend of mine who is one
of the top New York Life agents in the entire country, Sidney Halpern, has regaled me with the
anecdotal stories and financial facts demonstrating a massive stampede of money from other
companies, from maturing bank CDs, from hither and yon to annuities at New York Life precisely
because it is New York Life. Price/yield often is not even asked about; comparison shopping is a
non-issue.

To be fair about this, leadership position does not matter nearly as much to people in their 20s and
30s as it does those in their 50s and 60s, or when extreme greed is used as the main basis for the
sale, or when an entire product category is new. It is not a universally powerful factor. When it isn’t,
some other “Who Is Selling” factor often takes precedence.

The subject of making yourself THE “go-to guy” (or go-to company) in whatever field you’re in
is far too complex to tackle here. It is not the focus of this book. It is part and parcel of much of my
other work, which you can sample via the invitation on page 234. Here, suffice to identify it as one
of the top three factors in cutting the chain linking price to product and product to price.

If you combine #1 and #2, you can separate price from product by otherwise unimaginable
distance. Just a few paragraphs before, I said this about my business:

_I sell professional services B2B. My clients range from small business owners to_
_CEOs of billion-dollar companies. They are all very much aware there are many_
_Walmart-like options to me, at dramatically lower fees, not to mention easier to work_
_with, yet they hire me and I have no shortage of repeat clients and eager, patiently_
_waiting new ones. This has less to do with what I do than who they are, and how_
_they perceive themselves and their businesses._

But that only told half the story. The other half is that who I am, and who they believe I am,
greatly impacts price. They seek me out to craft advertising and marketing strategies and write copy
for their advertising and agree to de-link my fees from any normal and customary modes of pricing
or definitions of work product (such as hourly, by page, by item on a menu, i.e., 4-page letter costs
$x, full-page ad costs $y) because of who I am. I am, for example, known as a specialist in certain
things; in fact, as _the specialist in certain things. I have, for example, longstanding working_
relationships with prominent, respected caché clients. I am a celebrated, prolific author on the same
subjects in which I work. I have an established, on-going, somewhat paternal relationship with
about 25,000 business owners and leaders who read my monthly newsletters as well as my books,
attend conferences where I am featured speaker and, there, a celebrity typically signing autographs
and taking pictures for hours. It is from this “base” that 70% or so of my private clients ascend. I
could go on. All these things factor in to me being my clients “who of choice” to such degree that I
am de-linked from price.

Before you excuse yourself as unable to create such positioning, I remind you that I am entirely
self-taught and un-credentialed, entirely self-positioned and promoted, in a highly competitive field,
and went from start to very high fees and high demand in under ten years. While I am very hopeful
I’ll never be called upon to prove it, I could replicate that journey now in under three years. So
could you. In any field.

## 3: The Context in Which What You Are Selling Is Being Sold Matters

The difference in price between a face cream sold at Walgreen’s and a face cream sold in the home
by a Mary Kay or BeautiControl consultant or a face cream sold at a cosmetic counter in Saks or
Nieman’s or a face cream sold in an exclusive boutique in Beverly Hills or Paris is very
disproportionate to the difference in the product’s ingredients. The price is governed by the
expectations of the consumer largely based on where they are buying it, perhaps brand, and the
expertise of the salesperson. Not the product.

I have done a lot of work as a marketing strategist and copywriter in the skin care and cosmetics
industry for more than 25 years; I have even controlled a brand and had private label cosmetics and
“non-surgical face lift” products manufactured for a company I owned a big stake in. The truth of
this industry is that there are only a few ingredients for which claims regarding reduction in the
appearance of aging, collagen production, and healing can be legally made, so every company uses
the exact same ingredients. The differences are slight, in ratio, strength, and different added
ingredients that bring “story value” but have negligible if any real affect on efficacy. Further, a
number of different, very differently priced brands are made in the same factory with exactly the
same formulas—the only difference being the context in which they are sold, and price.

Consider selling in the home, face to face, vs. selling at retail or online. For a number of years,
smoke detectors were sold alone—for about $99.00 to $199.00 each—or within the context of
complete fire protection systems also incorporating heat detectors, at $3,000.00 to $5,000.00 per
home. Moved to the shelf at Home Depot or Walmart, the very same smoke detector is $9.00 to
$19.00. Water filtration systems have experienced the same death of price. Encyclopedias were once
bound books sold in homes for $800.00 or so; go online and see what it currently requires to buy
into unlimited use of Encyclopedia Britannica. Or use Wikipedia for free.

If we move any of the lower-priced automobiles—say Kia or Hyundai—out of their own
dealerships with dedicated sales forces into Costco and Sam’s Clubs, with a buy-it-yourself system,
what happens to price? It will drop considerably. But, if we take a guy adept at demonstrating a
magical cooking or cleaning appliance out of a booth in the tents at county fairs and set him up in a
Costco or Sam’s Club, we can raise the price and sell just as many units per number of people
viewing the demo.

Some years back, when I was doing a lot of work with the chiropractic profession, it was the
norm for the doctor to deliver his “report of findings” or case presentation to new patients in his
tiny, messy little work office or even a corner of a treatment room. I took a doctor averaging
$2,000.00 for treatment programs to averaging $5,000.00 overnight with no suppression of closing
percentage (buyers per presentation) and no change whatsoever in patients or his presentation but
for two “little” game-changers: one, we created a “closing room”—a well-appointed, very
professional looking office that stayed neat and was comfortably furnished, with a built-in light box
to show x-rays and a screen to show video; two, we took him out of his casual shirts and put him in
a blue shirt, conservative tie, and white doctor’s jacket. A 250% price increase with no change to the
product.

One other thing about the context in which the selling takes place: Sales Choreography[®]. This is
a term coined by Sydney Barrows, my co-author of the book Uncensored Sales Strategies, which I
cannot urge you enough to get and read, thinking about it the whole time as price-product chain
cutter. In brief, this refers to the physicality of the sale. As a simple example, again in professional
practices, we’ve documented differences in acceptance of treatment programs, price resistance, and
referrals produced by no variable other than patients being called out to and summoned from the
reception room to doorway to the back versus a staff person coming out into the reception room, to
the person, inviting them back, and walking with them to the door.

CONTEXT means: the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, in
terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed. Within that definition, everything matters.
The cleanliness of the hands and fingernails of the staff person at the front office counter matter.
And in aggregate, everything forms the basis for the customer’s assessment, at conscious and
subconscious levels, and that affects price. In her way-back- when, former-life business as the
infamous Mayflower Madam, in its time the classiest, highest-priced escort service in New York,
Sydney learned that having phones answered by a mature woman with a British accent made higher
prices acceptable than if the phone answered by a young New York girl with that New York accent

and, at times, chewing gum in her mouth. You might think of this as contextual congruency—
everything, i.e., every little thing, fitting together to reinforce an idea supportive of a certain price.

## CHAPTER 11

 The Power of Pre-Determination

 Dan Kennedy

**I bought Dean Martin’s Rolls-Royce Corniche II convertible. See page 102.**

**It was made for Dean. He had her from 1986 to 1991, briefly and barely driven by one person**
after that, then to a car museum, where she rested until I acquired her in 2010. When I got her, she
had just 19,000 miles. She runs like a new auto from the showroom. Just as gorgeous. I didn’t go
looking for her, but when I found her by accident, that was that. I have always had a strong affinity
to Dean.

Had I been looking for any pre-owned, mint condition 1986 Rolls convertible, I imagine I could
have acquired one at a lower price. If I would have been happy with any age Rolls convertible or
any 80s luxury convertible, certainly I could have acquired one at a much lower price. In this case,
price didn’t matter and could not be negotiated. There was but one, and I was pre-determined to buy
her. Some price would have deterred me, I suppose, but not the one I paid nor would have one five
thousand or ten thousand dollars higher.
