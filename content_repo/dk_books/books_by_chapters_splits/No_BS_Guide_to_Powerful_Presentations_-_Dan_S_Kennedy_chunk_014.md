###### pulled several tear-jerking, heart-wrenching, and amazing testimonial letters from his pocket and said, “I’ve got letters like these filling drawers at home and so do you, and it’s important to remember that they have much more to do with the people who wrote them than with me or you.” Profoundly true. Jim, quoting from the Bible, taught “If you cast the finest seeds onto hard, infertile ground, nothing will grow. But even the most ordinary seeds cast upon rich, soft, open, fertile ground can grow bountiful crops.”
 In short, it is the pre-existing conditions of the audience you assemble, appear in front of, or otherwise deliver your presentation to that can, and often does, control your success or disappointing results—not the presentation itself and not your delivery of it.
 Even comedians know this to be true. The late, brilliant comedian Shelley Berman often opened his live shows by instructing the audience on this fact. He explained that he was performing well-tested and proven funny material just as he had for many other audiences. He told them: “Whether you have a hell of a good time here tonight or not depends a lot more on you than on me.”
 With all this in mind, there are four very pragmatic, pre-existing condition criteria for you to consider and exercise as much control as possible over for the audiences you deliver your presentations to:

 1. CAN they buy? 2. SHOULD they buy? 3. WILL they buy? 4. CAN and WILL they buy HERE and NOW?

 For our purposes here, “buy” can mean “buy,” or it can mean some other desired response to and outcome from your presentation.
 CAN refers mostly to financial ability and secondly to their degree of autonomy in making a decision. If there is a corporate committee, board, accountant, attorney, spouse, etc., with significant influence over the decision to be made, and they are not in the audience right along with your prime target, your presentation is sabotaged. If they have insufficient cash or credit to meet your price for your service or product, the most powerful presentation will fail.

###### So, here’s a trade secret from “get rich in real estate” multiday boot camps, where training and coaching programs priced from $10,000.00 to $40,000.00 are sold by speakers: Early in the event, a presentation is given about what to say when calling one’s credit card companies to get the credit limits on the cards raised, ostensibly to create some working capital for real estate deals. But in harsh reality, this is to enhance the audience members’ ability to buy the subsequently offered programs. The attendees are encouraged, on a break in the seminar, to jump on their phones, call their credit card companies, and see what they can get done. You may have a squeamish reaction to this. But it shines a spotlight on how vital the financial ability to buy is. In this case, the wiliest of these marketers not only tries to exert some control over ability to buy—by the media used to attract the people in the first place, the ad messages, and a weeding-out process—but then also tries to better ensure ability to buy during the event where the sales presentation will take place. I am not necessarily suggesting some specific equivalent of this tactic for your business, but I wouldn’t rule it out either. I am emphasizing that an audience needs ability to buy to be a receptive, worthwhile audience.
 SHOULD refers to appropriateness. In my personal opinion, as an example, selling the above-described get-rich-in-real-estate training to truly poor people with hardly any resources, putting them into debt that is significant for them by buying it, and knowing most lack the basic business and negotiating capability required is predatory and dumb business to boot. It is better for that same training be sold to people who are sales professionals in varied fields, owners of home repair and contracting companies, doctors, accountants, and others with a foundational level of capability and the financial wherewithal to support some level of risk. Whatever business you are in, there are people very appropriate for it, marginally appropriate for it, and arguably, mostly inappropriate for it. Granted that every person has the right to judge their own appropriateness. Granted that a super-human salesperson can sell ice makers to Eskimos. But why engage in such difficult work, of questionable value to your audiences and customers or clients and potentially harmful to your own self-esteem, when there are highly appropriate customers for what you have to offer?
 WILL refers to pre-existing propensity and known, regular behavior. This involves knowing what else they’ve bought and where, when, and how


-----

###### they bought it, to sync with and avoid acting in opposition to their normal or conditioned behavior. Let me give you an example. I helped launch a now fabulously successful and rather unique software company called Infusionsoft, which has the only fully integrated CRM, online, and offline multistep marketing and no-fail follow-up system for small business. Initially, it was sold from the stage by speakers at my company’s member events. It’s a complex sale, and early on, it was a largely unknown and unproven product. It involved not only a significant financial commitment but also significant disruption to whatever cobbled-together systems the business owner was already using. I have just described something not naturally conducive to a one-step, direct sale by a speaker delivering a presentation to an audience. However, my audiences were well-trained to buy from speakers in such settings and to buy at relatively expensive price points. My audiences were well-conditioned to pay close attention to presentations that obviously had the selling of something as their objective because a reason to be at my company’s events was discovery of new and improved business-building tools. The same speaker delivering the same presentation about Infusionsoft would have fallen flat with most other audiences and certainly with an audience assembled on their own of randomly chosen small-business owners. Willingness to buy matters a lot. It segues to . . .
 CAN AND WILL THEY BUY—HERE AND NOW, which refers to the time, place, and circumstances in which your presentation is being delivered as well as to the habitual or conditioned behavior of the audience.
 Earlier, Dustin mentioned his dislike of Las Vegas as a site for seminars despite its attractiveness as a destination. I share his position. I believe an audience’s ability to buy now can easily be compromised by gambling losses or other impulse expenditures. And I believe an audience’s willingness to buy now can be compromised by being out all night, being hung over, suffering throbbing headaches, and sitting there in a fog. As an aside, for multiday events, I prefer cities with less competition for attention and right-sized, somewhat isolated hotels where my audience takes the property over, stays on-site on breaks and after hours, and convenes together in the restaurant and bar rather than scattering to the four winds.
 Different people have different propensity for decisive action or purchasing. Entrepreneurs, for example, tend to make immediate decisions


-----

###### more readily than do corporate executives. Salespeople tend to make immediate decisions more readily than engineers or school teachers. Obviously, as noted in the Infusionsoft example, people experienced in buying from group presentations are more likely to buy from group presentations than are virgins with no such experience.
 So, with all this said, it is incumbent on you not to simply assemble any audience or to accept opportunities to deliver your presentation to any audience but to be strategic and thoughtful about the makeup of the audience. Only by exerting control over pre-existing conditions of your audience can you fully profit from a great presentation.

### The Power of Webinars and Online
 Media How to Speak While You Sleep

###### by Dustin Mathews

 or a long time, your only real use of a powerful presentation was for manual labor. Speakers traveled from city to city to deliver their presentations at others’ organized meetings, at churches, at hotel ballrooms, and at convention centers—basically, anywhere we

# Fcould find, assemble, borrow, or rent an audience. P.T. Barnum did

###### it, lecturing on The Art of Money-Getting. Mark Twain did it. Today, authors, professional speakers, promoters of various kinds of opportunities, reality TV stars, corporate trainers, and consultants still hit the road regularly, taking their presentation to audiences. At the local level, doctors, lawyers, accountants, investment advisors, and other professionals and business owners go out to civic groups, business groups, and luncheons; advertise and promote their own seminars and introductory classes; and maybe go into companies and do lunch-and-learn sessions for the host’s employees, always taking their presentations to audiences. But what if you could bring the audience to the presentation?


-----

###### We remain fans of the “old school” way. It works. Most of the time, it works better than anything done online with the same presentation by any tangible measurement: sales made, customers obtained, appointments booked. There is, however, a very significant expense of money and time involved when going around the country or the globe, or even just around your city, to deliver your presentation. There are also people who will never set foot in a free preview seminar, come to an “executive briefing,” or otherwise place themselves in an audience, but these same people may be great prospects for your business.
 This is where online media becomes so valuable. If you have a presentation that works, perfected with live audiences in the flesh, there’s a 99% likelihood it can be made to work as-is or adapted as a webinar—short for “seminar delivered on the web.” This lets you speak while you sleep. It lets you reach audiences you wouldn’t in person. It multiplies the value of your presentation. It allows an audience of one to watch your presentation whenever he wants to, on demand, just like he watches movies, TV shows, and/or replays of sports games. It allows you to push a group to watch it at a designated date and time, just as you would if traveling to Boston and holding a meeting in a hotel. It is versatile, efficient, and can be entirely automated.
 At Speaking Empire, we’ve helped thousands of people convert effective presentations into effective webinars and build marketing systems around them. This includes people who want to reach a national or global audience like authors, consultants, and thought leaders. It also includes the dentist, cosmetic dentist, cosmetic surgeon, investment advisor, real estate agent, school owner, interior designer, etc., etc., operating a business in a local market, who can benefit by having a presentation they do to small groups invited into their offices or to civic or business club groups available to any size audience—even an audience of one, online, on demand, in a self-operating theater. As we did with The Speaking Formula, we developed The Ultimate Webinar Formula (see Figure 12.1).

##### 1: Traffic


-----

###### Just as you or somebody has to invite and motivate people to come to a meeting at a physical location, you have to invite and motivate your audience to come and watch your webinar. There is certainly no shortage of ways to do this. There is email, social media, offline direct mail, ads in magazines, even radio and TV, and opportunities to get other people to promote your webinar for you, for affiliate commissions or for reciprocity of some kind or just because they know you and like you.

 FIGURE 12.1: The Ultimate Webinar Formula

 If you’d like to see a sample email sequence we’ve used for our own business and get more information about bringing audiences to your webinar, go to http://NoBSPresentations.com/traffic for free resources.

##### 2: Registration

###### It’s rare that you want to set up a webinar for direct, on-demand access without some sort of registration. People are used to registering for seminars and classes, so there’s very little resistance. You want this list for follow-up. Figure 12.2 on page 101 shows an example of one of our registration pages.
 As you can see, there’s a headline, a photo of the presenter, and a little sales copy about what you would learn if watching. You’ll also see a


-----

###### countdown timer. In Chapter 5 about our Irresistible Offer Architecture®, we talked about deadlines and urgency. The clock here is literally ticking! It’s counting down to the moment when this webinar will not be available any longer.

##### 3: Build Excitement

###### First of all, you don’t want to take enthusiasm or followthrough on people’s part for granted. That’s why there’s sales copy on the registration page. If there’s a delay between registration and the webinar (or a live webcast), there should be a series of follow-up messages by email and text, possibly voice broadcast, and possibly mail to build their interest in the upcoming webinar. Much of the time, getting a person registered is the start of a process—not the end of it. We have to sell people who’ve registered on showing up! The good news is, just as with the playing and replaying of the webinar itself, all this communication can be automated.

 FIGURE 12.2: Registration Page


-----

##### 4: The Presentation

###### This is the easy part. You just have to deliver your Signature Presentation that you perfected based on the advice in this book and (ideally) battle- tested with live audiences. It can be a completely prerecorded video, or it can be done live as a webcast. If it is to work while you sleep, it’s obviously prerecorded. There are things you can do with a webinar that are impractical for presentations in physical locations, especially if traveling to various sites to deliver your presentation, and Dan Kennedy discusses those in the next chapter.
 One important difference is that you can’t stampede people to the back of the room to sign up for or buy whatever you are offering. Instead, you will most likely want to direct your audience to what we call a “Hot List” page. This is a separate website you’ll direct them to or have them click to,


-----

###### where they opt-in again, then move on to enrolling or ordering or scheduling with you. We split the requesting of their contact information and then their purchase information into two opt-in pages, like the ones in Figures 12.3 and 12.4 on page 103, so that when someone leaves without completing the purchase, we know to follow up with them in a certain way. This is our new list of hot prospects. At times, you might add as an option or even substitute calling your business or an outsourced call center.

 FIGURE 12.3: Hot List Opt-In Page

 FIGURE 12.4: Opt-In Page


-----

##### 5: Follow Up . . . Like Crazy!

###### Your webinar becomes the center of a lot of follow-up marketing activity. It creates different lists of people for different kinds of follow-up marketing:

 • Everyone that buys or takes whatever substitute action you’re asking
 for
 • Everyone on the Hot List who doesn’t complete their purchase or
 action
 • Everyone who watched the webinar but did not go to the Hot List
 • Everyone who registered but did not attend/watch the webinar

 In addition to your own direct follow-up by email, text, mail, and phone, you can do automated retargeting with Facebook and Google. A follow-up message can literally follow the person around. For more details about this, check out the information and resources at http://NoBSPresentations.com/ perfectaudience.

##### 6: Stick and Overdeliver

###### Whether you use your webinar to sell a product or get people to request free information or schedule an appointment, you want to immediately email


-----

###### them a confirmation of what they did, verification of what is coming to them, and, if it was a purchase, a receipt. In some cases, this can also be used to offer an immediate upsell to a deluxe or bigger version of what they just bought or to set up a second, sequential sale. Now, more than ever, people want instant gratification, so even if your product is physical (not digital) and will be shipped to them, or they’ve made an appointment for a phone consultation or to come into your office, showroom, or store some time from now, it’s good to give them something extra they can consume immediately. This might be an educational video, a downloadable information item, a membership site—something.
 People who buy something from Speaking Empire online also get offline touches—an old-fashioned, handwritten thankyou note and some kind of printed CD or DVD deliverable. One reason for this is that our typical customer is a boomer or senior, but regardless, I want them to have a great experience, and nothing is quite like getting and opening a package.
 When you move your effective presentation online and wrap these six results boosters around it, you leverage that presentation to a much greater extent than you could by just packing your duffel bag with a change of clothes and laptop loaded with your PowerPoint slides and playing Have Speech, Will Travel.
