## CHAPTER 17

 How Do You Set Your Prices?

 Jason Marrs

**This is what it all gets down to: Picking a formula.**

**Setting a price.**

As you walk through your store, page through your company’s catalog, examine your own
website or “mystery shop” your salespeople, you realize there are dozens if not hundreds of price
decisions that have been made. Were they made according to a formula? Do they reflect a
conscious, thoughtful price strategy? Do they successfully land in the sweet spot, just at or below
the highest price a sufficient number of your customers will pay, but no lower? How do you know?
Have they been fairly tested? As you think about the prices you now charge, can you explain—and
defend—how you arrived at them?

As sad as it may seem, if you walk into most businesses in the world and ask their owners or
presidents how they set their prices, they’ll probably stare at you blankly, with a look in their eyes
that reminds you of that deer in headlights right before the truck plows over it. If they eventually
can enunciate their price-setting strategy, it will almost certainly fall into one of five very
rudimentary, common categories.

-----

## One: WAG

**The most rudimentary method for setting prices is called WAG, which stands for Wild-Assed**
**Guess. Just like the name sounds, you make a guess as to what the price should be based on**
intuition with no formal testing, solid information, or history to guide you. You just decide you are
going to sell something. You guess at what people will be able and willing to pay. You pull a price
out of your butt and hope for the best. If you’re lucky, you establish prices you’re able to get and
that don’t bankrupt you. But you have no idea of how much available profit you are letting slip by.
More often than not, this is a financial train wreck waiting to happen.

## How Most Business Owners Price

1. WAG
2. Industry Norm
3. Clients Dictate
4. Cost Plus
5. Target Return

-----

## Two: Industry Norm

**The most prevalent form of pricing is by industry norm.** _Hey, what’s everybody else around here_
_doing—I guess I should do that. Many industries even have published norms and prices or pricing_
formulas and it is frowned upon by peers or organized groups within the industry if you deviate
from them, especially if you deviate up. This is particularly pervasive in professional businesses
such as, but not limited to, healthcare (where my wife and I have our main business) and law. But it
exists in many other places. That is why I’m going to spend a bit of time talking about it here.

Industry norm pricing ignores the costs and profitability of those companies being copied. It
assumes they know what they are doing and that you can copy it blindly yet profitably. This, a
dangerous assumption, since, give or take, only 5% of the business owners in any population
prosper while 95% either struggle or fail. The number one cause of a business’s slide from success
to failure to extinction over time is erosion of profit margin thanks to failed price strategy—not the
advent of new competition, inability to get capital, or other reasons popularly believed in or offered
as excuses. To make matters worse, most often business owners using this model will take a look
around and pick a price in the middle. They believe that a price in the middle is safe. It is not. A
price in the middle does not have any competitive advantage. It destines you to mediocrity. You will
probably have too small a profit to improve, innovate, grow, expand, or withstand trouble. You’ll be
better and stronger than the worst and the poorest, but inferior and weaker than the best and the
strongest.

If you are following industry norms it tells me that you have no clue about what your customers
really value. If you do not understand that, then it is only a matter of time before someone like me
comes into your market. I will identify the value drivers of your clientele and take customers away
from you so fast that it will make your head spin, usually charging them significantly higher prices
to boot.

One way or another, everyone wants to be a part of something special. Customers want
something they are proud of buying, of being a part of. Anything that takes you away from
exceptionalism in favor of middle-of-road mediocrity and sameness has to be very seriously
questioned, and that is exactly what industry norm pricing does.

Industry norms can be very intimidating. There can be illusion of law. But with the exception of
actual, verified laws enforced by regulatory agencies with teeth, you should only look at industry
norms as interesting information to be considered along with a variety of other information,
including, most importantly, that obtained from real customers, not peers and self-appointed
industry authorities. I have always made a sport out of breaking industry norms, and push my clients
and coaching-program members to do the same. Our rule is: Just because other business owners
have agreed to participate in a collective form of mental illness doesn’t mean you must too.

Industry norm pricing can be a starting point, but it can never be permitted to box you in. Keep in
mind, too, that a number of widely accepted industry norm price strategies you see today were
radical, revolutionary, and reviled in their infancy. This includes all-inclusive vacations at on-land
resorts, fractional ownership in real estate and other categories, fixed price and pre-paid treatment
programs in chiropractic, BOGO in retail, seat license fees in sports stadiums, and many more. This
means that the radical, revolutionary and, by peers, reviled price strategy you invent today may
eventually become a commonly accepted norm in your industry.

## Three: Client-Dictated Pricing

**Client-dictated pricing is also very common. Occasionally, it’s the clever basis for a good**
business—think auctions, where the owner is profiting from commission on gross regardless of net
profit to sellers, or by providing its own fixed price services to sellers, like eBay. But in most
businesses, it’s just plain dumb. Driven by the myth that the customer is always right, the business
owner sets out to survey customers about the price they would pay for a given item or service. From
that data they set a price. This ignores the fact there is a difference between any customer and the
right customer, obtained in the right place at the right time, and ignores the profound difference in
reactions to price depending on the salesmanship used in presenting the product and its virtues.
Surveying is basically price testing without sales presentation.

It is also against customers’ own self interest to tell you the maximum price they’d be willing to
pay. Let’s say I have a widget, and you really want my widget so much you’d pay $100.00 for it. If I
asked you, would you volunteer that? No. You want to maximize the amount of value you receive.
You will tell me a low-ball price with hopes of getting it. There is a big difference between what
people say they will do and what they actually do. Just because they say they will, or will not, do
something does not make it true. Humans are funny that way. They’ll tell you what they think you
want to hear or what is in their best interest a lot faster than they’ll tell you the truth. Often they
won’t even know the truth until they are in an actual, real situation.

You certainly do want to listen to your customers, obtain all the input and information you can
from them, and give it careful consideration. Surveys, focus groups, even casual conversation with
customers can be valuable. But putting people with no interest in your profits in charge of your
prices is a bridge too far.

## Four: Cost-Plus Pricing

Cost-plus pricing is a slightly more advanced way to set prices that is used by many successful
companies. It is an old and accepted, albeit antiquated, model for pricing. You can find it in
textbooks. If you ask your accountant for advice on setting your prices this is likely the method he’ll
trot out. To use cost-plus you must first determine all of your costs and then add your desired profit,
to arrive at price. In its defense, this is the first rational model we have discussed. It is the first to
even consider costs and profit.

While this is a significant improvement over WAG and client-dictated, there are still a lot of
problems with this model. The first problem is that it assumes that consumers take into account and
are affected by the costs of providing what you are selling or the profit you make—tiny or huge.

They do not care about your costs. Just because you have spent a boat-load of money on
something does not mean they will have a drop of interest in buying it. What you spent developing
it or spend delivering does not equate to value for the consumer. Your costs are totally meaningless
to the market. If it costs you $200,000.00 to build a viable all-electric car, that won’t help persuade
consumers they should pay you $201,000.00, $250,000.00, $300,000.00 or even $100,000.00 for it.
That’s your problem, buddy. They don’t care about your profits either. If you can make that car for
$500.00, they’ll still happily pay $25,000.00, maybe $40,000.00 for it. Whether you profit big,
profit small, or lose money isn’t their problem either. They care about the value they receive, period.
(Value broadly yet personally defined.)

Another example: you don’t take into account how far away from work the waitperson serving
you lives in deciding to tip nothing, 15%, 20%, or a generous, higher amount. But if Susie lives 30
miles away and Barb lives just down the street, it costs Susie a lot more to deliver service. Why
don’t you investigate this and tip appropriately? Because it has nothing to do with the value you
receive. You uncaring, selfish lout.

Cost-plus pricing is inherently flawed because it focuses on two things that have little or no
influence on what the customer will gladly pay: cost and profit.

The even bigger problem with cost-plus pricing is that it constricts how you think about price.
Cost plus forces you to focus on costs and not value. While it is designed to give you a profit, it
does nothing to maximize your ability to illustrate and collect the value you provide, nor to give you
the maximum possible profit. It limits you by its starting point. It pulls your attention away from the
customer to the bucket of bolts bought and used to make the object being sold.

Beyond all that, it also does not really account for costs in the correct way. It totally ignores
volume. As you know costs tend to fluctuate depending on volume produced or purchased from
vendors. In most cases, volume lowers cost. But in some businesses, there’s a curve, when
delivering more volume suddenly demands big investment in equipment, inventory, staff, adds
borrowing costs for capital, and actually raises costs for some period of time. Having a cost-plus
method of pricing ignores that reality. It also ignores the affect price may have on volume. It’s also
easy to leave out opportunity costs—if we sell a lot of X, are we selling less of Y, even though Y is
much more profitable to sell than X? If so, the loss from Y has to be amortized and accounted for as
a cost added to X. Finally, it’s easy to miss differential costs of the same product or service
dispensed by different people, or by different means. For example, many businesses in the child
health industry provide homebased services. Very few of their owners charge a different rate for a
home visit. They will charge the same fee if they go to the client’s home as they would for an office
visit. They ignore the costs of driving to an appointment. They miss the fact that there are
opportunity costs of being in your car and not in the office. It never occurs to them that when in the
office they can see clients back to back with no down time. When going to the home they lose a
minimum of 15 minutes on each side of the appointment that could have been used to see another
client. Without counting wear and tear on the car and other problems that home visits create,
ignoring this cost would steal a minimum of $125.00 per visit from our top line, in our business, and
the bottom line cost would be even more significant.

If you are going to use or at least consider cost plus numbers, you’d better be very careful to
calculate true cost.

-----

## Five: Target Return

The fifth basic pricing model is target return. This model looks at a business and its prices like an
investment. Target Return requires you to set a target return on capital invested into a venture. So if
you invest $100.00 and you aim to collect $200.00 after expenses this would be a form of target
return. Simplistically, it would set price at $300.00. In reality, the time cost of money, and other
factors would affect that price and might make it $310.00 or $323.62 or some other number. While
it does move more focus to the profit side of the equation, it carries with it many of the same
problems that cost-plus pricing has. It can also ignore the realities of the market by being too
focused on a profit that may be unrealistic. Still, this is the set of numbers you want to very
carefully consider, with strong emphasis on return on investment.

This last model also best allows for incorporation of your costs of making the sale as well as costs
of goods and fulfillment. If you have an advertising and marketing budget of $50,000.00 a month,
and you average 1,000 transactions a month, you might divide and get $50.00 invested, that must be
added to the cost. If your ad budget attracts new customers but also brings past customers back, or
promotes a variety of products, assigning it in pieces to different products gets trickier.

Surprisingly, few business owners work backwards from the income they want to make per week,
month, year, etc., then looking at numbers of transactions that must occur, products that must be
sold, customers acquired, and therefore prices that must be charged to hit the income target. When
forced to do so, they quickly realize their price strategy can’t produce the income they want. Then
the work begins.

## Why Static Prices Are Impossible

Aside from not using an effective method to set their prices, most business owners tend to treat their
prices like Ron Popeil’s much-advertised rotisserie: they want to “set it and forget it.” This is
particularly true of those who use the WAG and industry norm models. If you are using those
methods, let me ask you, when is the last time you checked the prices of your competition? It’s been
awhile hasn’t it? I’d bet good money that you and most of your competition are ignoring the reality
around you while your profits are withering on the vine. Inflation and your costs are completely
indifferent to your lack of action. They move with or without you. That is why you can’t have static
prices even if you never change them. It does not matter if you keep the number the same, your
price still changes. That is because inflation is affecting the purchasing power of your dollar. Every
up-tic in inflation is a drop in your price. Of course that means for every up-tic in inflation your
costs are moving up and your profits are going down.

Considering the spending spree Washington has been on, you can expect future inflation to be
substantial. I don’t care what they tell you in the news; you can’t flood the market with dollars
without consequence. For you, profit margins, take-home profits, and the prices that produce them
are meaningless if they don’t fluctuate to compensate for changes in the true value of the dollars
being paid, and the costs of what you want to buy with those dollars.

## Objectives of a Particular Price Point

If you now realize that businesspeople don’t pay enough attention to how they set their prices, you
can only imagine how little attention they pay to the purpose of their prices. While price is merely
the dollar representation of the value you provide, its objective is always to make a profit. It could
be about taking a loss today in order to make a bigger profit tomorrow, but it is always about
making a profit. To take that a step further, the price point you pick aligns you with a particular
strategic objective.

Those who prefer to set high prices often use a pricing method called Skimming. It got its name
from milk. If you take milk straight from the cow and let it sit for a while, the cream will rise to the
top. The objective of price skimming is to serve those customers at the top because they are the ones
who are willing and able to pay a premium. They are the cream of the market.
