# CHAPTER 6

STRATEGY 6 REMEMBERING WHY YOU’RE
 THERE

## This is an embarrassing confession:

 One of the very first speaking engagements I ever had was for a client company at the opposite end of the country from my home. My compensation for speaking was to come solely from the sales of my books and audio learning programs to the audience; there was no fee being paid. Well, I went and spoke and I was a hit! The audience laughed uproariously, applauded enthusiastically, even gave me a standing ovation at the end. I was back on the plane, halfway home, having a celebratory drink when it dawned on me that I had completely forgotten about the products hidden under the podium. I had forgotten to give my commercial, forgotten to sell anything, even forgotten to bring the product back with me. I had forgotten why I was there!

 I have been sharing this confession for years, and every time I tell it, it gets knowing reaction, rueful looks, nodding of heads. I’ve gotten letters specifically about it from readers of previous editions of this book. It seems everybody has caught themselves forgetting why they were there, at one time or another.
 When the author of Think and Grow Rich Napoleon Hill wrote about “definiteness of purpose,” he was surely aiming his remarks at those of us involved in sales and marketing. Clarity of purpose is very valuable and very important in advertising, selling, negotiation, and communication. You need a clear, single objective.
 Many professional salespeople resist this idea and, as a result, never rise above mediocre performance levels. They argue that they have to be concerned with creating and sustaining goodwill, building rapport,

## developing a friendly relationship, gathering information, and a myriad of other things in addition to selling. Unfortunately, they use these other things as excuses for nonperformance, as camouflage for a real problem—such as the fear of asking for the order. Some salespeople muddle along as “professional visitors.”

# Dan Kennedy’s #5 No B.S. Truth About Selling

## A top performer in selling is always focused on selling. He or she takes this attitude, described by Zig Ziglar: you’ve got my money in
 your pocket and I’ve got your product in my briefcase, and I ain’t
 leaving until we make the exchange.
 Of course, all those other things are important. Gathering information. Building rapport. But they should support selling, not distract from it or delay it. The New Economy demands efficiency and productivity, punishes waste. Ultimately, the sales professional must judge his effectiveness by whether or not he sells . . . at every opportunity.
 One of the people I made a point of studying, to bolster my persuasive skills in general and my ability to sell to groups from the platform in specific, was Glenn W. Turner, the very controversial founder of Koscot, a cosmetics company, and Dare To Be Great, a self-improvement training company. The two companies together attracted an estimated 500,000 people in just three years to multi-level selling operations (after the fact ruled illegal pyramid selling operations)—largely through his remarkably powerful speeches. In his time, Glenn Turner was an international phenomenon, receiving immense media attention.
 Glenn Turner, by the way, has a speech impediment. He was then and still is pretty difficult to listen to. In his early days in selling, he even had

## trouble getting hired for straight commission to sell sewing machines door- to-door. Certainly, nobody would pick him as one of the most persuasive public speakers and salespeople of all time.
 But there’s a film of an old speech by Turner called “Challenge to America,” in which he is speaking to an audience of distributors and prospective distributors for one of his companies. He looks right at them and at the camera and says: “It’s a good thing I don’t have a hold of you cause I’d reach in and extract that check right out of your pocket.”
 I often think about that piece of film as I enter a “get the check” situation. Is that too tough for you? Is that high pressure? Only if it’s felt as such. If it seems coarse by today’s standards, that speaks more to your own uncertainty and timidity than to anything else. Most salespeople are far more sensitive than the sensibilities of the marketplace require.
 If you worry too much about peripheral issues—such as being liked, loved, or even respected, or if you “buy into” the other person’s problems too much, or if you are overly sensitive to the risk of being perceived as overbearing—you’ll have a lot of “friends” but not much money.
 That’s why I think that you’ve got to take the trendy sales training programs infused with healthy doses of sensitivity training and pop-psych- babble with a big, fat grain of salt. There’s non-manipulative selling, nonconfrontational selling, consultative selling, no-closing selling. Most of this seems to get translated to timidity in the field, and to quote Zig Ziglar again, “Timid salespeople have skinny kids.”
 Today, in teaching and in using Group Presentation Marketing, I often remind myself: “Remember why you’re there.” I don’t care how much they laugh or applaud; whether or not I get a standing ovation is of minor importance. What counts is the number of people who buy and the amount they buy. These are the real statistics, the real measurements of success.
 In fact, I’ll tell you a “secret” about speaking that very few speakers like to admit: It’s surprisingly easy to get an audience to laugh, to applaud, even to give a standing ovation. You can be a mediocre speaker and still engineer those results. So the speaker who takes great pride in “audience ratings” is either foolish or pretentious. In contrast, it’s a lot harder to get 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, even 90% of the people in an audience to reach into their pockets, pull out their hard-earned money, and spend it on your materials. To accomplish that, you have to deliver a greater quantity of better quality information with greater skill and charisma in order to get those results than

## you do just to get applause—and have a well structured sales presentation —and remember why you’re there.
 For 10 of the 30 years of my speaking career, I appeared on publicly promoted seminar programs with Zig Ziglar, and numerous celebrities in virtually every major U.S. and Canadian city, with several thousand people to as many as 35,000 in each audience. As the last speaker, I followed the last famous person, and usually had the 5:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. or 6:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M. time slot. The audience had been there since 7:00 A.M. or 8:00 A.M., sitting on hard bleachers or stadium seats in arenas. As I walked on stage, they were poised to leave. Yet, even under these challenging circumstances, I routinely sold $50,000.00 to $75,000.00 worth of my books and audio learning programs each time and every time. How? Because I was totally focused on one objective and one objective only: making sales. Every word, every story in my presentation had been carefully chosen and assembled to make sales. The only measurement of my success I was interested in or paid any attention to was the number of sales.
 The reason very few speakers ever become top performers in Group Presentation Marketing, why very few salespeople become high performers in their fields, is because they avoid putting themselves totally on the line for instant, measurable results. In the business of selling, the most significant sales are made after the seventh or eighth call-back to the customer or client. I say this has a lot more to do with the salesperson than with the customer. It is the salesperson’s reluctance to push for definite results—and risk an early ending to the possibility of a sale—that causes this statistic.
 Most salespeople like to make themselves feel good by having a lot of “almost persuaded” prospects they’re working on and calling back on. But not me. I’d much rather have a “no” than a “maybe.” I’d rather know where I stand as quickly as possible, so that I can move on to the next potentially productive use of my time. When somebody says to me, “Let me think about it,” I say:

 • Let’s think about it together, out loud. After all, two heads are better than one.

 • What, specifically, do you need time to think about?
 • When someone has to think over a decision like this, it usually means he or she doesn’t yet have enough information with which to

## make a decision. Let’s review what we do know to see what may be missing. I push to get on with it, right then. When selling my own services as a speaker or as a consultant, as quickly as possible, as early in the conversation as possible, I talk about my schedule and say, “Let’s see if I can even fit you in this month” or “Do you have a date in mind? Over half of mine for the rest of the year are already booked.” I’m “closing” in this way from the very start. The last 20 of my 30 years have been about “one-call closes,” on the phone, or at in-person meetings, of sales ranging from about $20,000.00 to $2-million. I really hate think-it-overs. And I do not accept the premise that they are necessary.
 Those who insist on thinking things over present to you just one more challenge: to determine whether or not you know why you’re there, and whether or not you’re strong enough to get what you came for. If you are clear on your purpose—for calling someone, meeting with someone, making a presentation—you’ll have a big competitive edge over most of the rest of the world.
