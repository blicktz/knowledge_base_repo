Then congratulations, you’re King. Until you’re not.

 Bottom dwelling is NOT the path to long term success.

 MISTAKE #9: THERE’S NO FOLLOW UP

 I see this all the time and—even though I know better than to invest any emotional energy into the exercise—it still drives

 me crazy.
 The wife and I decide to go out to eat. We always eat at a

 few tried and true establishments, but what the heck, let’s try someplace different.

 So we head into town and see a new restaurant has just

 opened up. It looks okay from the outside, the parking lot

-----

###### isn’t full, but it isn’t empty either, so we decide to give it a try.

 We go in, get seated, the waiter arrives and asks for drinks and then our order. Food arrives, it’s actually better than

 expected. There’s a nice dessert menu, followed by some coffee (equally good), and then the check, a tip, and out the

 door.

 Overall, a relatively pleasant, enjoyable experience from start to finish.

 That was our perception. But we’ll probably NEVER return.

 Why? Because they didn’t seem to even notice we even existed.

 Sure, all the basic functions of a restaurant were executed

 properly—wait staff, food service, cooking, accounting, and so forth.

 But they missed the ONE thing that could make or break their business.

 They put zero effort into doing everything they could to make sure of our return.

 There was no capture of name, address, even email.

 There was no offer of a bounce-back coupon to entice us to come back.

 They didn’t ask about our anniversary, our birthdays, children, friends, none of that.

 ZERO effort went into knowing us as anything but an ephemeral visitor out of the blue who showed up one night

 and then passed like a ship out to sea, never to been heard

 from or seen again.
 Tragic.

###### THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE

 When you truly know your WHO, you can magnetically attract

 all the clients, customers, and patients you can handle. And you don’t have to do this by slashing your prices, chasing

 after everyone in hopes of catching someone, or spending yourself into oblivion trying to imitate massive multinationals

 with marketing budgets greater than half the world’s GDP.
 You can’t afford to make any of these mistakes and you

 don’t have to—because it’s not about you, it’s about them.

 Knowing them and their needs inside and out and then meeting them exactly where they live with just what they’ve

 been looking for.
 Getting the right Message—via the right Media—to the right

 Market—it all starts with knowing your WHO.

###### CHAPTER 3
#### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ATTRACT
 INSTEAD OF CHASE?

-----

###### If you run a business, whether it’s behind the counter at a walk-in location or you’re sitting in your home

 office beside the phone, the worst feeling in the world is the same:

#### Silence.

###### Without a constant flow of leads and customers coming to

 your business, you’re doomed to fail.
 It doesn’t matter how good you are, how motivated you

 are, how wonderful your products / services are, none of that matters. The lifeblood of every business is LEADS and

 CUSTOMERS and the beauty of Magnetic Marketing
 is that

 you don’t have to suffer in silence any longer—nor do you have to experience the pain of chasing them down via the

 painful path of “cold calling.”
 Instead, you allow your SYSTEM to magnetically attract

 them to you—prequalified, prescreened, already interested in you and what you have to offer.

 And don’t let the word “SYSTEM” scare you. What you’ll

 discover in this book is simple to understand and straightforward to implement, even if you don’t have any kind

 of technology background.
 It’s all about NOT chasing customers anymore, it’s about

 ATTRACTING them instead by:

 Abandoning strategies that everyone else is using

 that just don’t work.

 Making MARKETING your business and your message

 your #1 priority.

-----

###### Focusing your marketing on the needs and dreams of

 the customers you want to magnetically attract.

 The difference can be dramatic, as you’ll see in these stories

 of business owners like you who switched from marketing like everyone else and instead took that first step to

 implementing Magnetic Marketing
principles for themselves.

#### “CHANGING MY MESSAGE CHANGED MY BUSINESS.”

###### Derek Emery
owns one of the largest independent used car buying services in the state of California, but it took him ten

 years to discover the secret that would exponentially grow his business. After embracing the principles of Magnetic

 Marketing
, Derek realized that people selling their cars were

 not just looking for a professional used car buying service, they were really looking for a bank.

 When he understood this, he completely revamped his USP accordingly: “Not only will we buy someone’s used car, but

 we will guarantee cash in hand in twenty minutes or less.”
 That small little USP tripled his business overnight. People

 started seeing his company as a quick way to acquire cash
—

 not just sell a car.
 With this knowledge, he was able to position his company

 as not just a source of power in the marketplace; he became the ONLY source of power in the marketplace. He was able to

 develop the right message to the right market, using the right

 multiple sources of media.

-----

###### Before Magnetic Marketing
, his company was buying and selling two hundred to three hundred cars a month. With the

 Magnetic Marketing
 changes, he is constantly buying and selling over one thousand cars a month. Most of the cars he is

 now buying now are the profitable cars. He no longer has to buy the “traditional junk car.”

 He was able to get the right customer, the right car, and

 the most amount of profit by implementing the principles of Magnetic Marketing
.

#### “BEING GREAT WAS NO BETTER THAN LOUSY WITHOUT PATIENTS
 TO PRESENT GREAT TO.”

###### Dr. Dustin Burleson
opened his dental practice in 2006 with the thinking that “you get your degree, do good work, and

 like the Field of Dreams, the patients will come
.”
 As he quickly discovered, that’s not how the real world

 works. For the first three years he grew his business through

 blood, sweat, and tears. But he soon felt stuck.
 Looking for ways to escape the hamster wheel and build a

 better business, Dr. Burleson stumbled upon a book I wrote that opened his eyes to the power of Magnetic Marketing
 .

 After consuming that book, he had a key revelation … he

 wasn’t in the business of being an orthodontist, he was actually in the business of MARKETING orthodontic services. If

 he didn’t devote dedicated time to creating a system to magnetically attract patients to his practice—he would never

 achieve the practice he had dreamed of.

-----

###### The cold hard truth is that it doesn’t matter how good you

 are. You could be the best lawyer, the best dentist, or the best orthodontist in the world. But if you can’t get the

 message out to the public, no one will ever get a chance to experience how wonderful you are.

 His practice has gone from four chairs in one small clinic to

 four locations with five doctors, and from one employee to thirty-five employees. He spends time with the local college

 giving real world entrepreneurial advice, and has even created his own coaching programs to help other

 orthodontists!

#### “MY BUSINESS CHANGED WHEN I STOPPED DOING WHAT EVERYONE
 ELSE WAS DOING.”

###### Dave Dee
was stuck in a job he hated, working long hours

 scraping by to support his family, while all the while he had

 dreams of becoming a professional magician. Like many small business owners working to create a career on the side, he

 was really good at what he did, but he knew nothing about marketing other than doing the same thing other magicians

 were doing
and hoping for referrals.
 His fledgling side business was working out as well as you

 might expect—he was only doing about three shows a month

 and these weren’t big corporate extravaganzas with big corporate checks. These were children’s birthday parties and

 even though he excelled in this, the inability to create any kind of regular, predictable stream of business meant he

-----

###### couldn’t generate anywhere near enough money to go off on his own with any assurance he could still pay the bills.

 Then without warning—he was fired from his day job. Already deep in debt, he grew frustrated and angry, knowing

 that something had to change and fast.

 Almost by chance, he attended a SUCCESS event of ten thousand people and encountered a message he’d never

 heard of before from the very last speaker of the day, me.
 The message was simple:

 STOP doing what everyone else is doing, trying to chase business using the same ads, the same tactics as all

 your competitors. Instead, leverage proven principles to magnetically attract the very best clients to you.

 Dave realized that this was the answer to finally living his dream of becoming a professional magician—he knew is his

 gut that Magnetic Marketing
was the key to the vault.
 On the very same day my program arrived, he literally

 locked himself in a room over Friday, Saturday and Sunday and went through the entire Magnetic Marketing System and

 Toolkit.

 Then, on Monday, he started implementing the customer attraction strategies.

 It was like a miracle. In less than ninety days, Dave went from doing three shows a month to averaging more than

 thirty shows a month! In his fourth month, he did fifty-seven

 shows!
 He was living the dream. Everything changed!

###### His wife was able to quit both of her jobs and he paid off all

 his credit card debt. He bought a new home, a new car, and finally had financial freedom for the first time in his entire life.

#### “WENT FROM STRUGGLING TO
 MASSIVE SUCCESS WITH LEAD
 GENERATION.”

###### Ben Glass
 is a personal injury attorney who (twenty years ago) had just left the comforts of a law firm to start his own

 practice. So he does what seems natural—look around at

 what other lawyers are doing and copy what they do. But nothing seemed to make the phone ring.

 He came across my best-selling training The Magnetic Marketing System and Toolkit (
I didn’t have a book like this at

 that time). The concept of lead generation marketing jumped out at him. He then understood that there was a simple

 process to get people interested in his business and a system

 for marketing directly to those people.
 He didn’t fully understand the power of magnetic marketing

 when he started, he just started following the system. But boy, did it pay off in spades.

 He now has one of the most successful practices in his area, where he went from struggling to get clients to a

 predictable system that delivers clients on a daily basis.

 Today, he is a father of nine, grandfather of two, an active soccer referee, and respected thought leader who continues

 to break the molds in his highly regulated industry.

 THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING...

-----

###### I’ll acknowledge, there’re so many people running around touting the next big thing that it’s become harder to know

 who to listen to and who to trust.
 As they say, the proof lies in the pudding.

 These stories represent just the tip of the iceberg

 representing literally thousands of lives changed for entrepreneurs and business owners of all shapes and sizes

 since the first version of
 Magnetic Marketing
 was released over twenty-five years ago.

 The difference to their businesses was dramatic—all because they made the shift from “Chasing Customers” to

 “Attracting Customers.”

 Even though some of the specific examples used have changed due to new forms of media emerging, the

 foundational principles remain solidly in place and continue to run like clockwork—attracting slam-dunk customers, patients,

 or clients to your business
.
 And the good news is that with the ever-expanding number

 of media options now available, it’s never been easier to put

 together a Magnetic Marketing
 system customized perfectly for YOU.

**Note:
 Now you might be saying to yourself, “But wait, my business is**
different … what if I am in the commodity business? I HAVE to price my
services lower than anyone else in order to get the business I need.”

First off, your business is NOT different. Every industry faces the pressure to
lower prices, as one of the easiest ways to differentiate yourself in the
marketplace is to announce yourself as the lowest priced option.

If this is the route you choose to follow, I wish you the best. But understand,
it’s only a matter of time before someone else emerges to go after your
customers with an even lower priced option. Then you’ll be forced to either

-----

lose those customers or instead compete in a downward spiral to oblivion. It’s
a race very few can win and almost never for long.

The beauty of Magnetic Marketing
lies in the way it sets YOU apart from the
competition in a way that’s focused on features/benefits you control—and
that make you a UNIQUE solution to the challenges your perfect customer
faces. In essence, you eliminate price as the key component in the buying...

...decision and in reality, most buyers place price lower than other factors to
be considered, such as convenience, quality, guarantee, and so on.

Magnetic Marketing
frees you from the danger of relying on pricing alone to
make the sale. Even in industries where there’s significant price pressure, it’s
almost dead certain that customers exist to pay you what your worth.

All you have to do is identify and magnetically attract them.

###### C
HAPTER 4
#### WHAT THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE

-----

###### Marketing is often viewed as a mysterious but

 necessary evil, as in “it’s definitely not the business,

 it’s something I have to soil myself with in order to make my business work.”

 You are here because you are willing to reconsider that

 entire paradigm. It makes you a rare bird soon to take flight

 way above all others.

 The need for more leads and more customers for lifeblood exists in businesses of all shapes and sizes, but few business

 owners ever develop formal, organized marketing systems to

 meet this need.

 Instead, they constantly seek out the one magic bullet that

 will solve this problem… SEO, pay-per-click, social media, TV, billboards, radio, print ads. They hope that someone will

 provide the answer.

 The biggest mistake made is they immediately focus on the

 media without having a plan or a system in mind first. They are often sold media and pour money into redoing all their

 websites or making new videos for them, into buying online

 traffic, into some “one thing” to change everything.

 I call these random and erratic acts of and disconnected

 investments in attempted marketing.
 You need to realize that most ad agencies and most media

 representatives have a great understanding and reliance

 upon of what’s called “image” or “institutional” advertising.

 It’s what I call Goodyear blimp advertising.

 When Goodyear flies a blimp over a stadium, they don’t have any illusion that at half-time of the football game, thirty
 five thousand people are going to jump up out of their seats

-----

###### and run out and buy snow tires. They don’t expect that to

 happen and it’s a good thing they don’t because obviously it doesn’t.

 What they’re hoping for and what they’re buying is that,

 over a long period of time, by these sports fans seeing the

 Goodyear blimp over and again, they connect it with this

 happy pleasant event and they have warm, nice, fuzzy feelings for Goodyear. Then, someday when they have to go

 buy a tire, all of that comes together in their mind and causes

 them to buy a Goodyear tire.

 I call that high-risk marketing. It just seems to me that

 there’s a straighter line to get from a person who needs tires to buying Goodyear tires than going through all of that

 rigmarole of building a blimp and hiring a pilot and finding a

 football game and flying a blimp over it.

 There is—and it’s called “Direct Marketing” or “Response- Driven Marketing” or—when integrated into a complete

 system of attracting and converting leads—“Magnetic

 Marketing
.”

 This approach is derived from what used to be called mail

 order.
 The discipline of the entire mail order industry—now the

 direct marketing industry—is that for every dollar invested

 there is a direct, typically fast and always measurable return

 of that dollar plus presumably some profit. You can boil it

 down to two very basic ideas:

 1. Spend $1.00 on marketing, get back $2.00 or

 $20.00, fast, that can be accurately tracked back to

-----

###### the initial $1.00 invested.

 2. Do NOT spend $1.00 on any marketing or advertising

 that does not directly and quickly bring back $2.00 or $20.00.

 Go back and reread these two steps. Make sure you fully

 grasp this life-changing principle. They should affect EVERY

 action you take from this point forward when it comes to marketing your business.

 It’s not new and it’s almost certain that you’ve seen, heard,

 read examples of it on television, radio, letters, and so forth

 for most if not all of your life. Maybe you have even

 participated in it, without knowing it.
 Most media people and most ad agency people have little

 or no understanding of that kind of advertising and

 marketing. Most even fear it because it is so accountable.

 To make this system work, however, the first thing you

 must understand in depth is WHO your customer is. Because even the best possible offer made to someone who is wholly

 unqualified, or wholly disinterested in it is not going to work.

 It will fall on deaf ears.

 Therefore, you’ve got to match your offers with precisely the right people.
