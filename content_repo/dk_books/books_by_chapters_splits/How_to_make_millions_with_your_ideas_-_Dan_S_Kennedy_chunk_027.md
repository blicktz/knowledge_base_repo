   Classified ad sections USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and
   major city newspapers (New York Times, Los Angeles Times)
    In one issue of the Sunday New York Times, I counted over 200
    different ads placed by manufacturers, importers, liquidators, in-
   ventors, and other sources of an incredible variety of products,
    all seeking distribution, marketing assistance, help with mail-
    order, salesforces, or quantity buyers. In that same issue, there
   were twenty “Want to Buy” ads from various marketers, export-
    ers, etc., looking for particular kinds of products. And, under
   “Business Connections,” another fifty ads including new inven-
    tions and products, businesses seeking investors, investors seeking
   new opportunities, advertising media offered at discounts, and
   much more. The diligent entrepreneur regularly reading the clas-
    sifieds from a dozen cities, plus USA Today and the Wall Street
   Journal, could find a true wealth of product sources and
    opportunities.

     Direct-Mail Campaigns for My Business?
    Better than half of all the business successes I’ve used as
  examples in this book are significantly dependent, some almost
  entirely dependent, on direct mail. I believe that the greatest of
  all favors an entrepreneur can do for himself is to learn how to
  effectively use direct mail to promote ideas, products, services,
  and businesses.
   The success of a direct-mail campaign is roughly 60 percent
  dependent on the list, and the offer-to-list’s known interests
  match; 30 percent dependent on the copy; and 10 percent de-
  pendent on format and appearance. The sales letter is the single
