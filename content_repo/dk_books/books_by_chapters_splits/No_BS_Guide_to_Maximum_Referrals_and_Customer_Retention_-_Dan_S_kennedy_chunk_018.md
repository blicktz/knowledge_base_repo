##### your top customers only. However, for an event designed with your top 10 referrers in mind, you should play the exclusivity card to the highest extent. All of your top referrers should know they are in the running for an exclusive event like a wine dinner, day of shopping, or extravagant spa experience. It should be clearly stated that you can only take 10 people— plus their invited guests. You know you’re getting it right when people call and are dying to know when your next spa day, expert speaker luncheon, or other exclusive event is, and when customers are asking how they can qualify to be invited.

#### Rule #3: Give Them Bragging Rights
##### In the world of business, Warren Buffett is a name you should know well. His investing prowess has landed him in the ranks of the world’s wealthiest people, with a net worth of $72.3 billion as of this writing. As the most successful investor of the 20th century, Buffett has done more than a few things right. A single share of his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has returned an astounding 2,850,000% since Buffett began buying up shares in the 1980s. In 2012 a charity auction to spend a few hours at lunch with Buffett with no questions off the table netted a record $3.5 million bid. Clearly, he has no problem attracting investors and high net-worth individuals who want to learn from him. His company welcomes over 40,000 people to Omaha each year for their shareholders’ event alone.
 Like many shareholder events, there is a presentation of results from the previous year and predictions of what’s next in the coming year. There are meetings and lunches and votes that must take place. What separates Buffett’s annual event from anything else like it is the unmistakable excitement and brag-worthiness of coming back home and telling your investor friends what you just did or learned at the Berkshire Hathaway meeting in Omaha last weekend. Buffett will ride into the auditorium on an authentic Wells Fargo stagecoach. He plays newspaper toss with shareholders, a game in which he is undefeated for ten years running. He allows his companies to display products and services on a trade show floor the size of three football fields. This is anything but an ordinary event. It’s something to talk about. It is a full-fledged bragging right.


-----

##### Bragging rights for your event might include meeting a nationally recognized or local celebrity hired to sign autographs and pose for pictures. It might include access to a restaurant or venue that is hard to reserve. Perhaps you bring people to a country club or yacht club that everyone knows of but few ever experience. Simply hiring an emcee who is adored by the community, like the local news anchor or meteorologist, makes fine fodder for Facebook and Twitter posts.

#### Rule #4: Recognize Your Star Referrers
##### This is an area most business owners are uncomfortable implementing. They find my recommendation to recognize their star referrers as “tacky” or “cheesy.” They ask me why they must give awards to grown adults. Obviously these people don’t watch the Oscars, Grammys, or MVP awards after a major sporting event. Everyone wants to be recognized, whether they admit it to you or not. The ones who say they don’t want the recognition will lie to you about other things. Often, they are the ones who want recognition the most.
 After saying a few opening remarks at your event and reminding everyone why you organized the event in the first place, you must instruct them to return at a specific time for raffle prize announcements and a few special awards. Then, recognize your top referrers with visible signs of your appreciation. Medals, trophies, plaques, and small but thoughtful gifts are not too much and certainly not as cheesy or tacky as you see them in your head. In fact, the number-one source of emotional and personal thank-you notes will come from those individuals who were recognized for their generosity toward your business. If people aren’t reminding you after your event that they’ve never seen a business like yours before, then you’re missing out on a critical opportunity to connect with your top referrers on a deeper level. Thank them and recognize them in front of your fans.

#### Rule #5: Set Clear Goals with the Right People on Board to Help
 You


-----

##### Two ways to hold an unsuccessful referral event are to enter into the task without clear goals and to assume you can do it all by yourself. I mentioned earlier that I don’t do events for my health. I have a private physician and a large, comfortable sailboat that help manage my health and blood pressure quite nicely, thank you. I do events to get more referrals. Period. We don’t schedule an event or set a budget for that event until we have decided on clear and exciting goals. You shouldn’t either.
 Sit down with your proposed event team and ask them how many new customers you think you could generate from an organized event. Consider all the facts and data you can gather about referral productivity in your business. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Guiliani was fond of saying “In God we trust. All others bring data.” Obviously, as you do events, you’ll accumulate data you can use to better plan and budget for the next event. The more you know, the better the results. It’s important to have your entire team on the same page and focused on the desired results, not just throwing a fabulous party!
 As a general rule of thumb, we can get about 10% to 15% of an audience to bring a friend to an event and have that referred, brought friend actually schedule a consultation for services with one of our brick-and- mortar pediatric dental or orthodontic clinics while they are at the event. More guests come, but take time to develop into new patients. If we want to get 50 new, immediate patient referrals, we develop an event for 500 people. If you don’t sit down and clearly articulate your goals with your team, you cannot expect them to execute the event successfully.

#### Demonstrate Your Work
##### One of the world’s most prolific and profound classical musicians, Mozart worked constantly and at a lightning pace, often writing a symphony for a gig he had next Thursday. Literally that fast. He wrote over 600 pieces and he did it in under half of a lifetime. At the age of five, he wrote his first composition. By six, he was on the first of several European “tours.” A child prodigy, he interacted with the prominent musicians of his day and started studying their works.


-----

##### This was the life of a composer in the mid-to-late 1700s. Go on tour, write feverishly, show your work to as many audiences as you can, and get patrons and raise funds for commissioned pieces. Mozart and his father didn’t wait for people to discover them. Instead, they took their show on the road. The results were outstanding. New aristocratic Europeans surfaced every week, providing new opportunities for Mozart to produce more work, generating considerable wealth for his family.
 How many business owners today would tirelessly commit to a two- year road show in a foreign country simply to provide opportunities to earn new business? What money is being left on the table for those businesses who fail to realize the power of event-based marketing? A significant sum and possibly much more.
 Mozart and his father knew if they sat alone in their study, writing the next great piece of music and waiting for it to be discovered, the world might have never known the genius of Mozart’s work. Who is waiting to discover the great things about your business and what are the odds they come knocking on your door demanding it from you? Find your opportunity today to invite more customers, patients, or donors to experience your work in a setting that encourages new business and repeat referrals. It’s not going to happen while you are alone, working in your study. You have to get out there and demonstrate what makes you different, why anyone should choose your business.
 The kinds of events I’ve been describing are your orchestrated opportunities to demonstrate to present customers and their referrals that you are important, creative, generous in appreciation to customers, fun, interesting, and different from ordinary businesses in your category. With brief but well-crafted remarks delivered to the assembled group, maybe with visual displays, blown-up before and after photos, and information items included in take-home “swag bags,” you can demonstrate that you are knowledgeable, smart, capable, and professional.
 In his book No B.S. Wealth Attraction in The New Economy, Dan Kennedy lists “DEMONSTRATION” as number 11 of 28 Wealth Magnets. I have used my events as platforms for demonstration, and urge you to do the same.

#### Use Other People’s Events to Get More Referrals: The Artist Who Became Every Company’s Number-One Event Attraction
##### Eileen McCoy is a successful portrait, landscape, and caricature artist who started working with corporate clients in a creative way. An award-winning artist and creative production artist at Hallmark Cards, Eileen found an interesting niche in hosting small and large events where she was the featured entertainment. Customers, patients, and donors at events all over Kansas City will patiently wait in line for Eileen to create a caricature portrait of their kids or family. When we invite Eileen to one of our events, the line quickly wraps around the entire perimeter of the event space. Not only is she talented but she’s smart. Each caricature is branded for the event with a small logo and her information in the lower right corner of the artwork created before your very eyes. These portraits get framed and stay on the walls for years. Not surprisingly, her list of corporate clients has grown to an impressive roster of top area businesses.
 How many of these corporate clients would have ever wandered into Eileen’s art studio looking for a fun attraction to their next event or gala? The answer is somewhere between zero and not too many. She has brilliantly grown another business inside her existing business simply by showing up at events and giving prospective new clients an opportunity to see her in a different light. Creating these opportunities where new customers can interact with you and see your work in a setting outside of the normal nine-to-five at your store, restaurant, or other business is another way of generating word-of-mouth referrals. You’ll have to think creatively about what you can do to be a star performer at others’ events. If you own a restaurant, try a cooking demonstration or running a miniversion of a cooking competition, like on a reality TV show. If you own an apparel store, deliver and emcee a fashion show. If an expert advisor in finance or law or a health-care professional, a brief, informative lecture. There’s no businessperson on earth who can’t figure this out!

#### CHAPTER 14

## Is There a Secret to Maximum Referrals?

##### by Shaun Buck

 here’s more than one!
 But here’s an obvious one. Obvious, yet often overlooked. You know that guy in the TV commercials, Captain Obvious? Unless you’re an advertising aficionado, you won’t recognize it’s a little

# Tnod to a historical figure in the ad world named Obvious Adams. Well, you

#### You Can’t Get Referrals from Customers You Don’t Have
##### Wow. Profound.
 One of the reasons my co-author, Dan Kennedy, and I wanted to title this book about retention and referrals is that there are links binding the two. One link, just stated. Hardly any customer will meet his potential for referrals all at one time, as a volcanic eruption. Most customers have great capacity to refer. They have a dozen or more close family members, friends, and co-workers and peers whom they interact with often if not daily. They have dozens more not-so-close but connected people around them: neighbors, their dry cleaner and car mechanic, and the regular waitress at their favorite restaurant, all their fellow employees at work, or all their


-----

##### business or professional peers. Most customers could give you 12, 24, 48, even 96 referrals, but that can only happen over an extended period of time —so length of retention links to numbers of referrals.
 The other link is not so obvious as the first. Here it is: Increasing the number of referrals you get will increase your customer retention and keep your customers longer. Not only that, it will make them more active customers. There’s some really big money inside this link!

 Giving Referrals Deepens the Commitment of the Customer, Which Extends the Life of that Customer and Increases the Spending Activity of that Customer

 This adds the benefit of an increased lifetime value, but it also adds the benefit of additional referrals and additional time to refer. It’s circular: The more the customer refers the longer he stays so he can refer again thereby staying longer so he can refer again . . . and, inside the circle, the more actively engaged he is so the more he spends.
 This makes getting each customer to refer once, then twice, a top priority. It’s not extra icing on the cake. It’s wealth from the bakery.

#### Everyone, Bring a Friend
##### How would you like to double your business in the next 12 to 24 months without spending a dime on media? What if you could have a business where prospective customers called or walked in ready to buy? How would that change your business and your life? What would that do to your finances and stress level? What impact would that have on your family?
 What if I told you that with this book and your current customers, you have everything you need to make the above scenario come true? Would you believe me?
 A mentor of mine, Bill Glazer, once said, “The single easiest way to double any business is for each customer to bring a customer.”
 Take a second to imagine what your business would look like if you could get every customer to bring a customer. Imagine the positive impact that would have on your business. If you chose to spend money on outside marketing to drive leads and get customers, couldn’t you afford to spend


-----

##### nearly two times as much per new customer because you knew that every customer would bring another customer with them?
 The benefits of making this happen are pretty obvious. If you could cheerfully outspend all your competitors two-to-one, to get new, ideal customers, you’d destroy some of them and dominate any market you wanted to. They can only advertise on radio on one program once a day, you can be heard every hour on every local station. They can only mail postcards, while you can send letters by FedEx. They have a college intern handling their website and social media. You can hire a qualified full-time online marketing manager or top freelancers. They can send each new customer a thank-you email. You can send a welcome gift basket. And so on. Gee, what if you could outspend them by three-to-one? Four-to-one? The power to do so can come from referrals.
 We could talk about how much easier life and business would be or how much more successful and financially secure you would be, but even if we put all of that aside, when you go down this path and succeed, perhaps the best outcome is that it will frustrate your competition to no end. Sure, initially they might think you are an idiot and will say something like, “No one can afford to spend that much money to get a new customer; this guy will be out of business in no time.” But they will quickly see their error when each new customer of yours brings a friend your way, allowing you to easily outspend your competition on marketing. For many, frustrating the competition is reason enough to implement the strategies laid out in this book, and if that is enough for you to take action, great. If you are more money-motivated, that works as well. Either way, you win.
