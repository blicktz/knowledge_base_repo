am a reluctant road warrior, for more flian fen years,
I averaged more than 100 days a year on the road. I liked «&»
what I did when I got there, but I didn't like anything
about the getting there. And this dislike grew day by day.
Throughout my peak travel years, I was inspired to be as efficient
as possible about travel, as productive as possible while traveling.
Each time I grumblingly got onto an airplane, I wanted that trip
to be as valuable as possible. That's what I'll talk with you about
in this chapter: how to travel for business with as much productivity as possible. But I do want to be totally honest about this—
in the post 9-11 world, the problems and agony have exponentially

Long before 9-11,1 was well on my way to slashing
my business travel, and now travel less than in any of the prior 15

years.

As an aside, I believe a law should be passed requiring every
airline executive, on his birthday, to go out to dinner, to his l.ivorite

restaurant, with family and friends. While the rest of the
party can order anything they choose from the menu, the execu-tive

will get a standard airline dinner. After he gets frisked. And I
ie has to eat every bite. I devoutly wish all the flight attendants
who so obviously hate their jobs, hate their employers, and resent

the passengers would have the integrity to quit and go I
ind something else to do. Every time an airline employee lies,
his nose should grow. And the hotel industry should be prohibi ted by an act of Congress from ever using the term "hospitality industry"

again. Hospitality my eye.
Anyway, travel is agony for me, which makes me a little
obsessive about eking out every ounce of productivity from every
trip. Here, I am telling you what I did to survive my peak travel
years as well as what I still do when I must pack up and go.

###### Jam as Much Business into Each Business Trip as Possible
Planning is everything. Once it's determined that I have to go to
X city for a particular purpose, then the race is on to find other
productive things I can do in that same city or in other cities conveniently located en route. I detest having to get on an airplane,
fly somewhere, and come back, all for just one "event."

I think this discipline can extend to everybody. I'm often
amazed at how poorly organized territory salespeople are,

jumping from one end of their territory to another, back and
forth, able to fit in only a few appointments a day when they
could double or triple that if determined to do so. I observe service business owners, such as lawn and garden services, pest control services, etc., using shotgun, scattered marketing and winding
up with customers here, there, and everywhere. Instead, if they
concentrated on dominating a few "tight" geographic areas, they
would likely have lots of customers in one place, giving them
maximum efficiency in delivering services.

Here's an example of the kind of smart scheduling I like to do:
I was booked to speak in Florida on a Thursday, and in the middle of the country the following Tuesday. This allowed me to give
a break on expenses to an East Coast consulting client and sell
him a day, actually two half-days: Thursday afternoon and Friday
morning. I still had time Friday to get to Chicago and get to my
favorite harness racing track by its 7:00 P.M. post time and enjoy
an evening at the races. Saturday I had lunch with an old friend
and a brief, late-afternoon meeting with a prospective client.
Sunday was a "dead day"; I stayed in my hotel room and worked
on writing projects. Monday, at the airport where I had to change
planes, I arranged a two-hour meeting with two business partners, each of whom flew in for the meeting from their homes in
two different cities. Monday evening I did a radio talk show interview over the phone, just as I would have if I had been home.
None of this happened by accident. Once I had the two "bookend" dates locked in, I very deliberately went to work to fill in the
four days in between. My little hierarchical checklist is as follows:

 - What can I try to plug in that is directly revenue positive?

 - Can I plug in meetings with business partners or courtesy
meetings with ongoing, continuing clients or meetings

CHAPTER 8 / ON THE ROAD AGAIN. I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO GET ON THE ROAD AGAIN.

**NO 6.S.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs ft 79**

with my publishers, agents, media contacts, etc., that are
indirectly productive?

 - Finally, should I plug in any goof-off stuff?

I apply this checklist often. For example, a speaking engage-ment

in Las Vegas forced me to leave my Ohio home. As soon as I
hat commitment took its square on the calendar, I booked a
week in a suite at the Paris hotel, then began "fleshing in" the
week. I wound up with the speech the morning of the first day, a lunch

meeting with a continuing client on that same day, a paid
day of consulting the last day (with a client flying there from Los
Angeles) and three days of vacation in between—cheated only
with a two-hour tele-seminar I hosted from my hotel room. Behind

the Vegas week, I wedged in a stop in Phoenix to visit my
own office and for a luncheon speaking engagement. On the
front side of the trip, I first flew to Denver for a speaking engagement there.

Whether you are leaving your home base to go out into your
own city for the day or to distant locales, you ought to work at
making the entire foray as valuable as possible.

###### Where Are those "Friendly Skies," Anyway?
Next, there's the airplane trip itself.

When I first started flying on business, it was civilized.
People waited to be called to board, no elbowing, pushing, trampling. At least in first class, the stewardesses—yes, I used that word—were
actually nice to you. One for every four passengers.
Cheerfully helped you find places for your carry-ons. Other passengers behaved themselves. Wore socks with their shoes. Did
not fill their space and half of yours with an array of gadgetry

stewardesses—yes,

that'd make a Radio Shack window display look inadequate
Shut up and read a book. The food was edible, the air was breathable. All a distant memory.

Personally, I always fly first class. I do too much of it, I'm too
big of a guy, I'm too easily irritated while traveling to tolerate a"
the built-in abuse of coach class travel. Still, even as I'm endurin
the hardships of first class, I'm still able to be productive doin
some work on just about every long flight.

**_Catch Up on Reading and Snoozing_**
I find airports and long flights great places to catch up on read
ing materials that can be discarded afterward. I'll often stuff
pile of catalogs, newsletters, trade journals, and magazines into
the outer pouch of my suitcase. I'll leave with a big, fat bulge bu
return with a thin envelope of torn-out pages or articles, havin
thrown out 90% of it as I finished reading it. Not only is this
good use of airplane time, but there's a significant psychic satis
faction to lightening your load as you go. I recommend this t
anybody who "gets behind" in reading trade and professiona1

journals or similar discardable materials.

Airplane flights are also good for "noodling" a possible solution to a particular problem. The isolation, relative quiet, and
freedom from ordinary interruptions provide an environment
conducive to thinking. Also, the first-class cabin is a good place
to make useful business contacts. But, frankly, I sleep more than
half of all the flight time.

**_Don't Be on the Last Plane Out_**
From a time management standpoint, you should try never
to take the last flight from wherever you're at to wherever you're

going, and you should always have information with you about .illernate,

back-up flights. If you travel a lot, you are already .i
ware that the frequency of mechanical delays due mostly to the •iging

of the fleets keeps getting worse, year to year. I may hold the
record, though, for getting nailed by this sort of thing. Several
years ago, I was on the last America West flight from Phoenix to l

both enroute to speaking engagements on the same program. I

Iter an hour, while we were taxiing toward take-off, another, diflerent problem erupted. We went back to the airport and after
more delay were taken off the plane. After more delay, they brought

a different plane, which, after we had boarded, experienced a mechanical problem! Don't take the last flight!

Making off-peak connections is important; you want to avoid
rush hour at Atlanta or O'Hare or actually, anywhere, if you can.

I'm good at avoiding lengthy connections, and I do not find
the airline "club rooms" very desirable. But many frequent business travelers use these a lot. Actually, I tend to use the
Continental Club in my home city airport pre-departure more
than anywhere else.

**_Consider_** **_Alternatives_**
In the past few years, in part thanks to a post 9-11 boom in
demand, "time share" private jet companies have become more
competitive, more creative in their pricing options, and an
affordable option that a very frequent flyer ought to consider. If I
were flying as much today as I did in 1997, 1998, 1999,1 would
buy into one of these programs without question. In those years,

I spent over $70,000.00 on commercial airfare. As near as I can estimate, about three times that amount would have bought enough
private jet hours with Netjets or FlightOptions to do the same
quantity of travel. The differential would have been a very good
investment, given the value of each of my hours held hostage in
airports at security checkpoint lines or because of flight delays.

If you fly to cities and rent cars a lot, it's well worth joining and
using Hertz Gold Club or Avis's Preferred Customer program to
bypass lines at the counters and avoid filling out the contract from
scratch each time. If you cab it, consider using pre-arranged sedan
services instead, especially at airports known for long taxi waiting
lines, such as Las Vegas, Newark, or National in Washington, DC.
You can usually have a neatly dressed, courteous, Englishspeaking driver waiting for you with a clean, four-door Cadillac
or Lincoln sedan with a car phone. You can instantly be on your
way and spend only an extra $10 to $20 more than cab fare. I'm
amazed at the frequent business travelers I know who are too
cheap to use sedan services, opting instead for standing in line in
the rain and cold to finally go on a thrill ride with Abdul.

**_Be Kind to Your Body_**
I can remember, as can some of my road warrior friends,
when zipping back and forth across time zones had no appreciable effect on me. Not anymore. As you put on some years, travel
takes a greater toll, and you need to schedule time for rest. If I
cross a couple of time zones, I need to allow a little extra time for
rest and recovery. When I was a drinker, I used to have two or
three cocktails and think nothing of it. I don't drink anymore at
all, but friends who drink tell me their metabolism changes have
made drinking booze on flights undesirable. Alcohol has a

heightened effect in the air. On flights I make a point of drinking
quite a bit of water, and I often skip the really junky airplane
meals or eat only the salad. I hit my 49th birthday while finish-ing
this book, but in "travel years," I'm at least 90. Ignoring the damage

done to your body and your psyche by frequent travel is
stupid. You need to devise strategies for eating, exercise, rest, and
work that mitigate the damage as much as possible.

Nothing's worse—or more damaging to productivity—than
getting sick while traveling, or, for that matter, coming down
with something immediately on your return home. I am firmly
convinced that the risk of catching colds and flu are much, much
greater for the frequent traveler, and I think I do a pretty good job
keeping my incidences down to two or three a year. The quality
of the air in the airplanes has gotten worse (!) since the ban on
smoking; the lack of cigarette smoke has allowed the airlines to
save money by switching from fresh-air systems to recirculating
air systems. The "old" planes had two-thirds fresh air, one-third
recirculated; the newest planes use 100% recirculated air, so you
are breathing a mixture of all the other passengers' colds, flus,
viruses, sweat, etc., roughly every seven to nine minutes. Flight
attendant sickness is on the rise, and both employees and passengers are complaining (to no avail). According to the National
Academy of Sciences, measured in cubic feet per minute, fresh
air circulated inside the average airplane ranges from (best) 150
to the pilots in the cockpit, to 50 to first-class passengers, to 7, to
coach passengers. We solved the "secondhand smoke" problem.
Now we're getting sick from secondhand air.

This is why you should never aim the overhead air vents
directly at your face; contagious germs in that air go into your
eyes and—whammo!—you're sick as a dog. I also increase my

vitamin intake while traveling and, during prime cold and flu
seasons, I megadose vitamin C. There's a relatively new, good
product called Airborne, a vitamin-rich and zinc-rich tablet that
dissolves in water and makes a fizzy lemon drink. You belt this
down immediately before heading for the airport. Pros also
advise drinking lots of water during long flights. It seems that
dehydration enlarges the tiny, inside-the-nostril pores, which
increases your chance of catching infections.

**_Pack Light_**
Checking baggage is a giant time-waster, even if your bags don't
get lost. I haven't checked baggage more than once or twice in
ten years, on thousands of flights. Any male should be able to go
for up to two weeks with one large carry-on that fits in the overhead bins plus a briefcase. It's tougher for women, but the smart
ones figure out how to do it. (Hint: everything matching one pair
of shoes helps.) Otherwise, you must get to the airport earlier
every time, you must wait for baggage on arrival—usually 30
minutes or more—and this wait often puts you smack in the middle of a herd waiting in line for cabs or packed like sardines into
the rental car company or hotel shuttle bus.

If you are going to one place for multiple days and cannot
carry everything you need, FedEx it there ahead of you, and
FedEx it back when you leave. It's worth the expense—if your
time has any value.

###### Battling for Productivity in Your Hotel Room
Now you've arrived, you're in your hotel. I've learned to have as
many meetings as possible at my hotel, with people coming to me,
just as I would if at home in my own office, for the same reason. I
