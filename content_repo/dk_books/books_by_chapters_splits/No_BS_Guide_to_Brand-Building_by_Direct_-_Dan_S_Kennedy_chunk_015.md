###### The surgeon that Forrest made note of earlier is just one of dozens of examples that we had to have thick skin in dealing with. It caused us to wonder if it might just be worth creating brand-centric marketing that our clients can take pride in, even if it wouldn’t initially return as well as the pure direct-response stuff.
 I said “initially return” because the average Iron Tribe member athlete does indeed refer 1.3 people to join their tribe and renews their membership agreement at least one time, which means if brand-centric marketing helps our athletes take more pride in the Iron Tribe membership, it could eventually be tied to an actual ROI.
 Another way to think about this, which we’ve discussed at length with Dan, is that there is front-end ROI and back-end ROI. Front end and back end are direct-marketing industry terms that people in other fields may not be familiar with. Simply put, front end is everything leading up to and including the first transaction, when someone first becomes a client. Back end is everything that happens afterward, in the ongoing relationship with and monetization of that client. Front-end ROI has to do with the cost of getting customers through advertising and marketing and the return on those invested dollars from that first transaction or a series of transactions occurring one right after the other in the short term. Back-end ROI is more complicated. It has to factor in retention and longevity, frequency of purchase, continuity or renewal income, ascension, and, very important but often not managed or measured or accounted for, referral activity.
 We began thinking about our most aggressive direct-response advertising and marketing as front end, and by the way, a front-end necessity, and about a need for more motivational, brand-oriented messaging as back end.
 Forrest and I agreed that if we were going to start testing out these strategies at our own gyms in Birmingham, we had to be able to track it enough to justify it. The preceding statistics of average member athlete referrals and renewal rates would be our barometer for success, with a goal of maintaining an average of more than one referral and membership agreement renewal per member athlete, but ideally seeing improvement.
 We also knew that to pull this test off, we would have to invest into an implementation team that would be based in our corporate offices, since we


-----

###### felt continuing with our ad agency was not worth the offset in our marketing budget.
 Daniel Walters, an Iron Tribe member athlete who had lost more than 100 pounds and was already working in the tech and digital marketing world at another firm in Birmingham, would become the first member of our “marketing implementation team.” As our Marketing Implementer, Daniel’s objective is to carry out not only our already-in-play direct- response marketing load but also new initiatives like this brand-marketing centric test.
 We started with a different look, feel, and overall format in our TribeVibe newsletter, which became much more “pretty” and features the faces of our member athletes on its cover. We now use the inside content areas to review and preview local Iron Tribe events in each respective market, along with providing fitness and nutrition resources featuring our top coaches as the experts providing these tools to enrich the member athlete experience. (See Figures 7.1A through D starting on page 58.)
 Our decision to invest in an implementation team immediately expanded our in-house capabilities, not just with a slicker monthly newsletter design and strategy but also in establishing the ability to scale it in a graphically designed, templated format for each newly franchised market to utilize as a communication tool with their tribe.
 The next idea within this experiment was to leverage my on-camera broadcasting capabilities that I had honed in college and even professionally while working for networks like ESPN. This led to what is now known as TribeVibeTV, a weekly show that airs on our YouTube channel and is filtered into each gym’s respective website, social media channels, and our iPhone app.

carefully and gradually transitioning their marketing to and through their members to a more
brand-driven, graphic approach. The newsletter’s facelift made it more of a professionallooking magazine. What they understood, that many businesspeople don’t, is that you can and
should present yourself differently to different audiences at different times. And while frontend marketing has to heavily rely on specific promises and claims, promotional offers, and
urgency for immediate response, back-end marketing can revolve more around social proof,
human interest, and demonstration of community. It is difficult to reverse that and put sense of
community and prideful belonging out there as the front-end, absent promises, offers, and


-----

urgency. Companies that try it or insist on it waste a great deal of money that can’t be held
accurately accountable for ROI, and can even go broke creating a well-known brand that is
favorably thought of but doesn’t sell anything!

The winning formula Jim describes here is a great way to balance direct-response and brand in
a business.

(See Figures 7.2A–B below and on page 63.)
 If we learned anything from Dan Kennedy’s Renegade Millionaire audio CDs, it is the fact that you can never spend enough marketing dollars, nor can you ever be present in enough places. One of my favorite stories is of the business owner who bought billboard space near his competitor’s

Figures 7.2A–B: **DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: Notice the view counts for the**
different segments of TribeVibeTV. Do they seem small to you? Direct-response marketing is
much about _target marketing. Giant audience is rarely the goal. What’s important to a_
company like Iron Tribe is not how many know it and engage with it, but that the right clients
and prospective clients know it and engage with it. This is a great hybrid of direct-response
messages integrated with brand identity for members and those they tell about and refer to
their tribe. It’s also worth noting that Iron Tribe has a second audience to consider and appeal
to: new franchise owners, many of whom rise up from their members. Just about every
communication effort they invest in, including this one, needs to reinforce the idea that theirs
is not only a life-altering fitness phenomenon but also a business success phenomenon. You

###### This is the perception we want to create for Iron Tribe, within each respective market where our brand has its gyms being developed: that we are everywhere. That we are powerful. The reason I have coined it as “YOUbiquity” is because when it’s fully achieved, YOU truly cannot get rid of us even if you try. We’re everywhere!


-----

###### The unique advantage with our “YOUbiquitous” journey is the fact that we have an extra media that most don’t—the voices of our member athletes. They are true evangelists for their tribe, fighting for us right now on the streets as you read this very chapter.
 For instance, you might hear an Iron Tribe direct-response radio commercial and turn the station, only to see us on a billboard en route to your home, just before picking up a print publication with one of our direct- response ads and throwing it aside. And right when you think you’ve gotten rid of us, your colleague at work says, “Have I told you about this Iron Tribe thing that I’m doing? It’s amazing!”—and he directs you to TribeVibeTV and gives you a copy of the TribeVibe magazine.
 This is “YOUbiquity,” and I feel like I could write a whole ‘nother book on it.
 Having six of our own Iron Tribe gyms in a medium-sized market like Birmingham (1.2 million people in the metro area) has not only taught us the power of “YOUbiquity,” but also it’s held us accountable to the fiduciary responsibility to multiply what was one marketing budget at one gym into as many budgets as there are gyms in that respective market.
 This, of course, is one of several advantages when it comes to franchising—economies of scale.
 For example, if you have $4,000.00 allotted to invest into your Iron Tribe gym’s marketing each month and you stick to our proven development schedule of opening a new gym every nine months, you are consistently adding to your monthly marketing spend each year, from $4,000.00 per month, to $8,000.00 per month, to where we are today, at $24,000.00 per month.
 Our three-year journey in Birmingham, from one gym to six, became the gauge by which we began to make decisions with this budget on direct- response-style advertising versus brand-centric.
 Because of this, we’ve been able to create a system for all of our franchisees to follow, mapping out this investment strategy starting 60 days before they even open their doors, which of course is going to be a pure direct-response strategy, going back to Forrest’s chapter on “We Build the Brand—By Selling.”
 However, as Iron Tribe franchise owners begin to fill up their first gym with member athletes, there are brand-centric marketing pieces that they’re


-----

###### prompted to invest time and money into, encouraging retention and referrals amongst their initial member athlete base.
 Cutting-edge technology development is a big part of this as well. It’s one thing to put your message out there in public medias like print, SEO, SEM, billboards, direct mail, TV, and radio (we use all of these), but when you can actually create your own medias that are only filled with your message geared just for your clients, you’re tapping into an exclusivity factor that they will appreciate AND you’ve established a proprietary channel where only you can market to them. Dan Kennedy says that virtually every business—even something as seemingly ordinary as a Main Street shoe store—should be in the media business, too, and own their own media.

##### Don’t Sell to Customers—Totally Involve Customers

###### We’ve made it so that downloading the Iron Tribe iPhone app and becoming a member of an Iron Tribe gym’s website are absolute non- negotiables. It’s a staple in the Iron Tribe experience, where members must go EVERY DAY (or night) to schedule themselves for one of the classes at any of the Iron Tribe gyms in their local market, along with finding out what tomorrow’s workout is, which is like a game to them.
 They simply cannot go to sleep without knowing what tomorrow will hold, and they don’t find out until about 7:30 S 1P . each evening, when the next day’s workout is finally announced. It’s like the NCAA March Madness Selection Show, but every night!
 Analytics on their personal progression toward their goals, account information on food and product purchases, and a constant stream of microblog communication from other tribe athletes and coaches are just a few of the strong engagement aspects that take the Iron Tribe experience beyond the 45-minute class and four walls of the gym.
 If the competitive style of our workout programming has created an addictive game, the technology aspect has taken that game and created a league where these games take place. Thus, it is a forum for us to market upcoming events, new products, contract-renewal upgrades, and ultimately,


-----

###### the ability to communicate with members on a regular basis. (See Figures 7.3A–C starting on page 67.)
 Through these brand-building strategies, we know that Iron Tribe is more than just our faces as the leaders of the business. We’ve earned the logo some serious legitimacy, starting with selling memberships via direct- response marketing in each new market and then leveraging things like our monthly TribeVibe newsletter, weekly TribeVibeTV show, and addictive technology that has become a private media just for us to channel our marketing through, with each client subscribing to it religiously.

Figures 7.3A–C: **DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: Iron Tribe’s “client’s site” is a**
sophisticated piece of media. Positioned as the dashboard the member uses on a day-to-day
basis to manage his experience and achievement, it literally compels constant engagement.
This is not, candidly, easy to figure out for every business, but it is well worth working hard to
figure out! This is also outstanding brand reinforcement, with brand advertising appearing
throughout. But it also, as Jim points out, gives Iron Tribe the equivalent of its own daily
newspaper read religiously by its members, in which it can insert direct-response advertising
for events, products, and services. Their ownership of their own media is powerful, but the fact
that it draws attention every day is even more powerful.

#### CHAPTER 8


## Skating on Thin Ice:
### Advancing Brand, from Back
 End to Front End

###### by Jim Cavale


###### s I described, we evolved to a winning formula, with direct response dominating our front-end or external marketing to the world at large and brand dominating our back-end or internal

# A

###### marketing to and through our members. It worked. But we were involved in a business’s evolutionary process, not an arrival at a fixed destination.
 We established direct response to sell athlete memberships at each gym, building a growing number of tribes that each athlete member felt an allegiance to. This then allowed for the brand-centric marketing strategies to encourage them to feel prideful association with a brand that is much bigger than just themselves.


-----

###### But one thing that we began to ask ourselves was how we could better leverage the brand that we’ve built, while still putting solid lead-generating direct-response marketing out there.
 This is not easy. The ad agency experiment (and my passion for the TV hit series Mad Men) had spurred ideas in my head of infusing a traditional brand-building strategy with direct-response fundamentals. However, it has not necessarily been an instant success, but it’s definitely been a valuable learning experience. But that’s the advantage of having your own corporate gyms to use as innovation test kitchens.
 Our system is based on a “do as we do” foundation and NOT just telling our franchise partners to “do as we say.” It’s always frustrated Forrest and me to watch the consultants out there coaching people to do things they’ve never even had experience in, telling them to spend the money and time required without knowing whether that advice is going to work.
 This next experiment started with a basic idea. I told myself that if Iron Tribe was going to be a household brand name, then I needed to make sure that we had our very own marketing tagline that our member athletes can cling to (i.e., Nike’s “Just Do It”), as well as a tagline that could be the source for all our social proof that would continue to be embedded within ALL types of marketing messages.
 Dan Kennedy often talks about the breakthrough power of identifying and communicating what business you are really in and urges people to separate their deliverables from that real business.
 When we looked at the testimonial emails that clients constantly sent our way on a daily basis, a consistent theme emerged that moves Iron Tribe way beyond just fitness into the most powerful thing that any business could sell: TRANSFORMATION.
 Observing the most powerful brands out there, they’ve taken a commodity, good, or service, and translated it into a superior customer experience. Starbucks personifies this in their ability to take a four-cent cup o’ coffee and charge $4.00 for it. Their “third place atmosphere” (in addition to home and work) has generated an experience that customers simply have to have. In Kennedy Language, their coffee is just a deliverable. Their real business is providing that third place. In the evolution of our brand and our marketing, we decided that the gyms, the
