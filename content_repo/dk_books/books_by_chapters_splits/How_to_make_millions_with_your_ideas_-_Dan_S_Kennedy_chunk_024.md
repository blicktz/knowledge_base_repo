     on juvenile sexual harassment. Now that psychologist could

      Most shows’ staffs maintain extensive files of press kits
     and materials that are submitted to them. I have several clients

 YOU MIGHT MAKE YOUR MILLIONS
   FASTER BY SELLING OUT
    THAN BY STAYING IN
   here’s an old joke about the U.S. government social worker
   making the rounds of the Indian reservations, settling on this
 sleepy chieftain, and trying to motivate him, believing if she
 could get him into ‘‘the program,’’ all the others would follow.
   “‘We would pay for you to go to school and get an educa-
 tion,’’ she told him.
   *“Why would I do that?’’ he asked. He was siting on a creek
 bank, under a shade tree, with a fishing pole stuck in the mud,
 its line dangling in the water.
   ‘*So we could help you get a good job with a good
 company.”’
   ‘*‘Why would I want that?’’ he asked.
   ‘*Well, if you stayed there and worked hard for thirty or forty
 years, you’d be able to retire.’’
   ‘‘Why would I want to do that?’’ he asked.
   ***So you could spend the rest of your years relaxing, doing
 whatever you wanted to do.’’
   “‘Doin’ that now,’’ the chief answered.
   Of course, the distinct difference is to retire with money or
 without it, and, as the comedienne Totie Fields said, ‘‘I’ve been
 with money and without, and with is better.’’ I believe that the
 great dream of many entrepreneurs is to develop their business
 to a certain point and then have some giant corporation pay them
 a king’s ransom for it, so that they can walk away and travel the

   make that happen. T. Harv Eker did that. And he asked himself
   the question, Why take a lifetime to get this done—why not do
    it fast?
       From Biz Dunce to Biz Whiz after Just
            Seventeen Lessons
      T. Harv Eker is one of the most interesting guys I’ve met on
    the speaking circuit. He’s a Canadian transplanted to sunny San
    Diego, where he occasionally puts on what he calls a “‘Street
   Smart Business Boot Camp,’’ and more frequently, there and in
    other cities, he supervises ‘‘Street Smart Business Schools,”’
   modeled somewhat after the Dale Carnegie Courses.
     I was a guest speaker at one of these camps the weekend
    after Thanksgiving in 1993. There were about 400 students there,
   and Harv had pulled together a diverse group of speakers—Rob-
    ert Allen, author of Nothing Down, the get-rich-in-real-estate
    bestseller; Ted Thomas, a joint-venture marketing expert; Ann
    Boe, a networking specialist, Dr. Wayne Dyer, a metaphysical
    philosopher; and me. Ironically, the most interesting speaker of
    all was probably Harv, because he told a story I’d never heard
    before, that of very deliberately setting out to create a business
    for the sole purpose of selling it for big money as quickly as
    possible.
     These days, Harv’s students call him ‘‘The Biz Whiz,’’ but
    for quite a while he was more of a biz dunce. Harv bumbled his
   way through seventeen different businesses in a relatively short
    period of time. ‘‘It stands to reason that if I have gone through
    that many businesses, only a few of them survived for any du-
    ration,’’ Harv admits, ‘‘but the more businesses I owned, the
    more lessons I learned. In 1983 I decided to get married and
    settle down. I also decided to get rich, once and for all. In order
    to stay rich, I realized that I had to do things differently than I
    had in the past.”’

      Stay Away from Great New Ideas
   In analyzing what had caused him the most grief in his past
 business ventures, Harv determined it was making brand-new, in-
 ventive ideas work. That was risky, costly, and time-consuming.
 This time, he went in search of a business that was already proven,
 apparently poised for explosive growth, but nonexistent in his
 own area. And Harv found the home fitness retail store. ‘‘These
 stores were flying high in Los Angeles,’’ Harv recalls, ‘‘but no-
 body’d even seen one in Toronto, or anywhere in Canada, for
 that matter.’’
  By transplanting what was already working in one place to
 another place, Harv took a very valuable shortcut. In this in-
 stance, he had to be a good observer, astute enough to study the
 already successful business and understand the principles and
 Strategies that were causing its success, but he did not have to
 be a successful inventor or innovator.
        Pay Attention to Trends
   ‘‘T looked: at a number of successful, potentially transplant-
 able businesses and business ideas, but I settled on the fitness
 equipment store because it was in sync with not one but a num-
 ber of societal forces likely to insure its success. They were: (1)
 a general increase in health and fitness product sales; (2) an
 increase in the senior population, the increase in life expectancy
 making people over fifty-five the fastest-growing group (and
 these people needed to exercise more but weren’t eager to go to
 health clubs); (3) what Faith Popcorn (author, The Popcorn Re-
 port) identified as the ‘‘cocooning’’ trend—people staying at
 home; (4) the increase of home-based businesses, so people had
 to stay home; (5) women in the workplace [with] full-time ca-
 reers and families, [who had] no time to hang out at the health
 club; and, (6) the public’s passion for convenience.’”’
  Harv did a good job. In fact, these trends have held up over

   equipment advertised and sold via TV infomercials, such as
    those with ‘‘Body By Jake,’’ Joe Montana, Joe Piscopo, and Jane
   Fonda, via pervasive magazine and newspaper advertising, and
    in every department store, discount store, and warehouse club.
   Once there was only NordicTrack, now there are hundreds.
   Whether this trend holds up four years from now or not, I can’t
    predict. (You may be reading this book many years from now
   and say, Piscopo who?) But the trends Harv spotted did hold up
    long enough for him to become a millionaire.
        Determine to Build a Salable Asset,
           Not Just a Business
     The biggest thing Harv did differently is that he viewed his
   ‘new business as an asset, in his words, ‘‘similar to a house or
    piece of real estate.’’ He set the goal of cashing out as soon as
   he could get $1 million for the business, and a companion goal
    of doing that as quickly as possible, and that altered the way he
          - approached developing and running the business.
      In April 1984 Harv opened Fitnessland, the first fitness
   equipment store in Canada. ‘‘Most people look at businesses as
    vehicles for income,’’ Harv explains, “‘but my research indicated
    that businesses get bought for a combination of reasons and,
    often, income is of the least importance. There’s gross. sales,
    proof that the business is expandable and has potential to grow
    with the new buyer’s capital and ideas, public recognition, [and]
    market share. These are all important values to build into the
    property.”’
     With that in mind, Harv systematically reinvested virtually
    all the profit in growing the business’s number of outlets and
    gross sales and in creating a business image that was even bigger
    than the business itself. The first year, Fitnessland had $850,000
    in sales with a whopping $220,000 in profits, but in two and a
    half years, Harv expanded to ten stores with $7 million in gross
   combined—but $36,000 The money

 ance, in securing territorial exclusive marketing rights to certain
 products, and in generating as much media publicity as possible.
  Harv reasoned that these assets would have greater impor-
 tance and value to a larger company acquiring his business than
 would a higher profit number. And he believed that the image
 and publicity would attract suitors.
  He proved right on both counts. The first break came when
 Fitnessland’s advertising attracted the president of the Canadian
 operating division of the H. J. Heinz Corporation to the store to
 buy a treadmill. He was so impressed with what he saw, he
 started asking questions about the business, then told Harv that
 Heinz was on the lookout for businesses they felt they could
 grow into giants. Heinz’s acquisitions people were soon in-
 volved, and Harv had a serious, qualified suitor on his hands.
   Creating Competition: You’re More Desirable
     When More Than One Wants You
   ““Once I had the Heinz deal in play, I sent out letters to
 health-related companies in Canada. Basically, I told them a U.S.
 company was starting negotiations to buy my business, but that
 I would prefer to keep the company Canadian owned, if I
 could.’’ Harv adds, ‘‘And I had a detailed business plan to show
 them, forecasting expansion to 100 stores in Canada and in the
 United States, making the argument that capturing this market
 quickly was important.”’
  Soon Harv had seven other companies in the game, all con-
 sidering acquiring his company. In subtle ways, he let each dis-
 cover the others. This motivated Heinz to move quicker and
 more aggressively than it ordinarily would. It took a year—a
 long time for the impatient entrepreneur, but a short time for a
 major corporation to complete an acquisition—and Harv Eker
 cashed out of Fitnessland for $1.6 million, achieving his original
 goal of being an ‘‘after-tax millionaire.”’

         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #17:
             CLARITY OF PURPOSE.
     If you really pin people down, even business owners and
   entrepreneurs, you’ll find most cannot clearly and concisely
   enunciate exactly what they are trying to accomplish this year,
    in three years, or in five years. They’re running around playing
   what I call ‘‘blind archery,’’ and that’s a pretty difficult, even
   dangerous game. Harv Eker had a very clear, concise understand-
   ing of what he wanted to get done through his business in five
   years or less: Walk away an after-tax millionaire. This definite
   objective then governed all of his creative thinking and
   decisions.
      In a similar fashion, most of my activities these days have
   something to do with the objective of accumulating 5,000 paid,
   happy, renewable, renewing subscribers to my marketing news-
    letter. I choose or turn down speaking engagements, joint-
   venture opportunities, and other projects based on whether or not
    they’ll make a contribution to achieving this goal. My entire
   mail-order business is conceived as a giant funnel leading to
   newsletter subscription. Being focused on one, clear beacon like
    this makes navigating the waters on a day-to-day basis a lot
    easier.
      ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO BE A PIONEER?
     A lot of pioneers get shot full of arrows and die. As Harv
    learned through his seventeen lessons, it is often a lot smarter
    and surer to find a way to build on the solid foundation of some-
    thing that is already a proven success, rather than creating some-
   thing entirely from scratch.
     I am a huge believer in creative theft. When I work as a
    consultant with one kind of business, I identify some principle
    of success, some strategy that is working for them, then take it

 something that the second client’s industry is doing and ‘‘steal’’
 it to apply in an entirely different industry. You can certainly do
 the same thing for yourself. Harv found a successful idea he
 could transplant geographically. You might do that, too. Or you
 might do as I do—find an idea you can transplant from one type
 of business to another.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #24:
      PAY ATTENTION TO DEVELOPING TRENDS.
   The idea is to see “‘leading indicators,’ not ‘‘trailing indi-
 cators.’’ For example, in 1993 the percentage of young people
 who smoke crept back up, fast-food and junk-food consumption
 increased, and the total number of people entering formal
 weight-loss programs declined. If you look at all the advertising
 you see for weight-loss products, fitness products, and health
 foods, you might find those facts hard to believe. But you’d be
 looking at ‘“‘trailing indicators’; the 1993 statistics may be
 “leading indicators.’’.In fact, some highly respected trend ana-
 lysts are using such facts as the basis for predicting a dramatic
 drop in sales for the health- and fitness-related businesses in the
 next three to five years.
   Faith Popcorn, a legendary trend predictor, has coined the
 name pleasure revenge reaction for this; in other words, the pub-
 lic has deprived itself and tortured itself to lose weight and get
 better bodies, many have only gained back weight lost through
 grueling or expensive diets, and now all that frustration is going
 to play itself out in people saying, ‘“The heck with it. If I want
 a banana split, I’m having a banana split.”’
   In 1984 Harv saw a lot of current and leading indicators that
 led him to believe in a coming boom in health and fitness, and
 he was right to the tune of $1 million. If he were looking at
 today’s indicators, Harv would be making very different choices
 about the type of business to develop.

     SMART INVESTMENTS IN BUILDING VALUE.

    ness, or merging with a big, ‘‘deep pockets’’ parent, or even
    going public, it’s important to understand that net income is
    rarely the most important success factor. The business owner
    only using his business as a means of earning a living can (and,
    usually, should) make the bottom-line profit number his top pri-
    ority. But the entrepreneur with a bigger vision needs to build
    value, not just create income.
    Why Would a Ketchup Company Buy a Chain
          of Fitness Stores, Anyway?
     About eight years ago, I went to a seminar on how to sell
    your business put on by The Geneva Corporation, and one key
    principle I heard there for the first time has since been of im-
    mense value to me. Here it is:
       People and companies buy businesses for their reasons,
       not yours. Their reasons for buying not only have nothing
        to do with your reasons for selling—they’ll have little to
       do with the reasons you think somebody ought to have
       for buying your business.
    This means that you need to think very creatively when posi-
    tioning a business for sale and selecting and courting buyers.
    You have to crawl inside their minds and try to understand their
    .reasons for buying.
     With this in mind, I’ve since sold two of my businesses for
    considerably more than they were worth on paper. For example,
    I sold the manufacturing division of a company I owned to a
    direct competitor, with the appeal to him largely based on two
    things: the merging of my customer base with his existent op-
    eration, so he had instant added sales but no added costs, and
    the value to him of removing me from the marketplace as a
    competitor. Now, the truth is, he was whipping me in that com-

 ogy, and lower prices. But I was a skilled, tough marketer and
 a thorn in the side of his business. His company spent money
 on certain kinds of advertising that would not have been nec-
 essary if I was out of the picture.
   This value had nothing to do with the reasons most people
 think businesses are bought. For example, the equipment was a
 nonissue because of the differences in technology. The inventory
 was also a nonissue. Even the business name and identity were
 unimportant. In this case, two assets were involved: customers
 and elimination of an annoying competitor.
   Synergy often plays a role. I recently sold a specialized di-
 vision of one of my publishing companies to a small firm pro-
 viding services to the same unique niche market. For me, this
 was one of a number of product lines and markets. For them, it
 was their only market, and because all their resources and en-
 ergies were targeted at that market, it cost them less to promote
 additional products than it did me to deal with it as one of many
 opportunities. For me, it had actually become almost a nuisance,
 and it was being neglected because of that. They almost imme-
 diately doubled the sales of the product line they acquired from
 me because of their more dominant presence in the market and
 laser focus on the market. I made the argument that the business
_would pay for itself and be worth much more to them than to
 me. That was true, and it was the basis for a deal satisfactory to
 both of us. In Harv’s case, it so happens that the H. J. Heinz
 Corporation was already in health-related businesses—notably,
 they owned Weight Watchers International—and had targeted
 this as a big area of opportunity they wanted to exploit.
   There’s also an ego or arrogance factor at work when an
 entrepreneur’s business is bought by a big company. The big
 company’s executives believe they are much smarter and more
 capable than the entrepreneur ‘‘who got lucky.’’ This is why
 gross is much more important than net in most cases. Rapid
 growth of gross screams ‘‘potential.’’ But when they look at the
 low net, they chalk it up to the entrepreneur being an inept man-
 ager. ‘‘If we bring in a good management team,"’ they reason,
