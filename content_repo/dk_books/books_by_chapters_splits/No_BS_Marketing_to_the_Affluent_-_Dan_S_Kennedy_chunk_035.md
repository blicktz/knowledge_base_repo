##### this should be manageable. Part of your time allocated for social media should include engaging in conversation with people. Realize affluents do not like to be ignored. If you don’t reply to people, you are not just missing an opportunity to build a relationship, you risk losing them altogether.  7. Claim and manage your listings. People are changing the way they
 search for things. It’s no longer just looking up your business on Google. They are using their mobile phone to do searches on social media and review sites such as Yelp, Trip Advisor, and FourSquare. For many review sites, customers can create a listing for you. The problem with this is that when a consumer creates the listing, you do not have control over it. In order to update and control the information on your listing, you need to claim your listing.  8.  Research the best time to post each day of the week. Rather than
 choosing one set time to post or looking at your analytics alone, do your research to determine how your affluent customers interact with your product and service as well as looking at industry research for your category and the social network you are using. Sprout Social has done research on this subject and found, for instance, that with the introduction of Instagram shopping, the best time for consumer goods to post was on Saturdays between 11:00 A.M. and 1:00 P.M. and the safest times every day of the week were between 10:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M. But on Facebook it was different. The best time to post for consumer goods on Facebook is Thursday at 2:00 P.M. and Friday at 11:00 A.M. The safest times of the week are between 10:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M.  9. Find out what your audience wants to see. One of the best ways to
 get people to engage with your page is to ask your best customers, clients, or patients—that fit your target audience—what they want to see on your social media pages. 10. Develop a plan. Don’t post on a whim or try to figure out daily what
 you’ll post. A well-thought-out plan with objectives for each post will help you tell your story, which will create an engaged audience. Plus, it’ll be much easier to post consistently good content.

##### What Should You Post on Social Media There are several different strategies you can use when interacting with affluents on social media. And it somewhat depends on what your product or service is to determine which strategies will be most effective.
 For example, the financial services industry found that the wealthiest households surveyed are most likely to consume more specialized financial content, such as stock tips, while general financial information is more popular with less wealthy households.
 They also found that increasingly investors are using social media for information but not interacting with their advisors on these platforms. Plus, 70% of wealthy clients watch videos for financial advice.
 In this case, the advisor’s strategy would be wise to include regularly posting videos on specialized information and to concentrate on leveraging their social media to establish reputations for themselves as experts in specific topics rather than trying to engage or keep in contact with current clients.
 However, in another industry, engaging with current and prospective clients works well. Celebrity designer Wendy Bellissimo’s social media is brimming with personality where she tastefully shows affinity through references demonstrating she is “one of them.” Living in the gated, upscale, equestrian community of Hidden Hills, California, with her husband, four young daughters, and a collection of pets including dogs, chickens, and horses, she masterfully weaves her daily life, home décor products, and design service into her story. Showing stunning pictures and fun, often awe- inspiring videos in her stylishly decorated home, with her pups and chickens, adventures with her family, and design jobs she’s done for wealthy and celebrity clients, she satisfies in the minds of the affluent that she is authentic; believable; a knowledgeable, legitimate expert trusted by others; and more. She mixes it up by telling stories about her life one day, subtly inserting her products another day, and giving a more obvious, but tastefully done promotion another.
 A couple of examples from her page demonstrate:

 Example 1. “What a man, traveling with five girls all these years. Joe and I have never had a vacation without the girls … been 18 years! By choice of

 Example 2. “Window treatments installed this weekend and the auto vacs came. I’m in love with the Soft White Linen Drapes and Motorized Roman Shades in @graciebellissimo’s bedroom.

 Build and Leverage Your Reputation as an Expert Social media can be used by any industry to build and leverage your reputation as an expert. Posting specific content you’ve created that demonstrates your expertise is one way to do this. In addition, you can interact with the media and other key influencers, using strategic tagging and connecting with them on a peer-to-peer level to establish and build a relationship with them. Share their post with your own commentary. Do an interview series where you invite and speak with top leaders in your field. This raises your reputation in the eyes of your audience. Plus, when the time comes for you to release a book or some other item, the people from these fostered relationships are more likely to reciprocate and promote you, endorse you, or even write a foreword for your book.
 In the book Authority Marketing, authors Adam Witty and Rusty Shelton give the example of their client Carol Sanford using Twitter to start a conversation with popular blogger Sam Ford at Fast Company. The connection led to Sam’s endorsement, which was featured on the front of Carol’s book.

 Design a Photograph-Worthy Space


-----

##### People capture every moment of their lives in photos these days. Designing your physical space or even an area in your business that is “photo-worthy” can encourage your current clients to take photos and share on their social media pages—thus introducing you to potential customers who might not otherwise hear of you. You see this with restaurants all the time. Designing not only foods and drinks to inspire photographs, owners are now designing their entire restaurant in hopes of inspiring the most photos possible. However, this strategy need not be limited to restaurants. Orthodontists could have a colorful and irresistible backdrop designed for when patients get their braces on … and off. You could hire an artist to paint an incredible photo-worthy mural on the side of your business. Or design a room in your business, like Hebron Family Chiropractic, who has an animal-themed mural painted on the wall and an adjusting table designed to look like a zebra in their kids’ adjusting room.

 Product Placement by Affluencers Teaming up with affluencers who have a large following that intersects with your target audience can be an effective strategy for getting your product or service in front of their audience. These influencers are social media “stars” who have monetized their subscriber base on Instagram by posting pictures and endorsing brands. You can reach out to affluencers individually or find them through companies that connect you to influencers. Influencers are offered products or services free (and/or paid placement) in exchange for displaying on their page. Having them also post on their “stories” allows you to provide a link to provide lead generation bait or instant access to purchase the recommended product or service. If you use this strategy, don’t just look for a big number of followers. It’s better to have an affluence with a smaller number of followers who closely fit your ideal target audience.

 The Wealthiest Customers Want Service on Social Media Research by McKinsey and Company found that the wealthiest consumers prefer customer service on social media (dubbed social care) by phone, as well as in-person customer service. Forty-eight percent of the $200k+ audience and 29% of the $150k-$200 audience prefer social care.

##### You should not only be looking for consumers to reach out to you via social media for support, you should be prepared with a plan for how you will respond. Affluent consumers are not just looking to see if you are listening, they are looking at how you respond. While failure to respond can lead to an increase in churn, a study by Bain & Company found that when you engage and respond to customer service requests, consumers spend, on average, 20% to 40% more with you.
 To help you monitor customer requests, use one of the many tools available that alert you when you’ve been mentioned. It’s also important to look for mentions that might not be obvious–such as mentions where your business name is misspelled or tagged incorrectly.
 To reduce the risk of alienating wealthy clients:

 1. Assign specific people to this task—people who have the expertise
 and are adept and fully capable of quickly responding to and solving customer, client, or patient issues. 2. Respond quickly. Speed matters, and while some consumers find it
 acceptable to respond within 24 hours to a few days, approximately one-third of consumers expect a response within 30 to 60 minutes. 3. Develop processes for the people responsible for responding to
 customers. Processes should include: how to quickly contact you or other experts in your company to resolve issues rapidly should the need arise; the right way to take things off-line when necessary, and a reporting system so you can identify ongoing issues that need to be resolved. 4. Regularly schedule time to review customer service questions and
 issues that arise. Incentivize front-line staff to spot issues that occur. Use this to not only identify issues but to help solve the root causes of affluent-customer service issues.

 When you create a social media strategy designed to reach and connect with your affluent prospects, you can increase the awareness of your brand, improve loyalty, build your authority, create better customer satisfaction, and influence purchasing decisions (and more) in a cost-effective way.

#### CHAPTER 25

### Using Authority to Attract the Affluent: The
 Seven Pillars of Authority Marketing

##### By Adam Witty

# There is a huge secret I learned from Mr. Dan Kennedy, the author of
##### this book: The higher up in income you go, the more you’re paid for who you are, rather than what you do.
 This is true in almost any category—from fitness experts and restaurant owners, to doctors, lawyers, real estate professionals, financial advisors, and beyond. It is a common thread you’ll see among the highest-earning business experts in every field.

##### Think about the purchasing decisions you make in your own life. Let’s say you want to get your yard landscaped. You have two choices. The first is an unknown landscape architect that owns the local garden shop down the street. Perhaps you are aware of him because of the ads you’ve seen in a weekly discount magazine. The second is a landscape architect you recently saw on TV, discussing his new book on the best plant choices for yards in your area. This architect was just awarded the landscaping contract for the most prestigious hotel in your city; he regularly appears on a local cable TV show doing yard makeovers. Who would you be willing to pay more for, and who would you rather hire, given the choice? Both architects may choose the same plants and have equal years of landscaping experience— but you’ll be willing to pay more to the man who “wrote the book on it,” and who has landed TV spots, because you instinctively view him as the expert, the authority in his field.
 This is a critical point to grasp. If you are trying to attract the business of affluent individuals, they will not be drawn in by what you do, but by who you are. Your background, story, and authority credentials will drive the conversation far more than simply saying, “I put plants in people’s yards.”
 The next thing you need to understand is where affluent people go to get information, because it is a bit different from where non-affluent people go to get information.

 Affluent People Have Big Libraries. Poor People Have Big TVs Affluent people are readers, much more so than non-affluent people. You may have heard the saying, “Readers are leaders.” If you casually observe any company, any organization, in most cases, you will find the leaders of those organizations have a habit of reading. Ipsos Affluent Survey found that the more money a household makes, the more publications they read. Best-selling author Tom Corley also found during his five-year Rich Habits study that 85% of the wealthy read two or more educational books every month.
 Affluent people place more value on the collective wisdom gleaned from books than other socioeconomic classes. Because of this, if you want to attract affluent people, you need to reach them through a medium they


-----

##### avidly consume. In other words, to get on their radar you need to author a book. If you take that truth and combine it with the fact that people often pay more for who you are rather than what you do, you will better understand the rationale behind authority.
 I’ll turn to Dan Kennedy as an example. He has written over 30 books and has made publication a major part of his marketing strategy. Among them, a book titled The Ultimate Sales Letter has been on bookstore shelves without interruption since 1981. This book not only brings Dan clients, it established him as an expert and elevated his status above other copywriters. By deliberately positioning himself as the expert on sales letter writing, he attracts higher quality clients and is able to command large fees. To demonstrate, I’ll share a story in his words:

 Back when I flew commercial—I now travel by private jet—and when I was still on the hunt for clients and business, I always had copies of my books in my carry-on. In 1985, I was in first-class, on a flight from Phoenix to Houston, and the fellow next to me struck up the usual conversation. He identified himself as the owner of a Houston-based advertising agency and asked what I did. Instead of an answer or “elevator speech,” I stood up, got a copy of The Ultimate Sales Letter book, handed it to him, and excused myself for a trip to the bathroom. Two weeks later, I was conducting a nicely compensated training session for his staff copywriters, where he proudly told them, “Today, I have brought you the man who wrote the book on sales letter writing.”

 Writing a book aimed at your target audience is a powerful way to establish authority with the affluent, and should be added to your marketing strategy without hesitation. However, there are additional ways to establish it in the eyes of affluent, potential clientele. Authority itself can be manufactured, and a book is just one tool available to build it. The greater discipline of intentionally, strategically cultivating authority around yourself is known as “Authority Marketing,” and it can move mountains. Authority Marketing, in many ways, is about being comfortable having the spotlight shine on you. Not by accident or happenstance, but in a strategic
