##### positive attitude. But that’s not my principal argument here.) The value that motivates the Williams-Sonoma buyer to pay $19.00 for the apple is not in the apple at all. It may be in the impact of it given as a gift or served at a party. It may be in the feelings of success or prosperity or of rewarding oneself with indulgence that comes with making the purchase (even before ever taking a bite of the apple). It may be a sense of superiority, of buying or serving the best or something unique and unusual. Bragging rights: It’s a trophy apple, because, after all, we can’t really frame and hang our bankbooks on the wall for all visitors to see, so instead we opt for other visual representations of our achievement and success: trophy car, trophy house, trophy watch, trophy wife, trophy apple. It may be the time saved and convenience of ordering from the catalog rather than schlepping off to a gourmet store across town. It may be all those things. It is certainly mostly emotional and psychological, not practical. Thus, the $19.00 apple may very well contribute to the person’s emotional well-being in ways a grocery-store apple cannot.
 When I was young and poor and insecure, just starting in business and routinely asking older, more successful people to give me money, I bought and drove fancy Lincoln Continental Town Cars. And I always flew first class—at the time the only young kid up front, surrounded by 50-year-old executives. I didn’t drive the car or fly first class for its impact on others; I did so for its impact on me, for its programming of my own psyche. Neither the value of the car nor that of the first-class tickets for me had anything to do with getting from place to place. The value to me was purchased confidence and feelings of parity and belonging, of having arrived where I was actually trying to get.
 Personally, I don’t wear a watch at all. Years back, I owned and wore a Rolex® and a TAG Heuer®, but such things no longer interest me. But I pass no judgment on the fellow who wears one or ten and proudly flexes his cuffs at every chance in order to display them. I also understand that the different motivations different people have at different times of their lives for paying $5,000.00 or $50,000.00 for a wristwatch having nothing whatsoever to do with their need to know precisely what time it is. For that, of course, a $50.00 Timex® will do just fine.

### Stop Selling Products and Services

##### “Any fool can make soap. It takes a genius to sell soap.”

—MR. GAMBLE OF PROCTOR & GAMBLE

# A short preface … when I wrote the first version of this chapter for the
##### first edition of this book, published in 2009, even I didn’t foresee the rapidly accelerating, expansive wave of fundamental disinterest in things. In stuff. The most functional, basic products are no longer sold successfully based on functionality—phones are a great example. I have, in very recent years, become acutely aware that it is the poorly compensated, poorly skilled salesman, marketer, or copywriter who defaults to: Product/Service, Features/Benefits, Proposition/Price when selling. People, particularly the


-----

##### affluent, were losing interest in these tried-and-true approaches to selling when I first wrote this chapter. They have lost all tolerance for it now. Today’s luxury automobile is defined by its state-of-the-art technology, and sold by these features—not by its functionality as a car. Even a simple refrigerator is far from that. The highest priced models are digital, with giant iPads on their doors; they play videos. They respond to voice commands. They order whatever they are out of from Amazon. Water cannot be just water. It must be infused. It must have a story. It needs to convey status. The more affluent the consumer, the more capable they are of indulging these “significance impulses,” and the more they should be encouraged in doing so.
 There is an inside joke in the acting profession about the lowliest of walk-on extras, in a crowd in the background of the scene, there to wave and yell excitedly on cue. He disrupts the shoot, leaping from the crowd to confront the director with “But what’s my ‘motivation’?” This is today’s consumer. For even the most mundane of purchases, they are asking, “But what’s my ‘motivation’?”

 A cloth bag is not worth $4,000.00 without the Gucci® logo, or some other designer’s logo.
 You may feel that it is not worth $4,000.00 with the logo,7 either. But that reveals you remain hung up on what a product is, instead of what it symbolizes and represents, what status it confers on its owner, what emotional reactions it evokes, how it feels to purchase and own it, how others important to its owner feel about it.
 Few things are intrinsically worth their price. We have all accepted that a diamond engagement ring priced at least equal to two months’ salary is a requirement. But the diamond may be far, far, far more artificially inflated from its actual cost of materials than that Gucci® cloth bag. Diamonds are, in essence, polished dirt.

 A Great Ad Campaign Can Last Forever


-----

##### While most businesspeople think of De Beers’s dominance in the diamond industry as a result of controlling supply, truth is, it is more the result of creating and manipulating demand, thanks to brilliant advertising delivering a consistent theme for half a century.
 Finding rocks is easy. Selling rocks, tough. In the last 50 years, only two markets have opened up for stones. You wear them on your fingers when in love; you put them over the head of a loved one after death. The second was mastered by the Rock of Ages Corporation. The first by De Beers and its holding company, a near monopoly. The product itself—diamonds—was a loser. If you apply ordinary supply and demand, every diamond dug diminishes the value of those already dug because, in fact, diamonds are forever. Further, they are plentiful. De Beers recognized the problem with its mundane commodity, so it took the radical move of ignoring inherent value altogether. Instead the company made the product ritualistic and metaphoric, its purchase mandatory without practical purpose. This required the use of advertising to create demand where there was none, and no reason for any. This defies, of course, one of the oldest, most tired business axioms: find a need and fill it.
 Before the first ad ever appeared, some of the most extensive market research in advertising history was conducted, including direct questioning of thousands of men and women. The researchers determined that women had to be convinced that the diamond was the ritualized representation of love, commitment, and marriage. For women, the “diamond is forever” positioning began in advertising in 1914 and has continued unchanged to this day. And, to solve the forever problem, De Beers created the 10th anniversary ring, 25th anniversary ring, and similar products.
 The researchers also determined that men had to be helped past confusion about how to buy this polished rock. For men, the industry’s voodoo about carat weight, color, clarity, and so forth was created to provide logic where there was none. Men wanted to know what it was worth. Since it was arguably worth nothing, a logic had to be invented to assign worth to it. But in the cleverest of all gambits, a simpler shortcut for buying decisions was also created, stating the price in the frame of the buyer’s own wages: “How can you make two months’ salary last forever?” Today, the two-months-salary-rule is widely accepted by the public.
 In truth, what De Beers did for diamonds, anyone can do for anything.

##### You’re aware there are wines that sell for hundreds of dollars per bottle. But there is a Samuel Adams beer that sells for $140.00 per bottle. How can beer be worth such a price? You may answer: It can’t. Or answer: Why not?
 To make a giant income marketing to the affluent, you must erase your own deeply ingrained insistence at connecting price to worth and worth to function.
 A business associate told me how her neighbors paid a local architect $67,000.00 to draw up plans for a new house to be built on their beachfront lot. She found an architect to do what she judged to be identical work—if not better—for her new house to be built on her beachfront lot, paying just $7,000.00. And she questioned her neighbors’ sanity at failing to shop around, at paying such an outrageously inflated fee. She was proud of her bargain. But, contrary to protestations of the psychiatric community, there is abundant evidence that, in our society, insanity is subjective. My kudos go to the architect commanding his $67,000.00 fee. In all probability, he secured it for things other than a tube of blueprints. My associate may very well be correct in judging her $7,000.00 blueprints just as good as the ones delivered for $67,000.00. But her $7,000.00 ones didn’t come with the pride, status validation, bragging rights, and other emotional benefits her neighbors derived from searching out and hiring the biggest name, purportedly the most sought-after architect in the tri-state area, an architect, in fact, who had done the plans for a famous celebrity’s new beach house and who had three homes he’d designed featured in Town & Country magazine.

##### Marketing to values is more powerful than the marketing of products.


-----

##### On closer examination, this little story reveals even more. It shows two people’s very different values, and why what I call marketing to values is so much more important and powerful than is the marketing of products. My business associate is a woman who, her whole life, has competed with men, has made herself successful in a field difficult for women, has fought being taken for granted as a blonde beauty, and prides herself on her mental toughness, shrewdness, and won’t-take-no-for-an-answer-ism. One of her highest and most important personal values is that “nobody pulls the wool over my eyes.” Her neighbor is the second, younger wife of a wealthy doctor from a wealthy family—but she came from a poor family, grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, and, in her first marriage, lived a blue-collar life. Her beauty got her the trophy wife position, but she found herself thought of and gossiped about as a classless bimbo rather than accepted into the rich wives’ sorority. She has been a relentless social climber ever since, by donating to charities, sponsoring charity balls, patronizing the hairstylist, the cosmetic surgeon, the personal trainer, and being seen in the most current designer fashions, in an orchestrated effort to force her husband’s peers’ wives to accept her into their circle. One of her most treasured values is their acceptance or their envy. In reality, neither her payment of $67,000.00 to her architect nor my friend’s payment of her negotiated $7,000.00 to her architect had much to do with the comparative intrinsic or actual value of the work reflected in the two sets of blueprints.
 Another way to look at this, as a marketer, is a choice between selling things with ham-handed, brute force, typically against resistance, or selling aspirations and emotional fulfillments with finesse, typically with little resistance. Which seems like it might be more pleasurable? More profitable?

SPEECHWRITING DURING THE GERALD FORD ADMINISTRATION

# One of the most important facts about the mass-affluent is that they
##### do not trade up across the board. In his research, Michael Silverstein, author of Trading Up: Why Consumers Want New Luxury Goods—and How


-----

##### Companies Create Them, found that the typical mass-affluent person seeks little steps up in a lot of things, makes major steps up in only one to three things, and remains unmoved by luxury, brand, experience, or other factors in many other purchase categories. To put that in a frame of example, Mrs. Mass-Affluent may indulge in little things like going to Starbucks® rather than Denny’s® or to Cold Stone Creamery® instead of Dairy Queen®; may buy luxury-brand drop-downs like the line of Vera Wang® designer duds sold at Kohl’s®; may have one category of purchase where price is literally out the window—perhaps the care and feeding of her poodle—but may also still buy whatever coffee is on sale at the supermarket absent brand loyalty and recoil at the price for a Lexus®, preferring a Toyota®.
 She is a complicated creature. This makes marketing to the mass-affluent a complicated thing. Luxury-goods merchants have caught on and are very much engaging in what I just referred to as luxury drop-down. The makers of old-line luxury goods like Mercedes® automobiles or Coach® bags have created lower- priced products—usually smaller, with fewer features, but of the same quality and bearing the brand name—enabling the mass-affluent consumer to cross the luxury line without qualm. Some luxury merchants have found enormous leverage in leaving a huge chasm between their top-priced items and their new luxury-for-the-masses merchandise. Women who can’t afford one, and even those who can, might blanch at a $10,000.00 Vera Wang® dress but be quite happy to pay $99.00 for a Vera Wang® blouse at Kohl’s®. But without knowledge of the $10,000.00 dresses, they’d balk at such a high price for that blouse. Some marketers, including several of my clients, even go so far as to create and promote red-herring-priced goods or services they hope no one buys, only to set a standard that makes their actual prices seem imminently reasonable by comparison. I talk more about this in Chapter 28, “You Need to Choose Your Prices Carefully.”

 Their Little Indulgences Equal Big Profit Improvements Let’s go back to the Starbucks® and Cold Stone creameries® of the world. In these businesses, almost any marketer can find practical inspiration. While many mass-affluent consumers who are easily able to afford high-fee cosmetic dentistry, luxury cars, first-class travel, or designer fashions may


-----

##### find the price tags too big to swallow, they are easily wooed by little luxuries. For what seems like a small uptick in price—yet is a very big increase in profit margin for the merchant—the consumer can feel affluent yet not like somebody just throwing money around, can feel special without guilt. A $70,000.00 sticker on a car, a $35,000.00 fee quoted by the dentist, a $2,000.00 airline ticket—these are all so in-your-face. On the surface, the difference between the $70,000.00 car vs. the $35,000.00 car isn’t so great; a car may feel like a car. On the plane, all the seats arrive at the same time. But the fact that you can pick up a half gallon of ice cream at the supermarket for about the same price as a tiny cup of ice cream at Cold Stone Creamery® is more disconnected. The experience is dramatically different. At the creamery, you pick out your flavor, your ground-up pie crust and candy bars, and watch your dessert being made for you on a granite slab. “The Ultimate Ice Cream Experience.®” The price is still easily found in pocket or purse. It requires no thought, is done on impulse, feels good, and is easily rationalized if need be—I’ve had a hard day, I deserve it.
 These little indulgences do add up. It is frequently pointed out by Scrooge-like, annoyingly practical financial experts like David Bach, author of the Automatic Millionaire books, Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey, and their ilk that, were someone to forego all the Starbucks® and Cold Stone® and Omaha Steaks® purchases in favor of coffee brewed at home and carried in a thermos, ice cream bars bought at the grocery store and kept in the office freezer, and so on, he would quite easily save $25.00 to $50.00 a week, $1,300.00 to $2,600.00 a year, and, if it were all wisely invested even at modest interest rates, could add well over a quarter of a million dollars to his retirement fund or pay off his home mortgage during his working-life years. It is a wildly unpersuasive argument. As Pamela Danziger, author of Shopping: Why We Love It and How Retailers Can Create the Ultimate Customer Experience, puts it: “We want our little pleasures and we want them now.”
