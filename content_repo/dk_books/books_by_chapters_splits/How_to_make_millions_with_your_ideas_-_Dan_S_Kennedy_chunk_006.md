        Introduction
   SO YOU’VE GOT A “MILLION-
  DOLLAR IDEA”—NOW WHAT?
  beets This is the place and now is the time to turn your
    ideas into millions of dollars. In this book you’re going to
  meet more than fifty different people who’ve started with little
  more than an idea and made millions, many in very short order.
  Many of these people are my clients and friends, and I know
  them well. Others are people I’ve painstakingly researched for
  this book.
    Some of these people or their products or their businesses
  are famous; most are not. But each person [ll introduce you to
  demonstrates a different Millionaire-Maker Strategy. One of
  these strategies or a combination of them is bound to be right
  for you, too.
    It’s important for you to immediately understand what this
  book is not. It is not another dry, stuffy textbook about how to
  start, finance, and grow a business, according to Hoyle. If you
  want to know how to write a business plan, for example, there
  are plenty of books on library and bookstore shelves that can
  teach you how to do that. I can’t mean a good reason to write
  or to publish another one.

     Formulas for Success Don’t Work, So You
         Won’t Find a Formula Here!
     This is not a masterfully outlined and organized, step-by-
   step, 1-2-3 kind of book. Frankly, I don’t think people actually
   get rich that way. Most of the very methodical people I meet are
   working for wages as somebody else’s bean counter.
    Success seems to be a more chaotic (and more exciting) pro-
   cess of grabbing this idea from here, that piece of information
   from over there, goofing this up, seeing that work, and fitting puz-
   zle pieces together until you have just the right combination for
   your unique situation. Hopefully, this book shortcuts all that for
   you, but within its pages, you’re still going to be grabbing a piece
   here and a piece there and piecing them together in the way best
   suited to your purposes. If there was one formula for success,
   there’d be only one book about it. Formulas for success don’t work
   any more than diets do—if a diet worked, there’d only be one diet!
      I Wish the Fellows with the Cute Little
      Patches on the Elbows of Their Corduroy
     Sports Jackets Would Stay Off the Business
         Battlefield—Don’t You?
    Although this is a book about turning ideas into money, it is
   not a book of ideas. I have long despised business books written
   by fuzzy-headed academics, professors in cushy jobs on cam-
   puses, accountants, lawyers, and hotshot consultants from big,
   fat consulting firms, all spouting theories. I speak a lot, often on
   programs with many other speakers, and I always warn my au-
   diences about the many speakers who ‘‘run businesses only in
   their nightmares and sell only in their memories.’’ Listen, I live
   and work every day where you do—in the real world, where
   they eat their young. So, here’s a little promise: Every single

  personally for my businesses or my clients’ businesses, and that
  has been repetitively validated.
    Should This. Book Have a $10,000 Price Tag?
   Most of the information in this book has grown out of my
  own experience and my consulting activities, and is from my
  Millionaire-Maker Seminars. It might interest you that people
  have traveled literally from just about every nook and cranny of
  the United States and Canada, as well as from a handful of other
  countries, and paid no less than $295 to as much as $3,495 per
  person to attend these seminars.
    At our $3,495 per-person Millionaire-Maker Direct Market-
  ing Super Conferences, attendees can come back, at an alumni
  rate of $1,000—and over 90 percent of all attendees have done
  that at least once, many several times. I don’t tell you that to
  brag. A long time ago, a mentor advised me: Don’t worry about |
  impressing people, just get busy inspiring them. So that’s what
  I’m trying to do. I just want you to understand and appreciate
  the value of what you now hold in your hands. It’s much more
  than the dinky cover price on the book. It’s at least the equivalent
  of a few seminars—$10,000 or so. It represents millions of dol-
  lars of mistakes, tens of millions of dollars of notable successes,
  hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of goods and services sold
  in sixty-three different business categories.
   I hope you’ll consider all that, because I know that what you
  get out of this book will have a relationship to the value that
  you place on it.
    P.S.: Throughout this book, you will find a total of forty-five
  numbered Millionaire-Maker Strategies. They do not appear in
  numerical order in the book, as different people’s stories illus-
  trate different strategies. At the end of chapter 12, I’ve reassem-
  bled them for you in a logical order, as you might try to apply
  them to your own idea, product, service, or business. That order
  is not one of relative importance but one of relationship; it shows

  THE EIGHT BEST WAYS TO
   (STILL) MAKE A FORTUNE
  FROM SCRATCH IN AMERICA
    here must be tens of thousands of different categories and
   types of businesses, methods, and means of marketing and
  distributing products and promoting services. Maybe more. With
  new ones, or, at least, new hybrids being found or figured out
  every day. We are a very inventive society, especially when it
  comes to ways to make money.
   However, you do not need to be an innovator or pioneer if
  you carefully evaluate your chief objectives for bringing a prod-
  uct to market or building a business. Money made by pioneering
  is no more valuable than money made from reliable, predictable
  means. A dollar is a dollar. A million is a million.
   From all of my own entrepreneurial experience—failures as
  well as successes—and that of my clients, I’ve identified the
  eight highest probability areas of opportunity, where millions can
  still be made from scratch. These days, I try to concentrate my
  own efforts and business interests in these areas, and to direct
  my Clients into these areas. Why? The key words: ‘‘highest prob-
  ability.’’ Launching a new idea, product, service, or business is
  risky and problematic enough without doing it in a low proba-
  bility of success environment. Climbing a huge, forbidding, dan-
  gerous mountain is tough enough; why try doing it during the
  worst snow, rain, ice, and wind storm of the season? So, this
  chapter serves two purposes. First, it’s an overview of the entire
  book. Second, it sets up these eight categories of high probability

   egories together as possible.
     In chapter 12, I revisit these eight ways with brief, concise
   lists of the key how-tos for each, revealed mostly by example
   throughout this book.
     High Probability, A rea of Opportunity #1:
       Surprise! It’s ‘‘Ordinary’’ Businesses!
     As you drive down the street tomorrow, on your way to
   work, or as you run errands and go shopping on Saturday, you’ ll
   encounter doughnut shops, restaurants, dry cleaners, bookstores,
   video rental stores, gift shops, and dozens of other ‘‘ordinary’’
   businesses. We give most of these businesses very little thought.
   These shopkeepers seem to have, in most cases, just created jobs
   for themselves. In some years they may make as little as
   $25,000, in their best years no more than three times that, work-
   ing longer hours and harder than in a comparable job. Nothing
   very remarkable about any of that, is there?
     Yet, here’s what’s very interesting. Somewhere in America,
   in every one of those business categories, you can find someone
   who has found ways to turn an ordinary business into an extraor-
   dinary profit machine. I profile several in chapter 2. And, maybe
   even more interesting, is that more of America’s self-made mil-
   lionaires own and have accumulated their wealth through these
   ordinary businesses than through any other means.
     That local dry cleaner might surprise you. As you drop off
   your cleaning, you notice that the owner is always there working.
   What you don’t know is that he owns the piece of land or the
   shopping center where his shop is located, that he has a corporate
   pension fund that has sheltered a chunk of his earnings from
   taxes each year for the past ten, and that the dry cleaning busi-
   ness has a collection of extra-profit centers: It refers customers
   to a carpet cleaning company and receives commissions; ag-
   gressively markets fur, suede, and leather cleaning services; sells

```
  livery dry cleaning routes. All things considered, he’s doing
  about double the normal, one-store average in the dry cleaning
  industry. And that, over ten years, has quietly made the owner
  rich.
   The exciting truth is that you can take just about any ordinary
  business, do its core business and serve and satisfy customers
  just a little bit better than the norm, add clever, extra profit cen-
  ters to the core business, and manage the money very intelli-
  gently—and that business will make you rich.
     High Probability Area of Opportunity #2:
      The Best Equity Is Exclusivity
    If you’re just starting to consider any and all business op-
  portunities, you will be confronted, through advertising, business
  opportunity and trade shows, and other sources, with a myriad
  of chances to distribute or market other people’s products and
  services—distributorships, dealerships, franchises, and so on.
  You can make money this way. But it’s very, very difficult to
  get rich this way.
   Wealth is most often linked to exclusive ownership or control
  of a particular concept, product, or service. In chapter 3, I’ll
  introduce you to people who have followed this path to riches.
  Rather than be a cog in someone else’s wheel, they made certain
  to own the whole wheel outright.
    If someone else has control over your destiny, if someone
  else can change the economics of your business, alter your mar-
  keting rights, impede your creativity, sell the parent company,
  or otherwise unexpectedly interfere in your business, you don’t
  really have your own business. One of the insider secrets to
 making millions is doing everything possible to minimize cir-
 cumstances beyond your control.

     High Probability Area of Opportunity #3:
           Serve, Serve, Serve
     In 1994 almost all the new jobs created in the United States
   were in the service category. Why? Because those are the busi-
   nesses expanding most consistently and rapidly. People at all
   levels of society are unbelievably pressed for time, so they need
   ‘‘servers’’ to do for them what they do not have time to do for
   themselves. In chapter 5, I'll show you how to capitalize on this
   trend by incorporating service elements in any business or
   product.
     I'll tell you one illustrative story here, quickly. A client of
   mine, International Correspondence Schools, has been in the
   business of selling in-home career training since 1890. These
   days, one of their most popular home study courses is ‘‘Learn
   to Use a Personal Computer.’’’ The product they sell is this
   home-study course: the books, manuals, videotapes, audiotapes,
   and computer software. But the service element they’ve added
   is ICS ON-LINE, their ‘‘electronic campus.’’ Right through the
   computer, modem, and telephone line, their students can tap into
   group discussions and classes, leave and receive messages from
   helpful instructors twenty-four hours a day, share software, and
   much more. Learn from.this example of putting a service element
   into a product and you’ll possess one of the most topical insider
   secrets for making millions.
     High Probability Area of Opportunity #4:
        Go Ye Forth and Multiply
    One of the great benefits of turning an ordinary business into
   an extraordinary profit machine and of owning or controlling
   exclusive products is the ability to get rich through duplication
   and multiplication. This is a great, big, hungry country of con-
   sumers. When you have a business that works in one place, there

  was one McDonald’s—the brothers’ original restaurant. One
  Subway shop. One drive-through car wash. One athletic-shoe
  store. One fast-photo-processing shop. One of something. One
  of everything.
    In chapter 6, I’ll introduce you to some of the ‘‘masters’’ of
  duplication. You’ll see that even simple ideas, products, and
  services, if properly ‘‘packaged,’’ can make you rich through
  duplication or multiplication.
     High Probability Area of Opportunity #5:
          Go Direct!
    Direct Marketing is one of the fastest-growing categories of _
  business. Bypassing all the traditional complexity and costs of
  manufacturers’ representatives or salesforces; wholesalers, job-
  bers, and other middlemen; retail stores; and brand-identity,
  image-building advertising, more and more companies are either
  going directly to the consumers themselves or moving their prod-
  ucts and services through established direct marketers.
   How do you go direct? With ads or direct-mail campaigns
  or TV or radio commercials that bring the end user directly in
  contact with the manufacturer or publisher, with you, usually via
  an 800 number or the mail. Products that were never sold this
  way in past years are finding new success in direct marketing—
  furniture, security systems, computers, food, even automobiles.
  Services are now sold this way too, such as long-distance tele-
  phone and flower delivery. Today, if you want to send someone
  flowers, you don’t schlepp down to the florist shop, you just pick
  up the phone and call a toll-free number. If you want fresh Maine
  lobsters for a big cookout this weekend at your home in Ne-
  braska, you don’t go to a supermarket or specialty foods store;
  you call a toll-free number and have the lobsters delivered right
  to your door. What’s next? Maybe your fortune.
    In chapters 7 and 8, I take you on an eye-opening, oppor-

     High Probability Area of Opportunity #6:
         Profit from the Information Age
     The most traded, most consumed, most sought-after, and
   most valued commodity of our time is not precious stones, oil,
   or real estate. It is ‘‘specialized information.’’ All around you,
   in every imaginable form, people are profiting by selling what
   they know or know how to do. Do you know how to plan a fail-
   safe wedding? Brew beer in a basement? Make famous recipes
   at home? Lose weight fast? Make money with a computer? Get
   air travel discounts? Build birdhouses? The list of types of in-
   formation being turned into profits would itself fill a book bigger
   than this one.
    A quick example: A friend of mine has figured out a way
   dentists can give complete dental exams in half the usual time.
   That is his only piece of information. With that piece of infor-
   mation alone, he has developed his own how-to course for den-
    tists, another for dental assistants and dental hygienists, and two
   video products, and has created a $100,000 per year home-based,
   part-time business. And, after going through chapter 9, you’ll
   quickly see how he can turn that simple foundation into a
   million-dollar empire.
             - High Probability Area of Opportunity #7:
       Fame and Fortune Do Go Together
    A friend of mine, Paul Hartunian, has made as much as
   $400,000 in one day. He has been written about in Forbes mag-
   azine and countless newspapers, been on The Phil Donahue
   Show, many other talk shows, and built two different businesses,
   all through publicity. By making himself famous—once as an
   expert in collecting, investing in, trading, and selling celebrity
   autographs, and once as an expert in meeting and creating rela-
   tionships with beautiful women—Paul has made a fortune with-

  here today, gone tomorrow, or one ad in one magazine that will
  be gone in a month. For the same $1,000, I can fax 7,000 news
  releases to 7,000 different media contacts and make the equiv-
  alent of hundreds of those ads happen.’’
    There does seem to be an inexhaustible demand for famous
  people. There are more TV talk shows on the air than ever be-
  fore. Talk radio is booming. Magazines like People are huge hits.
  It seems that people are interested in interesting people. In chap-
  ter 10, you’ll meet people using this interest to their advantage
  in fascinating, imitatable ways.
    High Probability Area of Opportunity #8:
       Creative, Clever Combinations
    It’s hard to find an example of just one of these ways of
  turning ideas into millions. And that fact, in and of itself, points
  you to one of the greatest millionaire-maker secrets of all.
     Three Additional Ways to Look at Businesses
          and Business Opportunities
   As you look at all the examples in this book, you'll see that
  they fit one of these three categories: product-driven businesses,
  market-driven businesses, or media-driven businesses. .
    In a product-driven business, the product itself is so appeal-
  ing, unique, and promotable that it gets sold through a variety
  of media and methods, to or through a variety of markets. The
  Nancy Kwan Pearl Cream product mentioned in this book is such
  a unique cosmetic product that it has the power to drive an entire
  business. It is sold through direct-response TV commercials and
  infomercials, print ads in magazines and tabloids, direct-mail,
  catalogs, health food stores, and drugstores. It has attracted
  loyal, responsive customers of all ages—teens to senior Citi-
