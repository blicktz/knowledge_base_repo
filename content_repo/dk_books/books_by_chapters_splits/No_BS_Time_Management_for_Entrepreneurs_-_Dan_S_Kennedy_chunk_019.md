order. Many of these chains have in-room, individual fax machines,

which I find very useful. Increasingly, they are bundling
electrical outlets, Internet hookups, and the phone conveniently on a desk. The on-airport Hyatt in Orlando, Florida, l

be Hilton at O'Hare in Chicago, and the Marriott in Detroit,
Michigan, are wonderfully convenient.

If price is no object at all, THE best hotels for business travel**ers are The Four Seasons. There are Four Seasons properties in**
Austin, Texas; Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Houston; Los Angeles;
Maui; New York; Newport Beach, California; Palm Beach, I'lorida;

Philadelphia; San Francisco; Santa Barbara, California;
Seattle; Toronto; Vancouver, British Columbia; and Washington,
DC. The Vancouver Four Seasons, for example, has in the room a
desk, outlet within reach, desk phone, bedside phone AND bath­
room phone, and voice mail; plus laundry or dry cleaning pick­
ups and deliveries FOUR times daily; fast room service;
overnight shoe shines; and a staff that jumps.

If costs are a big concern, Marriott Courtyards and Fairfield Inns

have well-designed rooms where you can spread out, work,
and be comfortable, but you sacrifice all sorts of services.

Embassy Suites are good values, and every room is a mini-suite,
so you can meet comfortably with as many as three people at a
time in the living room half of the suite.

By the way, if you work in your room during the day, you
will be tempted to hang the "Please Make Up This Room Early"
sign on your door as you leave, to go to a breakfast meeting or
such. I know better but still occasionally do it, because it is so
easy. However, that sign telegraphs to thieves that the room is
unoccupied. It is safer—and more effective—to call "housekeeping," explain that you'll be out only for an hour and ask that the
room be made up during that time period. This seems to work
about 90% of the time.

###### Communicating while Traveling
Personally, I refuse to carry a cell phone, but you probably do. It
is extremely useful, if you can use it for outbound calling to suit
you but not have others using it to reach out and bother you. I
watch businesspeople already worn to a frazzle by traveling, piling on the taking or making of cell phone calls while taking every
step through the airport, eating, standing in lines, boarding the
plane, getting off the plane. They are not doing themselves any
favors. If a call is important to make, it deserves a bit more
thought and a more conducive environment than the boarding
ramp, while you are surrounded by screaming children and
being bumped by the cattle drive. Having a cell phone to make
different airline reservations or handle problems caused by
delays: good. Having it steal all your time: bad.

The routine I've arrived at is to (a) try my best to call into the
office once during the day, (b) have faxes waiting for me on

rival at my hotel, and (c) check in at home once each evening,lite

bigger problem is communicating with clients, returning (tills

from clients, vendors, etc., and being unable to take return
Calls. I train my clients, as best they can be trained, to communicate via fax rather than phone, and that pre-empts a lot of telephone tag. I also try to return calls from my hotel, when I can stay in

the room for a couple of hours, to take bounceback calls. I will
often block two or three hours to sit comfortably in my room and lake

calls, via pre-arranged, back-to-back phone appointments, and
knock them off with maximum efficiency.

Most road warriors now travel with laptops or PDAs, use
e-mail, and do much of their distance communication this way.
My comment is identical to my advice about the cell phone: if
you control and use these tools so they serve you well, fine. Do
not let them control you.

If I'm on the road for an extended period of time, big rubber
tubs of faxes and mail will be waiting for me on my return. The
only way to prevent this daunting mountain from being built is
to have all my mail shoved in a big FedEx sack and sent to me
once or twice while I'm away. I tend to do this with trips of five
days or more. I can get through a few days' mail while watching
an in-room movie or Monday Night Football, throw out a lot, jot
notes on some, and move some back to the office so action can be
taken on it the next morning.

###### The Extinction of the Travel Agent
in the past few years, the Internet and the airlines have, in
unholy alliance, done their level bests to kill off travel agents. The
travel agents, by being ignorant of positioning, marketing, and

selling successfully against commoditization (they needed my
book No B.S. Sales Success) stood there and took the beating.
Many have closed their doors.

The airlines' behavior has been reprehensible. By slashing
commissions, blocking agents from assisting clients with mileage
redemptions, and aggressively switching customers to Web sites
and direct, online purchasing, they have engaged in a very deliberate industry conspiracy to destroy the travel agents.

For frequent business travelers, profound dangers abound in
buying air travel direct, online, or through secretarial staff. In a
procedure exposed in several national TV news programs but
still mostly unknown to travelers, discount tickets purchased
online and tickets purchased from independent, nonairline Web
sites often carry "secret codes" that move these passengers to the
very bottom of the pecking order whenever anything goes
wrong. Many of these tickets and Web site ticket sellers have
truly bizarre "weasel clauses" and fine print warnings and
restrictions. I have several clients who have shared true horror
stories with me about being stranded for several days with these
tickets. Conversely, I'm amused by people I know willing to
spend 30 or 60 minutes or more searching the Internet for fare
discounts. I am certainly not willing to trade away a $1,000.00
hour of my time for $87.00 in discounts.

I find a competent travel agent worth his weight in gold. I
use the agent to check different flights, fax me options, check
every possible connection and cost, maximize my frequent flyer
miles, and think for me so I don't always have to remember to
ask the right hotel questions, to arrange for a limo, and so forth.
An agent like this saves untold amounts of time in planning, and
on the trips themselves.

###### As You Head Out the Door... Koad
trip! As you head to the airport or the highway, you have
to ask yourself if you have a real strategy for maximum efficiency,ind

productivity; minimum stress and agony. There's nothing that

can ruin a schedule, suck up more time, sap more energy, .md
otherwise cause more chaos and problems than travel, so
you must take many proactive steps to protect yourself—and
your time—as best you can.
