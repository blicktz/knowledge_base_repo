 his company, Gripping Solutions, was born.
   At the urging of a friend, he first applied his design to cre-
 ating new handlebar grips for mountain bikes, and the product
 is acknowledged by championship mountain bikers, mountain-
 bike product retailers, and doctors as far superior to anything
 else on the market. Yet, sales are so slow that Tom and his wife
 still run the company single-handedly, go to gatherings of
 mountain-bike riders to demo and sell them personally, take or-
 ders, pack and ship boxes, and still can’t seem to set aside any
 money for advertising or developing additional products.
   Through Tom’s almost annoying insistence at telling any-
 body and everybody about his grip technology, he wound up
 convincing a buyer for the Smith & Hawken gardening tools
 catalog, who happened to buy a mountain-bike grip, to order
 grips made for several of Smith & Hawken’s most popular tools.
 So, Gripping Solutions will be in a Smith & Hawken catalog
 soon, and although it has been a financial hardship for Tom to
 do the redesign work to apply his design to those specific tools,
 this could be a big breakthrough.
   There’s no doubt in Tom’s mind that he can develop golf
 club grips that will improve anybody’s game, tennis racket grips
 that will improve anybody’s game, industrial product grips that
 will improve safety and reduce repetitive-motion injuries, and,
 well, the applications are endless. But the funds aren’t.
   In 1994, Gripping Solutions, Inc., stacked up only $164,000
 in sales and lost about $20,000 doing it. In spite of ringing en-
 dorsements from just about every bicycling magazine, the En-
 durance products do not race off store racks—they are priced
 higher than other grips by necessity, and, so far, nobody’s found
 a way to get the package or in-store displays to tell enough of
 Tom’s story to sell the item. Until recently, the product was
 judged as too inexpensive and too price-competitive to permit
 marketing direct to the consumer, but, at my urging, a price
 increase and packaging of two pairs together as a set is being
 done, so that a reasonable attempt can be made at marketing .
 direct to bicyclists by direct-mail and direct-response print ads.

   50-50 shot.
     Tom is now aggressively seeking venture capital through ex-
    clusive licensing and joint ventures—for [example, ] [trying ] [to ] [find ]
    a golf products company that might invest in his company or
    give him R&D money in exchange for exclusive use of the tech-
   nology for grips for their golf clubs. And he is wrestling with
    the possibilities of going to friends, relatives, neighbors, maybe
    even customers and dealers to sell stock in the company, but he
    is fearful of giving up equity and control. But the time Tom can
   devote to this mission is limited—he also has to sell enough
    grips to keep the doors open and the lights on. And even spend-
    ing the money to get on an airplane and go to a candidate com-
   pany’s offices for a meeting or to a trade show is a seriously
    debated, agonizing decision.
     Tom’s struggle is the story of the inventor. Reading this,
   ‘Wilson Call will empathize instantly. And if you are going to
    go down this path, be prepared for this sort of struggle. It’s not
    for the weak of heart.
     However, should Tom tough it out and solve his marketing
   problem in the bicycling industry, that alone might yield million-
    dollar profits over two or three years. A deal to supply a major
   manufacturer or marketer of golf clubs might be worth hundreds
    of thousands of dollars a year, maybe even more. Success in the
   Smith & Hawken catalog could lead to distribution of various
        _ kinds of grips through hundreds of other catalogs, and provide
    a million dollars or more a year in profits. All that can happen
   —if Tom can tough it out.

              IF YOU’RE GOING TO INVENT,
            CONSIDER MARKETS FIRST.
      In retrospect, Tom Doyle feels—correctly, in my opinion—
    he would have been much better off perfecting, manufacturing,
    and marketing grips for golf clubs, tennis rackets, or even fishing
    poles before mountain bikes, based on the size and responsive-

    An Invention Story with a Very Happy Ending
        Full of Millionaire-Maker Strategies
   On a warm, sunny autumn day in 1985 in the small town of
 Sharon, Pennsylvania, James Winner walked out the door of his
 office building, eager to get into his prized Cadillac—equipped,
 incidentally, with a factory-installed security system—and enjoy
 the ride home after a tough day at work. Unfortunately, there
 was an empty parking space where his Cadillac had been. Right
 in front of his own business, a thief had bypassed the Cadillac’s
 alarm system and stolen it!
   That’s how Jim Winner got the idea for a now-famous prod-
 uct, THE CLUB. He brought THE CLUB to the market in 1986
 and only eight years later, THE CLUB has become a $100-
 million-a-year company. The now-famous CLUB, brilliant in its
 simplicity, clamps to any car’s steering wheel and makes it im-
 possible to pilot the car. Getting it off requires more time and
 effort than most car thieves are willing to invest, so they pass a
 car with the bright-colored CLUB fastened to its steering wheel
 and move on to an easier target. Jim’s company guarantees up
 to $500 against the car owner’s insurance deductible if a vehicle
 is stolen while protected by THE CLUB and, in 1992, received
 theft claims for less than one-sixteenth of 1 percent of the 3.1
 million CLUBs that had been sold up until that time.
   Recently, Jim’s been busy marketing additional security
 products, notably including THE DOOR CLUB, for homes,
 which received the 1993 Retailer’s Choice Award from Do-It-
 Yourself Retailing Magazine.

     AN ENEMY INTO ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY.

   perience with the very frustrating crime of auto theft sent him
    in a very profitable direction. People everywhere are increasingly
    frustrated with auto theft and home burglary, worried about their
   personal and family safety, and angry at the criminal element in
    their communities. With auto theft on the rise, Jim Winner
   stepped forward with an easily understood, easily used, afford-
    able, and credible solution.
     Incidentally, the entire anti-crime industry is booming, so Jim
   Winner is riding a wave. Sales of Mace, the leading self-defense
    spray, jumped 36% from 1991 to 1993. Quorum, a newcomer to
    security products, using an Amway-like multilevel marketing
   system with independent distributors, has gone from 10 million
    in sales in 1991 to well over 100 million in 1993. All this puzzles
   some business analysts, because, overall, crime is not, statisti-
    cally, getting worse. However, the public feels unsafe, and is
    trying to buy a safe environment.
     MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #4: KEEP IT SIMPLE.
     In an increasingly high-tech, complicated world, there’s tre-
   mendous opportunity in going against the grain with a low-tech,
   simple solution to important needs or desires. There’s certainly
   nothing high-tech about Jim Winner’s CLUB, but it works.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #7:
          PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER WITH AN
           EXCEPTIONAL GUARANTEE.
     ‘Satisfaction guaranteed’? may be an overused phrase, and
   some marketing experts will argue that point, but I believe the
   American consumer so frequently has the experience of spending
   money on products and services that fail to live up to their prom-
    ises, that he is more responsive than ever to a particularly bold,
    clear, and specific guarantee. For years, in my seminars on mar-
    keting, I pointed to the original Domino’s guarantee as an ex-
   ample of how an entire business can be built on one bold,

 less).
          - With THE CLUB, you are guaranteed payment of up to $500
 of your insurance deductible if your car is stolen while protected
 by the device. As a marketer, I’m going to tell you a couple of
 the “‘tricks’’ of that guarantee. First of all, a lot of people who
 buy THE CLUB or get it as a gift never use it. How many, still
 in their unwrapped packages, are sitting in car trunks or corners
 of garages? There’s no way to know, but my bet is it’s in the
 tens of thousands or more. Second, some people are going to
 forget about that guarantee as time passes between their purchase
 of the device and a theft incident a year or years later. These
 and similar facts of human behavior diminish this company’s
 apparent financial risk attached to this guarantee left and right.
 So this strong guarantee, like most strong guarantees, is not
 nearly as risky or costly as it might seem on the surface.
   Then, as a business manager, I’d speculate that this cost is
 factored into the selling price and ‘‘reserved’’ to pay these
 claims. At the very beginning, Jim Winner had to guess, had to
 have great faith in his product, and had to stick his neck out
 making this guarantee. But soon, as a consistent, and in this case
 very small, percentage of claims became known, the company
 need only add the cost of claims to the product and reserve that
 portion of sales to be perfectly safe. (if THE CLUB is a $50:
 item on average, 100 of them represents $5,000 at retail, ap-
 proximately $2,500 in wholesale revenue to the company. Sup-
 pose the claims are one-sixteenth of 1 percent. One-sixteenth of
 1 percent of $5,000 is $3, divided by 100 units, which is a whop-
 ping 3 cents per unit!)
   For the price of three cents per unit, Jim Winner gets a super-
 strength guarantee he can brag about in all his advertising, on
 his product packaging, and in retail displays. And, think about
 this: The person who does have a car stolen and obtains that
 $500 from THE CLUB tells everybody he knows what a fantas-
 tic company this is and how they honor their guarantee.
   This is good business—good for the customer, very good for
 the company. |

    How to Print All the Money You Want, Legally!
     Here’s my personal favorite: paper-and-ink, audio and video
    ‘‘information products.’’ With these types of products, you can
    create or license or get exclusive [rights ] [or ] [private ] [label, ] [you ] [can ]
    manufacture as needed (publish on demand), and you can enjoy
   huge profit markups. I’ve devoted all of chapter 9 to this lucra-
    tive area of opportunity.
      Securing Certain Exclusive Rights Is Almost
      as Good as Inventing—Heck, Maybe Better
     Why would a manufacturer give you exclusive rights to a
    product, especially without requiring you to put up any money?
     To many people’s surprise, this happens all the time, and is
    perfectly logical. Let’s assume you are a manufacturer of cos-
    tume jewelry wristwatches. Your company makes all kinds of
    different watches: men’s, women’s, kids’, watches with sports-
    related faces, watches that are look-alikes of very expensive
    watches, and so on, and you supply discount-store and drugstore
    chains like Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, Gold Circle, and Walgreen
    with these watches. That’s your business.
     Along comes a guy who says he understands the freestanding
    kiosk business, is starting a company to put people in shopping
    centers with freestanding vendor carts or kiosks, wants to use
    your watches as one of the inventory packages and product lines,
    and needs exclusive rights to this type of distribution. And he
    presents himself in a professional and businesslike manner. He
    asks for a one-year exclusive limited to that type of distribution,
    renewable annually for five years only as long as he buys at least
    100,000 watches the first year and at least 200,000 watches each
    year thereafter. He’s not asking for credit, or for you to do any-
    thing special. He’ll pay cash with orders, and you’ll drop-ship
    watches in assortments of 500, reorders no less than 50, to his

 900,000 watches, more or less, over the next five years, in a way
 you have never sold watches before. If he fails, you’re still going
 to sell some number of watches less than 100,000 but in the
 thousands the first year, in a way you’ve never sold watches
 before. And you had and have no intention of selling watches
 that way on your own. So, although the exclusive has plenty of
 value to that guy, it has no value to you. You’re giving up some-
 thing that costs you nothing and has no value to you, with the
 possibility of getting a whole new distribution network in return.
 You have the proverbial nothing-to-lose-everything-to-gain sit-
 uation. Marketers using this very argument carve out exclusives
 for themselves with tens of thousands of manufacturers every
 year. This is sometimes called the “‘Cossman Method,’’ after
 E. Joseph Cossman.
   Joe Cossman is one of the few early pioneers of the mail-
 order business who specialized in securing exclusive mail-order
 rights to products already being sold via other means, then
 exploiting them through direct marketing and publicity. I met
 Joe when I arranged an infomercial deal for him, and I helped
 him create an updated version of one aspect of his ae home
 study course for sale on television.
   Let me tell you a little bit about one of Joe’s twenty suc-
 cesses: Fly Cake. One Sunday, Joe was reading the classifieds
 in the newspaper—one of many techniques he’s used to find
 interesting products—and he spotted a little ad that read:
           Send in $1.00 and
           we’ll send you Fly Cake.
              It kills flies.
 So he sent in a dollar and got the product. It was a doughnut-
 shaped, solid cake of chemicals that seemed to attract flies, and
 killed them on contact. When Joe contacted the inventor, he
 learned that during World War II the inventor had been in the
 army and had been given an assignment to find an effective
 insecticide for the South Pacific. The sprays being used didn’t

    for twenty years, made Fly Cake and sold it only through clas-
    sified advertisements in newspapers and magazines. In total, he’d
    sold about 300,000 Fly Cakes.
     Joe said, ‘‘Give me the exclusive rights for this product and
    I’ll sell a million a year, or I’ll give you back everything I’ve
   done with it and it won’t cost you a cent.’’ Joe and the inventor
    reached an agreement, exempting classified advertising, but oth-
    erwise giving Joe exclusive marketing rights for Fly Cake. ‘‘At
    that moment,’’ Joe told me with enthusiasm, ‘‘it was as if I had
    invented the product and owned the factory!”’
     Joe sold Fly Cake in an incredible variety of ways. Within
    three years, he’d sold over 8 million Fly Cakes. He subsequently —
    sold the business and his rights. Fly Cake alone made Joe more
    than a millionaire.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #26:
            IF YOU DON’T ASK, YOU CAN’T GET.
     Don’t assume you can’t secure exclusive rights to a desired
    product or that manufacturers won’t work with you because
    you’re too small or any other limiting belief. There are enough ac-
    tual obstacles to overcome without manufacturing more of them in
    your own imagination. The only way to know for sure how any in-
    dividual or group of people will respond is to make your best pos-
    sible argument, under the best possible circumstances.
        How to Make Your Fortune with
           **Private Label’’ Products
     The private label industry is, to me, one of the most inter-
    esting and appealing places to go for products on earth.
      For some years, I had an interest in a small network mar-
    keting company, and at peak we had nearly 100 products under
    our label. By all appearances and perceptions, they were ‘‘our
    products,’’ yet they were standard or stock formulas being made
