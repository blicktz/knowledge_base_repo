In the speaking business, I know many people believe they
are much better speakers than I am. Some of them are right, and
they are befuddled and antagonized by how well I've done, mystified at how I came to be on the giant public events with huge
audiences and they didn't. "I'm better" or "I've been at this longer"—"I

I suppose the biggest problem with all that is the word
"should." It implies "entitlement." And our entire nation is being
rotted out by the viral spread of "entitlement thinking."

Everybody seems to think they are somehow entitled to
something. The Indians think they are entitled to become taxexempt multimillionaires through gambling because of wrongs
done to their ancestors. Minorities believe they are entitled to college admission and jobs based on quotas, regardless of their
qualifications. Women believe they are entitled to all sorts of special treatment from employers so they can have children, raise a
family, and develop a career; "have their cake and eat it too."
Senior citizens believe they are entitled to government benefits
far in excess of whatever they paid in, to free medical care for life,
regardless of how long they live or who has to pay. We even have
a nutcase congressman who has suggested that every American
is entitled to a home and a job, and that our government should
guarantee them these things. The so-called "Gen Xers" seem to
think they are entitled to everything, right now, for doing nothing. And I could keep going. (Have I offended everybody yet?)

Here's the real deal: nobody's entitled to

anything but opportunity. Not even to a

level playing field. Nothing. Nada.

Just opportunity.

This is one reason why a person fails to advance much from
one year to the next; he is so busy whining about how unfair

everything is and feeling sorry for himself that he has n o lime U -11
to make anything happen. But,

as Eric Hoffer, author of The True Believer: Thoughts _on_ _I lie_
_Nature of Mass Movements, wrote: "There are many who find a good_
_alibi far more attractive than an achievement, for an achievement does_
not settle anything permanently. We still have to prove that we are
as good today as we were yesterday. But when we have a valid
alibi for not achieving anything, we are fixed, so to speak, for life.
Moreover, when we have an alibi for not writing a book and not
painting a picture and so on, we have an alibi for not writing the
greatest book and not painting the greatest picture. Small wonder
that the effort expended and the punishment endured in obtaining a good alibi often exceed the effort and grief requisite for the
attainment of a most marked achievement." Hoffer's
observation is one of the finest, most accurate, and
profound I have ever encountered. I

say: no one who is good at making excuses

is also good at making money. The skills are

mutually exclusive. Alibi-itis.

"I'd do that IF ...." The kids were grown. I wasn't
so tired after a day's work. I had more support from my spouse.
I had a better education. I didn't live in this terrible neighborhood. And on and on and on.

How about writing a book? Scott Turow, now one of the
wealthiest and most successful fiction authors of our time, wrote
his first novel longhand, a page at a time, while riding the train,

commuting to and from the offices of his law practice. My friends
Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield wrote and had published
or self-published God knows how many books, audiocassettes,
and entire courses with the world barely noticing. They received
rejection notes from ALL the major publishers for their "ultimate
brainchild" before convincing a small publisher to put out
_Chicken Soup_ _for the Soul, which has since become a juggernaut, an_
empire, with hundreds of titles and millions of copies sold. How
about breaking into acting? Sylvester Stallone kept his belongings in a bus station locker, slept in alleys, and scrounged food
from dumpsters early in his career.

So, reason number one: alibi-itis. Choosing a nifty alibi over
a difficult path to achievement. That's why somebody looks
around after another year has passed and is still in exactly the
same place. Majoring

###### in Minor Matters
It never ceases to amaze me how people can manage to focus
their time, energy, and resources on everything but the few vital
things in their business that really have to do with directly making money.

Just recently, a fellow heard me speak at a seminar, rushed to
the back of the room and bought my "Magnetic Marketing
System," came back to me and enthusiastically told me how
much he learned from my talk and how excited he was about
implementing my ideas, pumped my hand like Jack LaLanne,
and tore out of there like the Tasmanian devil. About a week
later, his copy of my System came into my office with the mail­
man, with a note sheepishly asking for a refund. On arriving

home, the man discovered he already had my System, sitting on
a shelf, still shrink-wrapped in plastic, purchased at a seminar
over a year earlier. Now, it's not the fact that it was my System,
but what on earth had he been doing every hour of every day for
a year that was more important than enhancing his business'
ability to attract and acquire new customers?

Not long ago, I did a bit of consulting for a guy with a small
chain of retail stores. He just about begged for my help. Said he
wasn't making it and had no money to do any advertising or
marketing with. I gave him a simple, easy-to-implement idea—a
change in the way incoming calls were handled—that would easily double his sales. I know it would. It's proven. After a few
months passed, I asked him how that strategy was working. He
explained that he'd been too busy to try it. Too busy doing what?
He couldn't tell me. Just too busy.

Well, here's how to get focused, if you're having trouble in
that department: identify and write down the three most important, most significant, most productive, most valuable things you
can do to foster success in your particular enterprise. Just three.
Write them down. From there, translate them into three actions
you can take each and everyday. Write them down.

For example, one of the most important things to me is a continuous stream of new requests for my services. As long as this
demand for "me" exceeds the available supply of "me," I can
demand and get premium fees, insist on first-class travel, choose
clients I like and blow off those I don't, choose projects that interest me and reject those I don't, confidently turn away business
knowing the temporary vacuum will fill, and generally do as I
darned well please. But if I let the demand diminish so that supply exceeds demand, I have to start compromising all over the

place. So this is very important to me. What can I do every day to
be certain this demand-supply ratio stays weighted in my favor?

I do not let a day go by that I do not send out a letter or a
package, make or return a phone call, get an article published, do
something to keep my books on bookstore shelves, secure a highprofile speaking engagement, or do something else to create and
stimulate "deal flow." It doesn't matter how busy I am. Or how
tired I am. Or if it's the Friday before a holiday weekend.
Whatever. Before sunset, at least ONE thing will be done intended
to stimulate demand.

Nothing and no one can steal the time required to make certain that happens. Every single day. No exceptions. No excuses.

As a direct result, "demand" for me has steadily grown, even
as the "supply" I am willing to offer has diminished, which has
allowed me to very substantially raise my fees, keep raising them
every year, fire troublesome clients without remorse, and do
business entirely on my terms, to suit me. This one single, simple
discipline has been worth millions.

But I'll bet if you followed the typical entrepreneur around
with a list of his "Big Three," you'd log lots of days where he
"never got around to" doing any one of those three things at all.
See, those days are failure days. Too many of those days guarantee you'll wind up on New Year's Day just about where you were
365 days before.

###### Breaking the Code of Extraordinarily Successful People
Early in my career, I was very fortunate to be exposed to some of
the greatest "success educators," such as Earl Nightingale, Dr.
Maxwell Maltz, Napoleon Hill, and, the more contemporary Zig

Ziglar and Jim Rohn. More recently, for ten years, I got to appear
frequently as a speaker on programs with Rohn, Zig, Brian Tracy,
Tom Hopkins, and others like them.

Jim Rohn is a very interesting fellow. You've undoubtedly
seen Tony Robbins on television. Did you know that Jim Rohn
was one of Tony's earliest coaches, mentors, and employers? If
you want real, well-grounded "meat" from someone in the personal development area, it's hard to beat Jim Rohn. Anyway,
there's a point Jim makes that stuck with me when I first heard
him say it, when I was a kid, and that still has impact when I hear
him talk about it today. It breaks the code of the highly successful person. It takes all the mystery and mystique away. When you
very closely examine the highly successful person, in any field,
you walk away saying to yourself:

_Well, it's no wonder he's doing so well. Look at everything_
_he does._

You see, success isn't much of a mystery. In that respect, it's
actually disappointing to a lot of people who want it to be very
complicated, who, as we discussed earlier, prefer a good alibi.
But it's just a reflection of what you are doing with your time.

I would now add to Rohn's statement, "... and look very
closely at the one thing or two or three things he gets done without fail, every single day."

I can do a good job of predicting what your bank balance will
be a year from now, if you'll give me the following information:

 - What's in the account today

 - A list of the books you read and tapes you listened to last
month

 - Some information about the five people you hang out with
most

 - A little analysis of how you spend your time during an
average week

For 90% of all people, by the way, making this prediction is a
no-brainer. The correct guess is: same as it was last year.

If you happen to be "stuck," then just taking some action to
change isn't even enough. Jim Rohn calls this "The _principle_ _of_
_massive action." And when you look at highly successful people,_
you'll find they are massive action takers. They don't just try one
solution to a problem, they implement 20 all at the same time.

I once had a dentist call me, after having gone home from my
weekend seminar, and tell me: "I've made a list of 300 things to
change in the practice." Every week, he did ten of them. After 30
weeks, he had done everything on that list, big and small. And,
without a penny increase in advertising, without a dollar's difference in marketing, in the same office, with (almost) the same
staff, his practice had more than quadrupled in volume. He took
massive action. When I tell the story, the usual, predictable reaction is astonishment and dismay—"Three _hundred changes? I'd_
never get 300 things done."

I've had the interesting experience of spending just a little bit of
time personally with Lee Iacocca, and I have studied him a lot from
afar. Iacocca did not rescue Chrysler by doing one thing. Or
one thing at a time. He took massive action. He pursued the
government-backed bailout, he slashed operating costs, he rushed
the design and release of exciting new cars, he went on TV personally in Chrysler's commercials and took his case to the public, he
boldly put forth the strongest warranty in the history of the auto
industry, he negotiated with the unions and the employees. And
it's no wonder he saved that company. Look at everything he did.
