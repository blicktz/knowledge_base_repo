 yours. It’s fifteen inches from ear to tail tip, black and white,
 with big bulging eyes, a big smile, bow tie, clock in its stomach,
 and a long tail. The eyes and tail move together, tick, tock, tick,
 tock. Classic kitsch.
   Woody saw the Kat as something more. ‘“‘It really is a unique
 item. Very few novelty products stay in perpetual manufacture
 and distribution for fifty years. There’s something special about
  it. It makes even the worst sourpuss smile. Even the toughest
 customer’ll look at it and say ‘Look at that dumb clock,’ but
  that’s the worst reaction it gets.’ So, he bought a small clock
 company and diversified its business in incredible ways.
   For starters, he created the Kit-Cat Fan Club, and began en-
 rolling members with inserts inside each clock package. He cre-
 ated the Kit-Cat Creed: ‘‘Put a smile on everyone’s face, love
 in everyone’s heart, energy in everyone’s body and be a positive
 force in everyone’s life.’’ There’s a monthly Club newsletter,
 puzzles, games, stories of the magic the Cat and the Creed have
 worked in people’s lives. There are tens of thousands of mem-
 bers. And, of course, there are Kit-Cat posters, T-shirts, bumper
  stickers, coffee mugs, cookie jars, aprons, and the Kit-Cat Wrist-
 watch. He has even licensed the Kit-Cat character, just like Dis-
 ney licenses Mickey Mouse. If you visit the famous Ron-Jon
 Surf Shop in Daytona Beach, Florida, you’ll find the Kit-Cat on
 their surfer apparel, even on a surfboard.
   Next, he turned the Kit-Cat into a personality for how-to
 books. There’s Clockwise Quotes on Life, a motivation book;
 Babysitting Wise, in which Kit-Cat gives practical instructions
 for baby-sitters and parents; Clockwise, which teaches children
 how to tell time; and Song Wise, which illustrates patriotic songs.
   Woody still goes personally to gift industry trade shows,
 dressed in a Kit-Cat-like tuxedo and bow tie, with a Kit-Cat-like
 smile, to show and sell his smile-inducing products. But he also
 has a national salesforce calling on all kinds of stores and dis-
 tribution through many mail-order catalogs, including Wireless,
 the catalog of esoteric merchandise put out by Minnesota Public
 Radio.

          If You Ain’t the Lead Dog,
           the View Never Changes
     One of the principles espoused by advertising gurus Al Ries
    and Jack Trout, authors of Positioning: The Battle for Your
   Mind, is: If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category
    that you can be first in.
      In the early 1980s, the chiropractic profession was deluged
    with ‘‘practice management firms,’’ each offering high-priced
    services via multiyear contracts, and all promoting their services
    with free, introductory seminars. I did some speaking for several
    of these companies, studied their businesses, and saw that while
    the profession was clearly crying out for help with marketing
    their practices, many doctors couldn’t or wouldn’t invest $20,000
    to $50,000 in a services contract, so they came to the introduc-
    tory seminars but went home empty-handed and unsatisfied. A
    collection of elements came together through a process I won’t
    bore you with that led to my developing the same kind of how-
    to information, but packaging it for sale at a very modest price
    (under $1,000) to the doctors in books, manuals, audiocassettes,
   and do-it-yourself kits. So a business was born.
     But I didn’t want it to be just another business in a cluttered
    field. Somehow, I wanted it to be the ‘‘lead dog’’ from the very
    beginning. After some thought, my. partner at the time and I
   made these decisions:
    1. Because we delivered all of our advice in the form of mate- -
      rials rather than through services, we could call ourselves
     publishers.
    2. Because we were using introductory seminars, we could also
     call ourselves a seminar company.

```
  specific. After a little testing and experimentation, we found
  that mixing chiropractors and dentists in the same seminars
  worked best. We were the only company to do this.
  Combining these three elements, our company instantly be-
 came ‘‘the largest integrated seminar and publishing organization
 exclusively serving the chiropractic and dental professions,’’ be-
 cause we were the only company doing that. We invented a new
 category.
  By the way, none of the three people in this company was a
 doctor. We were all outsiders, marketing and businesspeople
 translating success principles to these professions.
  Our business grew like wildfire and, in a period of just sev-
 eral years, did millions of dollars in business in a very small
 niche market, reaching out to fewer than 60,000 potential cus-
 tomers. Within chiropractic, the more responsive of the two mar-
 kets, we achieved a 30 percent market share. I am convinced our
 creation of a new category, where we could advertise ourselves
 as the biggest and the best from the very beginning, played a
 major role in the professions’ acceptance of us as valid experts.
    How Domino’s Became the ‘‘Lead Dog’’
  The Domino’s Pizza story has been told so many times, you
 may think there’s nothing more to be said. But I think Tom
 Monaghan’s reinvention of the pizza shop deserves mention
 here. I interviewed Tom Monaghan for a magazine article, and
 he emphasized that early in the development of Domino’s, he
 recognized the critical need to position his business in the minds
 of consumers as different from other pizza places. ‘‘We tried to
 find something about the pizza business no one else was doing
 well,’’. Tom said. That was delivery.
   If you keep reinvention in mind, you can see that Domino’s
 actually set up a whole new category within the pizza business:
 delivery only. And Domino’s became such a success, the lead

             TWEAK, TWEAK, TWEAK.
      Often, success is just one or two minor adjustments away.
   Many people give up just one ‘‘tweak’’ away from turning ex-
    perimentation and struggle into victory. But how do you draw
    the line between persistence and stupid stubbornness? In most
    direct-marketing situations, if a marketing test returns less than
    sixty cents in gross sales per dollar of marketing expense, we
    walk away. If it’s sixty-one cents or better, it can often be
    tweaked to profitability. In each situation, you have to somehow
    decide whether or not you are close enough to keep investing in
    tweaking.

         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #37:
       TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SUCCESS
            OR FAILURE OF YOUR IDEAS.
     Blaming the marketplace, the customers, those in charge of
    distribution for not seeing how great and wonderful and needed
    your product is cannot possibly lead to success. It may be com-
    forting, but it’s self-defeating. It’s even childish, like saying ‘‘if
    you won’t play my way, I'll take my ball and go home.”’ If the
    inventors and advocates behind ThighMaster had gotten mad at
    their market and gone home, it’d be just one more failed inven-
    tion among thousands of fitness devices that also failed. Instead,
    they kept seeking different and better ways to present their prod-
    uct in a way that the public would respond to.

 and turned his imagination loose on it—how can we build on
 this success?
  The process of getting to success with a product can be long,
 agonizing, and costly. Once you get there, though, you should
 take fast, massive, and comprehensive action to capitalize on that
 success in every way imaginable.
   As soon as my client the Guthy-Renker Corporation had a
 hit with Vanna White on television selling the PerfectSmile
 tooth-whitening products, the race was on to create Perfect-
 Smile toothbrushes and mouthwash, PerfectTan, PerfectSkin, and
 PerfectWhatever, to build on the foundation of success.
       STAKE OUT A LEADERSHIP POSITION.
   There’s great value in being perceived by your marketplace
 as the biggest and/or the best, as the leader of your field. You
 can get to that point the hard way: starting at the bottom and
 crawling, fighting, clawing your way up the ladder, over a period
 of years, slowly building a reputation. Or you can, as Robert
 Ringer put it in his great book Winning Through Intimidation,
 ‘‘leapfrog’’ to the top. You can leapfrog by reinventing your
 entire business or the entire industry your business is a part of,
 or by inventing a whole new category within that industry.
   How Do You Take on Nabisco, Del Monte,
     Kellogg, and Other Big Brand Names
            and Win?
   There are two battles to be fought in the foods business: one
 for supermarket shelf space, the other for the attention of the
 fickle consumer. David A. Nichols came to Loblaws, a Canadian
 supermarket chain that was losing money, and concocted a rad-
 ical idea about getting rich. He proposed taking Loblaws’s lack-
 luster group of private label foods, improving their quality, and

```

```
    wanted to fight for shelf space and sales with the big names.
    And he wanted to export to the United States to boot!
             _ David Nichols saw three opportunities. First, he found that
    most private label lines of food were of inferior quality or at
    least perceived to be of inferior quality to the name brands, so
    only the most budget-conscious consumers reluctantly bought
    them. He believed he could change that. The quality of private
    label items could be dramatically enhanced and still sell for less
    than the big names because they carried no “‘brand tax.’’ In other
    words, their prices did not need to include the tens of millions
    of dollars that the big names spend each year on advertising.
      Second, he noticed that most supermarket chains’ private la-
    bel products were packaged almost in plain brown wrappers.
    They looked uninviting and cheap. Nichols determined that in
    volume, snazzy packaging was no costlier than dull packaging.
    So he put his ‘‘President’s Choice’’ products in packages with
    copy that sells, like their ‘‘Ancient Grains’’ cereal, boldly la-
    beled across its top: ‘“Too Good To Be True!’’ And in the news-
    paper inserts he develops and provides for promoting his
    products, you’ll see things like an elephant standing in a stew-
    pot and the instruction “‘Cut elephant into bite size pieces. This
    should take approximately 2 months’’ to advertise President’s
    Choice deep-dish meat pies. He gave personality to products that
    historically have been put forward with none.
      Third, he had his own testing lab in Loblaws stores. If he
    could quickly prove the salability of these products, he would
    be exporting more than just another product line to U.S. super-
    markets, he’d be offering a proven sales system, a franchise of
     sorts. In a sense, he completely reinvented the private label foods
    business and created something of much greater value to offer
     to retailers throughout North America.

             to the Tune of 9 Billion Dollars!

 Jewel in the Midwest, and D’ Agostinos in New York. According
 to the New York Times, while overall North American super-
 market products’ sales volume rose by 37 percent in 1993, Pres-
 ident’s Choice sales jumped 127 percent. When Nichols came to
 Loblaws, its private label food sales were $500 million. After
 three years, they’ ve topped $9 billion! And some individual Pres-
 ident’s Choice products, such as the ‘‘Decadent Chocolate Chip
 Cookies’’ outsell major brands like Chips Ahoy. Loblaws also
 private-labels its products for Wal-Mart.
  Competitors have been awakened by David Nichols’s
 achievements. Major chains like Safeway and A&P have re-
 vamped their own private label lines, now Safeway Select and
 A&P Masters’ Choice. David Nichols says that ‘‘retailer-created
 and -controlled brands’’ may account for as much as 40 percent
 of the supermarket industry’s food products sales in the near
 future.
   Nichols has already tired of this game that he created, has
 left Loblaws, and has begun a consulting business; he is talking
 about building a new wine distribution business around his small
 family winery. Aspects of his strategy are well worth considering
 for a variety of businesses.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #25:
    UNCOVER HIDDEN ASSETS AND OPPORTUNITIES.
  For example, the small businessperson who is trying to-find a
 way to get really, really rich might learn from Nichols’s exploits.
 Let’s say you own a small chain of restaurants or hair styling sa-
 lons or carpet cleaning trucks. If you develop your own private la-
 bel line of ancillary products and a terrific system for selling them,
 you can then roll that out to others in your business all over the
 country and create an instant, nationwide sales and distribution
 organization for your products. Nichols turned a neglected, un-
 dervalued product line into a new, very duplicatable system not
 unlike a franchise, although not called or sold as a franchise.
   In concert with this idea, we might summarize Nichols’s at-

```

```
   By riding on others’ established distribution networks, stores,
   store traffic, and advertising, he was free to concentrate on in-
   novation with product and product packaging. Or, for example,
    it’s worth noting that David Nichols saw great opportunity in an
   asset that was ‘‘lying around’’ at Loblaws, undervalued, ne-
   glected, and taken for granted by those who had controlled it for
   years. That very same situation—what I call the ‘‘hidden op-
   portunity’’ in an established business—exists just about every-
   where. Or, for example, take note that David Nichols ignored
   conventional industry wisdom, norms, rules, and traditions when
   he chose to build on private label products, rather than offering
   them as an ‘‘oh, by the way’’ accommodation to ‘‘cheap’’ cus-
   tomers. There are lots of lessons to be learned from the story of
   President’s Choice.
      Dan Kennedy’s Creativity Checklist for
       Inventing or Reinventing Products,
       Businesses, and Marketing Messages
     Here’s a little checklist I refer to whenever I work on a brand-
   new product or on re-invention:
   OPPOSITES The Burger King Whopper is a big sand-
             wich; the White Castle Burger is a very
            small burger, often sold in six-packs and
             dozens. Is there something that is success-
              ful and big that could be successful and
             small or vice versa? Today’s common indi-
              rect lighting was invented as the opposite
             of the traditional, standard direct lighting.
            As I mentioned elsewhere in this book,
            7UP was made by its positioning as ‘‘The
           UNCOLA.”’

 ADAPTATION If it works in one business, will it work in
           mine? The drive-in window has moved
           from banks to fast-food restaurants to all
             sorts of applications: quick-print shops, dry
            cleaners, liquor stores. In Las Vegas, the
           Imperial Palace Hotel & Casino has a
            drive-in window for sports bettors to place
           wagers on baseball, football, basketball,
           and horse races without leaving their cars.
  EXAGGERA- Years ago, Volkswagen demonstrated the
  TION ‘‘roominess’’ of its car by having basket-
             ball star Wilt Chamberlain get in it and sit
           comfortably. Even though no one really
            believed that Wilt would regularly drive a
           Bug, the point was made: If he can sit in
             it, it’s certainly big enough for me. Varia-
            tions of that idea have been used in dozens
           of car and minivan commercials. My friend
           and client Frank Robinson has driven the
            sales of millions of jars of Nancy Kwan’s
            Pearl Cream by having her deliver this
           guarantee in TV commercials: ‘‘If your
            friends don’t actually accuse you of having
           had a face-lift, return the unused portion
            for a full refund.’’ This is nothing more
            (or less) than a satisfaction guarantee, but
             it has much more impact by being said

              they'll be accused of having had a face-lift
             after using Pearl Cream, but they say to
            themselves, ‘‘If they say it’s that good,
            maybe it’ll make these laugh lines go
            away.’
   ADDITION/ Lite and fat-free foods are products sold
   SUBTRACTION based on what has been subtracted from
             them. At one time, there were two kinds of
            doughnuts: cake and glazed, both round,
             with a hole in the middle. Eliminating the
             hole and filling them changed the doughnut
             business forever. The next time you visit a
            Dunkin’ Donuts take a look at how many
              varieties are ‘‘filled’’—creme-filled, jelly-
               filled, lemon meringue-filled, maple syrup—
             filled, chocolate-filled. That’s addition.
   COMBINING One odd type of business that has cropped
                                 ’ up in recent years is the combined Laun-
            dromat-Tavern: Singles do their laundry,
            enjoy a beer, watch a game, and make
             friends all at the same time. But a much
            more common example is the combined
            supermarket—gas station—the convenience
              store. How about the clock-radio? The hit
            TV series Miami Vice was a creative com-
             bination of cop shows and music videos.

           remover, an ink stain remover, and on and
             on. The truth is that 80 percent of the
