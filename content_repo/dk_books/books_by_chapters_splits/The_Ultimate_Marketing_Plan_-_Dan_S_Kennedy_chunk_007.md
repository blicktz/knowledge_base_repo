Think again about my friend in the carpet-cleaning business. After choosing one or several zip code areas based on his drive-by observations, he could get even pickier. He might make the logical assumption that people in certain income brackets are better prospects than others. Folks with household incomes of, say, less than $30,000.00 a year might find money tight and choose to go through the agony of shampooing their own carpets to save money.

 Since he accepts VISA and MasterCard, he might prefer to mail only to people who have those credit cards, and since families get their carpets dirtier more often, he might want to skip mailing to single people.

 So he sits down with his list broker and says: “In these zips, I want married homeowners with kids, with household income of $30,000.00 and up, who have MasterCards or VISA cards.” Using lists derived from the census, credit card holder lists, property ownership records, and other readily available sources, the broker can deliver that exact list or something very close to it.

 Incidentally, it can be helpful to collect demographic data about your present customers. If you find certain biases or commonalities in your present customers, you may be able to use them in your criteria for future targeting.

 If it’s worth it to him, and it might very well be, he could experiment with response lists rather than compiled lists—and were he marketing to more affluent homeowners, I’d definitely suggest it. Martha Stewart

#### 3. Market by Affinity or Association

##### I like this approach and use it a great deal for myself and my clients. Let me give you a personal example: For many years, beginning in 1978, I was a member of the National Speakers Association, one of two trade associations for lecturers and seminar leaders. I went out of my way to be visible in the association, through a variety of means, and for a number of years I believe my name recognition was at about 70 to 80 percent of the total membership, about 4,000 people at the time. Those 4,000 people and I had much in common: First, obviously, I knew them and, more important, they knew me. I could call attention to our affinity by addressing them as “colleagues” and “fellow members.” We shared the same business activities, experiences, concerns, and problems. Because I was a known, respected success in the field, the members were interested in what I had to say and in whatever I recommended.

 In the time I treated this as a target market, I sold millions of dollars of goods and services to its members. Some years, as much as one-third of my income was derived from this very small market. I was occasionally able to reap pure passive income simply from licensing my endorsement to someone else’s product or service being offered to this very small market.

 Geographically, these people were scattered all over the United States, Canada, and several foreign countries. Demographically, they had few, if any, dominant commonalties. They were men, women, young, old, fat, thin, conservative, liberal, rich, poor, married, single, with families, without families. But they were still a perfect target market for me purely because of our mutual association. Because of affinity.

 As evidence of how well affinity worked for me with this target market, back when I was doing revisions and updating the second edition of this book, I was in the midst of a direct-mail campaign to this list for a new product and had brought in $226,400.00. Just a year before that, I had conducted a simple direct-mail campaign for another new information product to this group and did nearly $600,000.00 in sales. All from only about 4,000 people.

 I’ve since moved on, and our own Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ organization is much larger than the National Speakers Association and has become, in essence, my home market. There is also the linked, more specialized Information Marketing Association. From these markets come much of my present-day consulting, copywriting, and coaching clients; the few speaking engagements I care to do; and an ample number of other opportunities.

##### Many other businesspeople can apply this same principle to their trade or professional associations or to the chamber of commerce, Toastmasters, Jaycees, other business and civic groups, church groups, PTAs—whatever they belong to. I encourage chiropractors and dentists I consult with, for example, to get out of their offices at least eight hours a week to join and actively participate in a number of these associative target markets. Then, instead of advertising to a neighborhood, they can advertise to their fellow members. Instead of farming a community, they can farm a fraternity.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #5:
 Tailoring and Delivering Your Message to the Right Target

##### I find the pizza wars endlessly interesting. Domino’s took the industry by storm by focusing on delivery, initially to an identifiable, identified starving crowd. Those the chain was after knew it was for them. My friend, Gene Landrum, author of an excellent series of books on the psyche of the entrepreneur, was a creator of the enormously successful Chuck E. Cheese pizza chain, which is all about kids and game playing. Our famous Glazer-Kennedy Insider Circle™ Member Diana Coutu has made her pizza business all about—imagine this!—the pizza, unabashedly charging premium prices for premium pizza. All three could coexist and prosper on the same street, within eyesight of each other, because each is about something different; each is for a different customer.

 In Las Vegas, for many years most casino-hotels aggressively pursued the business of the high rollers. An acquaintance of mine has the title Casino Host at one of the biggest hotels on the Strip. He’s actually a recruiter who goes to other hotels, to parties in Beverly Hills and New York where the rich gather, even to Japan, to invite and inveigle high rollers to come to the hotel he represents. When they do, they are his honored and privileged guests, with complimentary rooms, meals, shows, airfare, limousines, even escorts if desired. Every big casino operation has such people. One high roller I know described Las Vegas as “the home of the $10,000.00 free drink.”

 Bob Stupak, mentioned earlier, ignored this market almost entirely. Nothing he did was targeted at the high roller. To the contrary, his market was middle-income, middle America, mom-and-pop, everyday folks, many of them first-time visitors to Glitter City. While the others chased the Saks customer, Bob preferred Sears. If the other hotels got people with Mercedes and even Rolls-Royces in their garages, Bob attracted the people with three-year-old minivans. While the other hotels pursued the country-club crowd, Bob recruited at the bowling alleys. For a handful of recent years, Las Vegas refocused its sights on families, with many casino resorts creating Disneyesque, family-friendly environments, and the city briefly surpassed Orlando as the number one vacation destination. However, in the post–9/11 world, the realization set in that adult customers were more reliable and valuable, so Vegas shifted back to Sin City, with nightclubs featuring scantily clad dancers, more “skin” shows, and the suggestive ad slogan: What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas. The more recent recession has been very challenging for Las Vegas. This city’s business leaders are constantly,

 The Profit-Boosting Secret of the NOW Buyer

 In real estate, there is a thing called the “NOW buyer”—and even though the real-estate industry as a whole has been in the doldrums for a while as I write this, plenty of NOW buyers exist despite the recession, and some exist because of the recession. With residential real estate, these can include people who must relocate for job or family or health reasons, those with babies on the way, “Brady Bunch-ers” suddenly merging families, or somebody like Candy Spelling who had to buy her new condo as a downsizing move—it was only 17,000 square feet!— when she put her $150-million megamansion on the market. In commercial, it may be someone with proceeds from a real-estate or business sale that must be reinvested to avoid a tax whack, 1031 exchange buyers. In that industry, there are personal timing reasons that compel purchase whether the overall economy timing is good, bad, or indifferent.

 In financial services, there are NOW buyers. They may have just inherited a substantial sum, sold a business and retired, or been a CD investor living off the fixed income from interest suddenly slashed by two-thirds that now must diversify and even take risks.

 In collectibles, there are NOW buyers because something suddenly comes available that must be bought or lost forever. In jewelry, vacations, and gifts, there are NOW buyers because the tenth, twenty- fifth, and fiftieth wedding anniversaries occur only once in most peoples’ lives and cannot, dare not, be ignored.

 IN EVERY BUSINESS, there are must-buy-now buyers. Idiotically, most business owners make no SPECIAL attempts to identify them, find them, and sell to them differently than they sell to everyone else.

 Today, a must-buy-now buyer has to be worth a great deal more than any ordinary buyer who may or may not buy now but can just as easily postpone, procrastinate, or prevaricate. The marketer can and should invest considerably more in finding and wooing that must-buy-now buyer. He’s worth more, so you can invest more. Since hardly anybody does, you can own an extreme competitive advantage, if you will.

 Combine the must-buy-now buyer with the affluent can-buy-now buyer and you’ve really got something. This is demographic plus situational. Having families with family members over the age of seventy on your mailing list, if you are operating a funeral home, is smart marketing. Identifying particularly affluent families in that category is smarter. Any divorcée aged thirty-five to fifty-five is a good target for weight loss, fitness, beauty, cosmetic dentistry, and cosmetic surgery marketing, but such a divorcée of a certain level of affluence is a better target. Doesn’t seem like much of a mystery to me.

##### The pertinent question, then, is who is your must-buy-now + can- buy-now buyer? The better and more complete your answer, the better able you’ll be to find him.

## Proof

##### The public has been lied to so much by so many that we no longer trust anybody, yet trust is needed to make most sales and to sustain most relationships. People are disillusioned and distrustful, with good reason. The hurdle is high.

 There is an old joke—told to me by a very cynical businessman— about the father who puts his three-year-old son up on the fireplace mantle and holds out his hands and urges him to jump. “I’ll catch you,” he promises. After much coaxing and coercion, the kid jumps toward Daddy, who steps back and lets him crash to the floor. He then leans over the wailing youngster and says: “You’ve just learned your first great lesson of life—don’t trust anybody.”

 The consumer and the business customers, your prospective customer or client, has been coerced off the mantle and let crash to the floor one too many times. Lucy has pulled the football away at the last minute one time too many, and Charlie Brown won’t play anymore.

#### ULTIMATE MARKETING SECRET WEAPON #6: Marketing Messages Developed with the Understanding That Recipients Will Be Stubbornly Reluctant to Believe
 Them

##### I often have clients bring me the same marketing problem: a truly irresistible offer that doesn’t work.

 One such client had put together the ultimate, legitimate travel premium: a certificate good for at least $500.00 worth of travel, including two nights in brand-name hotels scattered around the country, including resort locations, or a three-day Bahamas cruise for just $99.00 per person, and more. He sells these certificates to various businesses to use as premiums and incentives, at a dollar to as little as a nickel in volume—that’s right!—five cents each! The recipient of the certificate needs only to pay a $10.00 processing fee to use it.

 He was perplexed by the difficulty he was having getting businesses to buy and use these things. And he found that a shockingly small percentage of the people who got them make the call to redeem them. How could this be? “Why,” he asked, “doesn’t this work better than it does?”

 By now, of course, the answer is obvious, isn’t it? The darned offer is just too good to be true. People didn’t believe it. In this case, it is obvious to you. It’s a gift you’d be suspicious of if offered to you by your local auto dealer or jewelry store or restaurant. But what’s not so obvious is that your perfectly reasonable, sensible, and legitimate offer or your truthful assertions about your product may be received with just as much suspicion.

 Today, if you make any kind of a free or big-discount offer, the consumer says to himself or herself: “Who’s he kidding? Nothing’s free. There’s got to be a catch here somewhere.” Or: “Fifty percent off, my eye! All they’ve done is jacked up the price so they can mark it back down. It’s all baloney.”

 My research indicates that people don’t even believe guarantees. They say: “Yeah, just try to get your money back. You’ve got to bring it back still wrapped in the original plastic, fill out a sixteen-part form, stand in line for three hours, and scream and yell and threaten their lives.” I believe you should use, even lean heavily on, guarantees. But you have to go to extremes to make people believe them.

 If you use testimonials—and I’m going to tell you that you should— they say: “I’ll bet those are actors” or “I’ll bet they’re just made up” or

##### “I’ll bet they paid those people to say those things.”

 Here is the Ultimate Marketing Plan “Be Safe or Sorry” rule: Prove every single item in your case.

 Prove every statement, assertion, claim, promise, offer, and warranty. Leave nothing unproven. Never presume trust or acceptance.

 So, How Do We Prove Our Case?

 I sat, as an uninvolved observer, in the giant, lavishly decorated law firm conference room and watched and listened as one of this country’s most famous trial attorneys conducted his pretrial conference with his associates, investigators, researchers, and paralegals. Each person summarized his or her work and each gave an opinion on the probable outcome.

 One young attorney assured the boss, “I think you’ve got enough evidence to win this thing.”

 The boss came unglued. He slammed his hands down on the table and rocked the room. He lunged across the table, grabbed the young guy by his Brooks Brothers lapels, yanked him up, faced him nose-tip to nose- tip, and bellowed loud enough to be heard on the opposite coast: “Do not ever send me into a courtroom to face a jury with just enough evidence.” He paused, dropped the shocked attorney back into his chair, walked to the end of the room, and wrote these words on the blackboard:

 PREPONDERANCE OF PROOF

 Webster defines “preponderance” as a superiority in weight, power, importance, strength, or quantity. Roget’s Thesaurus suggests these synonyms: majority, plurality, advantage, supremacy, maximum, lion’s share, excess, surplus, redundancy, and domination. I suggest that you want all that and more when you present your case to the customer.

 How to Go from Zero to Maximum Credibility

 If we wanted an example of an industry with near-zero credibility, we need look no further than the people and businesses behind the automobile sitting outside in the driveway. Automobile salespeople are distrusted by everybody.

 My own informal—but I think fairly accurate—survey shows that ranked at the very bottom of the trust ladder by the public are lawyers, then, still worse, politicians, then, worst of all, car salesmen. The industry has brought this on itself. Often, people in the automobile business use artificial retail prices in order to create phony discounts, advertise stripped models in order to play bait-and-switch, use deceptive sales practices, bully their customers, sell grossly overpriced insurance add-ons, and are notorious for lousy service after the sale.

 Fortunately, there are good, honest exceptions to this rule. There are extremely reputable auto dealers and high-integrity auto sales

##### professionals who must combat the negative public perception of their black-hearted brethren.

 The most honest and, I think not coincidentally, the most successful automobile salesman I’ve ever known is Bill Glazner*, a Ford salesman in Phoenix during the years I lived there. He managed to attain maximum credibility in a business that, overall, has no credibility—a tough task, but a great marketing lesson. (* He’s not to be confused with the Bill Glazer featured frequently throughout this book, publisher of my NO B.S. MARKETING LETTER, president of Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™. They are not the same person. Not related.)

 For years, I bought all my cars from Bill. Here was the experience, consistent every time: When you went to buy a car from Bill, like most anywhere else, you went out on the lot and looked at cars, kicked tires, maybe test-drove a couple. Eventually you were led down the hall where the long row of salesmen’s cubicles were located. These are pretty much the same everywhere. You’ve been in more than one. The walls are ticky-tacky plywood partitions held in place with the little screw doo-dads we had on pole lamps in the sixties. In each cubicle, there’s a basic military-issue gray or green metal desk. There are two turquoise or orange plastic stackable chairs for the customers. And that is it.
