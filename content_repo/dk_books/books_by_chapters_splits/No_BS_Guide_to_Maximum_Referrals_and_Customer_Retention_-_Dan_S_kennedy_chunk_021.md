#### A “Case History” and Some Tricks of the Trade
##### I joined a local networking group shortly after moving to Orlando. Its members were mostly brick-and-mortar business owners and service providers, and many were open about struggling to generate new business, there to exchange leads and help each other. When I explained my business, I didn’t have one condescending guy rolling his eyes—I had a room full of them! I hired the accountant in the group to do my taxes and at the next Wednesday morning meeting, he stood up and said, “I want to thank Susie for choosing my accounting practice. I have to say, most of you disregard her business. But that business is making her more money than most of you are currently earning!” That got their attention.
 As a side point, never underestimate the power of someone else saying it for you.
 That same day, one of the members gave me his wife, Jan’s, contact information and suggested I meet with her. When I met with her, I showed her samples from my company’s clothing collection and suggested that she could earn some clothing she’d enjoy having free or at a significant discount just by hosting a little home party, for as few as eight of her friends —and who doesn’t have eight friends? She agreed, and we set the date.
 Now a little trick of the trade. I think of my party hostess as my business partner. Basically, we are opening up a pop-up store in her living room. As Dan likes to describe it, we’re using real social media. I want my partner to earn the maximum rewards, and that means she needs to invite the right guests, the best guests. For that, she needs direction. Since I sold mix-and-match knit clothing, it was perfect for women who traveled. “Who do you know who travels for her job?” I asked, then got those friends or even acquaintances at the top of her invitation list. “Who do you know who loves to go on vacations?” Add them to the top of the list. This populated the invitation list with the kind of women I knew to purchase ten-piece wardrobes, so I was stacking the deck with aces, to ensure high per-person


-----

##### sales. Because I wanted to book parties out of the party, I asked about any friends who had hosted home parties or even liked to entertain at home. They went on the list. In this way, I was managing the referrals to perfectly match my most desired potential customer. So, truthfully, when was the last time any of your customers brought you eight top prospects perfectly matched to your ideal customer profile? Are you able to exercise this much control over who they refer to you?
 Sales at Jan’s little party were over $1,500.00. As a direct result of booking new parties from Jan’s party, and new parties from those parties, I sold $13,146.00 over just the next six months, and recruited two new consultants for my sales organization. Three Jans is all you need to get your ball rolling.
 Of course, you need to know how to put on a great home party or meeting that people love and are happy to host for their friends. You need to know how to manage Jan, completely, so there are eight perfect potential customers waiting for you in her living room. These are processes that are relatively easy to learn and can be translated to just about any business. By the way, there’s a nearly unique benefit to the home party: Just about everybody comes pre-agreed with themselves to buy something. Anyplace else they go, not so much. But when they show up at a friend’s home, drink her beverages and eat her refreshments, and are introduced by her to you— who then dazzles with wonderful products or beneficial services—there is a quiet, underlying obligation to buy something.
 If you are still thinking the deadly, creativity killing “But My Business Is Different” mantra that Dan Kennedy rails against constantly, visit www.DSA.org, and you can peruse a long and wildly diverse list of every type of product, service, or business imaginable selling by home parties— including jewelry, handbags, clothing, kitchen gadgets, wine, chocolate, skin care, weight loss, pet food, legal services, financial services, even prepaid auto care plans. Dan tells a great story about a doctor selling breast implants in a home party setting, although I’m not sure if that would be called a product or a service. This isn’t just for women only, either. There are home party plan companies selling man-cave décor, tools, and sporting goods to men, by male consultants, with men as the party hosts.
 Don’t let the term “home party” get in your way. The same model could be done with business owners as party hosts, inviting eight of their


-----

##### customers to their offices or shops. It could be a class, a seminar, a demonstration, a workshop.
 Also, the party can be a place where actual products or services are sold, or where prepaid plans or vouchers are sold, or where nothing is immediately sold but follow-up appointments are booked.
 By the way, if you know Dan, you know he has personal background in direct selling and network marketing. He is a shareholder in direct-selling companies. When he read my book for people in the industry, 8 Weeks to Your Promotion in Your Home Party Business, he told me that I should be teaching my systems to nonparty-plan businesses as growth strategies, in much the same way that he brought direct marketing to nondirect marketing businesses starting 40 years ago, when that was a radical idea. Somewhat coincidentally, I had already retired from actively running my own party plan sales organizations, developed a consulting and coaching business in the industry, but was feeling constrained by it, already thinking that the speed of referrals I could trigger was being underutilized. We were on the same page, and I’ve begun working with an expanded variety of businesses, speaking to groups of business owners developing resources for this purpose, including the special report you can obtain free at SusieNelson.com/report. It’s great to have Dan Kennedy’s support for this, and hopefully his endorsement will have the same effect on you that my accountant’s did on some of the people in that networking group in Orlando, those years ago.
 Please, think creatively about this.

## Seven Ways to Grow Each Customer’s
 Value and Have More Power in the
 Marketplace

 It is vital to do so. Businesses failing at fully monetizing

##### years ahead. This is so because nothing is more difficult or costly than new customer acquisition. Further, if your customers are middle-income, middle-class consumers, that supply, in the U.S., is shrinking. If you market B2B, many niches, industries, and professions are shrinking in numbers of potential accounts by consolidation, contraction, and attrition. Competition, especially price-driven competition, is fierce and ever more enabled by the internet. Costs related to customer acquisition keep rising, generally outpacing inflation in most product and service categories.
 POWER comes from your ability to pay these rising costs and more, and much more than your competitors can, to acquire, retain, and care for your customers. Yes, it is that simple. He who can and will spend the most


-----

##### wins. POWER comes from making your customer so much more valuable to you than everyone else’s customers are to them that you can outspend everybody else. Obviously, retention—customer value grown by time—and referrals—customer value increased by being a portal to more customers— plays into this in a big way. There are seven specific ways to create the maximum possible customer value so you are the most powerful beast in the jungle.

 1. Increase Transaction Size—Initial and/or Repeat 2. Increase Transaction Frequency 3. Decrease Randomness or Division of Spending (In Your Category) 4. Increase Term of Retention and Lifetime Customer Value: STOP
 LOSSES 5. Increase Profits of Business Conducted with Each Customer 6. Recover Lost Customers 7. Clone or Multiply Customers by Referrals

 There is a great deal of work to be done in each of these seven areas of your business. Yes, I said: work.
 A little bit of good happens in all seven areas just by being good or great, and having happy customers. I’m right with Keith Lee on this (Chapter 5). We want happy customers. Fine. Well and good. But settling for whatever organic activity that produces will never come close to creating extraordinary income. These are seven areas of opportunity to be aggressive in. Not passive. So work on each is required.
 This book is not meant as and lacks room for a comprehensive description of everything to do in these seven areas. Obviously, it has focused on No. 4 and No. 7. But in the interest of giving you at least a complete overview of best opportunities, a few comments about each . . .

#### #1: Increase Transaction Size
##### In the Depression, at soda fountains, “soda jerks” were trained to ask, “In your milkshake, would you like one egg or two?” The same basic at-counter upsell is familiar to all fast-food restaurant customers. Unfortunately, what


-----

##### is supposed to be happening often isn’t. One major chain recently found eight out of ten not doing the simple upsell, via its mystery shopping.
 This is but one method of many to be creatively applied, then strictly enforced, for bumping up transaction size. A few dollars more per visit or purchase may not sound like much, until you apply it to the multiyear tenure of a customer and to all customers. That $5.00 more per transaction from a customer engaging in 18 transactions a year equals $90.00, times a five-year retention term equals $450.00. Done with 222 customers: an extra $100,000.00. Done with 2,222 customers, an extra $1 million. You can get rich on the extra money made just from small upsells.
 Upselling and cross-selling are the two best ways to bump up transaction size. But every possible method must be considered. All that can be used should be used. You have to know your customer to get this right. My dry cleaner, for example, has a tailor, and he constantly finds little things to fix on the clothes I take there for cleaning. A jacket lining coming loose or bunching up, loose buttons, a frayed pant cuff. These things are fixed and added to the bill without any discussion. He knows I will not squawk, will welcome the service. As I imagine the case with many of his affluent customers. I’m betting he’s adding $10.00 to $20.00 to a lot of transactions this way. Many hotels got blowback from automatically adding newspaper delivery and gym use daily fees to their bills, but other chains got little negative feedback, and successfully institutionalized this practice. The in-room minibar is a long-standing way of bumping up hotel stay transaction size. Some now have in-room catalogs, so you can buy the robe, the pillow, the linens, even the bed.

#### #2: Increase Transaction Frequency
##### One of our GKIC vendors, NewCustomersNowMarketing.com, and its founder Dean Killingbeck, mastered the obtaining of “cold prospect” birthday lists and birthday-theme promotions and direct-mail campaigns. He administers them for both obvious kinds of businesses, notably restaurants, to less obvious, like auto repair shops, very successfully. Response rates from these mailings to existent customer lists run as high as 25%! But just once in a year for each customer.  So, the invention of the


-----

##### Half-Birthday.  From once a year to twice a year, about the same responsiveness both times. This one little tweak doubles sales from this one strategy.
 Shaun Buck, my co-author here, has absolutely, empirically proven that transaction frequency (and retention and referrals) improves with the mailing of a well-crafted, monthly frequency customer newsletter. No business owner reading this book should be without one! If you want help or want it done for you, there’s no better person to call on than Shaun. Go to his www.TheNewsletterPro.com site without delay. I said: monthly. That’s the minimum. You could do more, like a newsletter on the 1st of every month and a magazine on the 15th of every month. Keep this our secret: Their frequency of purchasing has a lot to do with your frequency of friendly, interesting, informative communication.

#### #3: Decrease Randomness or Division of Spending
##### Customers are easily seduced sluts. Sorry, but they are. As customers, we are. In most categories, they divvy their spending. The same person may go to Walmart and Target and Walgreens all in the same week, even though all three stores sell everything they bought with divided spending. The same thing happens with nonchain, independent businesses of many kinds.
 Airlines invented Frequent Flyer Programs to curb this, but once they all had virtually identical programs, the power was lost. Very frequent flyers, like I was for about a dozen years, accumulated lots of points in every airline’s system, so we still divided our spending, mostly based on convenience of flights for our personal needs. This does not negate the role of a good loyalty rewards program, and a good source to look at is www.RoyaltyRewards.com. But a weak one has nominal impact. Just having one is not enough. It needs constant marketing to customers. Distance to the next reward or reward level promoted. Perks triggered by frequency. It is used often as leverage, not just as a card gotten into a wallet. Barnes & Noble mails its loyalty cardholders monthly discount coupons, with deadlines, and it often triggers an extra trip or two or three for me during the year. The independent Learned Owl bookstore I also occasionally patronize never sends me anything even though I am in their


-----

##### loyalty program too. I’d wager my spending at Barnes & Noble was 20 times what I spent at Owl last year.
 I overheard a guy who walked in and back out of a Sports Clips say, “Line’s too long. I’ll just go to the place across the street.” I asked, “Aren’t you in Sports Clips’ loyalty reward program?” He said, “Yeah, I’ve got the card somewhere. But it’s not important.”
 If you’re not important to your customer, it’s not the customer’s fault. It’s ALL on you. And if you’re not important to your customer, that customer will more easily, casually, and randomly divvy up his spending that could be all yours. I feel a little guilty vacationing anywhere but Disney in Orlando, because of how well they manage our relationship. There’s not a single restaurant I feel guilty about not patronizing in favor of any other. In fact, when Carla asks where I’d like to go to dinner Friday night with friends, I say: “Let them pick. I don’t care.” If she raises the prospect of going somewhere other than Disney for a vacation, I’m quick to resist.
 Customers divide their spending in various categories for a multiplicity of reasons—convenience of a moment, a heavily advertised big sale, a friend’s influence, boredom, and casual shopping, as well as feeling neglected and underappreciated. It’s up to you to reduce these temptations and make customers think of you and at least feel guilty about their defection. The amount of divided spending going on in your category, the casualness with which the customer views it, and the loss of rewards it causes all affect both retention and referrals. In other words, the customer with the least divided spending is most likely to stay with you forever and is more likely to refer others to you. Conversely, the customer engaging in the most divided spending is most susceptible to being seduced away and dropping you out of the random rotation altogether, and is less likely to refer. When you reduce divided spending, you automatically boost retention and referral likelihood.

#### #4: Increase Retention—STOP LOSSES IN THEIR TRACKS!
##### About half the book is devoted to this one, so there’s only one point I want to make here that isn’t dealt with anywhere else in these pages. You need an alarm that goes off, loud and clear, just as a customer is straying. Bill
