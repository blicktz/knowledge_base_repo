University Microfilms, we're now creating one billion pages
of information each and every day here in the United
States alone. Sometimes I think most of it crosses my desk!

People are struggling to cope with the avalanche of information. I get as big an avalanche as anybody. Here's what goes on,
for me. First of all, I have all the trade and professional journals,
new books, association newsletters, and other documents related
to my three primary businesses—direct marketing, infomercial
production, and speaking—to keep up with. I have all the general
business press to be concerned with, from Entrepreneur and Inc.

to Forbes, Fortune, and The Wall Street Journal. As a consultant, I'm
often "learning" several new businesses in connection with my clients,

so I read their trade publications, too. Because of the infomercial

business, I watch a lot of television, and I review .lbout
20 hours of videotape every month. Because I do so much
work with direct-mail, I read ALL of my "junk mail." And I read
at least one book a week. Fortunately, I speed read. But, still....

###### How Do You Handle All This? I'm
sure you are digging out from under your own avalanche of
information everyday, too. Let me offer you some "shovels."

IMPROVE YOUR READING SKILLS
Many people are poor readers and insist that they do not "like"
to read. Sadly, our U.S. universities and high schools alike are
churning out mass numbers of young people who do not read,
get all their news from TV or radio, and, in a shocking number of
cases, are borderline illiterate. Once again, honesty with yourself
is the best policy. Hire a tutor if necessary. If not, then take or get
a good home study speed reading course. Speed reading (and
speed comprehension) is real.

By the way, I think you MUST read, as you can see in the
accompanying article (Figure 9.1), that I originally wrote for one
of my newsletters.

GET ONLY THE INFORMATION YOU REALLY WANT AND NEED
If you are really busy, and time is much more of an issue than
money, you can pay others to read for you. There are "clipping
services," including one run by The Wall Street Journal, that will

**APPARENTLY, YOU ARE NOW AN AMAZING ODDITY AKIN TO A**

**THREE-HEADED COW—IF** **YOU** **READ. The Saturday after**

Christmas, working in my office, I had the weekend Today Show on

the TV, and jerked my head around to watch when I heard this

amazing statement, delivered with breathless excitement:

_"Coming up next—we'll_ _interview the woman who read a_

_book a week for a year and has written her own book_

_about the experience!" What!?!_

With brief lapses here and there, I've read at least a book

a week every year for more than 30 years. What's the big deal

about this? Well, apparently it is a big deal. The last time I went to

Barnes & Noble, I bought a new biography of Ben Franklin, Tom

Peters' new book, a couple of other business books, a book about stroke-free

living, three paperback novels to take on airplanes, and

about 20 magazines. The clerk said: "Lifetime's supply, huh?"

Sheesh.

You MUST read a lot to succeed. Here are the reasons: (1) Varied,

diverse input, ideas, viewpoints, life stories, examples, all the

essential raw material poured into your subconscious mind, for it

to sift, sort, try matching up with other puzzle pieces it already has,

so it can occasionally yell "Eureka!" and hand you something prof-itable—without

daily flow of new stuff, it just sleeps. Wealth secret:

you cannot manufacture anything without raw material. Not even

(2) Without exposure to others' thinking, your own range of ilKnight

shrinks. Soon, you're a mental midget. Your range of iihMight

narrows, like your range of motion shrinks if you don't move

and stretch. (3) You can't stay current. I read a monstrous

amount and I still can't stay current. If you're not reading a book or i

wo, a dozen magazines, a few newspapers, and a few newsletters nvery

week, you must be way, way, way behind. Pretty soon, your

conversation reveals you as a dinosaur. (4) If you have kids, you

want to set a decent example for them. They need to see you read
ing. They need to hear you talking' about what you read. When I

was a kid, the years my family was dead broke, we made a regu
larly scheduled, weekly treks to the public library for an hour or so.

My father, mother, and I each picked out three or four books for the

week, took them home, read them, and talked about them. Now I

prefer going to the bookstore, because I have money, and like

keeping the books. However, I'm grateful for the library-habit years.

It would be a better thing for most families to do than going to the

movies, arcade, or Wal-Mart.

Historical note I had in a book I wrote back in 1985: the town leaders

of Franklin, Massachusetts, once wrote and asked Ben Franklin for a

donation so they could buy a bell for the church steeple. He sent

money with this note: "I'm honored you have named your town Franklin

and a donation is enclosed. However, I suggest you start a library with

it rather than buying a bell. I prefer sense to sound."

ferret through hundreds of daily newspapers, trade magazines,
etc., for the topic you have requested and fax to you just the
articles about your topic. You may have a staff person read and
clip for you. A good project for son, daughter, grandson,
granddaughter is a regular pile of reading, like trade journals,
to clip, highlight, even summarize for you. One of my clients
pays his high-school-age son $75.00 a week to read 14 different
trade journals and newsletters and record summaries and
excerpts on a weekly tape that he can listen to while he drives
to work.

SET ASIDE AND "BULK" MATERIAL THAT IS NOT TIME SENSITIVE,

TO REVIEW AT YOUR LEISURE
Catalogs, interesting-looking junk mail, and popular magazines
fall into this category. You MUST be very selective about what
warrants your attention now, what later, what never.

CONSIDER CONDENSATION
You can subscribe to Executive Book Summaries, for example, and
get brief summaries of a dozen new, "hot" business books every
month. This is sort of a Cliff Notes for adults. There's a similar
service, Newstrack, for news buffs.

USE YOUR V C R, D V D, OR TIVO
Tape programs of interest or importance to you, then watch them
at your convenience.

USE YOUR "DRIVE TIME" OR TRAVEL TIME AS LEARNING TIME
Here are the average to-and-from-the-office commute times for
major cities: New York, 1 hour, 5 minutes; Washington DC, 1 hour;

louston, 1 hour; L.A., 1 hour, 30 minutes; Dallas, 48 minutes;
Phoenix, 46 minutes; Buffalo, 40 minutes. Because most audio-1

.issettes are about 40 minutes in length, you can finish a cassette .1
day. Half a cassette (one side) per drive. And these days, every-Ihing

is available on audiocassette: people like me; experts in
various fields. Tapes on business, finance, health, sex, self-improvement,

foreign languages, travel, lectures from great col-lege
professors'; classic and contemporary fiction; you name it. If
you average 40 minutes a day x 250 workdays, that's 167 "class­
room hours" a year available to you.

RESIST THE SIREN SONG OF DISTRACTION
A lot of people let "noninformation" consume a lot of their time.
Today's news is tomorrow's fish-wrap, yet we have just about
become consumed with useless news. Twenty-four-hour-a-day
news stations; 60 Minutes beget 60 Minutes II; 20/20, 20/20 I

_downtown;_ _Dateline twice a week. News-talk radio. Etc. Yes, you_
want to be informed. But do you need to be informed about the
latest celebrity sex or shoplifting scandal, the latest athlete going
to jail, the weather in Bulgaria?

USE TECHNOLOGY, BUT RESIST SEDUCTION BY TECHNOLOGY
Technology is terrific when it really enhances productivity. But all
too often it only gives the illusion of that. People who spend
hours on end roaming the Internet or in e-mail dialogue don't
fool me. This is just another escape into busyness, just like going
to one darned meeting after another.

However, virtually every newspaper is now online, so if
you are traveling to a distant city and would benefit from being
familiar with that city's current news, it's readily available.

Most associations and trade journals have useful archives. My
Gold, Gold+, and Gold/VIP Members have access to a members'-only

[section of my dankennedy.com site, with transcripts of past](http://dankennedy.com)
interviews with experts, articles, past newsletters, and other reference material.

###### Specialize. But Not too Much.
It is probably better to know a great deal about one, two, or several things than a tiny bit about everything. Specialization
almost always adds value. And it can be used to limit information flow.

In business, I specialize in direct-response advertising and
direct-mail, with a subspecialty in "long form" (copy intensive)
advertising, and another subspecialty in the marketing of information products. As a result, I rarely bother reading Advertising
_Age magazine, a trade journal for traditional advertising profes-_
sionals, but I do read Direct Marketing magazine and DIRECT.
Being able NOT to read something is very useful.

However, too narrow of focus becomes myopia. If you
exclude too much information and input, you rob your brain of
the raw material needed for breakthrough ideas. Most people in
a particular industry are so myopic they start committing what
I call "marketing incest"—with the same result as real incest;
after just a few generations, everybody's stupid. People in "x"
business look at what everybody else in "x" business is doing,
they go to association meetings together, read the same trade
journals, and copy from each other. Getting outside this box is
important.

So, you need a balance. A lot of specialization, but not too
much specialization.

###### Know What You Are Looking For I
)ealing with today's overwhelming quantity of information is a bit

like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. That task
is made less daunting because you know you are looking for a
needle. It would be even worse if you were just told to go l

lirough the entire hay mound and look for something.
So, here's a little test (Figure 9.2) I give to my clients that you
might try taking at the end of each week. It will help you focus,
help you spot the right things, and find the needles in the
haystack of the week ahead. FIGURE

If you actually discipline yourself to get one answer to each
question worth putting down in writing just once a week, after a
year, you'll be 624 big steps ahead of your peers and competitors.
And the odds are excellent you'll have uncovered a few ultra-v.iluable

gems. Keeping these questions in the forefront of your mind
is a way of "electrifying and magnetizing your antenna," so
casual conversations or even an overheard conversation can v
ield something useful you'd otherwise never have noticed.

###### How to Organize and Manage Ideas
The great success educator Earl Nightingale wrote that "a single I

liought can revolutionize your life. A single thought can make
you rich or well-to-do, or it can land you in prison for the rest of
your life. Everything was an idea before it became real in the
world . . . the law of averages begins to swing in your direction
when you begin to produce ideas."

"Ideas," Earl said, "are like slippery fish."

It is up to us to catch every idea—not to let

one slip by us.

For many years, I used a strategy adapted from Michael
Vance, a close associate of Walt Disney, called the storyboard. I
**had a corked wall in my office, with vertical columns, each col-**
umn headed by a business or project title. Then, every time I had
**an idea, I'd jot it down on a small card, about half of a 3 x 5-inch**

CHAPTER 9 / HOW TO HANDLE THE INFORMATION AVALANCHE

Walt

card, and pushpin it up there in the correct column. I carried a little supply of cards with me at all times, so I never lost an idea.
Frankly, for a while, I drifted away from that; now I've returned.
I also maintain different "project notebooks" or even lega
pads dedicated to one project.

I have a pad and pen everywhere. Even in the bathroom.
Some people are very adept at verbalizing their ideas, so they
carry micro-recorders, dictate, have a staff person or service tran
scribe it all, then organize it. My brain engages with pen in han
or fingers on keyboard.

The important thing is for you to choose and use som
method for capturing every idea that comes to you, whereve
and whenever it happens.

Bulk is a problem for many of us. My friend Lee Milteer has
research, reference, and project piles in gigantic clear plastic bags,
so she can see what's in them. My piles have 4 x 6-inch title cards
on them. I have more than 1,000 books on shelves, but if I read a
book with only a few worthwhile pages, I tear out the pages, file
them, then throw out the book. The computer with the CD-ROM
is obviously a major tool in reducing bulk for information storage. From a time standpoint, the trick is to be able to quickly find
what you need when you need it—my own Achilles heel.

###### How the Well-Trained, Conditioned, and Fit Subconscious Mind Helps Handle the Information Avalanche

From the mid-1950s to 1960, Dr. Maxwell Maltz worked devising and perfecting practical methods for making the subconscious mind fitter and more useful. His work is summarized in

Maltz

his classic best-selling book Psycho-Cybernetics and in the recently
updated companion I co-authored, _The New Psycho-Cybernetics. I_
)r. Maltz's findings and methods have been of enormous impor-tance

to me my entire life, and I urge you to investigate them for yourself.

Specific to being more productive, and to better managing and utilizing information, you can deliberately make your subconscious

work better as a finder, organizer, and provider of whatever
you need to make a presentation, write a sales letter,
whatever. This is beyond ordinary memory. This is a creative
retrieval process.

For example, I, Like most direct-response ad copywriters,
maintain a room full of what we call "swipe files." These are files of

samples by category. One file contains "Headlines, Weight Loss

Ads," another "Headlines, Income Opportunity Ads." There

are files for opening sentences, guarantees, offers, and on .ind
on. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them. Huge
notebooks. Reference books. It takes a lot of time to go through all

the relevant ones physically, in preparing to write copy for a
client. Sometimes that's unavoidable, but quite often, for me, it is Van

not. Instead, I give my subconscious mind the assignment of
going through its stored "swipe files" to find the right idea,
"hook," or starting point for a particular ad—while _I sleep ! When_
I wake, the idea spews out through my fingers onto my computer
screen. This is not a happy accident or some freakish mind mutation unique to me. It is the result of deliberate training with
Psycho-Cybernetics. It probably liberates me from at least 20
hours of hard labor every month.
