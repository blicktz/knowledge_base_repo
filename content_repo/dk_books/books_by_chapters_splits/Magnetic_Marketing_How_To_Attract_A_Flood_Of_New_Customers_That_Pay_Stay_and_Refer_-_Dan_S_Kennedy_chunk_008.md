###### This is criminal waste. I’ve been poor and I abhor and detest and condemn waste.

 When you fail to follow up, you are simply shrugging your

 shoulders and accepting waste as yet another cost of doing

 business. This is madness.

 When you invest in advertising and marketing, you’re not just paying for the customers you get. You are paying for each

 lead you generate, every call, every walk-in, every email,

 every reaction and response of any kind.

 If an ad costs you $1000 and you get fifty calls, every call you fail to follow up on is exactly like pulling a $20 bill from

 your wallet, taking a match to it, and watching it go up in

 flames. So unless you truly do have money to burn, you need

 to make sure to follow up with every lead that comes through

 your door.
 There are hundreds of variations for follow up campaigns

 and strategies, blending offline with online. Here are just few

 ways you can follow up:

 1. Restate, ReSell, and Extend the Same Offer
—
 present what they didn’t do or buy again in the best

 way possible. You can do this
in a straightforward

 manner with letters
or emails.
You can also use

 “retargeting” online technology to keep the offer in

 front of someone long after they’ve seen it the first time—they’ll see it on other websites they visit, their

 Facebook feed, and so on.

 2. Provide a Stern or Humorous “Second Notice”

 Tied to an Onrushing Deadline
—present the offer

-----

###### again, reemphasizing the approaching deadline.

 3. “Third and Final Notice”
—Tie this communication
 to the deadline and the disappearance of the offer.

 4. Change the Offer
—Sometimes you can change the
 offer relatively easily, by offering new or extended

 installment payment terms, by swapping out a bonus

 for something different, etc.

 Doing nothing with even one lead is like flushing money down the toilet. It is a serious lapse in judgment and waste of

 precious resources every time you fail to follow-up with every

 lead or every customer.

#### RULE #7—THERE WILL BE STRONG
 COPY

###### The fact is, there is enormous, ever-growing, almost

 overwhelming competition for attention and interest—a daily

 tsunami of clutter that must be cut through or circumvented.

 In this environment, where literally tens of thousands of

 messages bombard your prospects every day, the ordinary and the normal are ignored, the cautious and calm messages

 unnoticed.

 You can’t send a shy, timid Casper Milktoast to knock on a

 door of a home or walk into a business and beg in barely a

 whisper for a few moments of the prospect’s time. So you can’t do that with a postcard, letter, flyer, newsletter, email,

 web video, etc. either.

-----

###### You want to send the Incredible Hulk instead—huge,

 glowing neon green, stomping, impossible to ignore. He

 shows up and the guy drops whatever he’s been doing, and pays attention.

 But the copy can’t just shout. Loud but irrelevant isn’t much

 better than quiet yet relevant. Loudness can grab attention, but you can’t convert it to interest. The Incredible Hulk

 stomping into your office would get your attention, but he’d still have trouble bridging to interest and having you engage

 in a conversation with about just any new product.
 Strong copy can be sensational and attention-commanding, but does so in a way that establishes relevance and credible

 authority—creating proactive interest in our information, goods, and services. Here’s a good example of a strong

 headline making a real benefit-oriented promise:

thousands

###### Most strong copy gets written backwards, starting from the customer’s interests, desires, frustrations, fears, thoughts,

 feelings, and experiences (remember the emphasis earlier on nailing down the WHO?)—and then journeys forward to reveal

 a solution tied to your business.
 Most ineffective copy takes the reverse path: starting instead with the company, product or service and its features,

 benefits, comparative superiority, and price. This is the common default approach the overwhelming majority of

-----

###### advertisers, copywriters, and salespeople fall back to, rather than developing a more creative, customer-focused approach.

 Here are two major mistakes your copy can’t afford to make:

 1. Writing factually and “professionally” rather

 than emotionally
. Great copy communicates conversationally, one-on-one, just like you would

 sitting across the table from a friend you can’t wait to let in on something wonderful you’ve just discovered. And it makes no difference whether

 you’re selling to Fortune 1000 CEOs or Al Bundy in his trailer—your best approach is to write like you

 talk, speaking passionately from the heart with deeply emotional appeals.

 2. Being timid or bland in your claims and
 promises.
Many believe their customers, clients, or

 patients are smarter and more sophisticated than others, at least immune to sensationalism and

 hyperbole, perhaps offended by it, and they discredit themselves by engaging in it. Wrong. These beliefs are in contradiction to facts and experience, for in

 every category of product or service, in media directed at presumably educated, sophisticated

 people, I can find examples of ads making grandiose and extraordinary claims that succeed mightily. Zig Ziglar was right: “Timid salesmen have skinny

 kids”—no matter who they’re selling to.

##### RULE #8—IT WILL LOOK LIKE MAIL-ORDER
 ADVERTISING

###### This rule is a great simplifier, because it ends your paying attention to—and trying to emulate—the overwhelming

 majority of all the advertising you see on TV, in magazines, in newspapers, online; by your peers and competitors. You are

 to go blind to anything except pure
 mail-order advertising. Anything else, shut the door, ignore.
 I am specifically speaking of their formats, layout, and

 appearance of advertising—whether print ad or a webpage or any other item.

 Here’s exactly the type of ad I’m talking about:

-----

###### Classic mail-order ads are typically broken up into one

 quarter, one-half, and one quarter of the page, give or take. The top quarter is for headline and subheads; the middle half

 for presentation of product or proposition, sometimes aided by testimonials; the bottom quarter for the offer and clear response instructions, often with a coupon.

 The most frequently used alternative is the advertorial, which mimics an article.

 The other reliable format is that of a letter, from you to the reader, at whatever length is necessary to do the job. I have clients mailing 4, 8,16, 24 and in one case, 64-page sales

 letters. One of these, a 16-page one, literally tacked up online as a website, having traffic driven to it, has produced $1

 million a year for nine years running.
 To see real mail-order advertising, you need to assemble a diverse assortment of magazines in which highly successful

 mail-order companies consistently run full-page

-----

###### advertisements. These include Reader’s Digest Large Print Edition
, tabloids like the National Enquirer
, and business publications like Investors Business Daily
and Entrepreneur
.

 Also check out special interest magazines for model railroad hobbyists, gun enthusiasts, horse lovers, etc. as you’ll find

 fractional and full-page mail-order ads.
 Tear out and keep these ads as research; discard all others
. Let these ads be your only models. If you respond to some,

 your mailbox will soon be full of direct mail that also follows classic formats and architecture.
 You’ll eventually have a collection of advertisements that—

 if studied and modeled for your own use—represents money in the bank.

 If you’re looking for a shortcut, I have compiled a few along the way, with templates in my Magnetic Marketing System and Toolkit (
available at www.NoBSInnerCircle.com
.)

##### RULE #9—RESULTS RULE. PERIOD.

###### Results rule. Period.
 Do not let anyone confuse, bamboozle or convince you that

 anything else is of any importance. Nobody’s opinion counts —even yours.

 And there’s no excuse for not assessing results any more. With today’s technology, it’s easier than ever to link and track specific promotions to quantifiable results. You can even do

 what’s called “split-testing” or “A-B” testing, where you match one headline against another to see which produces the best

 results, and then continue the process over and again. Test.

-----

###### Monitor. Adjust. The goal is to gradually achieve the very best

 results possible.
 The only thing that matters is the answer to the question,

 “What results did I get?” When you implement this into your marketing approach and marketing messages, you change the way you communicate with your prospects and customers

 dramatically and forever.

**NOTE
 : A lot of what you have just read in the previous rules may seem**
weird, sound funny, or feel wrong to you. Too bold. Too aggressive. Too hypey. Too unprofessional. Too far outside the box of what’s deemed “correct” for
your profession or field. That’s understandable. But it doesn’t matter because
remember,
your opinions NEVER COUNT
. You don’t get a vote, neither does
your wife, your mother, your golfing buddy, neighbor, competitor, employee,
nobody gets a vote. The only vote that counts is the customer’s and the only
legal, valid ballots are cash, checks, and credit cards.

#### RULE #10—YOU WILL BE A TOUGH-MINDED DISCIPLINARIAN
 AND PUT YOUR BUSINESS ON A STRICT DIRECT MARKETING DIET

###### Many business owners who perennially struggle and suffer

 are very much aware of things that need doing but simply lack the will to do them.
 Maybe it’s a longtime vendor or employee or client, now a

 “friend,” who you know is toxic and needs to be replaced, but you can’t muster the will to fire them.
 Maybe there’s an ad that you keep spending money on that

 you know is failing to deliver results, but you lack the will to fix it or shut it down.

-----

###### Maybe there’s a website you know isn’t producing either,

 but the very thought of getting it remade is painful, so it stays as is.
 From this point forward, with ALL advertising and

 marketing, you have to be thick-skinned about criticism, tough-minded about money invested, extremely disciplined in

 thought and action, and dedicated to carrying out your game plan, all fueled by a resolute will to win.

 IMPORTANT:

 Anything
that doesn’t conform to the 10 Rules discussed in this chapter, do not let in at all. Just say no. And bar the door.

 When you DO implement all these into your marketing approach and marketing messages, you change—for the better—the way you communicate with your prospects and

 customers dramatically and forever.
