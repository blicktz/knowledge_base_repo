###### Testing small is the number-one way we prevent wasting money in our clients’ marketing campaigns and can show continuous improvement.
 Imagine an ice cream manufacturer releasing a new flavor. It doesn’t just put something together and send it directly to the stores for sales. It creates several versions, tests in-house, tests out-of-house, and then chooses the option that performs best.
 Your marketing should be treated the same way—with no guesses or assumptions.
 We recently split-tested email time-of-day for one of our clients and found that sending email in the evening received double the response rate vs. the same email sent in the morning. We can (and will!) use this data to optimize its future messaging.
 Take the emotion out of your marketing, and execute your strategies based on measurable results from your testing.
 Our motto: Test small and launch big. When testing, keep the following social media ad-testing best practices in mind:


-----

###### • Track conversions, not clicks. You want to optimize your overall ROI,
 not waste dollars on clicks. An ad that gets 100 clicks is not better than an ad than only gets 25, if the second ad gets more conversions.
 • Set up the target market demographics so you are always testing only
 one thing at a time. If you combine too many variables in your ads, it will be difficult to optimize them well. (Was it the moms who did best or those who were recently engaged?)
 •  Start with split-testing the demographic, and then use the best
 performing demographic in the rest of the tests. (Do moms who like rugby do better than moms who like HGTV?)
 •  For the ad image that performs the best, test changing the ad’s
 coloring to see if it performs better. (Does a black background perform better than blue or white? Better than red?)
 • Take the best coloring of the ad, and test different wording to see if
 that makes a difference. (If we tell them to “click here” vs. “download now,” does that do better?)
 •  Test adding a call-to-action button vs. running without a button.
 (Does adding a call to action hurt sales because your social media post now looks like an ad, or does it help sales because there is a clear path the prospect can take for action?)

 When you have run all of your optimization tests, it is time to move on to the landing page.
 Here’s a quick checklist of the items to test for:

  Ad images
  Headline  Text  Target market demographics, interests, and behaviors  Landing page copy  Opt-in form  Text below the photo  When the ad is run (time of day, day of week, week of month, month
 of year)  Daily budget  Type of bid, automated or manual


-----

######  Placement (Newsfeed, right side, mobile app, mobile and/or
 desktop)

 Unfortunately, social media is like any other form of marketing. If you want a continued high ROI, you have to keep testing. Steven Spielberg was rejected by the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts multiple times. He went on to create the first summer blockbuster with Jaws in 1975 and has won three Academy Awards.
 Do not rest on your laurels. Status quo never got anyone Academy Award Success. Continue to test to earn your next blockbuster actually deserving of an award.


#### #NoBSsm Social Takeaways

###### • Social media gives you the ability in a day or two to know
 exactly how a marketing campaign will perform

 • If you only create ads based on assumptions, nine times out of
 ten, you will be wrong.

 • Testing is the number on eway to prevent wasting marketing
 dollars.

 • Track conversions, not clicks.

 • Do not reset of your laurels. Status quo never got anyone

### Up-Leveling Your

## Social Media

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### Five Ways to Grow Your List for FREE (Before
 Spending a Dime on Advertising)

###### Vox Research estimates that $58 billion will be spent this year on social media marketing ads. This doesn’t even take into consideration all of the money spent on Google, YouTube, and let’s not forget those waste-of- money-but-entertaining Superbowl commercials.
 Beyond ads though, there are ways to grow your list for free. Yes, without spending a dime on advertising. Some will be new, some will be obvious, but the question is … which of them are you currently doing?

 1. Create a Juicy Carrot featuring others. Put together a Juicy Carrot
 with tips from experts in your niche, like Mastermind member Todd Tramonte did with his video series, “How to Get a Listing a Week” (see Figure 16.1). He simply asked other real estate professionals for their one idea and then once they were in the video, he asked them to promote it to their lists.

**FIGURE 16.1: Todd Tramonte’s Video Series**


-----

###### 2. Put your Juicy Carrot link EVERYWHERE. There should be a link to
 your Juicy Carrot everywhere you can include it. Link your Facebook cover photo, bio on Instagram, bio on LinkedIn, signature line on email, About Us on your website, at the end of every blog post, and anywhere else you have content. Schedule some time to go through all of your assets and make sure links are included everywhere. See Figure 16.2 on page 303 for an example.
 (Side note, if you want more followers on Instagram to see your Juicy Carrot link, make sure to check out your Powerful Professionals Business Coaching Free Guide: 21-Day Instagram Growth Plan inside your portal. [Not a member yet? Join now at Powerfulprofessionals.com/action.]) 3. Launch a quiz. Post a quiz on all social media channels asking, “If
 you had a magic wand, what is one thing you’d change about ___ (your business, the last diet you were on, your marriage … or whatever your niche is)”? Offer a prize to one person who fills it out in the next week and then promise to give everyone who enters a report of the answers. And if you want even more leads, give them a double entry if they share the quiz to their social media following. You can use the free platform Survey Monkey to conduct the survey.

**FIGURE 16.2: Instagram Growth Plan**


-----

###### 4. Be a guest. Check out blogs, podcasts, Facebook Live shows, and
 more from those in your niche, and ask to be a guest contributor. You’ll offer tips from your Juicy Carrot, and give it away for free. 5. Do a Facebook Live weekly. Facebook Live offers the greatest ROI
 when it comes to free distribution and lead generation. But you have to be consistent. Schedule a time you can be on live every week, and stick to it without excuses. To combat my ever-changing schedule, I had to schedule mine for 9:00 P.M. on Wednesday nights. Because in my schedule, that is a time I can control.

 It doesn’t matter when you do it. Just pick a time and stick with it.

#### How to Run a 72-Hour Buzz Campaign

###### It was amazing, but it wasn’t by accident.
 Last year we had a record-breaking launch of my newest podcast, “Made to Thrive,” and it happened because of stacking … (more on that in a second).
 Thanks to our tribe, it was the most successful podcast launch we’ve ever done. Not only did we get massive podcast subscribers, but we grew


-----

###### our list and drove in sales. And the entire campaign took place over only 72 hours.
 The good news is, you can do the same thing for your next podcast, book, or product launch.
 This campaign starts by creating buzz around the mystery of “something is coming.” The build-up is all leading to the big announcement. When the announcement hits, you make the offer so good that you almost want to throw up because you feel like you are giving too much away. (This is the official way to know if it’s a good offer, btw.)
 Here’s how we did it… 72 hours ahead of time.

 1.  Announcement. We scheduled a Facebook Live teasing a big
 announcement. This post created immediate social proof and started to build buzz with our followers (see Figure 16.3 on page 305). 2. Social. We posted on Facebook and Instagram newsfeeds and Insta Stories with a link to the Facebook Live announcement (see Figure 16.4 on page 305). 3. Pre-promotion. Asked friends and family to download episodes and
 post a review to create social proof before launching (see Figure 16.5 on page 306). 4. Day-of promotion. We sent an email out in the morning inviting our
 list to attend the event, and I posted on social media (see Figures 16.6 below, and 16.7 on page 307).

###### 5. Starting-now promotion. When I went live, we sent out a notification
 via email and ManyChat (see Figure 16.8 on page 308). 6. On air. Started the Live by asking folks where they were and what
 beverage they were drinking to give the video juice so more of my list would be alerted. I gave the incentive of a free Powerpack of goodies if they subscribed along with a chance to win an iPad mini if they left a review (see Figure 16.9 on page 308).

###### We offered a big incentive for people to subscribe that day, giving them a Powerpack for free (see Figure 16.10).

**FIGURE 16.10: Offered Free Powerpack for Subscribing**

###### 7.  Post-announcement. We sent out a message to our Messenger list
 and an email with a link to the promotion and posted on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn (see Figure 16.11).

 8.  Day-after announcement. A follow-up email went out and was
 posted on social media (see Figures 16.12 below and 16.13 on page 311).

**FIGURE 16.12: Day-After Announcement on Social Media**

###### Using all of the channels together in a concentrated promotion allowed all of the work we had done before to create an audience to pay off and produce a very successful podcast launch. Not only did we enroll podcast subscribers, but we made sales of the Made to Thrive Planner and brought in new members.

##### CHAPTER 17

### The Big Picture

#### Reaching More People

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that
 fear. —Nelson Mandela

 I recently heard a story that personifies so many entrepreneurs’ journeys.
 A young man’s mother told him something he didn’t want to hear. “You are going to have to go back to being a waiter at Red Lobster.” This was not the answer he was looking for. He hated being a waiter there. The restaurant had just released its free cheddar biscuits. The tips were decreasing, but work was increasing.
 His small company had already tasted success. LL Cool J had promoted him, and others were asking to wear his clothes. Orders were pouring in, and now he was going to go back to being a waiter?
 The reality was that they had already mortgaged his mom’s house, sold everything they owned, and had nothing left. Yet the company couldn’t fund the supplies and production of the orders it received. Not knowing better, it let the retailers order with terms only favorable to the retailers, including 120 days to pay for the clothing they were receiving.
 So, reluctantly he went back to being a waiter. He promised his mother he would earn the $2,000 she asked for. He trusted her. After all, she had


-----

###### mortgaged her house for him. But he was still uneasy about spending $2,000 on one last-ditch effort.
 With enough biscuits served and $2,000 earned, he gave his mom the money, and she finally revealed what she was going to do. She was going to take out a direct-response advertisement seeking funding.
 He fought her at first. He thought that was the craziest idea he ever heard. Did she know how hard it was to earn that money?
 But as smart moms do, she proceeded with faith and courage and placed that ad in the The New York Times.
 It read: “Need partner to help fund 1 million dollars in orders. Serious inquiries only.”
 Most of the respondents were not legitimate businesspeople (folks with names like Rocco, Tony Two Times, and Small Guy Stan), but a few were. Ultimately, they struck a deal with Samsung Textiles, which would underwrite the manufacturing of their orders.
 This entrepreneur, of course, is Daymond John, with a current net worth of $250 million, who founded clothing line FUBU. Today he is on the hit show Shark Tank, risking his own money in deals presented on the show, and he started Shark Branding as a marketing company.
 Daymond John is incredibly successful. Now. But he had a long journey filled with an incredible amount of hard work to get there.
 I have yet to meet a successful person for which this wasn’t the case. Generally before the success came long hours, fear, doubt, sacrifices, struggles, and failures.
 The journey of the entrepreneur is not easy. I struggled for years before my company started to thrive. It was a long time of very little social life, lots of debt, and exhaustion. I almost gave up many times—at least once per year for the first ten years in business. I would apply for a job just dreaming about things getting better. Thankfully I never got called in for an interview. Not once.
 I am just not meant to work for anyone else. I am guessing the same might be true for you. If you have made it this far in the book, you are one of the few.
 According to The Atlantic, The Pew Research Center found nearly a quarter of American adults had not read a single book in 2014. A January

###### 2019 CNBC article by Abby Hess shows the statistic sadly remains the same.[1]
 As in, they hadn’t cracked a paperback, fired up a Kindle, or even hit play on an audiobook while in the car. The number of nonbook readers has nearly tripled since 1978.
 And most who bought a book, didn’t finish it. It’s not just business books, though. Even Fifty Shades of Grey went unfinished by 75% of those who read it.
 The Wall Street Journal reports that the book’s completion is calculated by the passages highlighted in the book. Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James was only finished 25.9% of the way. So, if you read this book through, you are seeking better things for your business and your life. You want a change.
 There are a lot of strategies contained in these pages. It can seem overwhelming and daunting, but the road to success often is.
 How do you eat an elephant? Start small. Get to know your best customers better. Seek more of them. Create great content and distribute it for free. Dabble your dollars in the paid platforms, and keep an eye on your return.
 Most of our clients start with a small testing marketing budget and only scale beyond a few thousand dollars a month after several months of testing —even the very big companies and firms.
 I encourage you to take the first step toward your next chapter today. I’m excited to see what happens because of it. Please visit www.NoBSsmBook.com for free resources and strategies to get you started and report back on how your journey is going.
 You have value that should be shared with the world. It’s time for you to find those people who need you.

#### The Trouble with Trending

###### by Dan Kennedy I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, you should never try to be everything to everyone with your marketing.
