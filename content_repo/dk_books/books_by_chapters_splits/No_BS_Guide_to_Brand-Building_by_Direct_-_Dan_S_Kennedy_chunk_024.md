###### In other words, stories are way sexy. Even when they themselves are very far from it. Dr. Paul Zak, one of the Claremont researchers, showed volunteers a video that told a story about a four-year-old boy with terminal brain cancer—and also showed the same group a video of the same length about a four-year-old boy going to the zoo without any real narrative to it. Those that watched the first video had a 47% higher level of the love hormone. “Of all the stimuli we’ve developed that release oxytocin, this one was the best,” said Zak of the story experiment.
 Why do stories trigger that kind of reaction? Other research suggests that it happens because we identify with whoever the story is about—and put ourselves in their shoes. After all, we’re all people—and we all experience the same fears, desires, joys, and ambitions.
 More fun with brain scanning confirms that this is true. Jeffrey Zacks of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, ran functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of people reading a story or watching a
 movie[2]—and discovered that, when the main character encountered a situation, it activated the same parts of the brain in the subjects that would have responded if they themselves had been in the same predicament in real life. And it didn’t matter if the story was read or experienced through a movie or a video—it was the content of the story itself that provoked the reaction.
 We are addicted to stories in a very real sense—and here’s more research that proves it. Read Montague of Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Virginia, and William Casebeer of the U.S. Defense Advanced
 Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in Arlington, Virginia,[3] analyzed how listening to a story affects the brain’s reward centers—the parts that respond to such wonderful things as sex, good food, and drugs. Casebeer’s conclusion? “If I were a betting man or woman, I would say that certain types of stories might be addictive and, neurobiologically speaking, not that different from taking a tiny hit of cocaine,” says Casebeer.
 Simply put, strong stories key into our emotions in a deep and profound way; we identify with them in a way we don’t identify with raw data. That’s why Jared’s miracle sandwich diet was so effective for Subway—and also why raw black-and-white information wouldn’t have been. Consumers could see that eating at Subway actually caused a person like them to lose

###### weight—and, most importantly, could see it working for them. They identified with Jared—and it made for a very rewarding experience for their reward centers.

##### Splitting the Difference

###### Beyond the emotional component, however, stories actually accomplish a critical function for our brains. Believe it or not, we need them to figure out our lives.
 Let’s switch up researchers to find out just why this is—and examine the work of neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Gazzaniga has done incredible research in the whole right brain-left brain arena. He’s the person who discovered that the mind’s right side was more artistic, creative, and visual, while the left side
 was more verbal and intellectual (and he did this at the ripe old age of 25).[4]
 Now, given that the right side of the brain was the artistic and creative half, that half would be the one that would naturally respond best to stories in whatever form they take, right?
 Wrong—and this is where it gets interesting. You see, Gazzaniga also discovered that you could actually separate the left side of the brain from the right, and the left side wouldn’t suffer any loss in IQ points. Don’t ask us how he found that out. We’re afraid it will sound like a horror movie we definitely do not want to watch. Ever.
 But something about the brain’s ability to seemingly function the same, even when split in half, confused the good doctor. It didn’t add up—if the different sides of our brains acted that independently, what accounted for our unity of thought, action, and purpose?
 To find out, Gazzaniga used his access to people who had had surgery to disconnect communication between the two halves of their brains (this is done sometimes for severe epileptics, for example). What he discovered was equally revolutionary.
 Whatever information he gave to the right side of the brain, the left side of the brain would then work overtime to explain. The left side, through storytelling, concocted narratives to make sense of random information. More research confirmed his initial results: Gazzinga began to call the left


-----

###### side of our brains “The Interpreter”—because a big part of its job is to put together individual facts to make a complete mental “picture.”
 In other words, the artistic half of our brains doesn’t come up with the stories—the intellectual half does. And not as a creative pursuit—but just as a way to make sense of what was happening all around it.
 Think about your own daily life. Think about how many times you try to explain to yourself (or to someone who’s with you) something random that happens.
 For example . . . you hear a random piece of gossip about someone acting strangely. You immediately try to connect the dots to solve the riddle of why that person acted out of character, and come up with excuses like, “They’re getting a divorce,” “They’re on drugs,” or maybe, “They lost their job.”
 Or . . . your car makes a funny noise on the way home from the store. You immediately try to formulate an explanation in your head for why it’s making that sound. Needs an oil change. Maybe the muffler’s loose.
 Or . . . you watch TV shows like CSI, NCIS, or Bones—hourlong shows that have a central mystery at their core in each episode. These shows are so popular (just as murder mysteries and detective novels have traditionally been) because the audience is constantly trying to figure out the solution to whatever bizarre crime is being dramatized.
 This tendency gets even more intense with a show like Mad Men or Homeland, shows that have an ongoing storyline. Something shocking happens at the end of the episode—and you spend the week trying to concoct the storyline that led up to the cliffhanger (and not just you—there are 50 million people on the internet also blogging and commenting, also trying to explain what happened).
 Now, the above examples have something very much in common. In all instances, you pretty much have no idea what the real story is. But, the sad truth is . . . you can’t stop your brain from trying to figure it out anyway.
 That’s your left side talking. It wants to know. It NEEDS to know. Early man, pre-science, would make up various “gods” to explain away all kinds of natural happenings. That’s because, at that time, humans weren’t capable of discovering that the earth was round and it rotated—and that’s why the sun came up in the morning and sank down in the evening.
 But they still had to know why.


-----

###### So they made up stuff. They filled in the blanks, just like we do every day.
 It may be hard for you to think of Subway’s Jared as an ancient god, but, in a sense, he was. He personified Subway’s healthy eating possibilities and provided a living explanation of how they might work through his very dramatic weight-loss story. He filled in the blanks in a way that had impact. So people bought his StorySelling™—and, more importantly to the company, they subsequently bought a lot of Subway sandwiches.
 As we’ve hopefully demonstrated, a myriad of scientists and researchers (along with all of human history as well!) have all come up with the same conclusion about stories: that certain ones really do answer primal needs that we all need to have met.
 That’s what makes StorySelling[™] so powerful. When done correctly, it hits the human brain with an incredible impact, most of which is felt on a subconscious level. It also activates the pleasure centers of the brain— which makes you want to hear more.
 Jared’s diet breakthrough saga accomplished all that and more. It made a treat into a health food (“You mean you can lose weight by eating 6-inch subs?”) and it created the perception that Subway’s food wasn’t just good to eat, it was also good for you.
 The campaign was as effective as it could have possibly been, simply because Jared’s story was true—and yet unbelievable at the same time.

##### The Four Key Factors of StorySelling™

###### When you apply StorySelling™ techniques to your brand, you have the potential to maximize your impact on your audience—and you give yourself the greatest opportunity to persuade them of your value vs. your competition’s.
 There are four key factors that, when combined, create the perfect climate for StorySelling™ success:

##### 1. Simplicity


-----

###### How many stories do we hear in a day? How much information do we end up taking in? The answer to both of those questions is the same: a scary, crazy amount. That means if your story isn’t simple and easy to grasp, most of us, unless we’re already intensely interested in the story, aren’t going to hang on to it. Our lives are too busy and our minds too cluttered to take in something that’s not directly relevant to what we’re dealing with at the moment. With Jared, the facts were clear and easy to process—the guy ate nothing but Subway sandwiches for months and lost a whole bunch of weight.

##### 2. Authenticity
###### We are also bombarded with marketing campaigns night and day—and most of us can smell a sales pitch a mile off. If your story only seems like an effort to get your audience to buy—or, even worse, if it doesn’t have the ring of truth—no one is going to take it seriously. Jared was obviously not a polished media pro when he started doing Subway commercials—and that worked in the campaign’s favor. He seemed real because he was real—and so was his story, as many in the media found out when they checked it out and verified in their reporting that it was true.

##### 3. Visibility
###### Obviously, the public, or at the very least, your target audience, has to have access to the story you want to tell. There are a lot of channels you can utilize to deliver your narrative; the point is, you can’t expect your potential leads to come to you, you have to find a viable way to bring your story to them. Subway obviously put a lot of money behind exposing Jared’s story to the public and made sure everyone they could possibly reach heard about it.

##### 4. Relevancy
###### It also has to be a story that people want to hear. As we noted with Jared’s Subway commercials, viewers loved the idea that you could lose weight at a fast-food restaurant. Again, we have so many people out there trying to sell


-----

###### us their stories that we block out as many as we can, just to keep our sanity. That means your narrative must be one that your audience is predisposed to hear for one reason or another—and that reason should be a powerful one.
 Just like with any other powerful force, StorySelling[™] is awesome to use—as long as you can maintain some control over it. Often, that’s not possible. Ten years into Jared’s run as a Subway spokesperson, for example, he ended up packing on a few pounds—which wasn’t good for the campaign, which kept trying to cover up the weight gain. There were even a few ads where Jared’s waistline was disguised by big bulky coats.
 When something like that happens, however, there are ways to continue your narrative and make it turn back in your favor. In Subway’s case, they turned Jared’s weight gain into a positive—as they had him train for the New York Marathon in a new ad campaign, which gave them an entirely
 new narrative to StorySell[™] with their sandwich star (and also guaranteed that he would again be svelte and commercial-ready!).
 So think about what story you’re telling with your brand—and look closely at it to see if it’s really the most effective one you can tell. If you’re
 not putting the power of StorySelling[™] behind your brand, you’re missing out on your single strongest opportunity to deliver your message in the most memorable way—and with the most profitable results!

#### CHAPTER 17


## The Mouse and the Bunny

###### by Dan S. Kennedy


###### alt frequently reminded everybody that “It all started with a mouse”—which he first named Mortimer and changed to Mickey at his wife’s urging. Hef’s empire began with a stag as a

# W

###### symbol of maleness, abandoned because it was already taken, so replaced by the symbol of eternal horniness, the rabbit. You can make the case his success actually began with Marilyn Monroe, but his brand-builder quickly became the bunny.
 These are the two great brand-builders I’ve studied most carefully and admire most: Walt Disney and the keepers of his legacy and Hugh Hefner.
 You might not think the two should share the same sentence, but they have a lot more in common than most people would imagine. In fact, Disney and Hefner were developing their businesses and brands in an overlapping time frame, and I feel confident they paid attention to each other with interest, and borrowed from each other liberally.


-----

###### They both began with virtually no money to work with and built valuable, powerful, iconic brands with little investment in actual brand- building and virtually no brand/image advertising. Both Disney and Hefner grew their brands on the back of direct marketing and sales activity, on free advertising via media partnerships and publicity, and leverage of the media.
 Other shared strategies include:

 • Creating a world of their own. Walt’s line “The Happiest Place On
 Earth” might have been used by Hefner for the world of Playboy, symbolized by the Playboy Mansion, if Walt hadn’t already snagged it. Instead, we have actor Robert Culp’s toast for the Mansion: “Gentlemen, gentlemen, be of good cheer, for they are out there and we are in here.” The existential importance of The Playboy Mansion was shown off in a Playboy magazine cartoon, circa 1960, in which a truth-seeker has climbed to a mountain peak to beg wisdom from the wise guru at the top of the mountain. The guru tells him: “There is a man who lives in a mansion full of beautiful women and wears pajamas all the time. Sit at his feet and learn from him, for he has found the secret of true happiness.” Walt also featured a symbolic structure at Disneyland, and again at Disney World: Sleeping Beauty’s Castle, where dreams come true and romance flourishes. Both Disney and Playboy feature a profound sense of place—where no one ever need grow up.
 • Standing for and promoting a philosophy. Hefner even called it “The
 Playboy Philosophy,” and explained it in detail, beginning with a series of wordy essays extending over many months’ issues of the magazine. Hefner argued against censorship, for sexual freedom, for civil rights, even for modern feminism. He also created a series of internal ads titled “What Sort of a Man Reads Playboy?,” which presented a profile worthy of aspiration. Yes, readers were attracted by the pictures and the sex, but they did read the articles, including serious ones. Walt Disney also stood for certain enunciated principles and values, built into the films and entertainment product, taught by Walt, and integrated into projects like Epcot and Celebration. Here are a few revealing Walt Disney quotes:


-----

###### “Disneyland would be a small world in itself—it would encompass the essence of the things that are good and true in American life . . . a place for people to find happiness and new knowledge. The older generation can capture the nostalgia of days gone by, the younger generation can savor the challenge of the future, and it will be a source of hope and inspiration to all the world.”
