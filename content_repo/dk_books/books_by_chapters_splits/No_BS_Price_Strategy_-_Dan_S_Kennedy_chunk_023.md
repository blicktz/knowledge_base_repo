Anyway, how does Allen Brothers make their higher price appropriate? One way is with the
Principle of Association. Their catalogs usually feature a list of famous, top-tier steakhouses from
all across the country, that buy their steaks from Allen Brothers. One of their catalogs I kept in my
advertising files prominently displayed the logo of a different top steakhouse on every page. This
reinforces their basic promise: by buying from them, you can have the same exceptional quality
steaks that the very finest (and most expensive) restaurants serve their customers—at home. This
suggests that, at their prices, you are actually getting a bargain, if you compare to the prices of
dining out in these restaurants. (See page 122, Avoiding Apples to Apples Comparisons). It also has
them selling bragging rights and the cocktail party story, something affluent customers respond to.
When your guests praise the steaks, you can say “Well, we have them flown in overnight from Allen
Brothers. Have you heard of them? They provide the steaks to Mortons.”

Look at everything Allen Brothers accomplishes with their association to the top steakhouses:

 - Differentiation, from all other purveyors of steaks

 - Makes their extremely high prices a bargain by comparison

-----

 - Makes it “OK” to spend so much—you’re saving by dining in

 - Frees them to price as they wish—without concern over competitors’ prices

 - Gives their customers “pride of ownership” of something judged by experts (the top
steakhouses’ chefs) to be the best

 - Gives their customers a bragging-rights story to tell

Obviously, the restaurants buy from a different division of the company, at very different,
wholesale prices. I do not know this, but it wouldn’t surprise me if Allen Brothers gave them
additional discounts in order to make use of their names and logos. If need be, it would be money
well spent.

**Any business can do this, at national or local level. The specific association tactic used by**
**Allen Brothers is getting and bragging about cachet clients. The great ad man David Ogilvy got**
great self-promotion mileage out of having Rolls-Royce as his client. For many years, a lot of
business came my way—with little or no fee resistance—because it was known in direct marketing
circles that the Guthy-Renker Corporation was my client and relied on me for advice, advertising
copy, and script writing. (Guthy-Renker is the firm behind celebrity-filled TV infomercials and the
leader in that field.) Many decided for themselves they wanted the guy who was Guthy-Renker’s
go-to guy. It’s important to understand that association not only brought clients to me, but facilitated
my charging my chosen, way-above-par fees. Similarly, my 9 year’s tenure on the best-known,
largest public seminar tour, drawing audiences of 10,000 to 35,000 in 25-plus cities a year, brought
me a lot of other speaking engagements from corporate and association clients—and made my
compensation requirements a non-issue.

At a local level, it is often easier to leverage the cachet client. If it is known that Mrs. RichBritches, the number-one star of the local social circuit, patronizes your boutique, all the women at
her country club and in her circle will follow suit, as will women who only know of her. Diana
Coutu, operator of Diana’s Gourmet Pizzeria, makes much of being the official pizza provider of the
local, very popular hockey team, of having diabetic-friendly pizzas endorsed by doctors and nurses
of the top area hospital, and of her own competing in and winning awards in international pizza chef
competitions. It is not coincidental that her prices skew quite high—as of this writing, from $22.00
to $38.00 for a large, specialty pizza. Her business doubled from 2008 to 2009, incidentally, despite
that thing you might have heard was going around, recession. (See more at:

## NO B.S. Price Strategy Warning #5

**A lot of emphasis is put on product, proposition, and price, and rightfully so, but**
**never lose sight of how important the prospect’s perception of the seller is—of the**
seller’s expertise, status, authority, etc. Two different merchants can present exactly the

same proposition to the same prospect, and one be met with enormous resistance (and

price resistance) and the other met with unquestioning acceptance.

At the local level, the boost from any national prominence can be extraordinary. My friend Mike
Storms, who owns a thriving martial arts academy near New Orleans and gives private martial arts,
mind-set, and success coaching to executives and entrepreneurs, is flown in to work with a couple
NFL teams and a top college football team, and has several NFL athletes as private clients. I hope
he won’t mind me revealing this, but he under-charges these clients by necessity (as there are many
eager to replace him who would work for free, only for the glory) because the associative effect is
very beneficial to him in his main businesses back home. It is not coincidental that Mike’s student
fees at his academy are the highest of any competing school nearby or any within a 100 mile radius,
[and his private coaching fees run into the thousands. (See more at www.stormskarate.com.)](http://www.stormskarate.com/)

There are many ways to develop these associations, beyond the scope of this book to cover in
detail. Obviously, you can make a point of pursuing influential customers or clients. Create a “top
50” list of local celebrities, owners of well-known and respected businesses, influential civic

-----

leaders, and the like, and keep them on your mailing list, invite them to every event your business
hosts or sponsors, send them articles that may interest them; make yourself and your business
visible to them, persistently. You may be able to volunteer your services as a resident expert to some
organization, charity, or event, that provides promotable bragging rights or good networking
opportunities.

By all means, be alert for opportunities. One year in one of the cities that the big seminar tour I
mentioned went every year, a young limousine service owner was in the audience. Afterward, she
wrote to the seminar company owner and many of the speakers, offering to provide free limousine
service the next time the tour came to town. My client, who owned the company, took her up on her
offer. The next year, she chauffeured many of the celebrities appearing on stage with us—they’re a
blur, but I believe that time, in that city, that included Mary Tyler Moore, George Foreman, Larry
King, the famous defense attorney Gerry Spence, and the famous business speakers Zig Ziglar,
Brian Tracy, Tom Hopkins, and me. She got her photo taken with each of us, standing by her limo,
with its logo on the door visible. She used this to get some very good publicity immediately: a
feature story with the photos in the local newspaper, and an interview on a top radio program. It all
migrated to her website and brochure. Instantly hers became “the limousine service of the stars” in
that city. On my advice, she raised her prices to a point above all competition.

Another friend of mine, Jordan McCauley, is an expert in connecting entrepreneurs and marketers
with celebrities. In his outstanding book _Celebrity Leverage, he explains exactly how even small_
companies can, for very modest sums, get their products in the backstage gift bags given out at
Hollywood awards shows, given out in celebrity gift suites at various events, and otherwise put into
the hands of celebrities. This tactic has helped unknown, small jewelry and fashion designers,
cookies and cupcake bakeries, children’s products inventors, and many others leapfrog to
prominence. Keep in mind this all impacts on price as well as demand. Jordan tells, for example, of
jewelry designer Amy Peters succeeding at getting her jewelry worn to a movie premiere by an
actress in the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious, having several Survivor contestants seen wearing her jewelry
in photographs in a number of magazines, and having her jewelry worn on the TV show, The OC—
all thanks to sending out gift baskets direct to celebrities, exactly as described in the book. When
she migrates that to her website, catalog, and blog, and provides it to retailers who might carry her
line, it not only spurs interest and demand, but tends to make price a non-issue.

## CHAPTER 16

 The Deadly Trap of Bad Economics

 Dan Kennedy

**To a great degree, I run a M*A*S*H* unit for wounded marketers. Just like on the old M*A*S*H**
television show, periodically sirens go off, and my assistant, Vicky, yells “Incoming!” Because I am
so expensive, a lot of clients foolishly wait until they are in trouble to come to me. At that point,
what they usually want is to quickly get from me a better, more powerful and effective ad or directmail campaign or integrated offline-online campaign to counteract their collapsing sales and
dwindling profits. That is rarely what they need, though, because—make a big, bold note
somewhere—great marketing cannot overcome bad economics.

**One way a marketer arrives at these dire and desperate circumstances is bare-bones pricing**
**and buying customers with aggressive discounting. When you handicap yourself with bare-bones**
margin, you have no money for effective, aggressive advertising, marketing, and promotion to
acquire customers, for “wow-factors” customer love, or for retention after the sale. So handicapped,
the business owner’s response to every meaningful suggestion that might provide competitive
advantage, differentiation, and power in the marketplace is met with: “We can’t afford that.” Hire a
celebrity spokesperson? We can’t afford that. Advertise on the top syndicated radio programs that
are real market-makers? We can’t afford that. Pay me to craft extremely effective sales copy? We
can’t afford that. Put superior salespeople in the stores, do more on-going training and coaching,
retain a good mystery-shopping firm? We can’t afford that either.

Yes, you can drive sales with bare-bones pricing. But you cannot sustain success that way.

_Oh yeah, Kennedy, what about Walmart? First of all, Walmart’s rise to power was based on_
multiple factors including a superior, more efficient distribution system. It is perpetuating lowest
prices in certain categories now by virtue of giant-sized status, allowing the squeezing of every
ounce of blood out of suppliers, forcing overseas manufacture, and even getting manufacturers to
place their brand names on inferior products made to Walmart specs. Historically, though, the bigger
they are, the harder they fall. There have been Walmart-like bullies before, now extinct and
forgotten. But regardless of the future sustainability of Walmart, should you use them as your
model, you better be able to do everything they do. You can’t just decide to mimic them as lowestprices-every-day leader in your field without also having extraordinary efficiencies in your business,
the power of epic size, and the ability and willingness to force your vendors to sell to you at barebones prices. Be careful when you copycat that you can copycat. (Elsewhere in this book, my coauthor, Jason has more to say about Walmart and how small retailers successfully stand up to the
bully, and even prosper in its shadow. I also urge reading a dated but still relevant book, Up Against
_the Walmarts by Don Taylor and Jeanne Smalling Archer.)_

If you saddle your business with bad economics, please don’t direct the ambulance you’re in to
my M*A*S*H unit unless you’re ready for a price strategies fix, not just an advertising operation!

Just what are “bad economics”? Pricing, thus profit margin and profit in dollars ill-matched with
the way you need or want to advertise, market, promote, and sell, the clientele you want to attract,
the customer experience you need or want to deliver, and your own financial objectives. Simply put,
there has to be enough money to do what needs to be done.

The owner of the Italian restaurant in the city, who makes the decisions to hire the very best chef
he can attract at a very stiff salary, fly in fresh fish daily, import cheeses from Italy, keep the house
small so the dining experience is intimate and over-staff to provide flawless service is going to have
to make a lot more money per plate of spaghetti than Olive Garden does. If he tries matching their
prices or is even influenced by them, he’ll lack the money necessary to do what he has set out to do.
Conversely, if you’re going head to head with Olive Garden and targeting middle-income, middleclass families, you can’t layer on a top chef, made-from-scratch meals, imported cheeses. You’ll be

-----

broke in a New York minute. All that seems as obvious as a meatball, yet countless business owners
in every imaginable field err in creating economics ill-matched with their approach to their business.

## NO B.S. Price Strategy Warning #6

Great marketing, extraordinary salesmanship, even a truly extraordinary product cannot—

CANNOT—overcome bad economics.

If, for example, you are going to sell a product via direct mail or television infomercials, certain
economic realities exist. Cost of media inside cost of sale is going to be very high—perhaps 70% to
90%. You need a 300% to 500% mark-up from cost of goods. If it costs $3.00, it must sell for $9.00
to $15.00. But if your thingy costs $20.00 to make and there’s no way anybody can be persuaded to
pay more than $59.00 for it, you can’t use direct-mail or TV. Your economics will not let you.
Period. End of story. If, however, you are only going to market the product by placement in others’
catalogs and at others’ websites or via online affiliate programs, a thinner margin may be just fine.
Different media, different economics. Generally speaking, the tighter the margins, the fewer the
marketing options, the slower the growth of the business, and the more vulnerable it may be to
somebody bigger ‘n badder taking notice, and swooping in with a competitive product with better
margin, which allows him to spend more and do more to make a sale.

This book is loaded with ways to transform bad economics to good economics. In the above
example of products sold on TV, you might alter those economics with immediate telephone upsells,
padding shipping and handling or, if well-capitalized and investment minded, being willing to incur
a small loss for the customer acquisition offset by profits in subsequent sale and list rental. It’s not
where you start that matters but where you wind up, with price strategy. In direct marketing, I rarely
panic after test marketing to determine the cost of selling whatever is being sold, even if it is
appreciably higher than can be tolerated. Between the cost to make the sale and what can be spent to
make that sale may be a crevice or a canyon. Either way, as a marketing strategist, I then go to work
on bridging the gap.

As example, drawn from a real situation, but changed just enough here to protect a company’s
proprietary data, let’s assume we are selling a book about “100 ways to live to be 100” by direct
mail to well-targeted lists. Testing proves that $49.00 is the best price; anything higher, response
drops like a boulder. Anything less, response does not significantly improve. But at $49.00, it costs
$70.00 to make the sale. The gap is $21.00 + cost of the book itself + desired profit. So, $21.00 +
$4.00 + $5.00. Gap of $30.00. If we can bridge that gap, there are 100,000 names per calendar
quarter to mail to, and about 4,000 books to be sold; $20,000.00 profit to be made—plus whatever
we might do afterward with these customers. In this scenario, we can get rich, if we can bridge the
gap. As a side note, the smallest local business has this same sort of challenge anytime it is going to
reach out creatively and aggressively for new customers.

In this case, here’s how we bridge this gap:

Five “sponsors” are found who agree to have “bonus chapters” about their products inserted in
the book—each paying $1.00 per book for that stealth advertising plus the list of buyers. There’s
$5.00 of the $30.00.

The offer is changed: the book at $49.00 or the book plus a documentary DVD about longevity
and an interview with the authors for $59.00 ($10.00 added/cost $2.00/net $8.00). 20% of the
buyers chose this option. $8.00 x 20% = $1.60 of the $30.00. Now we’ve covered $6.60 of the gap.
A third option of the book plus the DVD plus a 3-month supply of an anti-aging nutritional drink
mix is added—at $99.00 ($50.00 added/cost of DVD plus drink mix $12.00/net $38.00). 10% of
buyers take this option. $38.00 x 10% = $3.80 of the $30.00. Total: $5.40 of the $30.00. So now
$12.00 of the $30.00 gap is accounted for.

A cosmetic company is brought in as a joint-venture partner; they add a DVD infomercial to the
package at its expense, selling a $300.00 “system” of age-reducing complexion care products. They

-----

pay the book publisher $100.00 per sale. 6% of the book buyers buy the skin care products. $100.00
x 6% = another $6.00 per book buyer.
