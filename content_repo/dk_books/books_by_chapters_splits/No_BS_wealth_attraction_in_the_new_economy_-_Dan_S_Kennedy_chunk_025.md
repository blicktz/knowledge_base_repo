## Ideas for Increasing Your Personal Value

#### 1. Expertise—what you know. 2. Expert Status—what you are known to know. 3. Skill—what you do. 4. Productivity—what you get done. 5. Efficiency—how you get done what you get done. 6. Effectiveness—opportunity selection; and how well you do
 what you get done. 7. Organization, Multiplication—how you get things done by
 means other than manual labor. 8. Influence—what you can get others to do. 9. Relationships—who you know. 10. Celebrity Status—how well you are known ( by your target
 audience). 11. Reputation—what others know about you. 12. Vision—what you see, that others don’t.

#### The entrepreneur dare not fall into this belief system trap, because he is devoid of false protections. He is at the full mercy of a marketplace with its own brand of harsh justice, based on real value. Wealth is a reflection of

#### actual value to the world. If you want to attract more wealth, you make yourself more valuable. Your value does not increase just because you hang around for years.
 Sorry, but age isn’t value—except with wine, some cheeses, some antiques and collectibles. Not people. I even tell young people to ignore the “respect your elders” nonsense told to them by elders. Be courteous to your elders. Courtesy is a gift you can give that usually costs nothing, and is appropriate in civilized society. People who’ve put in a lot of years, probably gone to work, paid bills, paid taxes, raised kids, been good citizens, and all that are entitled to everybody else’s courtesy. If they’re driving a little slow in your way, keep in mind that someday that will be you. I didn’t get that at age 25, by the way, but I get it now, at 54. But respect is another matter altogether. Respect is earned, not an entitlement.
 Marketplace respect, which is precursor to wealth transferred from the marketplace to any given person, must be earned by that person making himself sufficiently valuable to earn and warrant the transfer. You just can’t make wealth or any cousin of it—financial security, good wages that out- pace inflation or rise with lifestyle needs, or even first rate health care—an entitlement. Any society that’s ever tried, implodes. Further, foolish attempts to do so deliver a false and harmful message to people. Regardless of their folly, though, the truth can set you free: You can only be assured of getting whatever you want out of life, whether a certain income or security or wealth or simple respect, by earning it through proportionate creation of value. Not just getting older and being here or there longer.
 One of my Members, Judith Z. told me of one of her employees, who every year comes to her and needs a raise. Because they need it you are, of course, obligated to give it. That’s how they think. I’ve hung around for another year, so I’m entitled to more money. I need more money so I should get it. This is how they think. You can never think this way. Owning your business for ten years does not entitle you to anything more than your newest competitor of one year. What you get comes from the value you create and deliver.
 Let me illustrate how completely devoid of integrity this time-on-the-job thinking is. You own a convenience store and you sell coffee for $1.00 per cup. Every morning, the same customer comes in, gets a cup of coffee, pays his dollar. After a year, he comes in and points a gun at your head. He says “I’ve been here everyday for a year. That’s tenure. I’ve been exchanging a

#### dollar for a cup of coffee. Solely because I’ve made that value exchange for a year, I’m now going to take two cups of coffee for the same one dollar and you’re going to let me or I’ll shoot you in the head.”

#### Wealth and value and real integrity are all linked together. Anyone trying to get more wealth without providing more value is dishonest
 and unethical and immoral, and is attempting to defy the
 fundamental laws of life.

#### So the employee comes to Judith Z. every year and needs her annual raise. And every year, Judith sits down with her and says, “Fine, you’ve got a raise, as soon as you enroll in this course and you go to this seminar and you study these books and recordings. And as soon as you do, your raise is a done deal. Not after you finish. As soon as you do these three things and get started, the raise is a done deal. ”
 My question to her was, “How many years have you gone without giving her a raise?”
 Her answer is, “14.” This employee wants more money but is unwilling to do anything to deliver more value.
 You must avoid making the same unreasonable demands, the same demands devoid of integrity, of the universe. Instead, if you’d like to attract more wealth, do the opposite. Do something that increases the value you bring to your business, your work, your clients or customers. Increase your value and you will attract increased wealth.

#### Recently, we’ve had a gigantic, very unpleasant and uncomfortable economic enema, and one of the things flushed out was a big, big, big turd comprised of far too many people trying to get paid far too much for providing too little value. They got flushed out of executive suites at the top of tall buildings, flushed off factory floors, flushed out of small businesses. The New Economy will not welcome them back. A new level of harsh reality about value is, I think, going to be with us for a long time to come. What I am telling my clients is to focus their intellect, imagination, and initiative as never before on the creation of greater and greater value. This may wind up being the only pathway to wealth and by which wealth will come to you in The New Economy. Neither the mere manipulation of money or paper, the shuffling and re-shuffling of things, nor the mere showing up and being at the same place for an extended term are going to be well-tolerated or rewarded. In a very real way, the space has shrunk, there’s less room at the inn, and those who bring little may not get in.

 Think Equity, Not Income

#### T his is big.
 Most entrepreneurs wake up every morning thinking about how they can make more sales, get more customers, increase their incomes. These thoughts are ricocheting around their heads even as they stumble toward the bathroom or coffeemaker. And most entrepreneurs devote enormous thought, time, energy to these same issues all day long, all month long, all year long. At the end of each day, they try to assess how their day turned out in terms of income. But very few entrepreneurs give the same thought, time and energy to increasing “value” and “equity.”
 Income is temporary and perishable. Value and equity can be built to last. Right now, your daily thoughts, your daily measurements are probably weighted 80%, 90%, even 100% to increasing income, only 20%, 10%, or 0% to increasing value and equity. The right balance is 50%/50%.
 How can you possibly manage and measure increases in equity daily, like you can income? Actually, there are a number of ways. One of the best is

-----

#### what I call Future Banking.
 Most business owners are focused on Present Banking. If you ask a restaurant operator how his day was, he might cite number of meals served, number of customers who came in, or sales. But he will not talk about any measured equity increase. That’s what I call Future Banking, and he will not have given it a thought.
 I teach Future Banking in a lot of depth in my Wealth Attraction System and Renegade Millionaire System*. Here, a simplified summary. First, income is income and does not necessarily convert to wealth. In fact, income is usually spent. Income increases do not necessarily translate to wealth either. Wealth is wealth. It comes from “value” and “equity.” Second, there is Present Banking and Future Banking. The really astute entrepreneur works on both simultaneously, not sequentially. He thinks about “value,” not just “income.”

#### We’ll use our restaurant owner again as example. My client, Dean Killingbeck of Get Customers Now, has developed a phenomenally successful direct-mail marketing campaign used by thousands of restaurants, using the birthdays of every customer, and even creating lists in any geographic area of people having birthdays month by month. They are mailed actual birthday cards that contain special offers good the week of

-----

#### their birthday or weeks surrounding it. This works because nobody celebrates a birthday alone, and the number-one way birthdays are celebrated is going out to a restaurant. Each birthday brings 2 to 8 people in the door. This is very reliable. Name the type of restaurant and he can tell you what each birthday on file is worth in dollars, year after year. So let’s say a birthday captured is worth $100.00 a year to Restaurant Owner Bob. Now at the end of the night, Bob has a deposit for his Present Bank Account and another deposit for his Future Bank Account. For his Present Bank Account, the night’s revenues of $20.00 times 200 diners, $4,000.00 less costs, $2,000.00. But his wait staff also got names, e-mail addresses, addresses, and birthdays from 37 first time customers. Bob deposits $3,700.00 in his Future Bank Account.
 It is this “operating principle” that built up the wealth in my business over a 15-year period. For example, every time I got on an airplane and schlepped somewhere to speak, I made $10,000.00 or $20,000.00 or $30,000.00 to as much as $50,000.00 from the fee plus the books and courses sold, less my costs of goods, travel, overhead, to deposit in my Present Bank Account. But in my business, each newly acquired customer was known to be worth thousands of dollars in Future Bank value. So every day, my Future Bank deposit was much, much larger than my Present Bank deposit. So it stacked up year after year, pushing more and more additional income forward. As it peaked, I was able to extract millions from my businesses and also sell my businesses.
 To the degree that the Future Bank value of whatever you do today matches or exceeds the Present Bank value, you set in motion wealth creation forces that will soon deliver a massive harvest. Further, when you see your Future Bank balance building exponentially, your sense of being wealthy grows, and that sense or (mental) state of being wealthy attracts more wealth. A big, accurately, and legitimately calculated Future Bank balance has all the same positive effects as does or would an equally large Present Bank balance. You think differently, feel differently, speak differently, act differently, and are perceived more favorably by others when you are wealthy, secure, and independent than when you are not. Your Future Bank balance can give this to you faster.
 From a psychological standpoint, it’s extremely beneficial to have a Future Bank System working for you in your business. From a practical standpoint, in The New Economy, it is more essential than ever, because the

#### costs of creating present income have risen and are rising, and the tax bite taken out of higher earners’ present incomes is more substantial and likely to worsen in response to the massive deficits and expansion of government in general and entitlement programs specifically occurring under the Obama administration. All this makes each dollar of Present Income worth less, and makes it much more difficult to build wealth by moving dollars from present, day-to-day income to savings and investments. You need financial leverage, not just income, and leverage is most likely to be found in Future Banking, not Present Banking.

 Marketing Prowess

#### H ere is THE secret of secrets about the entrepreneurs who create and attract great wealth with relative ease, and are sought after by other wealthy entrepreneurs, executives, and investors who are eager to do business with them.
 These super-entrepreneurs may not be able to find their car keys, keep their offices free of overwhelming clutter, read a balance sheet, or turn on a computer. What they don’t know would shock most people. Their personality flaws and personal dysfunctions could keep teams of psychotherapists gainfully employed. But one thing is true of virtually every single one of them:
 They are unabashed, unashamed, irrepressible promoters, salespeople who know how to sell and do so day in and day out, and understand and usually keep their hands on their firms’ marketing. They are, first and foremost, marketers.

-----

#### Frankly, if you have emotional hang-ups about sales and marketing,
 don’t “like” it, are convinced you aren’t good at it, and refuse to
 hunker down and get good at it, I just don’t have much hope for
 you when it comes to wealth attraction.

#### Some entrepreneurs good at other things try delegating all the marketing. I’ve yet to see that go well. I see them delegate just about everything else with liveable results. But not the marketing. And really, why should you be able to delegate the moneygetting and still wind up getting the money?
 I’ll tell you an instructive story. For about a year, I had a major corporation, owned by a big global conglomerate, as a client. You’d know the names. The CEO was a pleasant fellow good at holding meetings, counting the beans, managing. But he was totally clueless about how to get customers. The company’s several hundred franchisees wanted to lynch him. His ad agency was scamming him. I was busily straightening his mess out, replacing embarrassingly inane and ineffective advertising with something persuasive and powerful. One day, he sat down with me in his office, door firmly closed, and told me he’d run some numbers and was distressed to discover I was being paid a big multiple of what he was being paid, on an hourly basis—“and, after all,” he said, “I am the CEO here.”
 I said, “That’s OK. There’s a very good reason why you’re paying me so much more per hour than you can pay yourself. You know how to do everything here far better than I do, maybe better than anybody else, except for one little thing. I know how to get customers for you. You don’t. But without what I know everything you know is worthless. But, don’t let this worry you. We’ll keep this our little secret.”

-----

#### Here’s the undeniable fact about my wealth: People have been attracted to me, line up and literally wait and beg and compete for my attention, and stay glued to me if they can for one reason and one reason only. It’s not my warm ‘n’ fuzzy personality. It’s because I know how to get customers for them. I see opportunities in their businesses they are blind to. So they tolerate my quirks and unusual demands and business practices. They pay very high fees, and stay even when I raise fees with impunity. If you know marketing, you are in the ultimate power position.
 Arnold Schwarzenegger got a part he wanted, at the strident objections of the director, because the studio heads knew no other star who knew how to promote a movie like Arnold. They told the director, if it’s you or him, it’s you. That’s how it works in the real world. The least dispensable person with the most power is the person who can bring in money. The Apprentice became an astounding TV success and, behind the scenes, an enormous financial success for NBC, Mark Burnett, and Trump not just because it was a great show—it was—but more because Donald Trump is an incredible, relentless promoter. I recently had a client, who must remain nameless, sell his company for an outrageous 15-times multiple of earnings because the bigger competitor was simply worn out and frustrated with competing with his superior marketing. They paid just to make him stop.

 Behavioral Congruency

#### B ehavioral Congruency is the core idea behind my entire Renegade Millionaire System.
 It is a deceptively simple idea, contrary to the overwhelming majority of all self-improvement and success literature. It doesn’t negate anything in any of the thousands of other how-to-succeed or how-to-get-rich books, courses, or seminars, but I do say it is more important than anything in those books.
 Most approaches to becoming more successful or prosperous focus on attitudes and thoughts. But, as a result of 30 years’ work with hundreds of first generation, from-scratch millionaire and multi-millionaire entrepreneurs, and my current work with so many million-dollar-a-year earners and wealthy entrepreneurs I came to one major conclusion:

 It’s less about how they think than about what they do .
