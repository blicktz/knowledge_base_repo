The fact is, the overwhelming majority of consumers continue to buy most of what they buy and
patronize most of the businesses they patronize despite price or cheaper prices offered elsewhere,
with their choices based on criteria other than price, regardless of ups or downs in the economy. As
example, a recent survey by the IBM Institute for Business Value found that in this recent recession,
72% of shoppers at grocery stores said that the quality of the products was more important than
price; 68% said nutrition was their most important consideration. Of course, such claims are
suspect, as people would think these are the “right answers.” But the reality is close: consumer
behavior tracked by the grocery industry indicated only about 50% of shoppers have been buying
smaller amounts at a time and shopping at more than one store, to find the lowest prices (up from
about 35% in 2006–2007), and 35% have been buying lesser brands or generics in some categories
(up by about 7% from’06–’07 levels). However, more than 50% of shoppers armed with coupons let
some coupons go unused and bought other, better brands. Get that. They clip coupons, they come
with those coupons, yet they buy a different brand and let the coupon go unused. Number one
reason given in survey for choosing a higher priced product: “it’s better for my family.”The
percentage that are still willing to pay more for name brands vs. generics and/or more convenient
packaging is 81%. Most significant, from a “marketing to the affluent” standpoint: premium brands
and premium-priced specialty foods’ sales remained steady during the recession. All this, mostly
with commodities, with no salesperson involved. My take on all that data and information is that
some consumers always buy cheapest price; some trade down under pressure, usually absent
effective persuasion; but many “stay strong” buying by criteria other than price, and by preference
or “mission” (e.g., providing best meals for my family). _(Sources: Grocery Shopping Survey by_

**Even under adverse economic pressure, the majority of buyers respond to motivating**
**factors others than price. They will even abandon their predetermined intent to buy at the**
**cheapest price if given other persuasive criteria for their purchasing decision.**

There is even a step up to better quality—and higher per item/ per experience prices - that occurs
in recessions. Smart marketers can capitalize on upscale consumers’ tendency in recession to cut
back on the quantity/frequency of purchases while searching for best quality when they do purchase.
For example, in ’09, New Yorkers dined out 3 times a week vs. 3.3 times in ’08, but their average
dinner tab went UP 2.5% from ’08, to $42.00 per person _(Source: Zagat). New York City is,_
incidentally, the second most expensive city to patronize restaurants in, behind London in the
United Kingdom. And there was that pesky Wall Street crash, wiping out Bear Stearns, shrinking
Goldman, emptying office suites. Net result: customers dialed back frequency a bit, but then went to
slightly better (more expensive) places or splurged on extras to give themselves better experiences
as exchange for their “sacrifices.” Nationwide, mid-range chains wound up with disappointing
results from price-cutting and advertising deeply discounted, 2 for 1, and low-price “bundle” (2
entrees, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert to share for just $15.00) offers. Many reported no increase or even
losses in numbers of customers, but drops in per person spending, and bigger drops in profits. These
customers still cut back on frequency but, since it was pushed on them, also took advantage of the
low-price offers, and spent less per outing.

**The path to prosperity in generally unprosperous times is rarely price cutting. No more**
**sane than reacting to bleeding profusely from an attacker’s knife wound by stabbing yourself**
**in another place on your body.**

To the befuddlement of most, there are also, always, businesses that score sales and profit
increases in purportedly bad economic times, and do so without compromising their prices. Familyowned Skinner Baking Co. in Omaha saw sales rise 18% from ’07 to ’08. In December, 2008, a big
25% jump. Its ovens had to run 6 days a week vs. 5 before and they were hiring (!) to keep up with
demand. They supply coffeecakes, cinnamon buns, etc. to supermarkets. They’ve been in biz since
1911, so their V.P. thinks he understands why their sales went up: “This is comfort food.” The owner
of Bathroom Magic in Fairfax, Virgina, reported ’08 revenues up 75% vs. ’07, and ’08 being the
best year he’s ever had. Why? People who, in boom times, would bring in contractors to completely
re-model their bathrooms, in these times chose a service they would otherwise sneer at: the one-day
bath makeover, with refinishing glaze and fit-over components to re-finish a tub like new for just
$425.00. The economy let him attract mass-affluent and even affluent customers. “When the
economy goes down, my business skyrockets,” he says. Interstate Batteries opened 43 new stores in
’08—hiring to staff them, on top of the existing 125, and expanded the variety of batteries carried,
although they’re known for car batteries. “October and December, 2008 were the best months in the
company’s history,” reported the president of this 56-year old company. Why? “With the recession,
whether it’s cars or laptops, people are keeping what they own and trying to extend the life of their
products.” (Source: USA TODAY 2/2/09)

OK, go ahead and get it out: your business is different. Your business isn’t designed to get a boost
from the recession. Duh! You can fix that. Any restaurant can create comfort food menus, comfort
food nights. And since more people are staying home to eat, expand pre-prepared meal offerings—
didja notice Pizza Hut’s started advertising gigundo trays of lasagna? _Any remodeler, contractor,_
furniture seller could reach up to more affluent customers than he normally attracts with value
packages. _Any retailer can alter or expand his product line to support a message right for these_
times. The question is not: how can I excuse myself from business modification so I keep my
excuses for suffering? Not: how can I survive the recession? The question is: how can I be nimble,
agile, creative, modify my business, alter my marketing to get a boost from recession?

The best recession or tough times price strategy is creative and complex—not a red pen to mark
down prices.

As I am writing this book, the recession begun under Bush and dramatically worsened by
Obama’s wasteful spending spree, debt multiplication, and a massive assault on the private sector
that has grown quite stubborn. Movement from it to a New Economy, as happens out the back door
of every recession, is slow. You may now, still, be doing battle with business capital on strike and
consumer hoarding of cash, with high unemployment, right along with one of the certain main
ingredients of the evolving New Economy: more thoughtful, prudent, and knowingly empowered
consumers. And/or the inevitable wave of sky-high inflation that must follow the dizzying debt
accumulation of 2009 and 2010 may have arrived. (If not, it will.) When I write my monthly
newsletters[1], weekly memos[1], and blogs,[1] I can be timely. The nature of book publishing requires 6
to 8 months lead time, sometimes more, so being precisely matched to present conditions on the
ground or accurately forecasting is tricky. But what I can state with certainty is, whatever the
specifics of the economy swirling around you, short of a repeat of 1929 and the ’30s, your best price

strategy will be in concert with smart marketing strategy, and it will not be accomplished simply
with a bloody axe. Bring a full toolbox.

One thing that must be in that toolbox is superior sales process, people, and salesmanship. Price is
supported by skillful selling; undermined by the absence of salesmanship. And absent it has largely
been!

In 2009, on my major Christmas shopping day, I went to the large, upscale mall. I first bought
myself a new suit at Nordstroms and had it tailored immediately, while I shopped, so I was there
twice, once to buy, the other to pick it up. The pleasant, professional salesman made only a halfhearted reference to overcoats on sale, but no attempt to offer a second suit at a discount or show me
sports jackets, trousers, anything else. I paid $950.00 for the suit. I guess that was all he wanted.
Downstairs, I got my boots shined, sitting facing the men’s shoe department, wearing obviously
expensive boots. Two salesmen stood idly by; neither came over, introduced himself, complimented
me on my boots, offered a business card, wondered aloud if I might have interest in any new
footwear. I wonder if the musings they were so occupied by had to do with how bad business was—
_or perhaps they had made all the money they wanted for the year._

At the Brighton store, I bought a women’s bag and two gift certificates, one for $200.00, the other
for $100.00. When asked if they were for different people, I said “Of course—one for my wife, one
for my mistress. Care to guess which is for which?” I did it to bedevil the rather annoying woman
customer next to me hogging all the counter space, which I succeeded at. But from the two
“salespeople” required to ring my sale—including having to look the bag up in their catalog because
the register wouldn’t accept the code on the tag—no attempt at selling me anything else … even
though the catalog page had two other items that matched the bag I was buying. Maybe they were
_idle rich ladies, just working in the store for fun._

At Saks, at the Chanel counter, I had only the name of the skin care line, no particular products in
mind. After determining I did not know exactly what I wanted, with a small sigh and a muttered “of
course, you wouldn’t know that,” she did no selling of products; asked me the amount I wanted to
spend; built and boxed a package. About $400.00. It so happens I know more about cosmetics and
skin care than you’d guess, so I happen to know there were three little jars displayed there, _each_
priced above $500.00, but she made no attempt to sell them. She accepted the $400.00 number I
gave her; she gave me no information or incentive to up my number, and damn if I was going to do
her work for her. After all, she must be quite content with her income as-is, so why should I trouble
_her with more?_

At the nearly empty American Greetings store, on entry I walked past three clerks yakking with
each other; on exit, 10 minutes later passed the same yakking clerks. At the Papyrus store, a clerk
actually made attempts at being helpful and at upselling. Meager and ineffectual attempts but
attempts nonetheless. At the Godiva store, I naturally picked the big basket with Christmas
assortment of goodies they only had one of; waited while a sadly dimwitted clerk was sent to the
storage room to find a second only to return to say they had none. I wanted two, they were $175.00
each. Rather than offering to assemble the second one from its individual items all there in the store,
my “salesperson” down-sold me to two $100.00 packages and when I grumbled that they weren’t as
Christmasy in appearance (brown instead of red ribbon, etc.), she just shrugged. I also bought seven
small packages of imported truffles; no attempt to upsell me to the larger collections. I got a $40.00
gift card as “bonus,” thrown into my bag with bare comment.

At the independent bookstore, usually pretty well-run, I stacked up and ultimately bought
$400.00 worth of books plus $100.00 in gift cards. The fellow had trouble loading the gift cards,
which he clearly found irritating, and made no comment about any of the books being purchased—
like: “if you like this author, you’d really like so-and-so” … or: “is this collection of great Cleveland
Browns games DVD’s a gift? We have autographed books by Browns players in the sports section.”
His only comment was: “You’re sure buying a lot of books.” At their in-store coffee shop, I stood
for over 5 minutes at the “Please Wait To Be Seated” sign while the person who was supposed to
seat me stood at the back talking with another employee, so I seated myself, then went over and
started getting myself a cup of coffee, which did get her attention—but I wasn’t offered a fresh
baked scone. Much later, at Starbucks, buying gift cards, their gift packages of coffees were not
mentioned. Incidentally, the _New York Times that day ran an article about all the New York_
publishing companies laying off staff—even _editors, oh horror of horrors; delaying new book_
releases, freezing acquisitions; the CEO of Barnes & Noble saying this is “the worst retail
environment he’s ever seen”—I would say, more accurately, it’s the pee-poorest selling I’ve ever
seen. Environment schmironment. Finally, on the way home, I stopped by a local restaurant to get a

take-out order, sat at the bar, listened to the owner tell me about how their group party business was
off and, generally, dinner business soft. I wasn’t offered a special on gift certificates. I say: nuts to
‘em all. But: **is this going on in YOUR business? Worse, are YOU personally guilty—of not**
selling?

## Theories About the Death of Salesmanship

This paucity of salesmanship hasn’t repaired itself since that outing. Pretty much everywhere I go, I
note the absence of good sales process, and lack of initiative and effort from staff to sell. This
reflects not just on salespeople and other employees, but on managers and owners as well. I have
five theories about the reasons for this strange phenomenon of non-selling:

1. _Assumption that nobody’s buying, so why waste energy selling? (Hibernation without_
even retreating to the cave.)
2. _Absence of know-how, skill, or even idea that they’re supposed to be selling—since_
people have been so freely spending and buying for so long on their own, despite pitifully
poor salesmanship. (Ignorance.)
3. Sloth.
4. Resentment of having to work.
5. _With staff: little, inconsistent, ineffectual training and/or supervision/enforcement; not_
enough fast firing of losers; insufficient incentive and reward for winners.

All these not only retard sales volume, they drive price reductions. The corporate or managerial
response to a sales slump is almost always to cut prices, increase discounts, create deeply
discounted “value specials.” In 2009, Burger King franchise owners had to threaten to sue their
parent company, to put a stop to its forcing bare-bones priced “value sandwiches” on them, on
which they actually lost money, their profit then found only in side items and drinks. Please, don’t
be that dumb and feckless.

Instead, take a look at the five evils named above, and work on them—with yourself and with
your staff. And please, quickly fire anybody who clings to any of these and replace them with the
next batter up, repeatedly as needed, until you get somebody who really wants to play the game to
win.

 Sample Advertising and Marketing Materials

From Jason and Isa Marrs’ Practice

and the Price Strategy and Price Strategy Support Lessons

They Illustrate

**1. “… That Few Parents or Therapists Know About.” Jason calls this their “Theory of the Mind”**
ad. This is a very effective ad that tends to attract a very serious, thoughtful parent, i.e. one for
whom price of services or access to free services will be less important than a unique, superior
approach to treatment. The ad lays the groundwork for differentiation between their practice and all
other therapists. This translates to any business. The key ideas are (a) differentiation from
competition, and (b) deliberately attracting potential customers for whom price will not be the
driving factor of their buying decision. It also will repel less-qualified prospects, who may not be
willing to take the time to read this much copy or are immediately looking for price information.

**2. Right Decision Guarantee. This is use of a technique called ‘risk elimination’ or ‘risk reversal’**
that is often especially important when selling at premium prices or fees AND selling something for
which efficacy or satisfaction cannot be immediately determined. The risk imbedded in purchase
goes up with price, so guarantees that provide adequate time to judge the outcome or satisfaction are
needed to bring that risk down to match or trump the lower risk imbedded in a much lower price. In
other words, if I pay $50.00 for something vs. $500.00, my risk is 1/10th as much at $50.00 and
10X as much at $500.00. To take the risk disadvantage out of the 10X price, I need a guarantee that
is effectively 10X better. (This copy taken from their website.)

**3. Good-Better-Best Offers Order Form. This Form shows how Jason has used tiered pricing and**
assembled three different packages or bundles of services. As we’ve said throughout this book, there
is a customer for every price. Good-Better-Best options allow different customers to do their price
shopping within the walls of your offerings, and make their decision in the context of “which is
right for me?” (or: which can I afford?) rather than a simple yes/no. This is a powerful Price
Strategy in and of itself, but it is plus-ed here by also presenting ala carte pricing, which is
substantially higher than the same services bundled. This provides price comparison within the
walls. It also gives the buyer a feeling of having gotten a bargain by choosing one of the bundles. It
should be noted that this is not just handed out with a brochure; it is given to the parent only after a
diagnostic process and recommendations are made.
