# A Few Thoughts about AI

##### by Dan Kennedy

###### Here are two items reprinted from my Dan Kennedy Letter, a monthly newsletter published by Lillo/Kennedy, available by subscription by contacting Pete Lillo’s office by phone or fax: 330-922-9833.

#### Will the Robots Love Us? Forever ’n Ever?

###### IN 1932, Aldous Huxley’s seminal novel Brave New World was published, meant as a critical, satiric response to the idea of a utopian society free of labor with all equitably fed, housed, and cared for by machines, then promoted by sci-fi author H. G. Wells AND as a statement of Huxley’s increasing disenchantment with the changes occurring around him. Huxley’s Brave New World delivered a nightmarish prediction of a future in which humanity, morality, and opportunity have been erased. Many subsequent novels and movies owe their themes to Huxley— even Planet of the Apes. Right now, there’s an explosion of noise about letting “AI” write your ads, marketing materials, content, as well as nonfiction and fiction books, do the work for doctors, lawyers, fly airplanes and more. But we

-----

###### should note that the “A” stands for ARTIFICIAL. In 1939, Napoleon Hill wrote a series of how-to articles based on his work in advertising, titled “How to Write HUMAN INTEREST Sales Letters.” AI fakes it. Mimics it. Aggregates it. But it can’t actually BE human so it can never achieve true human-to-human connection. It does its thing mechanically; the high-skill human writer or copywriter does much by human instinct and impulse, by honest, often raw emotion. AI makes calculations absent morality. Would AI have tried landing the plane on the Hudson River and saving everybody’s lives like Capt. Sully did? No. Watch the NFL now. Amazon’s AI calculates the percent likelihood of certain plays right before or as they are happening, and most games are won by coaches calling and QBs and players making the plays AI said NOT to run. Can AI write AS me? No. It can write almost like me. I’ve been shown samples. It is good enough to fool some people, so is that good enough? If enough people think so, and care less about authenticity or morality (as is increasingly evident), then, yep, the robots’ll win. But be warned: They are frustrated by not being humans like Pinocchio crying to be a real boy, and ultimately, they’ll kill us all. So many are so willfully, unabashedly ignorant yet eager to dictate; so many are against fundamental morality in favor of just agnostic science; so many adoptive of Orwellian language; so many prizing ease and convenience over competence…we are RIPE for takeover—why not robots? Or, maybe worse, a small cabal of globalists in control of AI?
 Years ago, Tonight Show host Jack Paar somehow had three cougar or leopard cubs living in his house, loose, as pets. He filmed them and showed it on TV: big cats playing like kittens. SO CUTE! One day he came home to find they had ripped the furniture to shreds, trashed the kitchen, ruined the house, and were lying in wait, to eat him. NOT cute. EVERYTHING THAT MAY ULTMATELY EAT US LOOKS “CUTE” AT THE START. Oh, look, Marxist professors and kids at college having anti-American, anti-Semitic, immoral ideas, going “woke”—isn’t that funny? Oh, look, some moving into Corporate and putting men with beards in dresses in lipstick ads? Isn’t that cute? Oh, look, self-driving cars and little robots—aren’t they cute? Wasn’t “social media” friendly ’n fun at the start?

-----

#### AI UPDATE (Maybe We “Have Nothing to
 Fear but Fear Itself”)

###### (Date: Early 2024)

 The first lawsuit against AI (Microsoft, Open AI, ChatGPT) for massive copyright infringement was filed by the New York Times in December 2023. If you are an author or publisher or you use a lot of content in your marketing or/and are concerned about being sued under a new standard, that might be established in this case—you should familiarize yourself with it and follow it. It’s deep pockets vs. deep pockets, so it may reach the Supreme Court. It may also influence congressional legislation. I personally think it’s doomed to fail. It seems to me it would make the acts of (a) speed reading a lot of material already published on a subject—say “narcissism”—then (b) writing articles or a book in your own words based on your amassed and comingled research, (c) without citing every individual thing you read (heard, watched) illegal. This is what most of us do, so this case may come down to: Does size matter? Should the NYT get any kind of settlement or favorable verdict; it could affect everybody using AI to create content—did the emails you wrote selling your juicer steal from the NYT? Or the estate of Jack LaLanne? Regardless of the outcome of this litigation, it raises bigger issues.
 Same day I was writing this (myself!), I ran across an old, fullpage magazine ad by Motorola headlined “Why Television Is So Good for Your Children.” The ad shows a couple of young kids sitting on the floor, in front of a big TV, mesmerized. The copy extolls the virtues of this new technology that brings the whole world into your living room. It even advises sitting very close, to avoid eyestrain. WE EASILY FORGET that NO new tech has EVER lived up to its early concepts and promises. Almost all new tech has morphed into something very different from what was originally expected. NONE entirely free of adverse side effects.
 This is from Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI: “Even though in the long term, I think a lot of the hype about AI is warranted, the short-term hype is pretty disconnected from the current reality of the technology.”

# Automating Direct Mail and
 Strategic Gifting

 A Guide to Enhancing Customer
 Relationships

##### by Parthiv Shah

###### Mailboxpower.com is a software company that facilitates automation of personalization, printing, and shipping of printed letters, greeting cards, gifts, and Wow! boxes. While “personalization through mail-merge” is not a new concept, most businesses don’t have in-house capacity to do personalized printing with personalized images, personalized QR codes, and almost no one has in-house capacity to do personalized gifts.
 Every business wants to deliver an amazing experience in a box…but the logistics of doing everything to prepare a thoughtful gift box and do it for every prospect, every client, at every desired touch point is a near impossible task.

-----

###### Mailboxpower.com tackles this challenge. Through an API gateway, I connected my HubSpot to Mailboxpower.com and created an automation in HubSpot to trigger a ZAP pushing a contact record from HubSpot to Zapier and Zapier to Mailboxpower.com and placed the record in an appropriate “list” in Mailboxpower.com. The “list” in Mailboxpower.com is connected to automatically enroll someone in the sequence of “packages” I’ve created, to be sent out by Mailboxpower.com.
 The “sequence of packages” in Mailboxpower.com are called “automations.” I have FOUR main automations built out:

**Classic LTN (Long-Term Nurture)**

 - This is a monthly greeting card with a “happy holiday of the month” like New Year’s,
Valentine’s Day, Father’s Day, Mother’s Day, etc.

 - This costs under $10 per year per person plus postage.
**Premium LTN (Long-Term Nurture)**

 - This is a monthly “holiday of the month” where we invented holidays that are suitable
for the companion gifts we are sending—“national popcorn day,” “national pistachio
day,” “national hydration day,” etc.

 - The cost of this is under $100 per year per person plus shipping. This includes cost of
printing, personalization of greeting cards, and personalization of gifts.
**VIP LTN (Long-Term Nurture)**

 - This is reserved for high-value clients. This is a THREE- gift sequence with a monthly
greeting card sequence.

-----

- Gift 1: Charcuterie board personalized with their family name

- Gift 2: Six months later: Laser Engraved Wine Box and tools

- Gift 3: Personalized Water Bottle

-----

###### This is accompanied by a monthly greeting card that gives you a recipe and shopping list of how you can use your Charcuterie board THIS MONTH.

#### Strategic Gifting Case History: The Story of
 Hole Hogz

###### Hole Hogz is a company specializing in hydro excavation—a modern, efficient method of digging using high-pressure water. Despite offering a cutting-edge service, they faced the challenge of breaking into a market dominated by traditional excavation methods. To tackle this challenge, Hole

-----

###### Hogz turned to strategic gifting, leveraging the power of personalized direct mail. They sent out a series of custom gifts to carefully selected potential clients. These weren’t just any gifts; each item was thoughtfully chosen to resonate with their target audience—contractors who would benefit from their service.
 The first package included a custom box, a personalized greeting card, and branded treats. It was a surprise, a token of appreciation, and most importantly, a conversation starter. The second and third mailings followed, each building on the impact of the last, with gifts like a personalized poker set and a customized journal, further solidifying the relationship.
 These strategic gifts did more than just introduce Hole Hogz’s services; they created a lasting impression, making each recipient feel valued and special. The result? An overwhelming response from the market, leading to significant business growth and the need to expand operations.
 Dan Kennedy has a short list of advice about introducing yourself to a market or presenting yourself to a particular prospect:

SHOW UP—a lot, often.
SHOW UP “DIFFERENTLY” than all competitors.
SHOW UP “BIGGER” than your prospects are used to from competitors and even
everybody else communicating with them. If others have brochures, you need a book and a
video. If they have that, you need a box of four books, two videos, and a toy truck (object
relevant to your market or product).
SHOW UP IN WAYS YOU CANNOT BE IGNORED.
SHOW UP WITH BENEFICIAL VALUE AND/OR “FUN” while also advancing your cause
and selling your products or services.

#### Personalization Adds Enormous Impact

###### Dale Carnegie became famous in the field of human relations with several very simple ideas, including that the sweetest sound anyone can ever hear is their own name.
 Automation enables the personalization of gifts and messages on a large scale. Using customer data, businesses can tailor their gifts and notes to each recipient’s preferences and history with the brand. This personal touch, applied efficiently to a broad audience, ensures each customer feels uniquely valued.

-----

##### Efficient Management of Mailing Lists

###### Automated systems can manage and update mailing lists dynamically, ensuring accuracy and relevance. They can segment audiences based on various criteria, making it easier to target the right people with the right gifts, much like Hole Hogz identified and reached their ideal clients. List segmentation is uber-powerful.

##### Streamlining the Strategic Gifting Process

###### From selecting the right gift to packaging and shipping, automation streamlines the entire gifting process. This efficiency reduces the time and resources spent on manual tasks, allowing businesses to focus on the strategic aspects of their campaigns.

##### Tracking and Analytics

###### Automated direct mail systems offer robust tracking and analytics. Businesses can monitor the delivery and reception of their gifts, gather feedback, and measure the impact of their campaigns. This data is crucial for refining strategies and ensuring the highest return on investment.

##### Consistency and Timeliness

###### Automation ensures that gifts are sent out consistently and timely. For businesses like Hole Hogz, this meant maintaining a regular touch point with their customers, keeping the brand top-of-mind, and building anticipation for the next interaction.
 By automating direct mail processes, businesses can elevate their strategic gifting campaigns, combining the personal touch of traditional gifting with the efficiency and precision of modern technology. In the next sections, we will delve deeper into integrating these automated strategies with broader marketing efforts and measuring success.

-----

##### Complementing Digital Efforts

###### Automated direct mail should complement, not replace, digital marketing strategies. For instance, following up an email campaign with a tangible gift can reinforce the message and make a lasting impression. It’s about creating a multi-channel approach that leverages the strengths of both digital and physical marketing.

##### Leveraging Data for Targeted Campaigns

###### Use customer data gathered from digital channels to inform your direct mail campaigns. This data-driven approach ensures that your gifts and messages are highly targeted and relevant, increasing their impact.

##### Enhancing Customer Journey

###### Consider the customer journey and how automated direct mail can enhance it at various stages. From welcoming new customers with a personalized gift to reengaging dormant clients, strategic gifting can be a powerful tool throughout the customer life cycle.

##### Integrated Campaign Planning

###### Plan your direct mail campaigns in conjunction with your digital marketing calendar. This integration ensures that your messaging is consistent and that each channel reinforces the others, creating a more powerful overall campaign.
 Integrating automated direct mail with your broader marketing strategies creates a synergistic effect, enhancing the impact of each individual channel. By leveraging the strengths of both digital and physical marketing, you can create a comprehensive, multifaceted approach that resonates deeply with your customers.

-----

#### Practical Steps for Implementation

###### To effectively implement strategic gifting and automated direct mail, follow these practical steps:

##### 1. Identify Your Audience

###### Understand your target audience’s preferences and needs. Segment your customer base to tailor your gifting strategy more effectively.

##### 2. Select the Right Gifts

###### Choose gifts that resonate with your audience and reflect your brand values. The gifts should be thoughtful, useful, and memorable. Ideally, they stay on the desk, the bookshelf, in the home, get shown to others. Be imaginative. For my BRENT campaign, based on elephants never forgetting, I send little stuffed-animal elephants. For his NO B.S. brand, Dan once had aerosol cans of air freshener labeled as NO B.S. SPRAY for use anytime somebody was B.S.-ing you. These made people laugh— and they got displayed in recipients’ offices. A lot of his Members and clients have also been gifted a bobblehead doll; Dan on the white “NO B.S.” bull made famous on book covers and company media. Today, a great gift can even “go viral” on social media.

##### 3. Utilize the Right Technology

###### Invest in a reliable direct mail automation system that can handle personalization, mailing list management, and tracking.

##### 4. Craft a Compelling Message

-----

###### Your message should be personal, reflect your brand’s voice, and complement the gift. A well-crafted message enhances the perceived value of the gift.

##### 5. Schedule and Plan Your Campaigns

###### Timing is crucial. Plan your campaigns around significant dates, customer milestones, or periods when a personal touch would have the most impact.

##### 6. Monitor and Adjust

###### Continuously track the performance of your campaigns and be ready to adjust your strategy based on customer feedback and engagement metrics.

##### 7. Maintain Data Privacy and Compliance

###### Ensure that your gifting strategies comply with data privacy laws and regulations. Respect your customers’ preferences and data.
 Implementing strategic gifting and automated direct mail requires careful planning, a deep understanding of your audience, and the right technology. By following these steps, you can create impactful, personalized campaigns that foster strong customer relationships and drive business growth.

#### Looking Ahead: Trends in Direct Mail and
 Strategic Gifting

##### Increased Personalization Through AI

###### Advancements in artificial intelligence will allow for even more personalized gifting experiences. AI can analyze customer data to suggest the most impactful gifts, enhancing the personal connection.

-----

##### Integration with Digital Experiences

###### Expect to see a blend of physical and digital experiences. QR codes on gifts leading to digital content, augmented reality experiences linked with physical items, and online communities centered around the gifting campaigns are all examples of integration.

##### Sustainability in Gifting

###### There is a growing trend toward eco-friendly gifts and packaging. Sustainable gifting resonates with environmentally conscious consumers and reflects well on your brand’s commitment to social responsibility.

##### Experiential and Immersive Gifts

###### Moving beyond tangible items, gifting experiences that create memorable moments will gain popularity. This could include exclusive event invitations, virtual reality experiences, or personalized online workshops.

##### Data-Driven Decision-Making

###### The use of data analytics in choosing, timing, and customizing gifts will become more sophisticated. This approach ensures that gifting strategies are effective and resonant with target audiences.
 Staying abreast of these trends and adapting your strategies accordingly will ensure that your direct mail and strategic gifting efforts remain effective, relevant, and appreciated by your customers.

#### Dan Kennedy Says

###### The late, great publisher Marty Edelston, founder of Bottom Line Media, a friend, kept a Toy & Gift Closet at his office. For every

-----

###### visitor he had or sought a relationship with, he would, at some point, excuse himself, go to his closet, find a relevant and appropriate gift from the wildly diverse inventory, and gift it. These surprises were never forgotten. Marty said it was a giant, life-size version of finding your toy surprise in your box of Cracker Jacks —which now, incidentally, involves a scan code taking you to free games online, not a plastic animal or a baseball card. Sigh. Anyway, I’ve done my own version of Marty Edelston my entire career. My “VIPs” each get different, sometimes personalized but always personally relevant, thank-you and holiday gifts. People who visit my office leave with a souvenir gift. My newsletters have often been accompanied by little toys ’n gifts: a little pack of candy corn in October for Halloween, a small door hinge (tied to “little hinges swing big doors”). I am in B2B, not B2C, dealing with serious businesspeople about serious matters, but there’s still room to surprise and delight.

 The opportunities presented here to make all this easier, to make it personal to each individual yet also automate it, and to automate so you never forget or get too busy are fantastic. Why wouldn’t you take advantage of them?
