Federal Express invented, built, and dominated an industry because of a commitment to on-time, as-promised delivery, and there are many classic stories of FedEx employees going to extraordinary extremes to keep faith with this fundamental value. Of late it seems to me, as someone who spends tens of thousands of dollars a year with FedEx, that their reliability is slipping, and I hope they are not letting go of their core value in surrender to logistical or cost or poor workforce quality influences.

 Peterman Catalog Page Example

 In my No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent book, I featured J. Peterman. If you are not familiar with the famous J. Peterman catalog, please visit www.jpeterman.com. He and his team are scary good at making a product about something much more than it is by tapping into peoples’ emotions, emotional connections, and values.

 For example, one of his catalogs recently included a $159.00, essentially ordinary varsity jacket. (Catalog page shown here.)

 You can buy well-made, nice-looking ones in many different places for a third of this price—but, then again, it might never have occurred to you to want or buy such a jacket like this unless Peterman’s catalog arrived in your mailbox and got you interested. I certainly had no such pre-existing
 interest, yet this nearly got me, and the only thing stopping me was the fact that I already own a varsity-style jacket as well as more autumn- weight jackets than I need or can wear. But I had a friend and business associate who was an Andover grad, who took me there for a visit, and this copy made me think of that storied, other-world campus, then of my visit to Notre Dame, then of High Point University, where I am on the advisory board of the School of Communications. As somebody who never attended a prep school or a college, I have a nostalgia for it that is imagined rather than experienced. I miss football games never attended.

##### Being young again is what’s being sold here— not a jacket.

 This is about how somebody in his forties or fifties or so is going to feel when wearing this jacket. It’s a time machine, not apparel. Peterman’s words: “young … invincible.” That’s how getting into my ’72 AMC Javelin AMX makes me feel. It takes me back to a time when I roared along back roads without thought of speeding tickets or points on my insurance or avoiding accidents; I was invincible then. At certain ages, I imagine just about everybody is eager for this feeling, then different people go about trying to buy, rent, or get it via different ways —but are probably susceptible to being sold it in many different packages. A whole lot of people have no need for an autumn-weight jacket (or a classic automobile, such as I own), and many people, as an act of responsibility, resist buying things they do not need, especially in a recession or postrecession hangover. But feeling young again transcends need. It is even more powerful than a mere simple want. It is a transcendental promise.

 It’s important to understand that most people won’t actually do much of anything to make such an ideal a reality.

 Most will not, for example, convert to a severely calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet, exercise for thirty minutes every day, stick to a complex regimen of nutritional supplements, relocate to a less stressful and less toxic place, and so on in order to feel young again. But if they can buy something and scratch the itch (or awakened-for-them itch) by a simple, nontaxing act—be that a yo-yo on impulse at the grocery checkout or this jacket, or for the more affluent, the sixty-year-old fellow who acquires the twenty-two-year-old wife (or, I suppose, vice versa)—lots of people will make a purchase to feel young again.

##### Youthfulness—the appearance of it, the feeling of it—is a highly prized American value.

 I was recently visiting with one of my literary agents who, some five years ago, longing for the simple life, moved from New York City to a town of 1,100 people in the Berkshires where every day he walks short distances from his home to office to diner to post office (because there is no mail delivery). He sits in his yard and sees wildlife and looks up at the stars. He does not hear the police sirens and street noise of the city. There are no giant piles of garbage bags every few feet on the sidewalks. He sees his neighbors picking up their mail, at the dump (where everyone drops off their own garbage), at the hardware store. He has a quiet and calm and simple life, very simple.

 This life appeals to me a great deal. But I am not going to abandon my entire life, notably including what is place linked, on a whim and disappear to a similar town, at least not now. But I might buy a big picture book or DVDs or some product symbolic of such a place or life, or maybe a flannel jacket and walking stick sold by Peterman and favored by the folk in such a place. I won’t do anything about this impulse. But I might buy something because of the impulse.

 Many people associate small-town life, nostalgically remembered or imagined, with treasured values: simplicity, honesty, family. Such people often buy things that connect them to that life. A long-time client of mine, Darin Garman, who markets investments in apartment buildings and commercial properties in Iowa to people all over the world, most investing from a distance in properties sight unseen, relies heavily on the concept of “heartland of America” real estate and on the description of his life and times in the quintessential American small city, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in his marketing messages. Many of his investors have heartland of America roots and family connections but now live in New York or Los Angeles or Washington, D.C., or overseas.

 How to Connect with Moms

 Here are the facts. Heritage brands that have been around a long time score big with moms—they have a preference for brands they grew up with. Leadership position comes in as close second: being number one equates to quality, value, and trustworthiness (thus you want to construct a category you can be number one in). In addition, 87 percent of moms reported being interested in advertising images of moms having fun with their kids; 86 percent appreciate seeing their multitasking acknowledged. (Sources: The Parenting Group – Survey; AskSmartyPants.com; BIGresearch.com; Marketing to Moms Coalition.org). Moms have a values image that—even though they may not conform to it in actual daily life—is at least an aspiration, if not a fiction, they

 I am working now with my client, Alan Reed, to build a similar “Andy Griffith-y” simpler-life storyline into the marketing of his dairy farm’s ice-cream-of-the-month clubs to consumers all over America, under the brand of Reed & Kennedy Farm Fresh Ice Cream, which you can see at www.ReedsIceCream.com.

 It’s important to understand that just about any product or service can be linked to values. Following is some copy I’ve written for use in advertising Proactiv acne treatment products to moms. Obviously, the copy is not about the product but about their role as mothers.

 “MOM” COPY SAMPLES

 Again, she says, “I’d rather stay home.” Mom, does your daughter hide her face—and cry?

 Will these years be your teen’s best years? So many firsts: first job, first date, first kiss, first relationship. The real world will take over soon enough. There’s no reason to let your daughter’s acne ruin any of this. When they look back on these years, every Mom hopes her daughter will have wonderful memories. But acne, it’s constant and the embarrassment it causes can, pardon the word, blemish these years—unnecessarily, because there is a Doctor- developed, teen-proven, Mom-approved and guaranteed in-home treatment …

 What’s Your Magnificent Mission?

 The nature and details of my business interests have changed quite a bit over time, but I’ve always kept them linked to this mission: to be responsible for getting how-to-succeed education into the hands of more people than any other individual or enterprise.

 At one time I saw the implementation of that mission limited to the mail-order marketing of books and courses. Then it expanded to include speaking and seminars. Then television. Then developing products for other publishers. Then consulting with publishers and direct marketers, even the birthing and expansion of an entire industry now known as information marketing, represented by the Information Marketing Association (www.info-marketing.org). And, now, through a network of consultants and marketing advisors to hundreds of different industries, businesses, and professions, I get success education and marketing systems into the hands of more than 1 million business owners every year.

##### All of this gives most of my business activity some meaning greater than just getting money into the bank accounts. From that comes, I think, a different, superior level of creativity, inspiration, and persistence. There is also a general sense among all my clients and customers and subscribers and readers that we are, together, about something more than me as merchant, they as consumers, and money changing hands. Without it being inauthentic, I think this is an important aspect of a sustainable successful business or career, and something that greatly strengthens marketing messages.

 Oprah is, I believe, the wealthiest entertainer of our time, certainly the wealthiest television personality. But her long-running daytime talk show, the foundation of her business empire and fortune, definitely seemed to be about something more than just a show or a paycheck, however large. She has been a champion of a philosophical position, and of numerous causes. Trump’s main real-estate business has been about “forever changing the skyline of New York,” and the recent years’ brand-development exercise has been about “representing the best.” I recently stopped into a little shop on Main Street in Hudson, Ohio, for a cup of coffee to discover that the Hattie’s shops—that one and several others—all employ developmentally challenged young people and support related activities like the Special Olympics.

 I’m not necessarily saying that you have to have some saintly charitable or profoundly philosophical motive behind your business activities. And I’m not one who feels any guilt about making large amounts of money. But I do find that the business owner who is at least as enthusiastic about the values and mission and processes of his business as he is about its bank balance does best.

 Walt Disney was thrilled when he finally achieved significant financial success, but he was much more committed to his ideals for his theme park than he was to piling up personal wealth. Once, driving home, he noticed an attractive new car in a showroom window and thought to himself: “Gee, I wish I could afford that car.” He drove a few more blocks before realizing, “Hey, I can afford that car!”

 I think you’ll find the challenges of successfully crafting and conveying great marketing messages easier and more fun to meet when you are on a magnificent mission!

 It’s Time to “Assemble” Your Message

 To clarify, your marketing message is the story you are going to tell about your business in your advertising, marketing, online and offline media, in direct mail, conversationally, by every means. At its core will be a foundational, permanent message that you convey consistently. At different times, for different purposes, you may hook different offers, propositions, promotions, or enhancements to it. For different audiences, you may customize it. Always, though, you will be telling a story centered around the most complete and compelling USP you can create.

##### You have undoubtedly had the “joy” of opening a large box and laying out a hundred parts, pieces, screws, and bolts on the floor and trying to assemble them into the beautiful bookcase or computer workstation or whatever is pictured on the outside of the carton. Well, there you are again, only with pieces of a marketing message. Actually, that’s where you start. Keeping in mind everything we’ve discussed in this chapter, get a large pile of blank 3 × 5 cards and start putting one fact, feature, benefit, promise, offer component, and idea on each card— until you have, over a series of brainstorming sessions, exhausted everything you know about your business and its competitors. Then do your best to prioritize the items, in order of their probable importance to your customers and their contribution to differentiating you from your competition. Through this exercise, you can come to the creation of the best possible USP, a supporting sales story, and one or more related offers.

## Presentation

##### Regardless of the target markets you later select—or, preferably, may have selected before you developed your message—and the modifications you make in your message to fit these markets, and regardless of the media mix you use to deliver the presentation of your message, there are some key ideas to keep in mind about making the right presentation.

 The Battle to Communicate

 There is a now very old, true, and still instructive story about Stew Leonard’s famous super-supermarket, where they were bringing in fresh fish every day, carefully packaging it, and displaying it in their freezer cases, clearly and proudly labeled as FRESH FISH.

 They had the right message—people who like fish really like fresh fish. At the time, few other supermarkets went to the trouble and expense of bringing in a lot of fresh fish, so this simple message— FRESH FISH—was a viable USP. They also, incidentally, were getting the right message to the right market; most of Stew Leonard’s customers were upscale consumers with the money to buy fresh fish, the time and inclination to prepare a meal with it, and an appreciation for it. Still, something was wrong. The fresh fish wasn’t flying out of its display case. Why? It turned out to be a presentation problem.

 One of their customers told them that she wished they had real fresh fish, like the fish at the wharfside fish markets. Of course, Leonard’s did, but it didn’t look like it. The fresh fish at the dockside markets was lying there unpackaged, on slabs of ice. So Stew Leonard’s people divided the fresh fish that came in each day and presented the same fish two different ways: one, as they had been, cleaned up and nicely packaged; two, unpackaged, on a slab of ice, in a little display unit topped with a sign reading Fresh Fish Market.

 Guess what? Their sales of fresh fish more than doubled.

##### In 1983, I began coaching chiropractors on marketing and sales, and quickly determined that the chiropractors who wore white doctor coats and even kept a stethoscope hanging around their necks (despite the fact that chiropractors have no use for it) and put their staffs in medical- looking uniforms were significantly more successful than chiropractors who dressed in jacket and tie only or even more casually, and permitted staffs to dress as they pleased. We measured their success by charting their rate at converting prospective patients to paid patients, the size and growth of the practice, the number of referrals, their fee levels, and their total income. I have not wavered on this point and today counsel these chiropractors and other professionals to present themselves “packaged” in the most reassuring way possible, considering peoples’ expectations. In advertising, we never use a photo of a doctor not dressed as a doctor.

 Very recently, I consulted with a company selling a rather high-priced personal care product to women by means of print advertising and direct mail driving them to call and then be sold to by telephone sales agents, with the product then shipped by Priority Mail. They came to me with a shockingly high return-for-refund rate, which can be fatal to a direct marketing company. There was no reason for customers to be dissatisfied with the product, and most of the returns were of a still sealed, unused product. The problem was glaringly obvious. Presentation. The product was shipped in a plain brown box with a plain-Jane, black-and-white label; took three to seven days to arrive thanks to the vagaries of Priority Mail; and the inside was presented very plainly, labeled plainly, and absent any postpurchase reassurance. By changing to a more impressive-looking box, using three-day Federal Express, more elegant interior packaging, and adding both a letter and a DVD reselling the virtues of the product, we slashed refunds nearly in half and recaptured enormous sums, or to put it another way, increased net sales by about 30 percent.

 There are many places that poor presentation can hurt you: in advance of the first sale to the customer, in your advertising and marketing; at point of sale, in your store or office or your or your salesperson’s dress, comportment, language; or after the sale, in the reinforcement and reassurance of the customer. There are three experiences in which marketing messages are at work: before the sale/purchase, during the sale/purchase itself, and after the sale/purchase. We’re going to focus here on everything leading up to the sale, but you should carefully examine and watch over all three.
