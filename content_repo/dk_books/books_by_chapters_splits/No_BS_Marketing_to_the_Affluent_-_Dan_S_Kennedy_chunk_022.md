##### with weak blood. They should not, however, be overlooked in developing a complete marketing plan for Boomers (or seniors). They have effective and reasonably priced media and exploitable affinity.
 The Red Hat Society (www.redhatsociety.com) has enjoyed terrific growth since its 1998 launch, largely thanks to generous media attention. Geared to women over 50, the organization has over 40,000 chapters (many very small), national publications, an online community and so on, but it revolves around local tea parties, luncheons, shopping trips, and the like. Over 500,000 members proudly wear the trademark purple outfit with a red hat. While the organization makes no effort to attract affluent women, estimates are that better than half of its members are wealthy. The organization also has a very active licensing department, for fashions, accessories, gifts, merchandise of all kinds, books, and consumer service.
 My take is that integrating a societal or community element into just about any boomer-oriented business is, at very least, in the no-harm, no-foul category, but can be very useful. It’s a way to create added value mostly from thin air, and to involve your customers with you and with each other. Ideally, you’ll find a way to use it to create “pain of disconnect,” discouraging departure or fickleness and encouraging continued or frequent patronage.

 Boomers Buying Businesses (and Selling Businesses) Well over 50% of all sellers of businesses turn around and start, or more often, buy another business within 12 to 24 months. There’s no indication this is less true of people in their 50s, 60s, and beyond. The franchise industry reports that boomer buyers, especially early retirees encouraged to exit their corporate careers, are a prime source of buyers. A growing number of franchisors specifically target this market. There is no reliable research I’ve yet located on the relationship between Boomers, homebased businesses, and in-home offices, but ample anecdotal evidence suggests a major trend there.
 There are three key themes.

 1. One reason Boomers start or buy businesses, franchises, or business
 opportunities is to prepare for and begin their next life. They have


-----

##### no intention of actually retiring in the classic sense, and they look to self-employment or business ownership for their sense of purpose for the years from 50 to 60 or 60 to 70. In many cases, they are pursuing dream businesses—that’s how bed-and-breakfasts, small restaurants, antique stores, and the like come about. 2. The other reason is to make up for lost time. Several of my clients
 have had considerable success aiming prepackaged part-time or second-business opportunities at professionals ages 45 to 55, who, while affluent, still have not amassed enough wealth to comfortably retire. They see the second-income business as a means of pouring additional income into retirement savings and/or quickly creating equity in a saleable asset. An example of this is Dr. David Phelps, who, based on his own experience transitioning from practice to real estate investor, sells coaching programs to dentists based around a “seven years to freedom plan,” designed to create passive investment income equal to practice income. He has affluence-required pricing, with one-to-two-year program fees from $50,000.00 to $200,000.00. 3. A third area of opportunity is in selling lifestyle businesses to
 Boomers, such as info-marketing or internet-marketing businesses, mobile and portable businesses, and absentee-owner businesses. The “have your cake and eat it too” theme is working well for countless promoters of businesses that lend themselves to spare and flexible time operation, outsourcing, and automation. And, claims about large income potential are not as important as lifestyle claims … a common mistake is focusing on the money.

 Boomers Investing and Investing in Boomers In the financial services industry, there is a current and likely to continue explosion of investment products, advertising and marketing programs, prepackaged seminars, sales tools, sales training, info-marketers, and coaches all aimed at reaching the affluent boomer market. There is even a separate trade journal, Boomer Market Advisor (www.thinkadvisor.com). Predictably and sadly, virtually all the ads and the editorial content in this publication is product and platform oriented, not focused on understanding and communicating with the boomer client. As is all too common, all of


-----

##### these fools think it is about their products. But the growing number of such products is illustrative of the size, scope, and potential of this market … and the need to customize for it, even if most financial companies and advisors are relatively clueless about how they ought to actually go about that.
 Fact is, Boomers have a lot of money invested but also a ton of money underinvested. Boomers, especially leading-edge Boomers, have hundreds of millions of dollars parked in bank CDs, money market accounts, regular checking, bonds, and, still, in their mattresses. Those selling businesses or selling large homes and buying smaller ones; those getting paid bulk sums to retire early; executives with golden parachutes; and those inheriting money from their parents all combined have a boatload of investable assets and are uncertain and anxious about where to put it. (Note: Anyone going after it needs to remember the three key wants mentioned on Page 73.)

 Boomers Buying Homes According to the National Association of Realtors, Boomers account for 57% of second-home purchases—a record high for the age group and a reminder that the old rules of age-based marketing are broken. Boomers used to buy second homes for only one reason (preparing for retirement), and only the ultraaffluent bought vacation homes. Today’s affluent Boomers may have a second and a third home … and they have multiple buying motivations: leisure or vacation; preretirement; retirement; gathering places for geographically scattered families; and investment. They account for 58% of investment property purchasing—single family homes, apartment buildings, and commercial properties.
 Affluent Boomers who intend to buy new homes when they retire— 59%; 45% in a different state than their current residence; 36% intend to downsize. One of the most sought-after in-home amenities: “spa-like bathrooms.” To me, this means the way the real estate industry works with boomer clients has to change, or the Boomers will replace Realtors® with other means of meeting their needs. Boomers ready to relocate do not want hassles or uncertainties. This presents growing opportunity for real estate investors rather than agents to immediately relieve the boomer-owner of his current property, but somehow whoever is at that end of the process must also be able to support the boomer in finding and purchasing the new home,

##### and vice versa. The opportunity here is in a seamless outcome for the boomer. Regardless, though, it tells you that this is a viable market for homes and condos—and a market less affected by price and market highs and lows than the general housing market, because when they’re ready, they’re ready, and they can afford the luxury of NOT waiting for better timing.

#### CHAPTER 8

### Those Who’ve Gone from Poor to Rich

##### “I don’t think of myself as a poor deprived ghetto girl who made good. I think of myself as somebody who from an early age knew I
 was responsible for myself, and I had to make good.”

—OPRAH WINFREY

# I’ve gone from rags to riches, so I think I get these rich customers
##### better than any others.
 A very significant percentage of the affluent population did, in fact, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, and they strongly identify with that cliché. Many came from stark or relative poverty or other difficult circumstances and are still very much governed by having been poor or put

##### down. They never disconnect emotionally from this past, no matter how successful and wealthy they become. Some romanticize their past struggles. All keep them as touchstones. I doubt it’s a coincidence that Jay Leno’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located precisely at the street corner where he was twice arrested for vagrancy. Can’t help but think he had something to do with that placement. Or that his massive collection of classic cars may have roots in his having to sleep in his car while homeless, when starting out.
 Walt Disney was once driving home from Disneyland® when he saw and stopped briefly to admire a particular new car in a showroom window. Then driving home, he said aloud to himself, “Gee, I wish I could afford one of those.” It was a half hour later that it occurred to him—“Hey, I can afford that”—and he turned around, drove back to the dealership, and bought himself the car. This reveals a little something about self-made affluents: They may have nearly unrestricted spending power in reality, but not necessarily mentally and emotionally. Most are conflicted about money. They know they need to think, feel, and act rich to remain attractive to money, as I explain in my book No BS. Wealth Attraction in the New Economy. But they also battle guilt, fear, anxiety, and abhorrence of waste. Those who have worked for their wealth, rather than inherited it or gotten it in some amazing windfall, as a movie star or athlete signed to a $50 million contract, can be self-indulgent and profligate, but are not casually so. A yacht salesman told me, “I always show them an outrageously pricey one first, a very expensive but slightly smaller and less luxuriously equipped one second, and a stripped-down bargain model third. They buy the middle one and are able to feel good about not spending as much as they could have. They feel like they acted responsibly.”

 Selling to the Self-Employed Affluent A very valuable sub-segment of these self-made affluents is business owners and entrepreneurs. Here you may very well find your best customers, clients, or patients.
 Self-employment is one of the most reliable paths to firstgeneration wealth, supplemented by real estate investment. The net worth of a U.S. household in which its head is self-employed is nearly 500% greater than


-----

##### one in which the number-one breadwinner works for somebody else. Frankly, we business owners tend to pay ourselves a lot better than we do anybody else! And among the ultra-affluent, just shy of 50% own a business that is their primary source of wealth. The other 50% is fragmented, with wealth amassed from inheritance, marriage and divorce, pedantic investment over time, and a number of other sources.
 The personality of these affluent business owners and entrepreneurs is sharply drawn, with little ambiguity, so they can be the easiest of all affluents to market a wide variety of goods and services to.
 One of my multimillionaire clients owns a large home services company. He grew up in a house with no indoor plumbing. He started in business with a box of tools and hard work. Another multimillionaire client was divorced by his first wife and shunned by his own family for being a wild-eyed dreamer who refused to get a decent job. Only when his brother, a doctor, saw an article about my client did the family make overtures to patch things up. Another multimillionaire client now traveling around in his two private jets and living in what can only be described as a palatial estate in Florida was once working as a car mechanic, and recalls having to explain to his wife that they could not afford to have the clothes dryer repaired and having to borrow the money to go to his first seminar on real estate. These examples are more typical than atypical of the affluent entrepreneur profile. They have never been handed anything. They’ve worked and sacrificed for everything they’ve gotten. They got it by “taking no crap” from anybody and have no intention of doing so now.

 Won’t Take No for an Answer First and foremost, they view themselves as fiercely independent. They chafe at rules and tend to exit, stage left immediately upon hearing rules language from anyone marketing to them. The fastest way to repel this customer or client is to tell him, “No, you/we can’t do that,” and when asked why not, say, “Policy.”
 I have stayed at every imaginable kind and brand of hotel, from the much-lauded bastion of service, Ritz-Carlton, to the orange-roofed Howard Johnsons; top-rated resorts, city business hotels, rural motels. I and my companies have spent millions of dollars putting on meetings, conferences,


-----

##### and conventions for groups of 20 to 20,000 in these same facilities. Since this is self-described as the service and hospitality industry, you might expect service and hospitality. But you’d be wrong. In 30 years of this patronage, I have been in only two of these places where no matter what I asked, I never heard the words “no” or “can’t.” The properties where this occurs consistently are Disney’s® in Florida, notably Animal Kingdom Lodge® and the Grand Floridian.® Everywhere else, you get nos. I’ve stayed in a lot of resorts once. I take a vacation at a Disney property nearly every year. If not already, I’ll certainly generate a million dollars in lifetime customer value for Disney.® Only $10,000.00, give or take, for just about every other resort I’ve every stayed at but will never stay at again. That’s the value of being able to say “yes” to the affluent.

 If They Admire You, They’ll Reward You with Their Business Second, the self-made affluent are great admirers of the qualities that got them where they now are. Every one of them is doing business with somebody who reminds them of themselves when they were starting out. I got my first bank loan from a 70-year-old entrepreneur who owned the smalltown bank outright, and the mill, and the main street restaurant and hardware store, and most of the real estate as far as the eye could see in any direction. I met him for lunch at his diner on a Wednesday, not knowing his bank was closed on Wednesdays. Afterwards, he unlocked the bank, found its checkbook in a drawer, wrote out a check to me for $50,000.00, and told me he’d have somebody draw up the paperwork and mail it to me to sign. He said I reminded him of himself when he was a young buck too dumb to know what couldn’t be done and tough enough to do it. I regretted not having asked for $100,000.00.
 These people reward ingenuity, drive, persistence, and salesmanship. They have a spiritual reverence for these virtues.
 An axiomatic example was given to me by a fellow who was charged with selling a new kind of pizza-making conveyor oven to New York restaurants. In the city of pizza, only fixed ovens with real pizza stones were acceptable. To crack the market, he determined he would need the number-one restaurateur as a reference, the owner of a couple famous, high- end restaurants as well as five different franchise chains. It just so happened


-----

##### this entrepreneur had just secured the area rights to a new pizza franchise and would soon be opening dozens of locations. The salesman sent him a letter requesting an appointment. Then he sent him one of his business cards with a handwritten request, along with some brochure or article about the ovens or the restaurant business in general, every day. Every day for two months. Finally, his phone rang and the famous restaurateur asked—in good humor—“What do I have to do to get you to stop sending me your business cards?” The salesman told him he’d bought the cards by the thousand, so there was a long way to go, but a brief appointment would put an end to it. The ending is happy. More than 100 of those pizza locations have the “odd” ovens.
 On the other side of this coin, the self-employed affluent genuinely detest sloth, weakness, and wimpiness. They are hustlers who not only respect hustle but find those lacking it pathetic and untrustworthy. That does not mean they respond well to desperate hustle; they don’t. But aggressive hustle, they do.

 They Are—More Often than Not—Searching for Value, as They Define It Third, they know the value of a dollar, and tend to pride themselves on being smart about money, getting good deals and bargains, negotiating successfully, and even being seen as frugal.
 One of the richest people in Europe, the founder of IKEA, Ingvar Kamprad, flies economy, eats lunch in the IKEA employee cafeteria, drives a decades-old Volvo, and lives in a modest one-story home. Warren Buffett still lives part of the time in the same home he bought for $31,000.00 in 1958, and has been known to pick up Bill Gates at the airport himself when Gates visits. The late Sam Walton was famously, symbolically frugal: old pickup trucks, off-the-rack suits, even brown paper bag lunches.
 Even President Donald Trump, pre-presidency, liked telling the stunts of buying the bankrupt billionaire’s oceanfront manor as a foreclosure bargain; of recouping his investment in his famous Mar-a-Lago resort by replacing all of the antiques, antique furniture, and art that came with it with reproductions and selling the originals; and of buying his huge 727 airplane rather than a smaller private jet because there was less of a market for 727s so it could be had at a bargain price. As president, early, he made much of
