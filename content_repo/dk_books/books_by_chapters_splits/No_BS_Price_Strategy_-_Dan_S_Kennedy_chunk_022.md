**Here’s the obvious yet often overlooked fact about all this, that directly affects price**
**strategy: I will pay more for a product, object, or service specifically, precisely “for” any of those**
four subcultures or my professional niche, than for a generic equal of the same product or service,
and I will rarely if ever question whether a cheaper generic will do just as well. To put it another
way, the movement of a product or service from generic to niche or subculture automatically
permits price increase, with no change in the actual manufacture or delivery cost of the product or
service. You might want to stop and read that again.

We’ll do a business product first, from my arena of publishing. Let’s assume I have a product
consisting of six audio CDs recorded at a seminar, with an accompanying manual and workbook,
_Effective Time Management. What is its price? If you go to the online catalogs of companies that_
publish such products, such as Nightingale-Conant Corporation, you will find that a low of $39.00
to a high of $79.00 is the prevailing price range. The same information, condensed and
commoditized as a book can be found at a bookstore for about $9.00 to $15.00. But, if my product is
_Effective Time Management for In-Field, Territory Sales Professionals and it is advertised in some_
media they read, then it may easily carry a price of $179.00 to $379.00. The number of CDs didn’t
change, nor the size of the manual, so it cost the same to manufacture, yet it will sell for 300%
more, give or take. If it becomes Effective Time Management for In-Field, Territory Salespeople in
_the Gardening Center and Hardware Store Industry, its price may again double. Its price is based_
not so much on what it is, and definitely not on what it costs to make, but on who it is for, the fact
that it is for someone specific, and that they believe they and their needs are unique and
automatically respond better to what is just for them vs. what is for anybody and everybody. Key
word: automatically.

Now to consumers. In the same magazine for dog lovers (a subculture), I saw a big ad for nice
ladies’ gold pins, earrings, and bracelet charms, of cute little doggies selling for $19.00 to $39.00,
and a different ad from a “collectors’ gallery” of the same type of jewelry, but available in images of

-----

20 different breeds, so you get the jewelry that precisely matches the pooch you own. That jewelry
priced from $99.00 to $199.00. If they had included “Schnoodle” as one of the breeds, I would have
ordered jewelry for my wife, as that is the breed of our designer dog, affectionately known as The
Million Dollar Dog. They didn’t, so I didn’t. I did not order the lower-priced generic dog-image
jewelry either. The $39.00 and $199.00 pieces are comparable in size, overall appearance, 24 KT
gold-plated, and warranty, but one sells for 500% more than the other.

**This is our famous Million Dollar Dog. She has her own leopard-skin couch, an upstairs**
and a downstairs bed, and flies by private jet, but refuses to eat gourmet or organic dog
treats, preferring doggie junk-food snacks you can buy at Walmart. Go figure. Just as
trivia, $45.5 billion was spent on pets in 2009, up 5.4% from 2008, despite recession. $3[million of that went to Doggles.com, a maker of high-fashion sunglasses for dogs to wear](http://doggles.com/)
at the beach.

In the professional practice arena, my long-time friend and “student,” Dr. Gregg Nielsen,
advertises his Back-to-Work Treatment Program, his Auto Accident Injury Recovery Program, his
Anti-Stress Treatment Program, and other specifically named treatment programs. All involve
essentially the same chiropractic treatment. But if you’ve been injured at work, which strikes you as
more valuable: ordinary chiropractic treatment available anywhere or the Back-to-Work Treatment
Program? If he were to take that a step further and market an Almagam Industries Back-to-Work
Treatment Program to employees of Almagam Industries via the union, free lunch-and-learn
presentations at the factory, and direct-mail to the employees at home, he would virtually negate all
competition and make price, certainly competitive price, irrelevant.

**The deeper the commitment to niche or subculture, the less price matters for the precisely**
**matched product, so the more price elasticity exists when moving a generic product to the**
**niche or subculture. I own, train, and drive Standardbred horses in harness races. I have also**
owned Thoroughbred racehorses. These horses are different breeds, but both are racehorses, with
more similarities than differences. Their owners and trainers, however, inhabit two entirely separate
subcultures and, generally, do not like or respect each other. The exact same liniment or potion for
the racehorse’s sore muscles or nutritional supplement to boost the horse’s stamina will have
virtually the same impact on either breed of horse, engaged in either type of racing. But if you are
the manufacturer or marketer of the liniment or the supplement and you are so tone deaf and dumb
as to name and package it the same for both markets, put a generic horse’s head or both types of
horse on its label, and run the same generic ad in both the Thoroughbred and Standardbred trade
journals, you’ll be selling those products for half what you could be selling them for, maybe even
less. You could command a significantly higher price from each subculture community by
presenting yourself and your product as exclusive to each of them. Were I advising such a client,
two separate companies would be formed—say Thoroughbred Stamina Laboratories and
Standardbred Stamina Laboratories; two different product packages made with two different
product names—say Kentucky Derby Performance Power (for the Thoroughbreds) and
Hambletonian Performance Power (for the Standardbreds), and two different ad campaigns made,
with only testimonials from Thoroughbred trainers in one, only testimonials from Standardbred
trainers in the other. And never the twain would meet.

-----

Too much thought about price is tied to tangible factors, as Jason describes in Chapter 7. Too
little thought given to intangibles, notably including the customer’s perceptions and feelings about
the product. Even with theoretically pragmatic, practical B2B buyers, feelings play a profound role
in most buying decisions, and most reactions to price. In the liniment and nutrition example just
above, there’s no difference in the two products bottled for the two different subcultures. The only
difference lies in the buyers’ feelings about the product. Because it is presented as formulated
specifically and exclusively for the buyer’s type of horse, he has more confidence in its efficacy and
therefore in its value than he would in a generic product, so he is naturally agreeable to paying a
higher price for it.

Yes, this is me, driving professionally in harness races at Northfield Park
[(NorthfieldPark.com), as I do about 200 times a year. PRICE IS NEVER AN ISSUE when](http://northfieldpark.com/)
acquiring a desirable horse, buying veterinary or chiropractic care, the best nutritional
supplements, or best equipment. That’s how everybody feels about something, and one of
the finest price strategies of all is connecting what you sell with buyers who feel about it,
or can be made to feel about it, that same way.

## Isn’t There Something “Wrong” with This?

So we arrive at the ethics question. Someone reading this is disturbed, thinking I’m advocating
charlatanism or outright fraud, or over-charging without commensurate benefit. Neither is true, but
even before getting to that, I want to remind you of your chief responsibility as owner of or
salesperson for a business: to maximize its profits, within the boundaries of the law. If you are
emotionally uncomfortable with that, you should not be running a business or acting as its
representative; you have a conflict of interest. If you have trouble with that, I urge getting and
[reading my book, No B.S. Wealth Attraction in The New Economy.](http://www.amazon.com/B-S-Wealth-Attraction-Economy-ebook/dp/B004RUGVWU/)

Now, to the matter of fraud. Nothing I did here comes close. The product named, packaged, and
advertised as formulated to improve the stamina of the harness racing horse is, in fact, formulated
for that purpose and has that effect. The fact that the same formula does the same thing for a
different type of horse—so what? It is of no concern to the harness horse trainer and should be of no
concern to me as its manufacturer. It is not only an irrelevant fact but a distraction that might
actually deter that trainer from getting a helpful product. The most ethical thing I can do is present
this beneficial product in the way most likely to be accepted by this customer. The least ethical thing
I can do is let him wander off never trying my extremely beneficial product or buying inferior
products because I’m a lazy, timid, or inept marketer. As to the idea of over-charging without
commensurate benefit to the buyer: nonsense as well. The benefit to the buyer is two-fold: first,
getting him to buy the beneficial product in the first place, and, second, creating sufficient
confidence and enthusiasm in the product that it doesn’t wind up idle on a shelf, but is used, used as
instructed, and given a long enough trial to demonstrate its benefits. That _is value. That is worth_
money. Even if there was a dollop of charlatanism in the selling, if there was true benefit derived
from the use that would never be experienced without the charlatanism, then the charlatanism itself
has value and is worth money.

## NO B.S. Price Strategy Warning #4

There are two chains that bind product to price: one is in the customer’s mind, the other is

in yours. BOTH must be cut. It’s a near certainty that the chain in your mind is bigger,

thicker, stronger than the one in the customer’s mind. Customers embrace de-linking
product and price routinely given reason to do so. Business owners and salespeople are,
ironically, more committed to the linkage. In this case, as in most, income improvement

will follow self-improvement!

De-linking value in your own mind from the ingredients in the bottle and whatever they cost, and
**from the fact that some product comprised of those exact same ingredients may be readily**
**available at a substantially lower price, is essential. Thinking inside that box severely constrains**
your price strategy, and misses the truth about value; that it is about the result(s) experienced by the
buyer, or, in some cases, the experience itself, or even just the feelings experienced by the buyer.
This value is naturally and automatically, and often substantially, increased for the buyer of a
product he experiences as “expressly for” him and his niche or subculture vs. a generic, and that
entitles you (if you need permission) and empowers you to attach a substantially higher price to it.
You are pricing to value.

I call this a place/price strategy, even though it usually does not relate to geography as place
(although it can). By place here, I mean the niche or subculture, and the existent state of mind of the
customer within that niche or subculture. In every respect, place has a great deal to do with price. In
geographic terms, the same service may carry a much higher price in Manhattan than in Boise, the
exact same product a higher price at the mall in La Jolla than at the mall in Indianapolis. In fact, I
can find the same sweater in the same store in a mall in Akron, Ohio, and in Beachwood, Ohio—
about 30 minutes’ drive between them—at two different prices, because one is a more affluent
community than the other. A stand set up for a bake sale to benefit a local cause may find need to
sell at lower prices if set up on the sidewalk in front of a Walmart than if set up on the sidewalk in

-----

front of a Target. But there is something called “media geography,” too. The person with a lowmileage, mint-condition 1960 Chevy will most likely sell it for a higher price if he advertises it at
web sites and in magazines for Chevy aficionados and collectors, than if he advertises it in his local
Pennysaver, the bulletin board at Denny’s, or even on eBay. Often, the place strategy that can have
the greatest upward influence on price is the move from generic or mainstream to niche or
subculture.

## Business Soars, Selling to a Subculture

I’m always fascinated to find an entrepreneur who has found a “place” in which to
conduct business where price doesn’t matter and a product/service/proposition for which
[price is virtually irrelevant. The company called MOTO-ART (www.motoart.com) is](http://www.motoart.com/)
there. Their specialty is furniture made from actual airline parts—the DC-9 wing desk @
$9,600.00, glass top $1,400.00 additional; the TBM Avenger conference table made from
the WWII war plane’s rudder @ $12,500.00; a curved desk made from the engine cowling
from a #727 @ $6,800.00; or a love seat for two made from that same cowling, same
price; my favorite: an executive desk chair from a B-52, complete with ejection seat
apparatus—“don’t like what you’re hearing in the office, just pull the lever and abort”!—
$4,900.00. That’s a chair for five thousand bucks. Gotta be some profit in that! The
company’s sales are driven by its own cable-TV show “Wingnuts,” and the ease with
which they can secure free publicity in countless magazines—although targeted directmail is easy for them to do, as lists of licensed pilots, airplane owners, private air terminal
operators, and subscribers to pilot and plane owner magazines are all readily available.

The Lessons Are These
1. It’s about the “who”—when the right person sees their catalog, there’s

something in it he MUST have. Must.
2. It’s product made for a very specific Who.
3. It’s not just a thing, it’s a cocktail party story, an opportunity to show off; it’s

about a person’s passion to which he is profoundly committed. Therefore …
4. Price does not matter. The prices of ordinary coffee tables, conference tables,

chairs are completely irrelevant; this is in a category-of-one.
5. They have more than one target market to live on: they are B2B, with private

air terminals, charter company offices, and companies in the airplane
manufacturing and travel businesses as potential clients—reached directly and

via commercial architects and interior designers; they are to-consumer, with
active and retired private and commercial pilots, aircraft owners, and aviation

aficionados as customers.

Their position is enviable. The trick is NOT to reject that position as out of your reach, but
to scheme to navigate your business into that very same territory.

If you reverse those five factors supporting their high prices out of a business, you arrive
where price is always an issue in the mind of the buyer, likely challenged and suppressed
by competition and commoditization.

## CHAPTER 15

 How “The Company You Keep” Can Impact Price

 Dan Kennedy

**The most interesting thing about price is the wide range, from very low/cheap to very, very high/**
**expensive there is for just about every product and service. For every price there seems to be**
buyers. One of the most important truths about that variance in price for the same product is that it
is greatly affected by things other than the product.

One of these factors—available to just about every marketer—is The Principle of Association.

You are probably well aware that TV and movies are, today, much about what is called “product
placement.” If Shrek drinks a particular brand of soft drink or James Bond drives a particular
automobile in the movies, interest in that product soars and sales increases usually follow. It’s not
foolproof, but it’s real, and hundreds of millions of dollars are now spent on it. When a celebrity is
seen wearing certain apparel, even a shade of lipstick, or using a product, again, sales often benefit.
Sales of both shoes and sunglasses that Sarah Palin was seen sporting during the 2008 Presidential
campaign got a huge boost. This associative effect on sales is well known. What you may not have
been as aware of is that association can affect price as well.

A great example of a company that knows this and uses it to advantage is Allen Brothers, a
purveyor of very expensive, prime steaks and other foods, delivered to your door. They sell
predominately by mail order, with their own catalogs and website. Steaks are, I remind you, a
commodity. There is at least one supermarket within a short drive from your house where you can
get steaks for your cookout, minutes before firing up the grill if you decide on impulse. There is
probably more than one such store near you, and there may be an independent, old-fashioned
butcher shop in your area as well. There’s also a big dog in direct marketing, Omaha Steaks, which,
like Allen Brothers, sells steaks by mail. Their prices are higher than the supermarket, but about half
what Allen Brothers charges. You can also get bargains on steaks at Costco and Sam’s Club. Home
shopping TV fans know you can buy steaks on QVC. There are even Donald Trump-brand steaks
sold on QVC and in several catalogs. Steaks at very low, low, moderate, high, and Allen Brothers
prices. Maybe there’s someplace you can spend more for steaks than Allen Brothers, but I’ve not yet
found it and it has not yet found me.

My wife is rather frugal, so we buy a lot of steaks and other meats from Omaha Steaks, for our
day to day dining, and order from Allen Brothers more for special occasions, especially if having
friends over for dinner. Common, odd behavior, if you stop to think about it—treating guests better
than you treat yourself. It should be the other way around.
