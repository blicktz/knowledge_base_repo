 up into multimillion-dollar-a-year enterprises, and sold them to
 or merged them with major corporations. Two of these were the
 largest manufacturers of specialty and ‘‘pressure-sensitive’’ pa-
 pers in America—Fasson and Morgan Adhesives. The label
 stock known as *“‘MACTAC’’ is Burt’s best-known product.
 ‘‘We have a number of products which are habit-forming,’’ Burt
 told me in a meeting years ago, “‘and we refer to these as our
 ‘opium.’ We discovered that the best way to sell them was to
 use the sales techniques used by drug peddlers: Give away lots
 of free samples until the customer is hooked.”’
   Of course, this kind of marketing takes some guts. But it is
 a way to turn an ordinary business into an extraordinary success, -
 in some cases, almost instantly.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #3:
        GUTSY (NOT WIMPY) MARKETING.
    How Small Can Your Beginnings Be,
          Anyway?
   Okay, so you’re not going to build a hotel or open a restau-
 rant. In fact, you want to get started in business with a peanuts
 budget and somehow still make it big. How small can your start
 be?
   Pretty small.
   How about a business so small you can put the whole thing
 in a cart the size of two wheelbarrows? The hottest trend in the
 shopping mall industry these days is welcoming ‘‘temporary ten-
 ants,’’ such as pushcart merchants. The typical pushcart mer-
 chant rents space by the month, with no long-term lease, takes
 up only about 100 square feet of space, sells impulse items or
 food items, and can get started for as little as $5,000.
   Can such a dinky business make any real money? Consider
 The Pride of Milwaukee, started with a single pushcart by

   with Milwaukee slogans, and similar merchandise carrying the
   Harley-Davidson logo. In the pushcart’s first year, sales topped
   $225,000, the next year, $308,000, with a net profit of about
   $80,000. The business is in its fifth year and expansion has taken
   the form of additional pushcarts during the holiday shopping
   season.
     Then there’s The Nutty Bavarian.
     How a Nutty Idea Turned a Mild-Mannered
     Bean Counter into a Millionaire Entrepreneur
              _ John Mautner was a successful accountant, earning a top sal-
    ary, living in a beautiful home on the beach, financially com-
    fortable. But he was tired of putting in twelve, even sixteen,
   hours a day whenever necessary with nothing extra to show for
    it, weary of the pressure, and restless as someone else’s em-
   ployee. So he threw away the security of his ten-year tenure with
    the accounting firm and walked away.
     On more than one occasion, John had listened to his father
   bragging about the fresh, roasted nuts available from street ven-
   dors all over Europe. He’d done a little investigating, and con-
   cluded that—given the right locations and a hot product—
   pushcart vendors could make a lot of money with virtually no
    fixed overhead or worrisome investments in long-term store
    leases, store fixtures, employees, and other overhead.
     Although he had no training in food preparation, John began
   fooling around with different nuts and condiments on his kitchen
    stove, with the intent of inventing a new kind of nut snack. He
    settled on a recipe for roasted almonds flavored with sugar, cin-
   namon, and several other ingredients he won’t name—The Nutty
   Bavarian’s secret sauce.
     He started his business with one pushcart, at one location.
   No employees. Just John, his nuts, bags, a pushcart, and a hope-
    ful smile. It goes without saying that, throughout this process,

 instant success. People love his product. So much so that after
 just three years, John’s company, The Sports Nut, has over fifty
 pushcart locations operating, many at top locations like Veterans
 Stadium in Philadelphia, Candlestick Park in San Francisco, the
 Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Universal Studios Theme Park,
 Kings Island, and Six Flags. In 1993 his company-owned push-
  carts sold $1.4 million worth of flavored almonds, and his li-
 censed dealers sold $1.5 million, his total sales falling just shy
 of $3 million.
   There’s also a small, but growing, mail-order business, as
 people discover the nuts at one of the locations, then call the
 company to order more. John told me they’ve shipped pounds
  of nuts to thousands of customers so far, without making any
  effort at all to develop this side of the business. But it’s easy to
  see a million-dollar-plus mail-order business evolving in the near
  future.
   How the Presidential Seal of Approval Has Helped
     with The Nutty Bavarian’s Explosive Growth
   Thanks to a chance encounter at an amusement park industry
  trade show, one of President Clinton’s assistants got the boss’s
 approval of The Nutty Bavarian’s cinnamon almonds as the of-
  ficial snack of the inauguration dinners. Of course, ‘‘chance
 encounter’’ is a huge misstatement: John was doing smart, pro-
 active things like exhibiting, distributing samples, meeting and
 greeting people, making things happen. The consumption of a
 half-ton of his snack at inauguration dinners prompted a video
 news release aired by local TV news programs nationwide, plus
 appearances on Today and Good Morning America, reaching an
 estimated 51 million viewers. There were also articles in mag-
 azines from Time to tabloids like The National Enquirer.
   John is amazed at the number of stadium, theme park, and
 other facility operators who heard about him through this pub-
  licity. Some sought him out as a result. Others were eager to

    over 100 yet this year, 500 within three more years. He’s already
        ~ employing about 100 people and will probably double that with
   company-owned locations this year, as well as expanding by li-
   censing to independent operators.
     “I’m thirty-one years old and having a ball,’’ John told me.
    “‘We’re opening up in Hawaii next month, so Ill be spending
   some time there. I travel. I meet fascinating people. I got to
   go to the inauguration. Do you think I can build this into a
   $50 million company in ten years? I wouldn’t mind having
    a $50 million corporation at age forty-one.”’
     I don’t see any reason why he can’t. And John’s story in-
    cludes a number of Millionaire-Maker Strategies that I’ll reveal
    as we proceed through the rest of the book. After discovering
    all of the strategies, you may want to come back and reread this
    story to see how many you can find at work.
     And one thing is certain: Even from little almonds, great
   empires can grow!

  HOW TO INVENT, FIND, OR
 GAIN CONTROL OF ENORMOUSLY
   PROFITABLE PRODUCTS
 Fe many businesspeople, this is one of the most important
   “*secrets’’ to success I think I can pass along: You must have
 ownership of at least some of the products you market, so that
 you have the full markup from manufactured cost to retail to
 work with. This is especially important for any kind of direct-
 marketing or mail-order business, but it applies to every busi-
 ness.
   Why Is Control of a Product So Important?
   When you buy and resell products obtained through normal
 distribution bureaucracies, you are going to have preset, very
 limited profit parameters. If you own a retail store, for example,
 you probably will buy just about everything from the same sup-
 pliers all the stores of your type buy from, at 40 to 50 percent
 off suggested retail. You’ll rarely be able to sell at full retail, so
 you will probably have a 30 percent profit number to work with.
   In the mail-order business, most vendors’ normal terms will
 be 50 percent off in relatively small quantities, to no more than
 65 percent off in huge quantities. This allows less than a one-
 time or 100 percent markup; however, you need a seven- to nine-
 times, or 700 to 900 percent, markup on your primary products
 to make it in direct marketing.

    control them. If you have primary products with big profit mark-
   ups and margins, you can have a ‘‘supporting cast’’ of other
   products with lesser markups, and still have an exceptionally
   profitable business.
     Let’s take a relatively mundane example: a chain of several
   swimming pool supply stores. These stores sold chlorine and
    other chemicals, supplies, filters and tools, some patio furniture,
    beach balls, toys, beverage coolers, and so on. The owner’s
    stores were barely making money. Following a strategy of get-
    ting control of certain primary products with much higher mar-
    gins, these stores went from ‘‘dogs’’ to big profit producers over
    a three-year period of time. Here’s what the owner did:
    1. He got his own line of ‘‘private label’’ chemicals (I'll discuss
     the private label industry later in this chapter), so instead of
     buying the bottled products at 50 percent off for a 100 percent
    markup (selling a bottle of chemicals that cost him $4.00 for
     $7.99), he got that same bottle for a cost of $1.00 and sold
     it for $6.99. This gave his business a competitive advantage
     in pricing, a brand-name image, and higher profits.
    2. He formed a little “‘garage business’’ with teenagers ‘‘man-
     ufacturing’’ patio furniture out of PVC pipe, so he could ad-
     _vertise and sell his own patio furniture at very attractive
     prices. Buying normally, he might make $50 selling a set of
     patio furniture for $199. Now he’d sell a set for $129 and
    make $100.
    3. He got exclusive territory rights to an automated pool clean-
     ing gizmo imported from Korea, on which he had a 400 per-
     cent markup.
    4. He pui a custom T-shirt shop in each store, which is a very
     high-profit business if there is sufficient traffic without direct
     advertising cost.
     Now, he still sold everything he used to sell. He stocked
    several brands of chemicals other than his own, in case a cus-
   tomer was married to a nationally known brand. He sold the

 supply store. But all those items became ppauatat or support
 products.
   In the direct-marketing or mail-order business, the economics
 are even tougher. Almost without exception, you cannot afford
 to invest in advertising or direct mail to sell products with less
 than an 800 percent markup. As a result, just about every mail-
 order business, mine included, has primary products it controls,
 with such markups, then secondary products it also sells, but
 only to its ‘‘house lists’’ of established customers.
       How Do You Gain Control of
        Super-Profitable Products?
  There are four main ways to gain ownership or exclusive con-
 trol of a product:
    1. Create
   2. Publish
   3. Secure certain exclusive rights
   4. Have it private-labeled for you
      Create Your Million-Dollar Product
           from Scratch
   Behind every famous—and not-so-famous—product there’s
 somebody who had an idea and the gumption to do something |
 with it. Who knows how many people have played charades?
 Rob Angel added a playing board and cards and came up with
 Pictionary. Burt Reynolds and the late Bert Convy also created
 a game based on drawing out charades and moved it from the
 living room to TV, where Win, Lose or Draw was a successful
 game show for years. The next time you enjoy a Popsicle, you

   keted by my client, the Guthy-Renker Corporation, was invented
   by a dentist.
     But for every one of these inventors who has the thrill of
   seeing their product become a big star, there.are thousands more
   who toil in relative anonymity, but can still quietly make for-
    tunes. Wilson Call is in that category.
     In 1987 Wilson Call, an architect by training, first got the
    idea for a small fused adapter to go on a TV set plug, to prevent
    fires in case of shorts. It so happens that this was and still is a
   huge problem; in fact, many experts insist that the number-one
   cause of home fires is the TV set’s cord. Convinced of the need
    for such a device, Wilson worked on it and ultimately perfected
   and patented the Fireplug TV Cord Protector.
      ‘‘T thought, like a lot of other potential inventors, that all I
   had to do was get my patent,’’ Wilson recalls, “‘then when the
    patent was issued I would contact various firms through the mail,
   show them my product, they would purchase the patent from me
    for cash and royalties, and I would sit back a rich man, to dream
   up some other device and repeat the process.
      **Little did I realize how amateurish that idea was. In no time
    at all I found out that this was not the case. To have an idea and
   bring that idea to a point where a patent can be filed is a complex
    matter. If you really carry the idea through in a manner that if
   you were to manufacture and market the device on your own,
   would it succeed? In most cases, that is what you are going to
   have to do.”’
     Wilson’s rude awakening does parallel that of most inven-
    tors. He had to take the product to the marketplace himself,
   working through a maze of manufacturers, assemblers, packag-
    ers, legal requirements, and distribution problems, eventually in-
    vesting nearly $200,000 before getting the first Fireplug onto the
    first retail store shelf.
      I'll be the first to tell you that I admire inventors like Wilson.
   But I’ve never had any desire to be one. The fastest way to lose
    a million dollars is to be an inventor.
     This is a very tough road. That’s why it’s quite easy to use

 and all the money they could beg or borrow into, but can’t sell,
 and have no earthly idea how to sell. If you are going to create
 from scratch, my very best advice is to create to fit a known,
 identified, affordably reachable target market or to supply an
 established distribution pipeline. In other words, create it only if
 you know how you will market it and that you can market it.
 And, for safest results, work backward: Have the market and
 marketing in place first, then invent.
   If we break down the ideal market, known means that the
 market exists, can be described, and that you either know a lot
 about it from personal experience or a lot of information about
 it is available through reference materials, periodicals, shows, or
 other sources. /dentified means that others have already done the
 work of profiling this market and proving certain theories about
  it. For example, “‘fishing enthusiasts’’ is an identified market;
 from magazine subscriber databases and specialty catalog com-
 panies’ databases, we can easily get a feel for the size of the
 .market and its makeup in terms of men, women, ages, income
 levels, and purchasing behaviors, all from research sources avail-
 able at the public library.
   Affordably reachable is very important. This means that your
 prospective customers all read one or several magazines, are all
 available on mailing lists you can rent, all go to a big event
 where you can exhibit, all watch a particular TV program, etc.
 In contrast, if you define your market only as American women,
 it will cost millions to reach them, because you must use a lot
 of costly mass media; you'll have to advertise on daytime and
 nighttime television, in dozens of magazines and newspapers,
 and you’ll be fighting for their attention with giant advertisers
 like Revlon, Procter & Gamble, and General Mills. Women who
 own or fly private aircraft is an affordably reachable market.
 There will be one or two magazines they all subscribe to and
 read. They will attend air shows. A mailing list will be available.
   You can best justify inventing, creating, or finding products
 and organizing a business around them when you match up with
 this type of market.

   owners, who ‘‘live the RV lifestyle,’’ are just getting into the
   business of assembling their own catalog of products of interest
    to RV owners. Although they will mostly assemble, catalog, and
    sell existent products, they certainly can afford to invest in in-
   venting and developing some of their own, new, exclusive prod-
    ucts, based on input from their members, because they are
    virtually certain of being able to market those products suc-
    cessfully. The risks of inventing are dramatically reduced; the
   problems of finding distribution nonexistent. Obviously, these
    situations exist for established companies, not for start-up en-
   trepreneurs,
     If you are determined to be a from-scratch inventor, I'd en-
   courage you to get a copy of Wilson Call’s how-to manual, The
   Anatomy of an Invention (see chapter 13).
        An Inside Look at the Tough Challenge
       of Inventing from Scratch and Turning That
             into a Profitable Business
      If you are thinking of going the invent-from-scratch route,
    an honest appraisal of the obstacles ahead of you is important,
   which brings us to Tom Doyle, a consulting client of mine with
    a big problem. Tom invented a product so different from its
   competitors. that it requires educating consumers to sell it, but
    it’s so low in price that there’s no way to cover the costs of a
    lot of educational-type advertising like infomercials or direct-
    mail campaigns.
     Frustrated with how quickly his hand and arm fatigued while
   playing tennis, Tom Doyle became obsessed with grips. Yes,
    grips. And grip designs haven’t changed much in 1,000 years.
   So Tom went to medical school libraries, visited with experts in
    the anatomy, anthropology, and physiology departments of five
    universities, analyzed pro athletes’ gripping problems, molded
    clay in his kitchen, and, over a five-year period, filled his garage
   with different prototypes. In 1988 his ultimate, revolutionary En-
