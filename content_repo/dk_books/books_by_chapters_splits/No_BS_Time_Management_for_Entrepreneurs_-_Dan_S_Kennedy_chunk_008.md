Hopefully, you have picked up this book because you are an
entrepreneur, your time is incredibly valuable to you, and you
are constantly "running out of it."

If you know me, then you've also been motivated to get this
book to find out how I manage to do all that I do. I have been
asked so often, by, what seems like everybody who becomes
familiar with my life, how the devil I fit it all in, that I sat down
and wrote out the answer—this book. If you don't know me, then
your curiosity about my methods may be further piqued by the
description of my activities that follow this Preface. If you know
me, skip that section.

As a very busy, sometimes frantic, time-pressured entrepreneur, awash in opportunity, too often surrounded by nitwits and slower-than-molasses-pouring-uphill

folk, I understand your

needs, desires, and frustrations. The multiple demands on an entrepreneur's

time are extraordinary. So I am here to tell you that
you need to take extraordinary measures to match those
demands. Measures so radical and extreme that others may question your sanity. This is no ordinary time management book for
the deskbound or the person doing just one job. This book is
expressly for the wearer of many hats, the inventive, opportunistic entrepreneur who can't resist piling more and more responsibility onto his own shoulders, who has many more great ideas
than time and resources to take advantage of them, who runs
(not walks) through each day. I'm you, and this is our book.

As you have undoubtedly discovered, time is the most precious asset any entrepreneur possesses. Time to solve problems.
Time to invent, create, think, and plan. Time to gather and assimilate information. Time to develop sales, marketing, management, and profit breakthroughs. Time to network. Probably not a
day goes by that you don't shove something aside, sigh, and say
to yourself: "If I could only find an extra hour to work on this, it'd
make a huge difference in our business." Well, I'm going to give
you that extra hour. But what we're about to do here together is
much bigger than just eking out an extra hour here or there. We
are going to drastically re-engineer your entire relationship with
time.

I've had more than 25 plus years of high-pressure, high-wirewithout-a-net entrepreneurial activity—starting, buying, developing, selling, succeeding in and failing in businesses, going
broke, getting profoundly rich, and helping clients in hundreds
of different fields. Here's what I've come to believe to be the single biggest "secret" of extraordinary personal, financial, and
entrepreneurial success combined: the use or misuse (or abuse by

others) of your time—the degree to which you achieve peak pro-ductivity—will
determine your success. So this book is about
everything that can be done to achieve peak personal productivity.

Just thinking about it is a big step in the right direction.
Awareness helps a lot. There's a reason why you can't find a wall
clock in a casino to save your life—those folks stealing your
money do not want you to be aware of the passing of time. And
that tells you something useful right there: you want to be very
aware, all the time, of the passing of time. It is to your advantage
to be very conscious of the passage and usage of minutes and
hours. Put a good, big, easily visible, "nagging" clock in every
work area. If you spend a lot of time on the phone, have and use
a timer.

Beyond simple awareness, there are practical strategies,
methods, procedures, and tools that the busiest, most pressured
person can use to crowbar some breathing room into his schedule, to force others to cooperate with his exceptional needs, to
squeeze just a bit more out of each day. In this book, I give you
mine. You will undoubtedly be interested in some, disinterested
in others, maybe even repulsed by a few. That's OK. Although
it's generally a bad idea to hire an advice-giver and then choose
only the advice you like, in this case, it IS a cafeteria, and you can
pick and choose and still get value.

Now it is time to get to work. —Dan

from an average 20 road-warrior days a month to four or five in
some months, zero in many. To do this, I totally re-engineered my
business and recently sold one of my businesses. In many
respects, I have less responsibility, and by the time you read this,
several hundred of my Inner Circle Members will have gathered
to celebrate my official semi-retirement at age 49. Note the word
"semi." (Glazer-Kennedy Inner Circle is a membership organization providing the author's No B.S. Marketing Letter and other
services, with Silver, Gold, Gold+, Gold/VIP, and Platinum levels of membership. You will see references to a number of the
Members throughout this book. Information is available at
[www.dankennedy.com.) Also since the publication of the first](http://www.dankennedy.com)
edition of this book, I have been diagnosed with diabetes; I lost
45 pounds and have kept it off for three years. To date, I have
held the diabetes in check with nutrition, diet, exercise, and no
prescription drugs. I've dramatically increased the time and
energy given another endeavor of mine—harness racing. I own,
at any given time, parts or all of 16 to 20 racehorses, and I drive
in races most weeks. I am also, of course, eight years closer to the
19th hole. To paraphrase Yogi, it's getting later earlier.

How has all this changed the attitudes and beliefs I express
about time in this book? Not much at all. If anything, the passing
of time has evermore stiffened my resolve about safeguarding it,
wisely investing it, enjoying it, and bringing wrath upon any
who would steal it, waste it, or abuse it.

How has the passing of time changed my personal practices
with regard to time? Only made them even more stringent, me
more militant. I think I may have mellowed, gotten softer in other
ways, but not when it comes to time. So this book accurately
reflects my thoughts, my modus operandi today, is absolutely

applicable today, and, I think, more critically important than
when first conceived.

The big thing that has changed since this book's first publication is the large and growing number of my own clients, Inner
Circle Members, and readers of prior editions who've adopted—
many, timidly, even fearfully, and skeptically at first—the advice
in this book and lived to be grateful for doing so. When I first
wrote the book, I was more of a lone wolf but in this edition, I
have added many stories, examples, experiences, and comments
from others who benefited from my strategies.

**For Those Unfamiliar** **with Dan Kennedy, a Brief Description of**
**His Motivations for** **Militant Safeguarding** **and Control of His**
**Time, and a Few of His Most Interesting Procedures**

For more than 25 years, Dan Kennedy traveled extensively, often
exceeding 120 to 130 travel days a year, presenting as many as 70
speaking engagements and seminars annually. In addition, he consulted with numerous clients, ran as many as four businesses simultaneously, and employed as many as 42 people and as few as one.
He also wrote and had published at least one new book a year for
eight consecutive years; wrote and saw published more than 100
other books, audiocassette programs, and home study courses;
wrote and published two monthly newsletters the entire time; got
involved in horseracing, and still took quite a few vacations every
year.

Presently, he maintains a slightly saner schedule, notably with substantially reduced travel. Still, he has 63 clients in four different coaching/peer

advisory groups, three of which meet for six days a
year, and one for eight days a year. In one year, he also spends one
day every month tele-coaching the same groups, works with 15 to
20 ongoing consulting clients and their projects simultaneously,
writes direct-response ad and direct-mail copy for more than 50
clients, 200 projects a year, speaks at seminars ten times, has clients
come to him for more than 30 consulting days, produces several TV
infomercials, writes two monthly newsletters, writes at least one
book, and drives in harness races two or more nights a week almost
every week. And he takes vacations.

He has but one staffperson, in an office distant from his own home
office. He takes no unscheduled incoming calls, does not own a cell
phone, and stubbornly refuses to use e-mail. His office phones are

answered "live" only one afternoon per week. He deals with the
majority of his faxes and mail only once each week.

Entrepreneurs have traveled from England, Australia, New
Zealand, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Canada, and every nook
and cranny of the United States and paid $2,000.00 to $5,000.00 each
to attend his intensive, multi-day seminars on entrepreneurial success, in which the subject of time is always addressed. Kennedy is
legendary within his Inner Circle Membership and clientele of
thousands for his unusual modus operandi concerning time, and in
this book, you get an inside look at the key strategies employed and
the thinking of one of the most dedicated time and productivity
managers to walk the earth!

It is significant that Kennedy is no longer alone in utilizing these methods—in

fact, he has inspired countless business owners and
sales professionals to make radical changes in the way they control
their time, access, and people around them. A few of their comments appear at the beginning of this book.

Starting with the very next chapter, we dive into very specific
how-to strategies, but first I think you'll find it useful to understand how I arrived at my philosophy of valuing time and how I
value time. I'll be the first to tell you: you can't eat philosophy,
but you do need your own philosophy of time valuing.

In time management books and in time management seminars, authors and speakers love to show off charts and graphs
depicting the dollar value of each workday hour, depending on
your income or the income you want to achieve. Maybe you've l

sat through one of these little graph-and-pointer sessions before.
You know, Mr. Lecturer up there, laptop computer wired into the
overhead projector, lights dimmed, even a laser beam pointer in
hand, so he can show off his beautiful five-color bar graph. If you
use his numbers, for example, based on eight-hour workdays,
presuming 220 workdays, earning $200,000.00 a year requires
that each hour be worth $113.64.

And that looks great on the chart. And everybody in the
room busily calculates what their hours have to be worth.
Somebody who wants to make $100,000.00 a year figures $56 an hour—hey,

I can do that. Plumbers, dentists, accountants, salespeople, most businesspeople say: cakewalk.

_Unfortunately, it's all a pile of seminar room B.S._

Here's why: it's all based on eight-hour workdays. Eight
hours a day. But there's not a soul on the planet who gets in eight
_productive hours a day. Not even close. You see, the workday hour_
is one thing, the productive hour—or what I call the billable hour—
is another. Elsewhere in this book, there's a definition of productivity you may want to use to determine which of your hours are
productive.

Now, if you happen to be an attorney, none of this matters. It
seems lawyers bill out hours whether productive or not. Rodney
King, famous for getting beat up by the Los Angeles police, had
attorneys who billed for such things as escorting King to his
birthday party and even thinking about his case while commuting. Here's a joke: 35-year-old lawyer in perfect health suddenly
drops dead. He gets to Saint Peter at The Gate and argues: "You
guys screwed up. You pulled me up here early." Saint Peter
checks his clipboard and says, "No sir. Judging by your total billable hours, you're 113 years old and we're late." Lawyers.

But the rest of us can only collect on genuinely productive
hours.

###### Can One "Number" Change Your Life?
So let's go back to the math game and assume that $200,000.00 is
your base earnings target. (We'll talk more about what that term
means later.) How many of your hours will be genuinely productive, directly generating revenue? How many will be otherwise
consumed: commuting, filling out government paperwork, dealing with vendors, emptying the trash cans, whatever? Let's say
it's one-third productive, two-thirds other. That's pretty generous, by the way. One study of Fortune 500 CEOs locked in at an
average of 28 productive minutes a day. Lee Iacocca once told me
he figured top CEOs might average 45 productive minutes per day—the

rest of the day fighting off time-wasting B.S. like a frantic fellow futilely waving his arms at a swarm of angry bees on
attack. But we'll say: one-third. Roughly, only one of three hours
counts as "billable." So you've got to multiply the $113.64 times
three, to get $340.92. This becomes your governing number for
$200,000.00 a year.

My personal number is a bit higher, but if the $340.92 were
MY governing number, as it was a couple years ago, here's how
I would have to use it.

First, it'd be on my mind constantly. Is what I'm doing worth
$340.92 an hour to do it?

Second, it puts a meter on others' consumption of your time—that

unnecessary 12-minute phone conversation just cost
$68.18. This exercise is extremely beneficial. This forces you to
think in terms of "investment" and "expense." It helps you quan_tify what is going on in your life._

Third, for me it sets the base cost for hours given to a speaking
engagement, consulting assignment, copywriting assignment, and
other things I do that are directly billable. And if you do anything
but earn a fixed salary, you have to weigh this base cost against
every activity, to set your fee or to decide whether or not to bother.

When I wrote the first edition of this book in 1996,1 was charging about $3,500.00 to write an advertisement or sales letter for a
client. Today, it starts at $15,000.00 to $21,000.00, and runs as high
as twice that, plus royalties. But let's say I still charged a client
$3,500.00 to write an advertisement. The naive would say that I just
made $3,500.00. After all, I didn't have any "hard" cost; I just sat in
a room and thought, then just sat at a computer and wrote. But if
you think that way, you'll never make big money. If it took me six
hours to write that ad, there WAS a "hard" cost of $340.92 times 6,
which equals $2,045.52. If it took me twice that long, I lost money.

If you travel in your business, you've really got to watch this.
As I write this, I live in a couple of different places. If I'm in
Phoenix, a business meeting in Los Angeles will take, at most, two
days: one half day to travel, a day for the meeting, one half day
back. Maybe even less. But if I'm in Cleveland, a meeting in Los
Angeles will take three full days. One full day more. Using the
$340.92 hour number, it costs $2,727.36 MORE to go to the meeting.

I've learned to think about this a lot. For example, as of this
writing, my one-day basic consulting fee is $8,300.00 (plus
expenses) if I travel to the client but only $7,800.00 if the client
comes to me. Why? Because it's worth money to me to stay home!
I'm buying time. I've maintained this sort of fee differential for
years, but beginning in 2002, I started simply refusing to go to
clients and only offering available dates in the cities where I live.

Many of my clients and Inner Circle Members have adopted
some variation of differential pricing in their businesses. An
