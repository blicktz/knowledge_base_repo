#### Again . . . I LOVE COMPLAINTS!
##### What’s the alternative? For most businesses, the customer doesn’t want the hassle of complaining. She just doesn’t care enough about you or your staff to say anything. She’s the customer who goes to the competition, and not only doesn’t recommend you to others but may also badmouth you. Sure, I don’t like getting these calls, but I love customers who give us the opportunity to MAKE THEM HAPPY, teach us how to be better, and sound an alarm about a problem before it costs us a fortune.
 Find as many ways as you can to tell your customers that you want to know if they are not happy. Tell them with signs when they are at your place of business. Tell them in your advertising. Tell them when you

 Your team members aren’t likely to forget your customer service expectations when they know that your customers know your expectations and that you want your customers to tell you directly when they don’t get

#### What Business Are You In?
##### I used to think we were in the business of selling price guns to retailers. Then I thought we were in the business of selling price guns and packaging to retailers. Then I decided we were in the business of selling retailers everything they needed to operate their business.
 Now I know what business we are really in. In their first hour of employment each new team member at American Retail Supply receives Make-You-Happy Customer Service® Training. The system includes our training DVD that discusses first-day training at Disney World. Where the trainer at Disney asks, “What business are we in? We know that GMC makes cars, and Whirlpool makes refrigerators. What do we make here at Disney? We Make People Happy.” That’s when it occurred to me, “That’s what we do at American Retail Supply! We make people happy.” Frankly, I think that’s the business every company should be in.
 If you are in the business of Making People Happy, it becomes clear to every team member in your business that their job is to Make Customers Happy.
 We understand that after customers call us, they’re not going to be singing “Zippity Doo Dah,” but the reality is, our job is to make them happy, and if we don’t make them happy, they won’t, and they shouldn’t, come back!
 I carry this idea over to all five of my businesses, including my training and coaching businesses, that you can tap into at www.KeithLee.com. These are B2B businesses, not a Disney-like business on their faces. American Retail Supply could be judged a mundane business mostly selling necessary supplies. There’s nothing inherently, organically “happy” about these businesses. We’re not putting inflatable bouncy-houses in backyards


-----

##### at kids’ birthday parties. But that’s the point. With any business, no matter B2C or B2B, no matter if seemingly as ordinary as dry toast, customers want to be happy.

#### Should YOU be in the Business of Making Customers Happy?
##### If you really want to get maximum referrals and customer retention, making customers happy is the place to start.
 If you, and your entire team, show your customers that you really care about them, they will be happy customers, not just satisfied customers. Happy customers come back, even if you’re a little higher priced. Happy customers will come back even if someone else is more convenient. Happy customers, and this is incredibly important, will allow you to make mistakes and they’ll still come back. Happy customers tell others about you.

KEITH LEE owns five businesses, including American Retail Supply. When Keith shared his secrets
to his exceptional customer service with his customers via his Retail Tip of the Week, they clamored
for more and asked him if he could put them all together. The result is his book The Happy Customer
_Handbook, 59 Secrets to Creating Happy Customers Who Come Back Time and Time Again and_
_Enthusiastically Tell Others About You. The book is a quick and easy read with secrets any business_
can use to improve their customer service. For more information, visit

## Three-Step Customer Retention Formula

##### by Shaun Buck

 ’ve found that people love 1-2-3 Steps, Checklists, and Formulas, so I try not to disappoint! It’s good for you to figure out what your customers really like, too, and try not to disappoint. That’s almost too simple, isn’t it?

# IDan Kennedy tells of being in the reception area—what used to be

##### called a “waiting room”—of a professional’s office on a fairly busy day and overhearing a conversation among several others waiting to be seen. The entire area was fresh from major remodeling, with new carpet, furniture, several big flat-screen TVs playing different daytime shows, and a fancy beverage bar. One person said to the other, “I don’t care about any of this. I just wish he’d be on time and that my appointment time meant something.” He said it with a couple swear words inserted. The person next to him said, “Second that. We wouldn’t need TVs to watch if we weren’t kept waiting around for a half hour or hour.” Soon, several more people joined into this shared frustration conversation. And what do you think the odds are of retaining them? What about getting referrals from them? It’s important to know what’s really important to them.
 Actually, the complete formula for retaining customers is simple:


-----

##### Shared Interest + Shared Space + Shared Concern = Customer Retention

 This isn’t a new concept. We have all used this formula before to make friends, find a spouse, etc. First, you need to find shared interests—those areas in your life that overlap. For example, I have five kids and they are all boys. Each year, we go to Disney World. In those two short sentences, I have connected with a large number of people, including:

 • People who have kids
 • People who love Disney
 • People who have large families
 • People who have all boys
 • People who have large families and who had a string of either boys or
 girls before finally having a baby of the opposite gender.

 I never communicate with my clients just about my products, services, and business. Doing that positions my clients as just customers of and for my business. I want a relationship, so I share my life, my interests, my experiences, my ideas. Who I am. What I’m about. So they can find Shared Interests with me.
 This is something a lot of business owners find difficult to understand or do. When I’m working with a customer who sells business to business, they often feel that opening up on a personal level is crossing some invisible boundary. I find this funny because at the end of the day, a person is the one who decides to buy your product or service, not the business. You’ve heard the saying, it’s not what you know, it’s who you know. Regardless of whether your product is sold to a “business” or to a consumer, people would rather do business with someone they know.
 This is an example of how creating shared interest has worked well in my business: a very successful business owner running a multimillion- dollar company got his hands on my newsletter. Inside each edition, I have a section called “Have you heard the good news?” It shares a handful of Bible verses each month. My prospect also happened to be a Christian, and when we were both at a direct response marketers’ training event, he stopped me in the hall and started a conversation with me about the Bible


-----

##### verses in my business-to-business newsletter and my reasons for deciding to add that section. That single point of connection has turned into a multiyear business relationship and a close personal friendship as well. Is it possible we would have worked together anyway? Sure, but it is also possible we wouldn’t have.
 Sharing an interest is important, but so is sharing a space, and it’s simpler to accomplish than you might think. You want to be present in the lives of your customers. The supermarket gets you to buy insulated canvas tote bags with their logo on it to bring with you shopping. It hangs in your pantry or by your door, rather forcefully reminding you to shop at that store, and interfering with an impulse to go somewhere else. That’s a retention strategy. Another way to do this is to give your customers a plaque they can hang on their wall or your book to put on their bookshelf. At The Newsletter Pro, our goal is to be in and around each prospect and customer in as many different ways as possible. Here is a short list of some of the ways we maintain a presence in our clients’ homes, offices, and vehicles:

 • Monthly print newsletter × 12 per year
 • Weekly email newsletter × 52 per year
 • Plaques to hang on the wall × 1 lifetime
 • Framed first edition newsletter × 1 lifetime
 • Educational audio CDs with our branding × 12 per year
 • Gifts × 4 per year
 • Water bottles with logo × 1 lifetime
 • Marketing examples that are worth saving, many that include our
 branding × 6 per year
 • Birthday and Christmas cards × 2 per year
 • Special reports × 6 per year
 • Reference materials with your logo and branding × 2 lifetime
 • Thank-you cards × 5 per year

##### Sharing space in someone’s physical world is not a new idea. Walk around your house tonight and look at all the logos and branding that is all around you. My co-author, Dan Kennedy, literally has a bookcase in my house. When he first started making an appearance in my life, he had one spot on a bookshelf. As time went on and he continued to write books, he soon had a whole shelf. Then, as I invested in my GKIC membership (the company Dan Kennedy founded—www.GKIC.com) and started receiving newsletters and CDs from him, his space grew. Now he has a big presence in my house, where I have more than 20 binders filled with his years of


-----

##### newsletters and dozens of sets of course materials. At my office, I have more books in our office library for my team to check out. I even have a Dan Kennedy bobblehead! And finally, in all three of my cars, you can find CDs from GKIC. Do you think I listen when he talks? Long before I personally knew Dan, I had a relationship with him, and part of that relationship was developed via his ever-growing presence in my space.

Inside you’ll be able to download additional valuable resources like different pieces we use to maintain a presence in our customers’ homes and offices.


##### Shared Concern is the final piece to this formula. Relationships do not thrive when they are one-sided. You have to genuinely want to help every customer and prospect. You have to work to help them come up with the desired outcome that they not only want but find to be in their best interest. Too many business owners put their needs ahead of the needs of the customer and prospect, and although you may do well for a time under those circumstances, your customer retention rates will suffer, your referrals will be nonexistent, and ultimately, your business will plateau or worse, rapidly decline. Customers want to believe that your concern for them goes beyond getting into their wallets! The more ways you find to demonstrate that, the stronger your customer relationships are, the better and longer the retention, and the more frequent the referrals.

## The Trouble with the Goldfish from Kmart

##### by Dan Kennedy

 am about to reveal my million-dollar truth about customer retention.
 I’d really rather not be sued by Kmart. This is my personal opinion based on my personal experience and may not reflect everyone else’s.

# IAnd I have no real beef with Kmart. If you want to buy a big metal can of

##### caramel corn or potato chips cheap, or some plain underwear cheap or beach towels and flipflops for the summer cheap, it’s a dandy place to go. But I do not recommend buying pet goldfish there.
 When I was a kid, for a time, we had a pet menagerie, including parrots and a coatimumdi, as well as more mundane critters like guinea pigs, cats, dogs. We raised tropical fish. We had a sunroom with two walls, floor to ceiling, of aquariums with all kinds of fish. We even entered them in shows. There are tropical fish shows, just like dog shows and horse shows. One of my guppies once won Best of Show. Some of our fish were imported, some bred domestically, and we went and got most of them from a reputable, celebrated fish farm and importer oddly named Tricker’s, near Cleveland, Ohio. These fish were healthy. Bred well, fed well. Their fins strong. They even came with a replacement guarantee. We also directly imported some, and I can remember going to the freight terminals at Cleveland-Hopkins


-----

##### Airport to pick up the just arrived fish, in water filled plastic bags, in Styrofoam chests, just flown in, alive and well. If you wanted guppies, neons, other tropical fish, or just some good-looking goldfish that would have long lives, this is how you could get them. The best place to get a good goldfish is at a local, independently run pet shop. This is all especially important if you put more than one fish obtained at different times into the same aquarium, because one sickly fish can kill them all overnight.
 I am not sure where discount stores like Kmart, or, when I was a kid, five-and-dime stores like Kresge’s or Woolworth’s got their fish. But I can assure you, not from these same sources. If you know what to look for, you can tell by eye that the fish for sale in the back of the pet sections at these emporiums are weak, poorly colored, with thin and fragile fins, lethargic, sickly, and in many cases toxic. When you bag them and hurry home, some die enroute, some die within days. Few live long.
 Now you know more about fish than you ever wanted to know. But maybe it well help hammer home this point: If you insist on stocking your pond with sickly or toxic fish, you can’t expect any of them to live very long.
 This is the secret truth about retention. Shaun quoted me on it briefly in Chapter 6. But it is so important, it deserves this chapter all to itself.
 Retention and the economics of retention—long-term or lifetime customer value and your ability to invest in customer retention and development—have as much or more to do with the nature, quality, and appropriateness to you of the customers as with you, your goods and services, and your operation of your business. That’s a vital idea, so here it is again, big and bold:

 . . . have as much or more to do with
 the nature, quality, and
 appropriateness to you
 of the customers as with you, your goods and services,
 and your operation of your business.

 This is mentioned one way or another by just about everybody who has contributed to this book. Susie Nelson describes her own clever strategy for
