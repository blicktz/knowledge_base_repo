THE SIX STEPS OF THE NO B.S. SALES
 PROCESS

## Before I had turned 45, I received by mail my invitation to join the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). It was a beautiful direct- mail package, including a personalized letter, a temporary membership card embossed with my name, and a great premium offer. Only one problem: you have to be 55 to join. It arrived at my place more than a few years too soon. And no matter how great the offer is, I’m not buying.
 Many salespeople waste tons of time trying to sell to people who cannot or will not buy. It’s not always as clear-cut as in my case with AARP, but it still happens often, for a lot of reasons. Some salespeople are too lazy, too ignorant, or too “chicken” to properly qualify prospects. I know salespeople in business-to-business situations, for example, who know they need to be dealing with the CEO, but insist on selling to the personnel directors, training directors, and sales managers instead. Why? It’s easier to get to those people. It takes less confidence and self-esteem to deal with those people. The problem is that dealing with those people is ineffective.
 How do you know who is the right prospect?

 • Someone who has a reason for interest in your proposition.
 • Someone with the financial ability to say yes.
 • Someone with the authority to say yes.
 • Someone who is predisposed to say yes.

-----

# Interest

## Let me quickly explain those four qualifications: first, the prospect has to have a logical reason for interest. Someone who lives in the middle of the Mojave Desert is probably a poor prospect for a yacht. A 92-year-old is probably a poor prospect for life insurance, definitely a poor prospect for skiing lessons. Those are obvious. The real-life situations you deal with aren’t so obvious.
 I don’t want to encourage you to prejudge prospects to the extreme. However, you need to determine some sensible link between the prospect and the proposition. If you sell furniture, for example, “homeowner” might be the only link needed. If you sell very high-end, expensive furniture, it might be homeowners only in certain zip codes, with a certain size home, with a certain amount of equity in their homes.

-----

# Ability

## Second, you need someone with the financial ability to say yes. If you sell to businesses, you might want to zero in on companies that have reported growth in the previous quarter (which is a reflection of their financial strength). If you sell swimming pools, aluminum siding, insurance, remodeling, etc., to homeowners, and are going to do a pre-approach letter campaign, you might want to have the mailing list of residents in a given area merged with a list of bank credit card holders. The odds are much better that credit card holders are financially able to buy.

-----

# Authority

## Third, you need to talk to someone with the authority to buy. In consumer selling, that often means that both husband and wife have to be present at the meeting. In business-to-business marketing, you have to determine who has the authority to spend how much for what. It is easy to ignore this caveat and be a very busy salesperson who is not very busy selling. In my own selling, I’m usually dealing directly with an entrepreneur who has sought me out—with THE decision maker.

-----

# Predisposition

## Fourth, I urge salespeople to concentrate on selling to people predisposed to say yes. In mail order, for example, we’re much better off marketing to known mail-order buyers who also fit our other selection criteria than to people who perfectly fit our selection criteria but have no history of mail- order shopping. If I were selling investment or insurance services, I’d rather contact people who already had some insurance or investments than those who did not. Beyond that, using the “positioning, not prospecting” strategies presented earlier in this book, you can be sure you are investing your time only with those predisposed to buying—from you.
 Here is the most important thing: you should create your own Highest Probability Prospect Profile, then do everything you can to invest your money and time in reaching only those people. When you combine setting out to attract or pursuing only Highest Probability Prospects with my No B.S. Sales Process, you can engineer truly spectacular results. So, the Process...

# Step One: Permission to Sell

## The first step in the selling process can be best defined as obtaining the prospect’s permission to sell. You cannot sell effectively to someone who is mentally or physically backing away from you. Nor can you successfully force someone to pay attention. A person has to choose to be sold to before you can sell to them.
 The best advice for securing permission to sell is a question structured like this:

 If I could show you how to __________________would you be
 interested in knowing
 more about it?
 Or, if you prefer to be bolder in your assumption, try this:

 If I could show you how to ____________________you’d be interested
 in knowing more about it, wouldn’t you?
 The prospect who responds positively to this question gives you permission to sell, and you will have actually built a little box around the person, with his or her cooperation, that virtually guarantees subsequently closing the sale. Now all you have to do is fulfill the “if I could show you how to” conditions, point out that you have done so, say ”Eureka!” and ask your prospect to “initial right here.”
 Here is an actual example I scripted for a client of mine in the investment real estate business. When his reps use it, it will work like magic! It is a series of question:

-----

## • Did you pay federal income tax last year?
 • Would you be interested in legally reducing the amount of taxes you pay, providing it didn’t cost you anything to do so?

 • Could you use $5,000.00 to $15,000.00 in extra cash income per year?

 • Do you consider yourself an open-minded, positivethinking person?

 • Then, if I could show you how to legally reduce your taxes at no cost to you, increase your income, and associate with others doing the same thing, would you be interested in knowing more? This series of questions will get the needed permission to sell more than 50% of the time. It can be used in person-to-person prospecting, telemarketing and, preferably, in lead generation advertising or direct-mail.
 I have a “bonus,” advanced strategy for you, one that secures permission to sell and ensures heightened interest from the prospect. A financial advisor in Chicago who uses it exactly as I scripted, targets only multimillionaire business owners, and gets invited in to meet with 92% of all he approaches. It is that powerful. I call it: guarantee the appointment. Or, buy the appointment. Here’s what it reads or sounds like:

 Give me __minutes. If I fail to show you at least X# __________________ you did not know about and would otherwise not have known about—and that your _______ had not told you about —and you honestly feel I wasted your time, just say the word, and I will pay you $________ as my penalty, right on the spot, cash, on your desk.
 Actual example of this template filled in:

 Give me 19 minutes. If I fail to show you three strategies for improving response to your existent advertising or extracting more value from your leads—that your ad agency has not told you about— and you honestly feel I wasted your time, I will pay you $500.00 . . .
 That’s the one I used, in 1974 and 1975, when I first started an advertising consulting business.
 Today, I use a very different approach, and to be fair, I should let you see the flip side. These days, I never meet with anyone free, and any new client

-----

## relationship begins a certain prescribed way. The verbiage is as follows:

 All new client relationships begin with a day of diagnostic and prescriptive consulting, at my base rate, $18,800.00. At the end of the day, one of three things happens: one, we’ve had a good, productive day and you leave happy with strategies to act on. Two, there’s a project or projects you want to hire me to do for you, in which case the initial day’s fee is fully credited to the larger project fees and royalties. Or three, you feel your day was unproductive, in which case I gladly refund your fee.
 As you can see, I am still guaranteeing the appointment. This is tried and true, but one of the things is even more relevant to The New Economy. In The New Economy, everything must be earned. There are no gimmies. Even the permission to sell must be legitimately earned. It will not be casually given to you by any prospect worth investing time in; the more valuable the prospect, the harder it will be to get. So, a very specific promise for information gained just during the initial appointment, conversation, or meeting, and a guarantee, are means of earning that permission.

-----

# Step Two: The Offer

## I believe in prefabricating an easy-to-explain, clear, simple, and understandable offer that includes no more than three and preferably only two options.
 A two-option offer, commonly called “an either/or” or “an A/B split” usually divides along price lines. You might have a basic, no-frills package at $X, or an options-added, deluxe package at a higher $Y. Another similar approach is to present the deluxe offer, but have a lower cost offer in reserve for a stepdown sale. However you choose to structure it, you should get to a point in the sale where you lay out the “you get this and this and this and this” summary of products, services, warranties, benefits.
 I am almost always opposed to cafeteria selling; letting the customer pick items from an ala carte menu. In countless situations, I’ve improved the average transaction size, closing percentage, and speed of sale by putting the individual items into “bundles” or “packages” and offering only the choice of Package A, B, or C.

-----

# Step Three: The Presentation

## There are several “classic” formulas for the structure of a sales presentation. You can find and learn them in a variety of books, tapes, and articles. They have been tested and proven over time. You do not need any new or more sophisticated formulas. You only need to select the one most appropriate to your particular situation. But you should build your presentation with one of them.
 One formula you’ll hear about is AIDA: Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action. First, you get the prospect’s attention. This is most commonly done by briefly outlining a set of benefits. Next, you build interest by providing evidence of the benefits with facts, statistics, demonstrations, stories, and testimonials. Then, you create desire by relating the benefits to the prospect. You can also build desire with discounts, incentives, or premiums available for prompt action. Finally, you create action with a closing technique.
 Another formula is PAS: Problem, Agitate, and Solve. This is the formula I prefer to employ whenever possible. I was using it long before I knew what it was called or that it was, in fact, a known formula.
 With this formula, you first state a problem and secure the prospect’s agreement that the problem exists. For example, you might agree that there is an epidemic of crabgrass in the neighborhood. Next, you get the prospect agitated about the problem, perhaps realizing that crabgrass ruins the appearance of the lawn by damaging the root structure of the healthy grass and that it can damage the lawn mower. Then you produce the solution. Example: Wouldn’t it be wonderful if there was a liquid you could spray on your lawn that actually killed crabgrass without damaging the other grass?
 I want to emphasize that you should have a disciplined approach to your presentations. If you are “winging it,” you’re kidding yourself about being a professional. Fortunately for you, the airline pilot who flies you from place to place and the surgeon who operates on you, should you, God forbid, ever need it, don’t “wing it.” They are professionals.

 “Presentation”

# Step Four: Emotional Logic

## As far as I know, my speaking colleague of ten years, Zig Ziglar coined the term “emotional logic in selling.” It represents the way people really buy: they take buying action spurred on by emotional factors, but need logical reasons to justify doing what they really feel like doing.
 If you try to get somebody to reason their way to a sale with you, you’re going to find tough sledding wherever you go. And I don’t care if you’re selling sophisticated computer systems to Fortune 500 executives, the act of buying will still occur at an emotional level. If you can’t create emotional activity and feelings inside your prospect, you won’t make many sales.
 But you don’t want to be an “emotions steamroller” either. If you do, you’ll probably wind up buying back as much as you sell or selling to each customer only once and never building valuable relationships. People require reasons to justify their actions. You need to combine emotion with logic.

 Use the E-Factors
 There are five main Emotional Factors that motivate people to action: love, pride, fear, guilt, and greed. Please note, though, that they are all based on a simpler self-interest formula of avoiding pain and obtaining pleasure. For example, let’s say you are soliciting money for a nonprofit organization. Some people might feel guilty about how well off they are compared to the world’s poor starving children; they might fear bad luck or karma for not doing their share; they might take pride in being able to help; they might be genuinely inspired by love of humankind; or they might see positive public relations benefits for their business by participating. So all five factors might influence them to participate. But if you go beneath that activity to the very core of response, not giving must be more personally

# Step Five: Closing the Sale

## I once flew across the country seated next to a grizzled directsales veteran who had been a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman during the Depression. When hired, he had to study a huge book of answers to 357 different objections and stalls, and learn 357 different ways to close a sale, and take a test on it before getting out into the field where he could make some money. So he learned all 357. And he told me that in his entire sales career since he’d only used three of them.
 I believe that closing the sale should be a natural progression, not some abrupt jack-in-the-box trick you pull out at the end. If closing is difficult, something is wrong with earlier parts of the selling process. You should not have anxiety or stress about the close because it should happen virtually of its own accord, from the momentum you’ve established. In my own experience, clients will ask: “OK, how do we get started?” before I even have to “close.”
 Also, if you’ve asked a series of trial close questions as you’ve gone along, you will have established the momentum toward the positive closing and you will have already taken the tension out of asking questions and obtaining answers.
 On the other hand, I’m not suggesting you be weak-kneed about closing either. If you aren’t fortunate (or good) enough that the prospect jumps ahead of you and literally says “Let’s do it,” then you need to accelerate your use of assumptions as you approach the close. Salespeople sell their way right out of sales by using “if” instead of “when” terminology. For example, never say “if you become a member,” say “when you become a member,” or better “as a member, you get . . . .” If you are meeting the prospect in person, match your words with physical action: “here in your Member Kit, you’ll see . . . .”
 If you must ask a closing question, there is one simple formula superior to all others. Just about the only closing question structure I bother using or

-----

## teaching is the simple yes-or-yes question. Would you prefer red or blue? With or without? Today or tomorrow? Pay in three or four installments?
 Some people say this is “old hat,” and I guess it is. But I haven’t found anything better. People usually choose from what’s put in front of them. You go into a restaurant, they give you a menu, you choose from the menu. You call up the airline, they tell you what times the flights are, you choose one. So assuming everything else in the sales process has gone well, a two- option, yes-or-yes question is a comfortable way to close the process. Why fool around with anything else?
