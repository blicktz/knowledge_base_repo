###### We were able to leverage this message of scarcity in each and every media that we put our message in and made sure to update the number of memberships sold in each ad, while updating the diminishing number of available memberships left before the waiting list would kick in.

**FIGURE 4.2**


**DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: Here’s the early ad with the group photo. The**
emphasis is on the free report offer, but also on the urgency created both by scarcity, with a
diminishing number of spots available, and by a specific deadline and the direct offer to call.
This is all, again, hard-core direct response. The logo is a little bigger, though.


###### The response we received was immediate and amazing! We started selling 40 to 50 memberships a month, at double the price of our competitors, and sold our capacity number at that first location in just under eight months! Often the first question that would be asked when we were contacted by a prospect from an ad was whether there were still any spots


-----

###### left from the original 300 available. That is great positioning to begin a sales consultation.
 As we developed more and more raving fan testimonials, we started to vary the message and went after different demographics with our ads, such as females and the over-40 crowd. We wanted to continue to dispel the myth that Iron Tribe was only for elite athletes and we weren’t for mainstream America.
 I started to use my wife as one of my models for the ads. As a busy mother of four, she fit the stay-at-home mom demographic perfectly and really resonated with that demographic. As much as she hated being the star of the ads, they were great for recruiting women who never thought they would be doing our type of intense group workout. (See Figure 4.3 on page 41.)
 We were also having success through several different direct-mail campaigns. We did really well at leveraging our own sphere of influence, and eventually we created a three-step direct-mail campaign for new Iron Tribe gyms getting ready to open, and that has done extremely well for us. But we also knew that we would have to create proven external marketing campaigns for our franchisees that were going into new markets, where they didn’t have a sphere of influence, so we started to apply much of what I have learned over the years to some very successful postcard, sales letter, and lumpy mail campaigns. One of our most successful direct-mail campaigns is an evergreen campaign to neighborhoods around each location. (See Figure 4.4 on page 43.)

Figure 4.3: DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: Most big-brand advertisers would pale,
tremble in fear, and probably criticize this ad as “too tabloid-y,” like something you’d see in
the _National Enquirer. They would also think its copy’s tone too confrontational and off-_
putting to many women. About that last point, they would be right. Key word: many. One of
the chief principles of great direct-response advertising is that it should repel the wrong
customers in order to strongly, magnetically resonate with precisely the right customers, thus
always sacrificing many to attract few. This is a great example of using a clear and forceful ad
to position a brand-in-the-making.


###### We have never wavered in our commitment to selling. A lot of small- business owners and professionals as well as big corporations get weak- kneed about this! During the time this book was being written, a disastrous experiment was run with J.C. Penney in which selling in its advertising was abandoned in favor of vague, feel-good brand messaging. The CEO behind this decision came and went quickly, leaving behind a financially wounded company. We want to build our brand, but we need 300 active members enrolled at each of our locations as quickly as possible, so we are patient about our brand-building and act with urgency about our selling.

Figure 4.4: **DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: This is an oversized (8½" x 11") two-**
sided postcard, with a classic “bribe offer” (Free Fitness Gear Bag) and a free try-before-youbuy offer (Free Fitness Consultation). Notice how little space is given to Iron Tribe branding—
in fact, find the logo if you can! This is all about getting prospects to sales appointments where
memberships can be sold. It actually takes a lot of courage NOT to plaster one’s brand logo,
image, and slogans all over everything. A lot of Forrest’s and Jim’s brand development is from
the Tribe out, rather than by sacrificing selling to outright advertise it to the world. This is
actually how Apple built its brand early on, but few remember now that it is so iconic.

## Criticism Will Come; Thick
 Skin Is Required

###### by Forrest Walden


###### e were having a great time creating and running all of the different campaigns that we were building. They were returning anywhere from 200% to 400% ROI a month, and we were

# W

###### thrilled.
 However, there was a small problem. My wife hated the ads, and our clients kept telling me that the advertising didn’t reflect the quality of the program and the quality of the brand. I was told our advertising was “unprofessional.” I had many heated conversations with my graphic designer, who helped me develop the mark and logo, about how bad the advertisements I was running were. Everyone (including our investor) was


-----

###### telling us that nobody would ever read the 30-page free report that we were mailing out and that we were wasting so much money using snail mail.
 I’ll never forget talking to a surgeon, who was an absolute raving fan of our service, and hearing him tell me that he wasn’t proud of our brand when he saw the advertising. I was deeply troubled. As I asked him more and more questions, I realized that he had actually come from one of those very same ads, requested a free report, and read it cover to cover. As Dan Kennedy says, “Buyers are liars!”
 Our advertising was “crushing it,” and we started opening more and more locations in Birmingham, using the same campaigns and adding even more urgency, leveraging the fact that we had literally sold out two locations and had waiting lists.
 We knew that we had to have more than a prototype to show that we had successfully replicated our model and that we needed to establish a true system that was ready to franchise.
 When we opened our third location and started finalizing the franchise process, we started to realize that we had a raving fan base and a true brand that was being built. However, we also knew that when franchisees look to purchase the franchise, they were going to want some strong branding campaigns as well as the “tried and true” direct-response campaigns that we had been building and testing so effectively.
 I remembered the story from Dan’s Renegade Millionaire audio CDs, where the CEO from Weight Watchers said that Dan’s stuff out-pulled his advertising agency’s work easily, but he could never use it because it was too ugly and his board as well as the franchisees would turn it down.
 We needed to start creating some campaigns that not only had direct- response elements, but also could leverage our rapidly growing brand. Unfortunately, we thought we had to go out and find an advertising agency to help us pull that off.
 I am describing an evolution and maturation of a business’s identity and brand, and of its relationship with its tribe, that is very sensitive and hazardous. Giving your tribe what it wants and needs to feel proud and eager to recruit customers for you and making your brand more recognizeable as a brand while staying true to the marketing principles, strategies, and tactics that got the business to success and that are required


-----

###### to fuel its sales is like being a blind tightrope walker on a windy day. It’s easy to stumble here, and we did. And we learned from our mistakes.
 One thing is very important: Critics will assemble around you and may get more vocal the more successful and visibly successful you become. I believe you have to listen to all voices—but unemotionally. You have to listen most to your actual customers’ voices. Ultimately, though, you must listen to your own voice.

## Adventures with Ad
 Agencies

###### by Jim Cavale


###### e all have an incident that we can recall as kids, where we were warned not to touch something, but yet as soon as we had the chance, we went and touched exactly what mom and dad said

# W

###### not to!
 You only have to read Dan Kennedy’s No B.S. Direct Marketing For Non-Direct Marketing Businesses one time to know that ad agencies don’t really understand direct-response marketing nor do they want to. The warning is clear.
 I remember bringing up the option of bringing in a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) or hiring an advertising agency at one of my Platinum Mastermind hot seat sessions, and Dan summed it up by saying, “Don’t bite


-----

###### the hand that has fed you.” That’s not the only time he has told us that we should never stop developing and overseeing the direct-response marketing strategies, since that is the basis for our success in the first place.
 Yet for some reason, Forrest and I still felt led to begin pursuing and interviewing advertising agencies, with aspirations for relief from our marketing duties so that we could focus heavily on all of the “more important stuff” that’s required to actually go out and franchise your brand. There’s a lot of operational work, like following the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) requirements for all new franchisor brands, such as creating our Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDD) and operations manual tools, let alone stepping up all of our systems and opening up more corporately owned gyms in the Birmingham market.
 Those things are vital, especially during the creation phase. But I am here to tell you that none of it matters if you lose control of your marketing, and essentially your brand. Which is exactly what we did when we tested out working with an ad agency early on.
 First, we set out on a six-month tour of multiple agencies who pitched our up-and-coming brand on how they could be the marketing solution for our expansion in Birmingham and beyond. It was quite interesting listening to the diverse feedback we were getting on what we had done to that point and how these potential ad agency partners felt like they could take it and not only improve it, but also scale it to multiple markets. It is flattering to be told good things about your brand, but also intimidating and troubling to hear a lot of criticism about how you are presenting that brand.
 We heard it all. From questions about the “nonexistent graphic design and layout” that they thought we desperately needed to improve, to concerns about “the amount of excessive copy that we had in our print ads and email templates.”
 There were even pitches that were self-eliminating, as several agencies felt like they didn’t want to step in and “mess up” what we had already established, even though they didn’t really understand why it worked.
 Either way, the search took six months because it was highly underwhelming. It felt wrong, but we still chose to give it the ole’ college try and test it out by choosing an agency that we assumed could actually learn our direct-response style and then help us continue to scale it.


-----

###### As we ran our test, we realized that Dan was exactly right; we couldn’t ever expect a marketing agency to understand our style of marketing enough to be able to improve upon it in an innovative way that could grow our brand into new markets. WE HAD TO DO IT OURSELVES.
 They didn’t embrace us, nor did they even read the Dan Kennedy tools that we put in their hands with hopes they’d become junkies just like us. However, like all tests, we learned a great deal from it, and honestly, it further emphasized the fact that we could indeed begin to combine the direct-response and branding strategies into a powerful hybrid far more valuable than either extreme could ever service on its own.


DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: There are three vital points made here by Jim that I
want to be absolutely certain aren’t missed. First, I resolutely teach there are two things never,
never, never to give up control over in your business: the checkbook and the marketing. It is
infinitely easier to replace yourself in technical and operational roles than in the driver’s seat
of your advertising and marketing. Whether you keep that a do-it-yourself effort, with a few
in-house staffers or a few outside freelancers, or you manage to pull off the feat they didn’t
and find an outside agency that understands or is willing to understand the unusual hybrid of
direct response and brand taught in this book, you must never abdicate authority. I was taught
early in my business life a simple truth: Two people cannot ride side by side on the same
horse. There can only be one person with the reins. That has to be you. That does not mean
you want obsequious yes-men and yes-women merely doing your bidding. It does mean when
you do consider ideas and input and arrive at your vision, your leadership decisions, and your
tactical plan for your marketing, your team makes it their business to understand it, embrace it,
and implement it.

Second, when you turn to outsiders for assistance with advertising and marketing, make
evidence of their understanding of, respect for, and preferably successful experience with
direct-response marketing a requirement. The advertising and marketing world’s population of
idea-rich theorists and outright nincompoops has expanded wildly in recent years as online
media has brought forward an array of _technicians (web designers, social media managers,_
blog writers, etc.) who grab the reins of marketing yet have no successful marketing or selling
experience. Beware them. A bricklayer is not an architect.

Third, last, do not underestimate yourself or undervalue your own knowledge of your business.
Just because someone has a trophy case of ad industry awards (from peers—not based on
clients’ profits), or two Ph.D.s from big-name universities, or big-name corporations as clients
does not mean his judgment is superior to yours about your brand, your customers, and your
marketing. You don’t want to be arrogant or close-minded, but you can’t let yourself be
intimidated or unduly influenced either. I have two key questions I like to use, that you might
appropriate, when there is an expert or a critic confronting me: 1) why do you believe I should
think differently about this? and 2) what facts do you have to support your position? Facts are


-----

important, and much harder to come by than opinions or criticism. I am willing to be
persuaded by facts. In a toss-up on competing, conflicting opinions about my business, I’ll
take mine.
