  What REALLY Leads To Success
        In America In The
        21st Century
  Relax! This is NOT going to be some gray-haired guy in a
  sweater lecturing you about how tough he had it growing
  up and telling you to "keep your nose to the grindstone."
 Who needs to hear any more of that?
  For starters, lets agree that we can disagree about what
  "success" is. It certainly means different things to different
  people. For one person, "success" may pop up pictures of
 a Corvette, a boat, a fancy house, maybe a business of
  your own, or a white collar, management career with a
  solid company, or all those things. For somebody else,
  just the thought of having to put on a shirt and tie and go
  to an office everyday is as frightening as a Stephen King
  novel. For somebody else, the emphasis may be on
  family, not money. So there's no point in trying to force fit
 any one idea of success onto you.
  However, we may be able to agree more easily on the
  opposites of success, on what we do NOT want our lives
  to become. For example, consider these checklist items:
    Not having enough money to pay bills
     Living paycheck to paycheck
   No money to save, invest, make a down-payment
    on a house

      Stuck in a dead-end job
      Passed over for raises or promotions
      Lack of job security
      Embarrassment when visiting your relatives
       or your spouse's relatives or in other social
       gatherings. . .embarrassment about your job
      Worry about the future in general
       Desire to do better but not sure what to do,
      what steps to take
      Lack of education or know-how about
      computers or other "technology" coming
       into your workplace
   Do ANY of these apply to you? Chances are, at least
    several do, just as they do to hundreds of thousands of
    other Americans, especially men and women in the 1 9 to
   30 age group. In fact, most people wind up going through
     their entire adult lives never solving any of these issues.
   They get stuck just "going with the flow."
   What we'd like to do here, in the beginning of this book,
      is to challenge you to take a completely fresh look at
   where you are, where you COULD go in life, where you'd
   LIKE to go in life, and how you can take control of that
    process.

  Change IS constant. Your physical body changes on a
  minute by minute, day by day, month by month, year by
  year basis. You know that you CAN exert considerable
  control over that, by, say, smoking or not smoking,
  exercising or not exercising, the foods you eat, and so on.
  Some people choose to do certain things deliberately, to
  control their weight, get and stay fit, and stay healthy.
  Others do not. But everybody changes physically.
  Change happens in every other aspect of living too, for
  everybody. Marriage. Divorce. Kids. Get a job. Lose a
  job. Buy a home. Move. Get older. Learn something
  new. Education. The list of changes is endless. You just
  cannot escape constant change. But you can make it
  work for you or let it work against you.
  You see, the biggest difference between farm animals
  and human beings is that we have the power of choice .
  The ability to make choices and decisions. Of all the
  creatures on earth, only human beings have been given
  this power. Will you use your power or ignore it? It may
  be time to STOP "going with the flow."
 "WHO — ME? CONTROL MY FUTURE! HOW?"
  Maybe you feel that you do not have the ability or
  opportunity to control your life and your future. These
  days, it seems everybody is a 'Victim." And in some
   circles, it's even popular to be "anti-achievement." You
   will undoubtedly hear people insisting that the deck is
  stacked against them to such a degree there's no point
   in trying to do anything. Or that "society" owes them a job

```

```
    remember, though, that every aspect of life operates on
   Cause And Effect — for every Effect or result or outcome,
    there is a Cause. 'Victim" thinking or "it's no use" thinking
   becomes a Cause in and of itself. What kind of Effect do
    you think it has to have?
   You may very well have some disadvantages to
    overcome. Maybe you grew up in a broken home or a
     terrible neighborhood. Maybe you were abused. Maybe
    you don't even have a high school education. Or maybe
    you don't read very well, can't do math, you're shy
    whatever. Each person's obstacles appear very large to
    them. But here are two absolutely inarguable truths :
      First, regardless of what your particular obstacles may be,
    there are many people who have had those exact same
    obstacles — or worse ones — who have overcome those
    obstacles to become successful in life. The fact that
    others have overcome your obstacles is proof positive
     that you can too.
    Second, if you continue to DO the things you've always
    done, you can only expect to get what you've always got.
    Whatever change happens, will work against you.
    Opportunities will pass you by. Only by first changing your
   own actions and behavior can you create other desirable
    changes in your life.
    So, lets talk about some of the very basic, fundamental
     things you can DO to get a grip on what kind of success
      in life you want and how you can go about getting it. We
      call these: THE FIVE ESSENTIAL FOUNDATIONS OF
   SUCCESS IN LIFE.

    'The Cheshire Cat in 'Alice In Wonderland'
  Foundation #1 is: Positive Directions . What does that
  mean? Well, first "direction" means where you are
  headed, where you are going, where you want to go.
  Here's a shocker: Most people spend more time planning
  a weekend activity with friends or a vacation than they do
  planning their futures! In fact, most people never really
  THINK about "directions" at all. One writer in the field of
  self-improvement once spent a whole morning on a busy
   city sidewalk, stopping people on their way to work, and
  asking them why they were going to wori<. Why are you
  going to wori< today? The answers he heard most were:
                * To put food on the table
                * To pay my bills
               * Because I have to
               * Everybody else does
  These are all terrible reasons for getting up every
  morning and going to work! Yes, terrible. Why terrible?
  Well, if one of the above is your only reason, how are you
  going to feel about your job and yourself after ten years
  of that? Twenty years? Thirty years? Probably pretty
  awful. You'll feel trapped. Bored. Wasted. Stuck in a rut
 — and the only difference between a rut and grave is the
   rut is open at both ends!
  Actually, going to wori< should be a means of accomplishing
  many other appealing, rewarding goals. Buying your

                                         limitation
  — re-building classic cars, fishing in all the great rivers and
     lakes throughout America, whatever. Developing a career.
   And so on. These are all "directions."
     "Positive directions" means choosing directions that are
    most likely to lead you to the kind of life and lifestyle you
     want.
    Just for example, one direction you could take is spending
       all your free time hanging out at the local pub, watching
     sports, playing pool, drinking beer, and spending all your
   money that way That is a "direction." It is going to take
    you toward a destination. It is a "cause" that will have a
     predictable "effect."
   OR, taking two nights a week of your free time' and using
    those to go to classes or seminars or the library to learn
   some new skill and setting aside even a small amount of
   money each paycheck, this too is a "direction." Which is
     "positive" and which is "negative"? Which is most likely to
    lead "somewhere," which most likely to lead "nowhere"?
     Weil, you certainly know that without being told! But what
    you may not have given a lot of thought to is the idea of
     sitting down and CHOOSING certain "destinations,"
     things you want to accomplish, things you want to have,
    and then DECIDING on certain positive directions most
      likely to lead there.
    You can do that.
    Regardless of where you are right now, you can start
    doing this.

  these onto bigger pieces of paper, on a pad or a
  notebook, or use these as is and write in the book. Either
  way, try something: lock out the world, get into a quiet,
   private place for an hour or so, no distractions, no TV, no
  CD player, just you and these pages. Put your pencil or
  pen in hand. Let your mind slip into gear. And, without
  being critical. . .without worrying about the "how to's". . .jot
  down the answers to the questions. Make the lists. You
  may find this to be a very exciting, if challenging
  experience.
   THERE IS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN
  EDUCATION AND INCOME, EDUCATION AND
     OPPORTUNITY IN AMERICA.
   YOU CANNOT "BEAT THIS SYSTEM."
  Foundation #2 is: Education . Certain things are "facts of
    life." The Law of Gravity, for example, is a fact of life. Any
  object you drop out of your hand will fall to the ground.
  What goes up must come down. You are actually a tiny
   bit shorter at the end of the day than you are each
  morning, after lying flat all night, as an effect of the Law
   of Gravity. And there is absolutely nothing you can do to
  change or "beat" this fact of life: gravity. Join a gang, get
  a gun, beat up somebody, the people who do these
  things canNOT escape this fact of life we call gravity. The
   richest men and women in the world canNOT escape this
   fact of life. The most talented athletes canNOT (Sure,
  Michael Jordan pushed the limits of gravity. But he could
   not escape it. His most spectacular leaps always ended
   with his feet coming back down to the floor.) A fact of life
    is a fact of life, period.

    these facts of life, but you are affected by them
    nonetheless. You can ignore them and you WILL suffer as
   a result. Or you can accept them and then change
    directions and do things to make these facts of life benefit
    you.
    Here are the facts:
    Fact#1 : Government studies and statistics clearly
    demonstrate that people with high school diplomas earn
    as much as $8.000.00 MORE per year than do people
    without high school diplomas. In a 40 year working career,
    $8,000.00 MORE per year equals $320.000.00[ .] .
   enough to pay off a home mortgage and buy a second
   home, too. . .enough to put into an investment and retire.
    Also, the number of good jobs that you just cannot get
    without a high school diploma keep increasing.
    Fact#2: Above a high school education, Career Training
   and a Career Diploma are known to make an income
    difference of ANOTHER $25.000.00 to $100.000.00 OR
   MORE over a person's working career.
    Fact#3: Above that, an Associate Degree is known to
    equate to about $10,000.00 a year more in income. . .as
   much as $400.000.00 over a working lifetime.
    To make this simple: more education equals more income
   and more varied career options and opportunities.
    Now, knowing these facts, if you do not have a high
    school diploma, what "direction" seems obvious to you as
    the most "positive direction" you could choose for
     yourself, as soon as possible?

```

```
  most "positive direction" you could choose for yourself, as
  soon as possible?
   Or, knowing these facts, if you have both a high school
  diploma and some specialized career training, what
   "direction" seems obvious to you as the most "positive
   direction" you could choose for yourself, as soon as
   possible?
  You can clearly see that
   getting a high school "If a man empties his
   diploma, then getting wallet into his head,
   career training, then no one can take it
   getting an associate from him."
  degree are all very, - Benjamin Franklin
   very positive directions.

  on this, see Chapter 7.
       IT IS DIFFICULT TO SOAR LIKE
    AN EAGLE IF YOU HANG OUT WITH
    THE BUZZARDS AND CHICKENS
         ALL THE TIME.
   Foundation #3 is: Association . There is a 'principle of
   success' called 'The Power Of Positive ASSOCIATION."
      It basically means that you either hold yourself back or
   improve yourself based on the people you hang out with
   the most, because their values, ideas and directions are
   always influencing your own.

```

```
   good relationship with your parents or parent, brothers
   and sisters, and your family life has included helpful
    values, then you DO have an advantage, there's no doubt
   about that — and you should value it and continue it. If
   you do not have this advantage, you will have to work
    harder on your own thinking, your own values and your
   own decisions.
   As we become adults, though, "peers" become just as
    important or more important than 'family" in this area of
    association. Surely you've heard about "peer pressure." It
   can be 'positive' or 'negative' — helpful in going in the
    directions you want to go or distracting from going in
   those directions. Here are very tough questions to ask
    yourself about the friends and other people you hang
   around with most and listen to most: Are these people
    going in the directions I want to go? Do they have ideas,
    experience and encouragement to share that can help
   me move in the directions I want to go?
        If you can't honestly answer "yes" to those questions, then
   you probably need to make some changes in your friends
  — who you spend time with, who you listen to. You may
   need to get involved in yery different activities, where you
     will get to meet new and different people.
   Everybody needs a "support group." Your "support group"
   can include family members, friends, neighbors, co-
    workers, a mentor on the job, teachers and coaches. It
   must feature people who share your directions or who
   have already traveled successfully in the directions you
   want to go.

     BASE SITTING ON THE BENCH.
    YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE GAME!
   Foundation #4 is: Beginning[ .] There is a certain process to
   success, an order of steps you have to go through, bases
  you have to run in order. And to begin, you have to get into
   the game. How do you get into the "game of success"?
     It all seems to start with Gainful Employment. A job. Even
      if it is not the job you want. Not the job you've prepared
    for. Not a job that seems like it naturally points toward the
   kind of job you want. Any job is better than no job.
  Employment is better than unemployment. The way you
   get into the game is with a job.
             When you go and apply for a
                     "better job," what will you be
    "Begin somewhere. asked about? Well, one set
   You cannot build a of questions will center
    reputation on what around your education. The
   you intend to do." next set of questions will
       - Liz Smith center around your work
    (Famous syndicated experience. And many smart
    newspaper gossip employers will be as
     columnist) interested in how you did
                 whatever job you had than
                what the job itself was.
  Comedian and movie-maker Woody Allen once said,
  "50% of success is showing up." He may not have been
   far off. One study of business managers, executives and

    every job applicant:
                      1. He shows up.
                 2. He shows up on time.
            3. He shows up ready and able to work.
    Well, ANY job gives you the opportunity to demonstrate
    these three things, and establish a reputation for these
    three things. If you ARE cun-ently gainfully employed,
    don't make the mistake of drifting into negative thinking
    about that job. . .of just going through the motions or
    worse, failing to show up, show up on time, show up
    ready and able to wori<. The best way to get a better job
      is to out-perfomn the one you have! If you are not now
    employed, re-think your position on this. Maybe it would
    be better to get in the game with ANY job than to sit on the
    sidelines waiting for the right job.
   "SCHOOL IS NEVER OUT FOR THE PRO."
                      - Cavett Robert
    Foundation #5 is: Lifelong Learning[ .] Many people have
    the idea that once they graduate from high school, they
    can "stop learning." No more school books. No more
     study. This is reflected in the fact that the majority of adults
    get ALL their news and information from television (not
     reading), that the majority of adults NEVER visit the public
      library, and about half of all adults NEVER go into a
    bookstore. Unfortunately, many people have learned how
     to be taught, but have not learned to enjoy learning on
     their own.
