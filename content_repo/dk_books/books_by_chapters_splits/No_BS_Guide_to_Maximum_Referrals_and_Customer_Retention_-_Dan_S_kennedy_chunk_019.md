#### Everyone Wants Referrals, But No One Has a System to Get
 Them
##### Over my entrepreneurial career, I have tried a number of different types of businesses. One business I owned was a direct-mail marketing company called Our Town, which mailed coupons from local businesses to people

##### who had just moved into the area. I had a lot of success with Our Town, selling to 100 new clients in less than 90 days.
 The primary sales method had me literally going business to business, selling. The way it worked is I had two part-time appointment setters who would make phone calls and arrange appointments for me. I would go business to business all day and meet with people. Although I sold to a number of people, I had a larger number of people take the appointment, meet with me, and then tell me that they didn’t need to advertise because they got most of their new business from referrals. This often confused me because over two-thirds of the time, I was sitting in a store or office building that had no customers in it. Where were all those referred customers hiding?
 Out of frustration, I started to push back a bit when that objection came up, and I would say, “That’s great—what are you doing to generate all of those referrals?” Do you know what the number-one answer was? “We do nothing. People just love us.” I found that hard to believe, especially when most of the time, I was sitting in an empty store. Often, the owner would spend time telling me about why they were the best pizza place on the planet or how they provided the best widget, etc. I am about to share a big secret with you: It doesn’t matter. Everyone knows a better place to get pizza than Domino’s, but in 2014, they had sales of $3.8 billion. If literally everyone in America can name a better pizza joint, why did this chain have $3.8 billion in sales? Having the best product just isn’t good enough. Thinking you get all or most of the referrals you could just by “being good” is pure fallacy and fantasy.
 The second most common answer I got to my question about how these businesses were getting referrals was, “I ask for them.” It was almost laughable. When I got this answer, I was always confused. Why did this business owner take an appointment with me—knowing I was going to be coming in to pitch some kind of advertising—if they had all the business and referrals they could handle? Think about it: How often last week, in all the places you went and spent money, with all the different people you spent money with, were you asked for referrals? Who’s kidding who?
 In reality, 99% of these people were full of b.s., but it wasn’t because they weren’t following a widely held idea. The most common advice given about how to get more referrals in your business is to have a great product

##### or service and ask for the referral. Asking does work, but most people are uncomfortable with doing it and never do it regularly.
 According to the book Referral Engine by John Jantsch, 79.9% of business owners and sales professionals surveyed admit to having no system for getting referrals. I suspect if we dug deeper into the 20.1% who say they have a system, we would find some kidding themselves or outright lying to sound good, and others with some methods undeserving of the term “system.”

#### What a Common Referral “System” Looks Like
##### 1. Send in your friends and family and we’ll give you $25 in cash 2. Send in your friends and family and we’ll give both of you $25 in
 cash 3. Send us a referral and you’ll be entered to win a new iPad 4. Send us a referral and you’ll get a FREE iPad

 These promotions are better than doing nothing. They do work, but they are not a system by any stretch of definition and have serious flaws.
 The main problem with these offers is that you are putting 100% of the work and risk on your customer, and asking too much of the customer. If we were to read between the lines of these offers, they would say this:

 Mr. Client, please go and tell all your friends and family members about us, and if any of them decide to come in and give us money, we will toss you (and maybe them) a token gift. If they don’t give us any money or they don’t call because you simply don’t have enough influence, you get nothing. By the way, please try and send us good customers, not slugs. And be sure to tell our sales story well.

 Is that reasonable? That is the first hurdle you have to overcome—you’re asking a lot, giving comparatively little, and for some people making the whole thing a little unseemly. The second hurdle is that just because your client likes you and your business, that doesn’t mean their friend or family member will like


-----

##### you. So your client is trying to decide whether or not they should put their neck on the line, and they hope that you do a good job for the person they referred because everyone knows that if you don’t, the client is going to hear about this bad experience on every holiday for the next seven years. The person referring takes on a lot of risk.
 None of that sounds pleasant, nor is it natural. Personally, I don’t work for free, so unless someone makes a specific request or comment that would naturally elicit a recommendation of a business, I don’t run around singing the praises of every business I come across. The same is likely true for your customers. If they’re going to refer your business, they’re going to do it when it’s natural for them to do so, not the moment they’re being bribed with an iPad. Which is that link between retention and referrals again rearing its head.
 Furthermore, even when someone does make a comment that would normally elicit a referral response, if I have any reason to believe that my referral could cause additional work or grief on my part, I pass on giving it out. That means you have to make it easy for your customer to refer. You have to facilitate referrals. Not just hope or ask for them.

#### Give First, Then Receive: The Best Way to Get More Referrals
##### We need to make the process of referring easier, both for the person giving the referral and for the person acting on the referral.
 One of the best ways to do this is to offer information that your customer or referral partner can give out, that allows you to control the story being told about you while being helpful to the person receiving the information.
 Many times this information comes in the form of a free report, white paper, or even a book. Information is much more interesting than a sales presentation to the average person. Customers are far more willing to give their friends information, or send them somewhere like a website to get information, than they are to directly push a friend to call you or to go to your place of business. People are more receptive to being given or told about information than they are when being pushed to do business with you.


-----

##### And, people are more likely to act on information because they perceive it to be nonthreatening.
 A few of my favorite examples of this come from a friend of mine, personal injury attorney Ben Glass. Here are the titles of a few of his free reports and books that are available to help his customers refer:

 • Get It Settled—The Accident Victim’s Guide to Settling Your Case
 Without Hiring a Lawyer
 • Why Most Medical Malpractice Victims Never Recover a Dime
 • Five Deadly Sins That Can Wreck Your Injury Claim

 When you look at the titles of these reports, you can see genius at work. All of these reports answer questions or handle concerns for people who may need the services of a personal injury attorney. They also make it super easy for his clients to refer. In times of need or when a suitable conversation occurs, Ben’s client says, “You should get the free report about winning medical lawsuits” and never has to say “You should call my attorney.” The latter gets responses the client can’t handle: I’ve already got an attorney. I’m not sure I want an attorney. My brother-in-law says. Where is he?—oh, gee, all the way across town. The first gets: Well, okay, here, type the website address into my phone.
 Here’s how a conversation like this goes when there’s information to refer someone to, instead of just a service provider:

 Referrer: “I am so sorry to hear about your car accident. Are you doing okay?”

 Referral: “I hurt a lot, and so does my wallet. The car accident didn’t
 kill me, but these medical bills might.”

 Referrer: “You should check out this free book my lawyer wrote called, ‘Get It Settled.’ It’s all about settling your car accident case without a lawyer. His website is www.benglasslaw.com.”


-----

##### Referral: “Thanks! I’m going to check that out because I need to do
 something about these bills.”

 That is a much easier and more pleasant conversation for both people involved, and best of all, we have bridged the gap, allowing the person being referred to take an easy step toward possibly doing business with Ben and his firm.
 Ben and his firm are also way ahead of the game. They have now identified a person who likely has been in a car accident. They have used a lead capture software like Infusionsoft to capture the contact details of the referral before sending out the free book. Collecting this data and having a software system that automates multistep, multimedia communication gives them the ability to follow up, and the book gives them the ability to educate and presell to the person who has been referred before they ever even consider making an appointment.
 Done correctly, this can weed out bad prospects and can give good prospects the comfort level they need to take the next step and make an appointment.
 One of Ben’s more advanced strategies is to provide information to people who think settling their case on their own and saving money on fees charged by a law firm is in their best interest. Inside the book, Ben is helpful and gives great advice on how to settle your own case, but he also educates the reader and potential client about when it would be in their best interest to hire a lawyer. Ben can also use this book as a way to help a prospect who calls the practice with a case that is just too small for his firm.
 Another friend of mine sells inbound marketing services for businesses. He wrote a book on the topic and offers it for free to referrals. He also created a simple landing page that he asks his clients to send referrals to. You can see the page at http://info.inboundsystems.com/inbound- marketing-book. As of the writing of this book, he was getting a 70.7% opt- in rate for the referrals that hit that page.
 Another example of this can be found at my website, www.TheNewsletterPro.com. On the main page, you’ll find an offer for my book on newsletter marketing. This book is on a very narrow topic. We only get requests from people who genuinely want to know more about newsletters and how newsletters work to increase customer retention and


-----

##### referrals—our target client. Another benefit the book provides us with is that we know we need to educate people on newsletters, and a book gives us the opportunity to do just that. We have found an educated customer buys sooner and sticks with us for the long term, so providing the definitive book on using newsletters to grow and market your business and then giving it away for free is a no-brainer, as it is for both of the other companies mentioned in this chapter.
 In the case of GKIC, the entrepreneurs’ organization founded by Dan Kennedy, its initial information offer carries a tiny shipping and handling charge, as a means of weeding out the least interested, but it is presented as and fundamentally is “The Most Incredible Free Gift Offer,” and contains over $600.00 in resources. This gives GKIC Members an easy way to refer, and huge numbers do. It’s available to you, too, on page 182.
 If you aren’t a GKIC Member, you should grab this not just because it brings you a plethora of helpful resources and business tools, and hooks you up with the leading association of marketing-oriented entrepreneurs in the world, but also to see and experience their business model: what they deliver in that free offer, how, when, and what they do for, with, and to that brand-new customer in the first days and weeks of the relationship.
 EVERY KIND OF business can and should create some sort of free report, book, CD, DVD, “most incredible free gift,” or trial offer that they can promote but, more importantly, makes it easy for their customers to refer to.

#### Dollars and Cents of Referral Marketing
##### The investment in creation, production, and distribution of these “information packages” stops some business owners cold and at least disturbs others. They see added costs and a delaying of the sale. I see investment (not cost) in starting a potential relationship with an appreciative, informed, and respectful potential client or customer. I also know the actual selling will be more successful and efficient, with less waste of my time or my sales team’s time, by having pre-educated the customer. There is money involved here, but there is also money being saved here, directly and in time, in not having to work with and follow up


-----

##### on unqualified, unconverted prospects. Those who do become customers do so more confidently, so you can sell at premium prices and be more of a trusted advisor, not just another salesman. For a lot more about that, you should read Dan’s book No B.S. Trust-Based Marketing.
 In the case of referrals, when you are giving away an “information package,” it is typically given away at no charge, even if you are sending a physical book, the way Ben Glass and I do. This includes any and all shipping fees. This is usually true of multimedia packages as well, with a book, other literature, and a DVD—just like you see advertised on TV by companies like Sun-Setter Awnings, Sleep Number Beds, the reverse mortgage companies, Fisher Investments, and many other direct marketers. They may easily be investing $10.00 on each one sent out the door and be sending thousands to tens of thousands of them out every week.
 That leads us to an important question: How much should you spend to get a referral? I always answer that question with a question. What are you paying to get a new customer now? Unfortunately, many don’t know the answer to my question, but when they do, my answer is always at least that much per new referral. Often, people don’t like my answer because they feel entitled to referrals, as if customers should simply be providing the company with referrals for free. Sure, you might provide a good service or have a cool widget, but that is not the world we live in, although many business owners still feel it should work that way. Make no mistake, having a systematic way to get referrals into your business is an investment, and one that will require the proper care and feeding of both time and money for you to get a return.
 An easy case can actually be made that you should cheerfully spend more money on referrals than on a cold customer off the street. Referrals are better customers in every way. A referral converts to a customer at a faster pace, spends more as a customer with much less price resistance, and does these things with much less shopping of your competition. Referrals usually have an increased lifetime value, and, the best part is, they are preconditioned to refer others because that is how they came to your business. If all of that wasn’t enough, as a bonus, your original customer who made the referral is more committed to your business, and their lifetime value goes up as well. All of this entitles you to spend at least as much as you would on a referral as you would to get a cold customer in the

##### front door. The most sophisticated entrepreneur will cheerfully pay more for a referral.
 When Dan read the first draft of my chapters, he circled the above paragraph and marked it as “possibly the most important paragraph in the whole book.” I guess you might want to stop here long enough to re-read it and think about it. Maybe photocopy it and stick it up somewhere. And you really should develop a number—what will you invest to get a referral?
