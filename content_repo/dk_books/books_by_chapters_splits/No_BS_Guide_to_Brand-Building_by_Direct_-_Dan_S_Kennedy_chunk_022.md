###### release and, at the same time, keeps your brand top-of-the-mind with your public.
 Post-PR is what you do after something happens. Let’s go back to that Good Morning America interview; even though it may have been over in a few minutes, you can make it last forever with post-PR by putting out a press release about the interview, sharing some of the content, and, in the online press release, including a link to a clip of the interview on the network website, YouTube, or wherever it happens to land.
 PR exists to amplify your StorySelling[™]. Let’s say your company just sold its one millionth widget—why not announce that fact? It shows your business is very established and very successful. Press releases boost awareness and continue to build positive word-of-mouth about your company. And, if that press release hits the right place at the right time, it could land you a story in the newspaper, in a magazine, on a local radio or TV station, or on an online site—even a national one. It can also get you invited on radio and TV interview shows to talk about that special millionth widget.
 Most importantly, online press releases, the kind we like to focus on, show up heavily in search engine results. So, if potential customers or clients Google your name or the name of your company, the first impression they’ll get is going to be a favorable one. Instead of just coming up with your website or your LinkedIn profile, you’ll have people reacting by saying, “Hey—this guy sold a million of his widgets and was on Good Morning America—he’s the real deal!” Online press releases significantly boost your internet presence and, because they’re written in the third person, also act as powerful online testimonials to anyone Googling you or your business. They appear to be a normal news story to the average reader.
 The right PR could nab you special media appearances, lead to other news stories, and drive more traffic to your website. The main cost comes from hiring a PR company to help you make all of that happen. But, unless you have a legitimate story that really does stand out, that PR firm might be hard-pressed to get you much of an afterlife beyond that initial press release.
 As a matter of fact, that’s one of the biggest mistakes we see companies make—hiring PR firms when they don’t have the marketing or media to

###### back it up. When you try to get PR without a story big enough to catch people’s attention . . . well, let’s get back to that tree falling in the forest fable. In this case, there are people around to hear it—but nobody really bothers to listen. That’s why, again, we swear by the Business Trifecta.
 But hang on for more about how that works . . . after we explain the third and final member of that trio . . .

##### Successful Use of MARKETING

###### Marketing, of course, is how you drive revenue for your brand. It’s how you actually promote your products and/or services to your public.
 And let’s spend a moment and talk about that public. Have you taken the time to actually narrow down your main niche when it comes to your most likely customers? It’s always the most cost-effective if you can zoom in on a small group that is most disposed to clamor for what you’re selling. You can truly mine “riches from niches”—because you can market more aggressively, more often, and more effectively to a smaller and more receptive crowd.
 Many marketers often make the big mistake of trying to sell to too many people at once—which rapidly drains your marketing budget. At the same time, you don’t realize as much revenue from your marketing because you’re trying to sell to a lot of people who probably don’t want what you’re offering in the first place. That’s why, especially when you’re starting out, you want to determine your best target group for marketing and focus your efforts on them.
 It is also easier to achieve brand recognition in a small pond than a large ocean, particularly when you and the brand you’re trying to build has great relevance and significance to the particular fish in that pond. Dan Kennedy calls this Message-to-Market Match, and it links to Brand-to-Market Match.
 The purpose of your marketing, of course, can be multifaceted. You may want to drive people to your website . . . and then, have your website convince them to leave their contact info . . . and then, generate an email sequence designed to get them to buy. Or you may want a simple, targeted campaign with just one end result in mind—a simple sales letter designed to get people to buy your product, for example.

###### As this entire book advises and demonstrates, the use of direct-response advertising and marketing is the clearer, cleaner, shorter path to revenue than other approaches, and it can build your brand right along with generating leads, converting them to customers, and putting money in the bank.
 With any approach, it’s always hard to make a sale “cold”—without having already established yourself with the prospect in question. Which is why we believe you need to employ . . .

##### A Fully Integrated Approach

###### If you examine the art of storytelling, you’ll find that stories don’t work without a setup. You need to know the people involved, their situation, and whatever challenge they have to face. That setup could be as short as a line in a simple joke (“A guy walks into a bar . . .)—or as long as a few hundred pages in the beginning of an old Russian novel. But unless you understand what the story is about, unless the setup explains the basic facts to you, the plot, and most importantly, the ending won’t make any sense. Imagine only seeing the last 20 minutes of Star Wars—“Wait, what was that Death Star thing? Who’s that girl with the weird hair?”—you’d think you saw some cool special effects but would have no idea why any of them mattered.
 Sales are the end game to your brand and your business, which is why most entrepreneurs emphasize marketing so much; to them, that’s the quickest way to those all-important sales and ongoing success.
 BUT . . . unless you prepare your audience and unless you give them the crucial “setup” beforehand, it’s going to be hard to make those sales happen. Unless they know who you are and trust in what you do and sell, they’re not likely to give you their credit card numbers.
 It’s why chain stores and restaurants tend to do so well; customers know what to expect from them and understand that a certain standard of quality is in place. The setup has already been provided by their mass marketing, as well as the public’s previous experience patronizing their various locations.
 You, however, don’t have the instant recognition and trust that a Home Depot or a Walmart triggers with a glance at their logo. That’s why the Business Trifecta is so important to implement—because it’s designed to do


-----

###### the setup that provides recognition and trust before you make a direct sales pitch.
 Here’s how it works. The Business Trifecta begins with creating effective media, as we’ve discussed. One of the ways we do that for our clients is by producing a great, high-quality hardcover book that’s got an attractive, eye-catching cover, powerful overall theme, and the participation of a lot of great authors. Those authors usually only have to worry about contributing a chapter rather than generating an entire book—making it much easier on their end. They still get credit for authoring the book, however, and can order special customized copies of the book with their picture on the cover. Still another way is to create a polished branded film that uses StorySelling™ to focus on a business, entrepreneur, or professional. By structuring the content of the film correctly and telling the right story, you can create a movie that people will respond to on a positive and emotional level.
 Whatever media is decided upon (and, obviously, a multimedia approach can be incredibly effective), it should have a high impact factor. For example, we ensure that our books are bestsellers and our branded films have high production values.
 Because the created media does have that high impact factor, we can move on to the next member of our Trifecta—PR. High-profile media makes a great story for PR. Participation in one of our books, for example, means you can benefit from the pre-PR and post-PR we discussed earlier. For example, one press release would focus on you signing with our publishing arm for a book deal and another one would announce that your book reached bestseller status. You can also obviously do PR about a branded film being released (you can even host a premiere of the film at a local theater).
 The real value of PR is that it makes your media live forever. Your press releases stay online and continue to show up in Google results—even though your media may have been released months or even years ago.
 Which brings us back to our third member of the Trifecta—marketing. Because you have the media in place and you’ve done the PR about the media, you’ve generated a lot of substantial “setup” about you and your business—and you can now use that setup to finish your StorySelling™ and


-----

###### actually pitch your products and services. Your PR and media efforts are already there to establish your credibility and visibility. Not many people have written books or starred in movies. That’s impressive, and it says something about who you are and what your level of expertise is.
 And it gives you a much better shot at convincing someone to buy from you.
 Let’s face it. It’s easier now than at any time to market, thanks to the internet. That’s why, more than at any other time, we all need to find a way to differentiate ourselves from the rest of the pack.
 The Business Trifecta does just that. Media feeds into PR, which feeds into marketing. All three components create a powerful machine that ends up driving more and more revenue. Each makes the other more effective than it otherwise would have been.
 Which brings us to the magic ingredient of our special formula . . .

##### Melding Media

###### What we left out of our discussion of media earlier in this chapter is the fact that there are two kinds of media.
 Mass media is the type most people know about. We’re talking about commercial TV networks, national magazines, radio stations, etc. that are operated specifically to bring in consumers of all stripes. Mass media is about numbers—they want to attract the most users, so they can’t really mess around. They must produce content that’s genuine and interesting to the most people or they lose money.
 All of us put the “mass” into mass media—we seek it out every day by watching our favorite shows, reading our favorite newspapers, listening to our favorite music, and so forth. And because it has no other visible agenda than to entertain and inform the most people, mass media automatically brings two things to the table—awareness and credibility. If there’s a story about you on CNN, people 1) see it and 2) think more of you because of it. (Unless, of course, you just murdered somebody or something, but we won’t get into that here!)
 This is why people hire PR companies—to get them on mass media outlets. The problem is, you can’t “eat” awareness and credibility—in other


-----

###### words, if there isn’t a direct solicitation involved with a mass media appearance, it’s not really a big revenue generator. And chances are, if you did score an interview with Good Morning America, they’re not going to let you sell your stuff while you’re sitting there chatting it up with the host.
 Now, let’s talk about the second kind of media, known as “direct media.” Most of you have created something in this arena—it’s a targeted informational sales tool that takes the form of a CD, DVD, newsletter, direct-mail piece, website copy, etc. The business distributes this direct media to an audience it selects (or in most cases the audience has identified itself by “opting in” on its website) with the sole purpose of selling to that audience—and it’s created by that business for that specific purpose.
 The problem? As we’ve already hinted at, direct media lacks credibility. There’s a reason direct-mail campaigns only have an average response rate of from a fraction of 1% to no more than 3%. Whenever anyone knows that a business is directly trying to sell to them, they immediately put up their guard and get suspicious. They don’t know if what the sales piece is telling them is true because they know that the company is mainly interested in their money.
 One way around this credibility gap is to use testimonials, product reviews, and other third-party verification that appears objective. But there’s still another way around it that works just as well, if not better . . . and that’s melding both kinds of media—mass media and direct media— into one.
 Go to our website at www.celebritybrandingagency.com. You’ll see, near the top of the home page, “AS SEEN IN . . .” followed by a line of instantly recognizable logos of leading media outlets. We don’t put those logos there to brag and be obnoxious—we do it because it’s a vital part of our marketing philosophy. When someone comes to check out our website, we want them to see that powerful lineup—and to immediately understand that we’re established professionals who work with some of the biggest media companies in the world.
 And we want our clients to have the same advantage—which is why we advocate placing them in such publications as USA Today or on such networks as CNN. When you can talk about those kinds of mass media appearances in your direct media, that direct media suddenly has an awesome level of credibility it would otherwise be lacking. If someone sees


-----

###### national media logos on your direct-mail marketing piece, again, you’re suddenly elevated in their eyes to a national expert (which you may already be—but might have a hard time convincing a stranger of that fact).
 Whenever you’re able to be a part of the mass media conversation, you should always leverage it to your maximum marketing advantage. Say you managed to get a spot on CNBC talking about your business. You trumpet that fact on your website, your newsletter, your e-zine, whatever direct media piece you create. That mass media “stamp of approval” can mean the world to a potential customer.
 Even better is if you post a copy of that appearance on your website, or put a copy of your newspaper article into a direct-mail piece. We even hang ours up on our office walls—and our clients will invariably comment on them, which inevitably leads to us telling those clients how they can get the same coverage for themselves.
 So ask yourself—don’t you think that kind of mass media “stamp of approval” will get you taken a little bit more seriously? We can tell you, based on literally hundreds of case studies, it absolutely will get people to pay closer attention to you and what you have to offer.
 So get yourself some mass media credibility—and insert it into your direct media. Don’t spend all your time and money trying to get on TV or in the paper without having a plan for using that mass media exposure in conjunction with direct media for your marketing.
 When you successfully combine media, marketing, and PR, you guarantee yourself business growth and increased revenues. Correctly using the Business Trifecta raises your enterprise to the next level—and trust us, you’ll enjoy the view from up there!
