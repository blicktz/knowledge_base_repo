Entrepreneurs make lousy managers and administrators
because too much of that work is routine.

This tells you a lot about what you must do in order to
achieve maximum success, derive maximum value from your
time, and lead the happiest possible life: you must systematically,
aggressively divest yourself of those activities you do not do
well, do not do happily, or find routine, so as to systematically
invest your time (and talent, knowledge, know-how, and other
resources) in those things you do extraordinarily well, enjoy
doing, and find intellectually stimulating.

I have just described for you a formula for peak personal productivity, as a specialist. And you ought to note that, in every
field of enterprise, specialists outearn generalists ten to one.
Heart surgeons vs. M.D.s. Sophisticated database computer program developers vs. programmers. Nuclear waste disposal
experts vs. garbage men. And so on.

But having said that, how do we make that happen? How do
we get there? It certainly is easier said than done. But you can
start moving in this direction today, step by step, just as I have.

###### "We're Overpaying Him, but He's Worth It"
The movie magnate Samuel Goldwyn, famous for butchering the
language, said that. Actually, your business is overpaying you for
some of the jobs you do and grossly underpaying you for others.

**_Step One: Honest Self-Analysis and Self-Understanding_**
The typical entrepreneur—myself included—believes, no, knows,
absolutely knows that he can do anything and everything,
because, at some point in time, we have had to. However, even

NO B.S. **Time Management for Entrepreneurs** _ft_ 105

though I can do it all, truth is, there are only a few things I do so
extraordinarily well that—even if given all the money in the world—I
wouldn't hire anybody else to do them. There are only
a few things I do better than anybody else on the planet. Truth be
told, you have only a few things in that category too. Then, you
and I have another couple of handfuls of things we do well, better than most, but cannot be considered our "specialties." And
there are any number of things you and I do that we do out of
necessity, don't do very well, but do them anyway.

If you're honest with yourself, you can create these three lists.
(And it's a very productive exercise to sit down alone and make
these three lists.) "Delegate

###### or Stagnate"

**_Step Two: Delegation_**
Of course, delegating is as hard for entrepreneurs as telling the
truth is for politicians. It's downright unnatural. Why? Habit, for
one thing. We create our businesses from scratch, do it all, develop
a way of doing things that we believe in, and find that habit is
hard to break. No one is ever going to do things exactly the same
way we do them.

Jay Van Andel, co-founder of the giant Amway Corporation
impressed me many years ago with a speech titled, "Delegate or
Stagnate." Of course, the entire Amway system is based on multiplication of effort; one person learning a set of skills, then duplicating himself over and over again. And Jay and his partner, Rich DeVos,

had a business that grew like topsy. In order to stay ahead
of it, they constantly delegated and—ultimately—replaced themselves over and over again, which we'll get to in a minute. What

we _ft_ **NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

Jay made very clear to me is that the only way to advance in any
business is to keep delegating.

THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO BE RIGHT
Brendan Suhr, the assistant head coach of the Detroit Pistons during their championship years in the 1980s, said to me: "Do you
know how many head coaches there are in the NBA? Well, there
are at least that many different ways to be right, because every
one of these coaches does things differently, yet they all represent
the top Xo% of the coaching profession. There are 1,000 guys
who'd like every one of these jobs. There are at least 100 guys
who'd be good candidates for every one of these jobs. So these
head coaches all do it "right," yet they all do it differently." His
point is valid.

You cannot delegate if you believe there's only one way to
get things done right.

OFTEN, GOOD ENOUGH IS GOOD ENOUGH
Let me give you an example: I used to have a business associate,
a key person in my company, a $100,000.00 a year guy—whose
time had to be worth more than $250.00 an hour. It so happened
he had a fetish about how boxes were packed. When we were
leaving for a week-long series of seminars, instead of attending
to any number of important responsibilities, he'd be back in the
shipping department for hours, doing the job of the $10.00 an
hour shipping clerk. I've got to admit that he packed a wicked
box. I mean, this guy's boxes were works of art. They were very,
very carefully packed, firm to the top and the corners, so that no
corner crumpled in. The tape was perfectly straight. The bottom
and sides were taped just as perfectly as the top. Every label was

guy—whose

on straight. However, in the many years since he has been gone,
our shipping clerks shipped thousands of cartons to my seminar
sites. Not packed quite as well. Corners crumpled a little bit now
and again. Tape crooked. Labels cockeyed. But every one of these
boxes got there. The product was fine. The result was the same.
Good enough is good enough.

Many, many things can be delegated to people who will not
do them the way you would, won't do them as perfectly as you
would, but will wind up with the same result. Every one of these
things should be delegated. In fact, you MUST delegate. You cannot move ahead without jettisoning some responsibilities and
tasks in order to make room for new, more valuable tasks and
responsibilities.

And I'm not necessarily talking about creating a giant managerial bureaucracy. Today, you can delegate to independent
contractors, freelancers, and vendors, too. Outsourcing is the
buzzword of the day, with good reason. Also, if you have anybody around you with intelligence and talent, you must keep
giving them new, more important responsibilities and getting
them to delegate.

**_Mastering_** **_Delegation_**
You MUST master this difficult skill. To delegate effectively,
here's the seven-step process.

1. Define what is to be done.
2. Be certain the delegatee understands what is to be done.
3. Explain why it is to be done as you are prescribing it to be
done.
4. Teach how it is to be done without micro-micro-managing.
5. Be sure the delegatee understands the how-to process.
6. Set the deadline for completion or progress report.
7. Be sure you have agreement to the date or time and
method.

y the way, resisting the temptation to micro
manage will require plenty of willpower. One of a num
ber of reasons I stayed out of my business offices and

worked at home as much as possible was because

when I went to the office, I was "drawn" to listen in on,

interfere with, or critique every phone call, look at every

fax, poke my nose all the way into everything—to the

extent that I ruined everybody else's productivity as

well as my own. Today, I am never there. In fact, I am

most often in a home office at the opposite end of the

country from the office where my sole staffperson does

everything.

This is not rocket science. But it takes very deliberate
patience. It even takes time. But investing time in getting good at
this and getting people around you who respond to it is the only
way to get time freed up to do more valuable things yourself.

###### Going Beyond Delegation
And, as difficult as all this is, it's just the beginning. The real, big,
blockbuster secret of entrepreneurial success and happiness goes
beyond delegation to replacement.

**_Step Three: Replacing Yourself_**
My Platinum Member Rory Fatt, president of Restaurant
Marketing Systems, exhorts the thousands of restaurant owners
he advises: "Fire yourself! You'll make more money and have
more fun." The disease exists in every industry, but Rory says it's
epidemic and endemic in restaurants—owners terminally inflicted
with the belief that they must be the one making the sauce, greeting the guests at the door, doing the inventory. They are so busy
doing the $10.00-an-hour jobs, they never get to do the $100.00an-hour job: marketing to bring in new customers, and to keep
customers coming back. Rory says you can hire just about anybody to wash glasses, and there are a lot of people you can hire
to make the sauce, but there's hardly anybody you can hire to
effectively market and promote the restaurant.

###### "They Gave Me a Lifetime Contract, Then They Pronounced Me Legally Dead"
I agree with Rory—most business owners need to fire themselves
from a lot of those $10.00-an-hour jobs. The late college basket

ball coach Jim Valvano wrote a book long before his death from
cancer with the above title as a sardonic poke at his field. It's said
there are only three kinds of coaches: those just getting hired,
those just fired, and those soon to be fired. Jimmy Johnson took
the Dallas Cowboys to two Super Bowls in a row, then was fired.
Nobody, and I mean nobody is indispensable. The day Johnny
Carson retired, the entire country wondered if the Tonight Show
would soon die. So did NBC. But we have become loyal to Jay
Leno, and a whole lot of people might not recognize Johnny
Carson if they bumped into him on the street. Jack Paar couldn't
even get onto the studio property without an ID card.

**_Step Four:_** **_Welcoming Your Dispensability_**
Most people do not like the idea of dispensability. The entrepreneur on vacation is schizophrenic: hoping everything's OK at the
office but disappointed when he calls in and finds out everything
**_is OK at the office. How can things be running smoothly without_**
him? I'm going to try and sell you on welcoming your own dispensability.

Entrepreneurs grow in experience and expertise very quickly.
Fast learners. You will probably master entire "chunks" of a business in a matter of months, yet you may continue doing those
same functions for years. This will lead to stagnation and unhappiness. You may even wind up ineffectively doing things you
could do well just out of boredom. The ultimate answer is
replacement. That is, you replace yourself and step up to a new
set of opportunities and responsibilities. You groom someone to
take your place.

Note that this is the opposite of executive behavior in a corporate bureaucracy. In that environment, the executive is desperately

CHAPTER 10 / FIRE YOURSELF, REPLACE YOURSELF, MAKE MORE MONEY, AND HAVE MORE FUN

-----

**B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs** _ft in_

afraid of the up-and-comers who would take over his job. The
executive is determined to protect his turf. Through secrecy,
deliberate confusion, corporate politics, and every other imaginable method, the executive tries to make himself indispensable.
The super-savvy entrepreneur does the opposite and tries to
make himself dispensable.

I have gone through many different scenarios in my business
life. I had 42 employees; then for quite a while five; now only
one. I have delegated a lot, I've delegated almost nothing, and
done everything myself. I confess I am still guilty of doing some
menial tasks myself rather than supervise anyone. Beginning in 1999,1

aggressively switched from delegation to replacement of
a sort. I sold my information products business then. In 2003, I
sold my newsletter business. I've arrived at what I call my "Dan
as Center of Universe Strategy": me in the middle and satellite
businesses owned and managed by others all based on me, my
writings, my other content, all paying me. Right now, there are
four such satellites.

A good question to consider is, what plan you are working
on to reduce your business' and income's dependency on your
own time and effort?

###### What to Do with the Time You Liberate
One thing you can do is enjoy the success you create. Golf, buy
racehorses and hang out at the track (a passion of mine), write,
get involved in community service or politics, whatever.

If you're looking for the answer that turns your time into the
most money and wealth possible, then turn your attention to
marketing. Get free of as many other aspects of your business as

you can, get passionately interested in and good at marketing,
and invest your time there. Why? Because it is infinitely easier to
find or train someone to take care of a business' operations than
it is to get someone to do its marketing. Marketing is the highestpaid profession and most valuable part of a business. The person
who can create systems for acquiring customers, clients, or
patients effectively and profitably is the "money person." He is
the equivalent of a "high impact" or "franchise" player in sports.

Let me give you a quick example: a big publisher of a variety
of different newsletters, on average, hires and pays only four or
five professional copywriters each year to write the sales letters
that acquire new subscribers for those newsletters. The copywriter who can create a successful sales letter for this company
will rarely be paid less than $250,000.00 in a year, in fees and roy-alties—for

writing just one letter! Find me any other kind of
writer who can command $250,000.00 for eight pages. You can't
find a novelist. A screenwriter. A technical writer. A journalist.
No one gets $250,000.00 for eight pages.

In my book Make Millions with Your Ideas (Plume/Dutton), I
tell the story of the turnaround of the now-famous Thighmaster

dollars success. The person who figured out the three "little"
things to do to "fix" that product's marketing (described in my
book) received millions of dollars.

Now I have what should be very exciting news: most of the
top-flight, most successful marketing wizards are entrepreneurs
who grew up into marketers, and who are self-taught, many in
very short periods of time. What they have done to become what
they are—people whose time is worth thousands of dollars per hour—you
can do too. Yes, I am here to tell you that you can,
over a two-to-five year term, make your hours each worth
$1,000.00 or more.

Join me. Free yourself from boring routine and modest payoff activity and graduate to life as a "Master Marketer."
