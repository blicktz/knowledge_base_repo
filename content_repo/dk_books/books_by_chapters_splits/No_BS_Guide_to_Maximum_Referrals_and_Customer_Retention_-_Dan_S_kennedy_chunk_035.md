##### bed, and with him cheering me alongside (thankfully I am blessed to have a supportive husband [who also happens to be very cute, I might add]), I set to work.
 I opened up an e-fax account (did I mention Dan doesn’t use email?), wrote my application, sent it in, and waited.
 Waiting is my least favorite! But getting faxes from Dan is my most favorite. The day I received a fax from him about being chosen as a finalist, I did an extended happy dance. Being a finalist meant that I was able to compete in a live phone-in program where I would share with others what I discovered through my time with GKIC and Dan that had changed my business and life. I would speak about the strategies I learned and the practices I put in place because of them. Independent judges would choose the winner, and Dan would announce the results live on the call.
 I was born for this challenge! I went into the contest believing that even if I didn’t win, this was my chance to share my gratitude with Dan for all I had learned through him that had changed my life.
 I spent a lot of time preparing for the competition. Thankfully over the course of the year of being involved with GKIC, I became friends with some brilliant and kind entrepreneurs. I consulted dear friends who had competed as finalists in the past. They offered some poignant insights.
 I prepared by writing out a script, buying the domain www.ILiveOnPlanetDan.com to post all of my examples, and spent some time praying before the call.
 I was sooooooooo nervous. I sat alone in the most quiet space of my office building—our nursery. I provide childcare for our staff members’ children along with my girls, but on this day, none of them were in. So there I sat among jumpers and dolls and pastels bearing these young folks’ names, waiting.

 FINALLY IT WAS MY TURN My hands shook. My voice trembled. My heart beat so fast I thought Dan could hear it. But I kept reading my script. And reading. And reading. Dan, who had a reputation for being a curmudgeon, was supportive throughout and encouraged me to keep going.

##### I finished my presentation and took a deep breath. Breathing was something I didn’t do much of back then.
 I had to wait to listen to the other callers. That was torture. Don’t get me wrong, they all had great stories, but waiting is my least favorite. It seemed like forever until they were done.
 Then it was time for a decision. The judges had chosen their favorite, and Dan was going to announce it after a few housekeeping items.

 AND THE WINNER WAS Not me. Dang!
 Dan was kind to share that I was the other person he was debating on, but the judges felt strongly about awarding the contestant who was a manufacturer who successfully put GKIC practices in place.
 But wait, all was not lost! In an act of delight and surprise, Dan announced that for the first time ever he was going to allow all of the finalists to come to the Mastermind. We would have to pay our way to come, but if we did that, once we were there, we could participate in all activities for the weekend. We just needed to fax him and let him know if we were in.
 I couldn’t send in my acceptance fast enough. Two months later, I had my chance to present at the Winner’s Weekend Mastermind at Disney and get to know Dan better. After that event, we started to talk about how we might be able to work together on some projects, including a presentation to his most elite Mastermind, the Titanium Group. From there, he introduced me to GKIC’s Chairman of the Board and from there, I was able to secure GKIC as a client. To this day, we still run Facebook member acquisition for GKIC (for more on that, take another look at Chapter 1).
 And now, of course, our partnership has produced the book you are reading. Two years into working together, Dan Kennedy is writing a book with the woman with the hyphenated last name about social media. Me.

 WORK SMARTER. NOT HARDER. Amen.
