 Finally, the third solution is customer-get-a-customer or referrals. Word-of-mouth advertising can be expanded exponentially from over- the-backyard fence conversation to easy sharing with hundreds or even thousands of “Friends” by online social media. Consumers escape being lost in space via three shortcuts through choice: being reached and persuaded directly, one to one, through direct marketing; by brand; and by friend, neighbor, or peer referral, asked for or volunteered. Brand helps this, but so does good direct-response media so there is an effective place for the referror to send the referee. All three connect. To be successful, you need to be effectively using and integrating all three. To that end, I cannot urge you strongly enough to grab the FREE TRIAL OFFER on page 261 and get involved with all of us at and associated with GKIC. GKIC is quite simply the world leader in this integrated marketing approach, made understandable, practical, and usable by businesses of every imaginable breed, type, and size. GKIC provides vital information and practical training, support and coaching, networking and facilitated alliances with like-minded entrepreneurs actively and successfully implementing these strategies, even connections with quality vendors of every service you might need who are particularly knowledgeable in our methods and themselves trained to work with our members. There’s just nothing like GKIC.
 The space you and your customers find yourselves in is only growing and expanding, so it is getting ever easier to get lost in it. Entirely new spaces within the vast space of the marketing universe keep getting created. Amazon and Facebook are two examples. It is up to you to connect with your customers, to shine a bright beacon that attracts them and that they can follow to find you in the vast blackness and use to navigate their way through all the clutter, the “space junk,” floating around in that vast space. Here we have given you three powerful beacons. I hope I’ll be hearing from you, of your success with them, and even meeting you at a future GKIC event, maybe even crowning you as one of the GKIC Marketers or Entrepreneurs of the Year and inviting you to an all-expenses

## How I Started Making Money in Direct Mail—and How You Can, Too!

###### S A BUSINESS OWNER, ONE OF YOUR PRIMARY GOALS IS TO SEE your business grow and become more profitable. In my experience, direct mail is one of the most powerful tools available

# A

###### to help you achieve that.
 Regardless of what business you are in, or how big it is, or even what type of customers you have . . . with the right information, I believe you will be able to develop a direct-mail program that will work for your business.
 Marketing is a critical need of every business. It doesn’t matter if you are selling software, clothing, or books, or if you manufacture some kind of widget.
 Maybe you produce the best face cream in the world. Perhaps it even has the power to rejuvenate the skin and make people look 20 years
