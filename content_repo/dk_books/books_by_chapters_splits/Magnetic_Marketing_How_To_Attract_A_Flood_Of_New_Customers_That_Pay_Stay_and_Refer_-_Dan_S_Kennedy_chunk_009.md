# BUILDING YOUR
MAGNETIC
 MARKETING SYSTEM

-----

###### CHAPTER 7
#### YOUR MAGNETIC ATTRACTION SYSTEM

-----

###### What I’m going to describe to you over the next three chapters represents the foundational components of

 the complete Magnetic Marketing System
.
In over four decades, I’ve never met a single person who couldn’t take

 this foundation and apply it for use in their business.
 When you put this system in place, you’ll have a repeatable, reliable machine working for you 24/7/365 to

 attract-convert-retain customers. No more guesswork. No more “feast or famine.” No more random acts of marketing.
 In this chapter, we’ll cover your
 Magnetic Attraction

 System
 —built to attract prospects who you know fit your targeted WHO and allowing them to raise their hand

 indicating th
at they have a problem you can solve thanks to what you have to offer, be it product, service, or some mix of both.

 The diagram below shows how the Attraction System works:

-----

###### The Attraction System uses a variety of MEDIA channels where your target prospects hang out to let them know about

 your Lead Generation Magnet.
 These can include magazine ads, banner ads on websites, Pay-Per-Click ads, emails sent to lists they’ve subscribed to,

 direct mail, business cards you hand out when meeting someone, display ads in newspapers, ValPak coupons, and so

 on.
 The Lead G
eneration Magnet is the special “Widget” you are offering to get individuals—from the greater population of

 prospects—to indicate interest and thereby transform themselves from a prospect into a “LEAD.”

 Once a lead raises their hand, you now have permission (and the responsibility) to follow up with them regarding the information they requested. For example:

 If they asked about ideas for staging and selling their house, you can follow up with them on this.

 If they asked about ensuring their children are

 protected in an estate plan, you can follow up with them on this.

 If they asked about learning how to hit the golf ball ten yards farther without new clubs, you can follow

 up with them on this.

 Everyone who raises their hand gets put into a “bucket” or

 database or list from which you then follow up with messaging aimed at converting them from a lead to a paying customer.

-----

###### This approach transforms your advertising from a “hope but can’t tell if it works” model to a “know if it works” system. Now you’re investing in reaching out directly to people you

 KNOW you can help and who have indicated they have a problem you can solve. You can run the numbers based on

 the results you’re getting from your lead generation ads— calculate to see that for every $1 you invest you get $2-$4 or more back. This is a huge improvement over Goodyear blimp

 advertising where there’s no way to accurately measure and you have no idea whether the ads have any effect at all.

 CREATING YOUR LEAD GENERATION REPORT / GUIDE / MAGNET

 Typically, your L
 ead Generation Magnet is information that has real value to the prospect.
 It can be simple, brief, delivered via offline or online media,

 and crafted to attract exactly the prospect, customer, client, or patient you want.

 It can be a free report, or a checklist, or even a cheat sheet on a subject of prime interest to your preferred customer.
 The purpose for all of these is to position you and your

 company as reliable, knowledgeable, experts in your field.
 Your L
ead Generation Magnet has four main jobs:

 1. First, to generate and enhance response to

 advertising.

 2. Second, to reinforce and strengthen the prospect’s
 unhappiness with the current circumstances and

 problems he has that you can provide the solution to.

-----

###### 3. Third, to establish both your expertise and empathy.

 4. Fourth, positioning so that the prospect is
 predisposed to accept your recommendations favorably.

 In many cases, the free report is nothing more or less than a disguised, persuasive long copy sales letter, but if you called

 it that, no one would want it.
 Instead, it’s best to include legitimately valuable information. When you include such information, the prospect

 will see that you are a good source for answers to his problems, needs, and desires.

 A lot of people balk at giving away valuable information, but that’s a huge mistake. You give to get. If you don’t reveal anything of value in your L
 ead Generation Magnet, the

 prospect can assume there’s no value in your products or services either.

 Here are some examples of information-based
 Lead Generation Magnets.
 If I were a chiropractor my report might be, “Six Ways to

 Have a Pain-Free Back in Six Weeks
.” Obviously one of the six ways would involve coming into my office for an exam, and possibly treatment. The other five ways would be useful

 things the person can do on their own to relieve pain.
 If I were in real estate, my report might be, “Fourteen Little

 Known Ways to Get Top Dollar for Your Home, Even in a Tight Market
.” One of those ways would be to list the home with me, and in that section of the report I’d thoroughly describe

 all the benefits of listing with me. The other thirteen ways

-----

###### would be information about inexpensively cleaning up the

 house and yard, staging a house, writing Craigslist ads, and so on. Through these thirteen ways, I’d show off my expertise

 and know-how, and convey the difficulty of doing everything without me.

 If I were in multi-level marketing recruiting, my report

 might be titled, “Ten Best Ways to Create a Half-Million-Dollar Retirement Nest Egg, Even if Starting Late, Even with Little or

 No Money to Invest
.” The report could include information on buying real estate with no money down, on tax-sheltered savings vehicles like IRAs, on mutual funds. One of the ten

 ways would be developing a network marketing business in your spare time.

 Here are a few important writing tips.

 Avoid “me, me, me, we, we, we” speak.

 Some L
 ead Generation Magnets talk too much about the company and not enough about the prospect. He does not

 care about you, or your company per se, he only cares about the wonderful things that will happen to him as a result of

 doing business with your company. Translate every fact and feature listed in your report into a benefit. Be you-oriented, not me-oriented. Use all the data you gathered about your

 who, and talk to them in their
language and about their real probl
ems.

 Don’t overeducate.

 You want to inform and impress, but not tell everything you know. Tell people what to do, but not how to do it. Let them

 take the next step to get the exact how-tos. (In
fact
, one of

-----

###### the best responses you can get from your Lead Generation

 Magnet is “can you help me do this?”)

 Don’t forget the call to action.

 If you don’t have a call to action (CTA), you’ve wasted your

 time and money. To paraphrase Zig Ziglar, “Is your free report a sales professional, or a professional visitor?”
 Tell the prospect exactly what to do, when, why, and what

 will happen once he does. It’s helpful to offer an immediate gratification incentive for that requested action, such as a

 special bonus, or a discount. The CTA could be a number of things, depending on how complex your sales funnel needs to be.

 You could go directly for the sale of a product or service, including pricing, features, bonuses, guarantee, even a deadline.

 You could instead offer some type of consultation, with an invitation to set up an in-person call or face- to-face meeting.

 Or you could send them to a website or some other additional information resource.

 Create and use powerful titles.

 The title of your L
ead Generation Magnet is very important. Like a headline, it has to interest people enough to want it, and then motivate them to consume it when they get it.

 Take the time to create a really powerful title. Where do you get great titles? Model the attention-getting headlines you

 can find on supermarket tabloids, like
The Enquirer
, and on

-----

###### the covers of magazines like
Cosmopolitan
,
Readers Digest
,

 and others.
 These headlines have to sell those magazines off the rack. Of course, the subject matter probably won’t fit your

 business, but the structures of these headlines will.

 Making the Lead Gen offer

 Making the offer for the Lead Generation Magnet involves

 two steps:

 Step 1: Sell the prospect on getting the Lead Generation Magnet.

 Step 2: Collect contact information for use in follow up.

 (After you finish step 2, you deliver the Lead Generation

 Magnet, which leads right into the Conversion System, which I’ll discuss in the next chapter.)
 Let’s talk about step 1, which involves making a strong

 sales pitch to convince them to request the Lead Generation Magnet.

 Do NOT underestimate the difficulty in doing this, even though it’s probably something you’ll be giving away for FREE. People remain reluctant to share contact information,

 especially given the amount of unwanted SPAM they suspect will come their way, as well as privacy concerns.

 So you need to very clearly make the case why your Lead Generation Magnet will solve a specific problem, heal a burning pain point, or address a real heart-felt concern

 they’re dealing with.

-----

###### Your options for your Lead Generation Magnet are many and varied:

 Business card

 Postcard

 Phone script

 Website

 Facebook/YouTube/Social Media

 Banner ad

 Valpak insert

 TV or Radio commercial

 Email

 Speaking

 You can (and should) offer your Lead Generation Magnet

 anywhere and everywhere.
 If you do so in person, it’s easy—just get the prospect’s business card or contact info. Then send them the Lead

 Generation Magnet. Over the phone, just write it down. You can also drive people to an 800 number with a recorded

 message and have them leave their info there. While this may sound old school, it remains quite effective, especially when dealing with target markets that skew older.

 A client of mine with one of the most productive lead generation ad campaigns on radio nationwide instructs

 listeners to call a voicemail number and leave their email address. Then he’ll send them his free report, which has a

-----

###### sexy, exciting title, and promise of interest to his target market.

 Don’t miss that point—your Lead Generation Magnet needs to sound sexy, exciting, informative—the magic pill to cure

 whatever ails you. The ad copy used to promote it likewise has to frame its benefits and value with powerful, emotional language. The Lead Generation Magnet offers transformation,

 pure and simple, and anyone would be a fool not to take advantage of it and now.
 One of the primary mechanisms today for collecting

 contact information is online with a dedicated, simple webpage called a landing page or squeeze page.

 You probably already have a big, fat, catchall site that has a mountain of content on it.
 If you’re going to do lead generation, you should not send

 prospects into that. Instead, send them to a very simple landing page that works just like a clerk answering the phone.

 The landing page or squeeze page is very, very simple. This is where you’re going to capture the person’s contact information who has come to your website from one of your

 lead generation pieces.
 The website is simple because the only reason they’re

 coming to it is to give you their contact information in exchange for your Lead Generation Magnet, so that’s all you want to show them. It doesn’t include any kind of navigation

 options or a menu bar with “Home,” “About,” etc. so they can’t get lost someplace else on your website. The only

 purpose of this page is to collect contact information so you

-----

###### can send them your Lead Generation Magnet, and then follow up.

 You’re not trying to build a brand. Not trying to entertain or inform. You’re not trying to get likes, or anything like that— although those are not inherently bad. What you are trying to

 do, and what you want to measure, is to get the people who do show up to give you their contact information. That is the

 one and only goal of your landing page.
 Once you have their information, you send them your Lead Generation Magnet and then put them into your Magnetic

 Conversion System.

 IT’S ALL ABOUT MAGNETIC ATTRACTION

 This chapter should make 100 percent clear what I mean by

 Magnetically Attracting leads as opposed to chasing them.
 Yes, you lay out the offer of a Lead Generation Magnet—the

 free report, the information kit, DVD, audio, checklist, etc.—to everyone in your WHO that you can. But it’s not chasing, it’s simply laying it out there to see if anyone’s interested enough

 to step out of the pack and raise their hand.
 By doing so, you’ve enticed them to take that very first

 step on their own. They’ve crossed the first threshold barrier. It’s a tiny step to be sure, but it’s an important one. They’ve said YES for the first time about something you have to offer.

 Now it’s up to you to build upon that momentum in your Magnetic Conversion System.

-----

###### CHAPTER 8
#### YOUR MAGNETIC CONVERSION SYSTEM

-----

###### Now that you have gotten your prospect to raise their hand,
 it’s time to fire up your Magnetic Conversion System
—the goal of which is to turn them from someone

 who is merely interested into a paying customer.
 The diagram below shows the different elements of the

 Conversion System:

 It’s important to note that it’s up to YOU to define exactly how configure this system. The different components, each of

 which I’ll describe on the following pages, can be mixed and matched and sequenced in different ways.
 The key, however, is to implement SOMETHING. Far too

 many businesses totally drop the ball when it comes to following up with leads who have already made it clear, either

 through action or communication, that they’re interested in what you have to offer. It boggles the mind—you’ve paid good money for inventory, rent, power, licensing, website hosting,

 advertising and more, yet you’re willing to watch all that go down the drain by failing to follow up.

 Indeed, this should inspire you because by putting this Conversion System in place in your business, you will literally create an unfair advantage over your competition, who

-----

###### almost certainly won’t do anything anywhere close to
, or as

 detailed, or as systematic.
 All the components of the system are based on one

 overriding principle:

#### “Show Up Like No One Else.”

###### For just a second, let’s go back to that question I said you should ask yourself when creating your Unique Selling

 Proposition (USP). Do you recall? It goes like this:
 “Why should I choose to do business with you versus any and every other option available to me in your category?”

 This is such a powerful question and you HAVE to be able to answer it in every communication you make with future and

 even current clients. Because as they say, every horse eventually goes lame— you can’t simply assume that just because you’ve convinced someone to buy from you once

 they’ll continue along that path forever. You constantly have to provide a good answer to that question throughout the

 entire customer life cycle.
 Therefore, your goal in your Conversion System, is to show up like nobody else. Stick out like a sore thumb among the

 tens of thousands of sales messages bombarding your prospects every day. And when you show up at the door—

 standing out from the semi-washed competitive masses—you arrive not only looking like something truly special, but you bring heightened value that’s clearly different.

 It’s important to understand that the higher up the income ladder you go, people will pay more for WHO you are rather

 than WHAT you do. The WHAT of what you do can easily be

-----

###### turned into a commodity. But WHO you are is unique—there’s

 only one, and therefore the value is established accordingly.
 Showing up like no one else reinforces that fact, which is

 why it must stay top of mind through all your communications as a Magnetic Marketer.
 Let’s talk about a few ways to do just that.

 MULTISTEP CAMPAIGN

 Most people’s marketing is not very sophisticated at all. Here’s what it looks like. Print up a brochure. A lot of them.

 Put them in a burlap sack. Rent a plane. Fly low. Shake sack. Hope.

 We can do better. What we want to do is identify a small, carefully selected, manageable target market and set out to become the

 dominant presence in that target market in as short a period of time as possible.

 Why small? The biggest marketing mistake most businesses make is marketing too big. I’ll ask, “What’s your target market?” “Detroit.” “Well, if we send one postcard to

 every adult who lives in the greater Detroit area once a year, which can hardly be called an intensive campaign, what’s our budget got to be?” The guy says, “$300,000.” “How much

 you got to spend?” “$600.”
 How’s that going to work out?

 Point being, you instead need to shrink the size of your target market to whatever resources you’re willing and able to commit to allow you to have big impact. And here’s the

 secret to that: if you want impact and you want response
,

-----

###### then you must have repetition. They are inextricably linked.

 But you can’t afford to do what Madison Avenue wants you to do—spend huge dollars on TV ads that play 24/7—and maybe someday respond. That’s not the answer.

 The answer is
a series of communications
—they could be letters, they could be emails, they could be postcards, they
