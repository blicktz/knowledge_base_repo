Everybody needs to be cautious of need . After all, if you ask most people why they go to work in the morning, they say: to pay bills. Very high income people say the same thing. And they are still slaves, just better dressed. Working for Debt .
 Entrepreneurs need to be especially cautious of expanding need by piling on employees, infrastructure, overhead, people, places, and things. Bigger is not necessarily better. More gross may not only produce less net, but may move you from master to slave before you realize it.

Many succeed but only to a limited degree. Their theft stands in the way of attracting wealth and abundance. Their theft puts them in a prison of their own making.
 People who work in factories, especially if union employees, think years on the job should translate to wage increases. This is why wage-earners rarely attract wealth. Their erroneous, greedy thinking is in the way. Although it is corporate CEOs and entrepreneurs usually accused by the media and viewed by the public as greedy—and occasionally there are some spectacularly conscienceless thieves who work their way to top spots on Wall Street (as we’ve recently seen) or at big corporations—it is actually

Time on a job, years doing a job, does not increase the inherent value of that job being done. In most cases, after the first few years, it doesn’t increase the value of the employee either. He doesn’t bring 30 years’ experience to the table at all. He only brings 1 year of experience repeated 30 times.
