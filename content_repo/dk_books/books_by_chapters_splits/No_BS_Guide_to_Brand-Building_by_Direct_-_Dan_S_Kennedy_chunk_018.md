My parents Faye and Ted started the company when I was 10 years old. My dad was a salesman for C&K Distributors, which sold Old Style Beer, and he was making a sales call at Al Pars Liquors, the one on 71st Street. He overheard Al making arrangements to sponsor a concert, heard him saying he needed a caterer, and Dad yelled, “I’ll do it.” Al looked at him and asked, “Do you know what you are doing, Ted?” And Dad said, “Of course, done it many times.” We did not know what to do. We actually hired another caterer and watched them for the next three months, then really started on our own. Our commitment was to create flawless events, not just deliver and serve good food and drink. Because of this, we


-----

###### caught the eye of the entertainment industry and started catering for Patti LaBelle, Rick James, Prince, and many others I can’t name. We became known as Caterers to the Stars. We’ve catered Nelson Mandela’s Freedom Tour, private fundraisers for President Clinton, movie shoots for Denzel Washington, national commercial shoots with Morgan Freeman, even President Barack and Michelle Obama’s wedding reception. But our mission is not just to serve stars, it’s to make all our clients’ events unforgettable.

 Notice that the story is still charming and has its roots, but focuses on what Fanfares can do for the client. There is tremendous social proof. Before GKIC, Al wasn’t mentioning most of the celebrities he’s catered for, including President Obama! If you have impressive customers, you definitely want to show them off and use them.
 As you can see, it takes time and creative thinking to get to the best possible USP and DCS. This is helped a lot by brainstorming with other smart marketers and qualified coaches, a creative environment that we provide for GKIC Members, but that you can organize for yourself, too. I don’t think you can build or support a great brand without a strong USP and DCS, and I know you can’t successfully do direct-response advertising and marketing without them. So whatever work and however much time and persistence are needed to get to them, it just has to be done!

#### CHAPTER 12


## A Brand without Marketing
 Is a Tree Falling in a Distant, Unpopulated
 Forest

###### by Steve Adams


###### ou’ve heard that saying—if a tree falls in a distant, unpopulated forest, and nobody hears it, does it even matter? If a brand has been invested in and had great importance attached to it by its owner, but

# Y

###### it isn’t effectively marketed, does it matter? Brand or no brand, you’ll be in the same place without a marketing system. I’d like to tell you how I came to that understanding, and what I did about it.
 It’s July 1996, and I’ve just relocated my family from Michigan to Wisconsin. I’m launching my first entrepreneurial venture after ten years as a commercial loan officer.


-----

###### After investing ten years of study into the success and leadership literature, and a very successful banking career, I was now in control of a new business of my own. I quickly discovered that nothing in my traditional marketing education and big-company experience prepared me for my biggest challenge in business.
 Looking back, it’s easy to see that I overvalued brand identity, in this case bought in the form of a franchise. The same mistake can be made creating your own brand identity from scratch. A brand, a brand name, brand identity, logo, slogan—these things are assets and can be valuable assets, but they are not marketing. There’s no substitute for marketing!
 That first major challenge was insufficient sales. Despite having a franchise flag, the brand was new to the market.
 Advertising representatives flooded into my store to pitch their programs for TV, radio, new neighbor kits, Valpak, and community coupon programs. Every charity you can imagine, in and out of the pet-related world, came to the new guy with limited money for advertising and donations. I spent a lot of money on advertising.
 For our first grand opening, we ran six radio spots a day on three stations for a week, we ran TV ads and a full-circulation newspaper FSI. We were flooded with new customers, and I thought I was really smart.
 Then the trouble began. Immediately after the grand opening, revenues fell back 40% and significantly below break-even. My immediate response was to sign up for regular radio, newspaper, and coupon book marketing at costs that were not easy to digest, given we were losing money.
 As the months went by, sales gradually grew but my frustration grew right along with it. Where were these sales coming from? What if I eliminated some of this marketing to achieve break-even sooner? What would the impact be? No one I knew could tell me the answer. The advertising representatives’ answers were always along the lines of “whoever spends the most wins the game.”
 More than once, we had to cancel a marketing program we signed up for and arrange a payment plan to make good on what we spent because revenues didn’t grow and we couldn’t afford to continue to spend.
 My frustration with this pattern of buy a program, no growth, and cancel reached its peak in 2003 when we had to close two stores in the


-----

###### Dallas-Fort Worth market. We entered the market in 2001 and had disastrous results. Our biggest problem, again, was an unknown brand, which translated into very slow adoption rates of our stores by new pet owners. There was no shortage of pet owners in Texas. They just didn’t know or trust us.
 At the height of my frustration with advertising, I quit. I quit all advertising and informed our team we were going to work on our business model and become so good at what we did that word-of-mouth alone would generate the growth. In the meantime, I cut 100% of our advertising spend and downsized store count until we were profitable; then I immediately went to work on reinventing our value proposition.
 Our franchise, at that point, was a loosely tied group of store owners who had license to do as we pleased with product, real estate, and marketing. The deal was to pay the fees, run a good, clean store, and go about building our business. The primary value-add was the monthly ad circular and buying power the franchise had given us.
 We were the first franchisee to enter a major metropolitan market as the third entrant. The problem was we showed up with a generic selling proposition. This was THE reason for poor sales results. Pet owners saw no compelling reason to choose us over all the other options they had to purchase pet supplies.
 We entered 2004 with the goal of creating a new Unique Selling Proposition (USP) for the company. Our process was to map out what our competitors focused on and then determine what we could do much better that didn’t match their USP focal points.
 Our choices were: 1) expertise of the staff, 2) quality of our staff interactions, and 3) emphasis on organic and natural foods and supplies. Later, through the influence of Dan Kennedy, this transitioned to differentiating on how we sell our clients, the experience they have in the store, and the expertise of our store personnel. Our overall positioning is that of “trusted authority.”
 For the next several years, we experienced steady growth rates of 6% to 8%. We upgraded our store personnel through hiring profiles and providing generalized pet-care training. Word-of-mouth marketing was working. We provided a good experience in the stores. Our team had good solutions for


-----

###### pet owners who were tired of the “know-nothing” employees at our major chain competitors.
 During the period of 2004–2008, we grew to four stores, and in mid- June 2008, we completed an acquisition of five stores in Birmingham/Tuscaloosa, Alabama. After the acquisition, we upgraded the staff, invested in pet-care training, and continued with the zero marketing investment mind-set.
 It also was during this period that the infamous pet food recall occurred due to lethal chemicals being found in food manufactured in China. We were inundated with frightened pet owners asking us if we knew if their food was safe. Fortunately for us, one of our customers in Dallas was a reporter for the Dallas Fox News affiliate. She knew our team had a higher level of expertise than the typical pet store so she interviewed one of our managers in the midst of the recall crisis. Sales immediately jumped 10% in our two Texas stores.
 I realized at that moment that an opportunity for truly unique positioning was staring me right in the eyes. What if we could be recognized as the leading experts in every market regarding pet nutrition? Every dog and cat has to eat, so this was a big issue that we could become the “go to” place for answers.
 In 2009, I was able to develop and implement a nutrition certification program with Dr. Sarah Abood, DVM Ph.D., the lead nutrition professor at Michigan State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine. Today we have more than 100 certified pet nutritionists in our 21 stores giving great advice to pet owners each day.
 Then in 2010, revenues flattened to zero growth across our entire ten- store group in Alabama, Texas, and Wisconsin. I realized I needed to make a key executive change and step into direct market leadership.
 I simplified a lot of the operational processes and harmonized our merchandise assortments and loyalty program with a now active and value- creating franchisor. We also improved our overall internal store culture.
 The importance of marketing that internal store culture and professionalism cannot be overstated. Great direct-response marketing will accelerate the demise of a poorly run retail business.
 However, it was then that I realized being a better merchant, becoming more operationally sound, tinkering endlessly with store design and real


-----

###### estate could only do so much. The first half of 2010 revenues declined on a same-store basis by 5%. However, through the previously mentioned changes, we were back to 3% to 4% positive sales comps by the fourth quarter of that year. Overall, we suffered through our first flat sales growth year since early in the decade.
 The improvements made in 2010 bore fruit in 2011. Those improvements generated our best revenue growth year ever with companywide sales increasing 10% for the year. As the fall approached, I knew we needed something else to continue this growth. The 2011 bump was event driven around some clearly identifiable improvements—inside the store—that would not be able to generate consistent growth year after year on its own.
 If we were going to become a company that grew above the industry norm year after year, we needed to learn to become marketers. I was still an advertising victim, so rather than return to old patterns, I began to do some research.
 I met fellow author and entrepreneur Tony Rubleski through a mutual friend one day in my office. Tony reached out to meet again, and we met over coffee at Starbucks. At the end of the meeting, I offered my credit card to Tony and asked him to send me $250.00 of his best marketing information that I could read to help me.
 I wasn’t someone who liked to enter into consulting retainer agreements. I wanted to do my own independent thinking first, then once I achieved a level of mastery, would hire consultants to leverage my effectiveness.
 In that package was my introduction to Dan Kennedy. I don’t even remember the other items in the box. I read the book No B.S. Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses and was instantly hooked.
 I signed up for GKIC Gold Membership, read both The Ultimate Marketing Plan and The Ultimate Sales Letter, and within 60 days, had crafted our first four-page sales letter. A compiled list, suppressed against our current customer base, was purchased, and the letter was sent late in November 2011.
 That first sales letter, and one reactivation postcard with concepts learned from Dan, had an immediate impact. We sent out 4,000 letters and received 206 new clients into our stores! More amazing was our


-----

###### reactivation postcard that had nearly a 70% response. It was the best holiday season we had ever experienced.
 At that moment, I became a Dan Kennedy convert and bought nearly every book he had published. I read all of them over a two-month period. I realized for the first time that I needed to become a professional marketer of my business and less a doer of my business.
 After attending a GKIC Implementation Boot Camp in Atlanta, Georgia, with my IT Director, who is now my Marketing Director, it became clear that we could, in fact, control our own destiny through a systematic plan to grow revenues.

##### Marketing by Numbers

###### The first thing we did was build a data warehouse and create a flow of information to the database from our loyalty program and point-of-sale systems so that we could understand our marketing math.
 We learned what our first-year client profit was and began to base marketing investment decisions off that metric. We chose gross profit because we have to remove product cost from annual revenues to calculate what we can pay to acquire a new client. Additionally, we chose first-year rather than lifetime value because we didn’t want to assume long retention periods given the dynamics of retailing.
 In retailing with multiple stores, volume is a challenge in designing marketing programs. Whatever we came up with had to be scalable across multiple stores and markets. Furthermore, I wanted to acquire new clients, retain the clients we had, increase frequency and annual client spend, and finally, begin to regularly reactivate lost clients.

##### New Client Acquisition

###### For acquisition, we contracted with Craig Simpson of Simpson Direct to help us acquire the right mailing lists based on our best client profile and to manage the overall process of getting a monthly sales letter out in multiple markets. Craig is also invaluable in testing new concepts, format design, and copy review.


-----

###### Additionally, we hired Kevin Donlan, a Dan Kennedy-trained copywriter, to improve upon my original sales letter to create a control we could mail out month after month with success.

###### Earlier, I mentioned an aversion to hiring consultants. I made the time investment in studying direct-response marketing, understood the fundamentals, and now, given our scale, needed the help of experts to leverage my time and accelerate our results.
 I see entrepreneurs unwilling to spend money with people who can help them get to where they want to be. They fail to make the connection of greater profits sooner offsetting the cost of the consultants.

##### That Was Then, This Is Now

###### That tells you about the early journey, during which a banker bought a brand and became a retailer, but had to learn that neither a good brand nor a good retailing operation is enough. That was then. This is what drives our 21-store chain now . . .
 Armed with help from these outstanding experts, we now mail a monthly four-page sales letter in a self-mailer format. The letter emphasizes our trusted authority positioning with the elements of a good sales letter. Over the past year, the average response is 1.78% with 2,399 new clients acquired and an average ROI of 271%.
 An additional acquisition strategy we employ is an alliance referral program with animal rescues and partner businesses. We offer a $25.00-off coupon to first-time clients who have adopted a pet or are first-time clients referred by business partners. It’s a value-add to our partner clients. We then


-----

###### pay the rescue referral a donation of $20.00 for each redemption and $10.00 to our business partners.
 Through the first full year of the alliance referral program, we acquired 6,776 new clients. The overall ROI on the program the first year was 173%.

##### There’s Gold in the List

###### Another challenge every business has, but few grasp, is growth through marketing to the house file. Before entering Dan’s world, we were no different. We had more than 350,000 buyers in our database, and we were doing nothing to increase our share of wallet with them.
 In retail, it is common for consumers to cross-shop a store with direct competitors. They follow advertised specials. We wanted to escape that commodity trap, so we invested in our nutrition certification program. It’s an extensive web-based pet-care university tool and leadership/client facing engagement training. We were positioning ourselves as experts and being the trusted authority.
 Now, our marketing challenge was to learn how to market this positioning effectively to our client base. We wanted to cause them to consolidate purchases with our stores, which would lead to increased frequency and spend.
 We chose a combination of education and old-fashioned bribery. Our retention and frequency enhancement marketing plan consists of the following:

 1. Monthly printed eight-page newsletter to our top 500 clients per
 store. FSI (Free Standing Insert) is embedded into the newsletter. We haven’t determined how to measure an ROI on this yet; however, we believe enough reasons exist to continue sending it to our best clients. 2. Three holiday postcards per year to our “A” segment clients with a
 10%-off offer as a thank you. Our 2013 Valentine’s Day holiday card generated an 18.44% response, an average transaction size lift of 28%, and a 417% ROI net of all costs and discounts.
