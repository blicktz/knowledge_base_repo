Bill’s cubicle was the same as the others—except for one little detail. Floor to ceiling, side to side, every square inch of wall space was covered with instant snapshots of Bill’s customers, proudly posed next to their new cars, with their names and dates of purchase written on them. I never counted the photos, but the quantity was overwhelming. Then, if you looked a little closer, you would pick up two patterns in the arrangement of the snapshots. First, the relationship pattern. For example, next to the picture of me with my Lincoln, you would have seen the photo of my wife with her Taurus, my parents with their Mercury, my brother with his pickup truck, my business partner with his Lincoln, his wife with her Probe, his sales manager with his Tempo, and one of his office managers with his Escort. Also, you would have noted a historical pattern. Not just me with my current Lincoln, but backwards chronologically to me with the Lincoln before that. In some cases, there were five, even six such photos: the customer with his new car, the same customer with the car he bought several years before, again with the car he bought several years before that, again with the car he bought several years before that.

 Now I’m going to tell you something that is almost unbelievable. I went there with my wife, with business associates, and with friends while they bought cars from Bill and I watched, in every case, as Bill figured up the price, wrote it on the contract, quoted the price and payment amounts, and heard the customers say, “Fine.” I watched them sign on the dotted line without even once haggling over price. In the car business!

##### In the weight-loss business, one very successful sales representative for diet products carries a sales tool with her everywhere she goes: a photo blown up into a life-size poster of herself, fifty-four pounds heavier than she is today. She unrolls the poster and stands next to it, and the sale is made.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #7:
 Pictures That Prove Your Case

##### Let me tell you something funny. Bill Glazner outperformed his sales colleagues at the dealership month after month, year after year—yet he was the only salesman there with photographs up on his cubicle walls. In the diet-products company the lady with the life-size “before” poster sells for, there are over 15,000 representatives, but as far as I know only one has a life-size poster of her overweight former self.

 Over four years, I built the largest integrated seminar and publishing firm exclusively teaching marketing to chiropractors and dentists, and, in one way or another, I told all of these stories to at least 15,000 doctors during those years. I’m still telling these same stories to the doctors. Yet, to the best of my knowledge, there are only a handful with a photo wall like the car salesman’s.

 Maybe all that is a comment on my effectiveness. I hope not. I think not. Instead, I think it is simply a reflection of the vast majority’s interest in improving, but only if doing so requires no change, discomfort, or initiative. That’s why, in every field, a few outearn the huge “mediocre majority” by giant margins.

 Today it is very easy to incorporate photographic and video evidence into presentations on websites and other online media, and many marketers do because there is abundant evidence that doing so boosts response. But nobody should stop with what’s easy. This kind of evidence should be incorporated into every media and every sales environment that is part of your business.

 Who Says So?

 When you make a statement, it’s a claim. When your satisfied customer makes the same statement about you, that’s a fact.

 What others say about you, your company, your products, and your services is infinitely more credible than anything you can say on your own behalf.

 I am here to tell you that you cannot overuse testimonials. Some businesses, notably the weight-loss industry and the skin care industry, do an outstanding job of getting and using good testimonials—watch advertising by Weight Watchers or TV infomercials, like Guthy- Renker’s
 infomercials for Proactiv acne products or Victoria Principal skin care. After its massive recall troubles in 2010, Toyota resorted to TV commercials featuring testimonials rather than cars, and Ford quickly

##### followed suit with a very successful campaign. This strategy will never go out of style, never run out of gas. When Priceline.com was brand new, introducing name-your-price travel purchased via the Internet, it used offline marketing and ran full-page magazine ads filled with photographs of happy Priceline customers captioned with the trips they took and the amounts of money they saved.

 Testimonials are beneficial in every marketing situation, whether it’s introducing yourself or a new product, service, or idea to prospects for the first time; responding to a negative situation and rebuilding trust in a marketplace; countering competition; or even reminding established customers of how happy they are. But one of the most critical needs for testimonials is in marketing the extremely unbelievable. A book I coauthored with Chip Kessler, Making Them Believe, explores the “lost marketing secrets of Dr. J. R. Brinkley,” possibly the wealthiest and most controversial doctor of his time (the 1920s–1930s) who promoted goat testicle and gland transplant surgeries for men with what is now called erectile dysfunction. Long before I conceived it, Brinkley used a near clone of the entire Ultimate Marketing Plan described in this book, featuring his essential reliance on proof provided by testimonials, notably including a “champion” or “poster boy” standing as dramatic proof of his promises. Here is a brief excerpt from one of Chip’s chapters in the book about the doctor’s most valuable testimonial:

 “… Dr. Brinkley’s paramount breakthrough, product-wise, came shortly after he moved to the town of Milford, Kansas, in 1917. Brinkley, practicing his personal brand of herbal remedies, had hung out his shingle and patients began trickling in. One in particular, a local farmer, complained of a lack of pep in general and a loss of sexual vitality; both conditions were old Brinkley mainstays. One thing led to another and the idea was offered between physician and farmer of an instant and permanent cure by transplantation of a goat’s testicles into the man’s scrotum. The surgery was soon performed. A couple of weeks later, the farmer returned with the good news. Perhaps the only resident of Milford more pleased than the farmer—and maybe the farmer’s wife*— was Dr. John R. Brinkley. The farmer was more than happy to spread the word and other locals soon followed onto Brinkley’s operating table. A testament to the power and persuasion of a personal testimonial from the heart, and how it instantly gave Dr. Brinkley a niche that would carry him and his reputation to fame, or as others would label it, infamy.

 “… When was the last time that you made a decision or purchase, or took an action, and there was no doubt in your mind that you were making the right decision and moving forward on it? In your heart and mind, you knew what you were doing was right. Dr. Brinkley had this effect on people, and it made him stand head and shoulders above the average run-of-the-mill marketer, anyone else offering any product, service or cure. Most importantly, John

##### Brinkley found ways to connect to the most profound reasons someone would want to believe in him and his proposition. A great example of this was handed to John Brinkley, but to his credit, he recognized its potential value when it occurred. John’s gift came from that farmer who first went to the Milford, Kansas, physician because he lacked ‘pep.’ John R. Brinkley’s handy-work below the belt not only brought praises from the farmer Bill Stittsworth and his wife (remember, she was so elated with her man’s newly rediscovered sexual ability that she then wanted to have ovaries from a female goat transplanted herself), it also brought one other thing: Billy Stittsworth, Jr.

 “There are ways of letting your target market know about the effectiveness of what product and service you are marketing … and then there are ways. The best is some evidence of the validity of your proposition that is intensely, profoundly motivational, triggering desire to believe. The emergence of a Stittsworth offspring not only spoke volumes about the transformative power of Brinkley’s goat-glands surgery, but also tapped into the greatest desire many men and women have: the need to have a baby. For the man, it’s the continuation of his name. For the woman it coincides with her need to bring life into the world. In John Brinkley’s time, it was still seen as the natural, expected fulfillment of marriage, and the absence of offspring represented embarrassing failure—a sign that, either the woman was barren or the man not a man at all. A couple without at least one child was not blessed by God, and family, friends, even the entire community wondered why, and viewed them with pity. These were the cultural conditions into which Dr. Brinkley had brought his cure. And now, Brinkley had an in-the-flesh demonstration of what a goat’s transplanted testicles into a man can produce! The farmer’s story and his living, breathing son provided a rock-solid foundation for others’ belief. John Brinkley knew how to present his ‘miracle’ in a way that made people want to believe. Billy Jr. provided the unassailable reason to believe.”

 Resource note: Our book Making Them Believe is a very detailed, in-depth examination of everything that can and should be done to create belief. In addition, there is a complete home study course built around the amazing Brinkley marketing examples. Information is available at www.ChipKessler.com.

 I’m going to let you in on a secret: As common amongst top marketers and as well-proven from the early 1900s to this day as testimonial use is, the absence or underuse of testimonials remains the number one marketing error I see repeated most frequently. I can promise you this: If you get nothing else out of this entire book but the inspiration to collect and heavily use as many good testimonials as you

##### can possibly get, in as many places and ways as you can, you’ll have a strong competitive advantage from that alone.

 What Is a Good Testimonial?

 For starters, think of a testimonial as a pair of verbal “snapshots.” The first is the “Before” picture—the problem or the skepticism; the second is the “After” picture—the positive result, the pleasant surprise, the solution. “I was fat, lonely, frightened, poor, unhappy, skeptical, etc. —now, thanks to XYZ, I’m thin, popular, confident, rich, happy, and a believer!” On the following page you’ll find two testimonials from our own Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Members that have appeared in our newsletters and marketing materials, presented exactly like verbal Before and Afters.

 Second, view testimonials as strategic weapons. I suggest making two lists; one of every claim, feature, benefit, and fact about what you’re marketing that you want to substantiate; second, every doubt, fear, or question that might exist in your prospective customer’s mind. Then collect and use testimonials that specifically substantiate the claims that eliminate the doubts.

##### A Few Examples

 A cafeteria wants to attract new customers. The owners are eager to emphasize the variety of foods they offer and that, unlike some cafeterias, they keep their food hot and fresh. The owners also know there are a great many people who never dream of coming to a cafeteria. Against that, they position these testimonials:

 I haven’t eaten in a cafeteria since high school, but I’m sure glad a friend brought me here—I’m really surprised at the tremendous variety that’s offered. Finally there’s someplace I can take the whole family for dinner and make everybody happy.

 I’ve always thought that cafeteria food sat around on hot plates and got soggy. Maybe that is true elsewhere, but everything here is piping hot, fresh, and, well, really good.

 A dentist “made hay” with this great testimonial:

 I avoided dental care I knew I needed for almost a year because I didn’t want the pain. I just couldn’t stand the thought of going to the dentist. But I’ve got to say that Dr. Welmer and his staff were just terrific! They were patient and understanding. And things sure have changed since the last time I went to a dentist. Dr. Welmer’s got the newest technology so the treatment was virtually pain-free. I was amazed.

 And this powerful testimonial for a lawn service:

 I’m busy, I travel a lot on business, and I hate taking care of my lawn. It always needed to be cut. Plants died. I tried different lawn care guys—you know, the guys with beat-up old pickup trucks who come around and hang Xeroxed flyers on your door, then never show up when they’re supposed to. When the representative of Lawn Technicians knocked on my door and I agreed to use them, I was prepared for another aggravating disappointment. Now, three months later, I’m telling everybody I know to use Lawn Technicians. They’ve turned lawn care into a profession.

 The Expanded Testimonial

 In print advertising, you’ll usually see short testimonials, two or three sentences long. On TV and radio, they’re usually a few seconds, except in thirty-minute-long infomercials, where each testimonial may run for a couple of minutes. In online media, there is a prevailing, popular (and entirely incorrect) belief that everything must be brief. Even though short is the norm, there may be cases where you’ll want to use an expanded testimonial. As a matter of fact, the long, story-style

##### testimonial can be the basis for an entire full-page ad or newspaper insert, an entire direct-mail piece, or an entire website.

 Following is one of my longest tenured “students” and long-time Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Member Dr. Gregg Nielsen’s patient and public newsletter articles that is, in essence, an expanded testimonial. Every month he does one of these, ranging from a third to a half to a full page, featuring the story of another particularly interesting or made interesting patient like Motocross Mike. I recall seeing a rodeo clown, a downhill ski racer, a local firefighter, a ballerina, and a chef featured. In regular publishing, these are called human interest stories, a staple of one of the most popular magazines of all time, Reader’s Digest. Dr. Nielsen is a phenomenal marketer. He and his staff and his patients have a lot of fun with his advertising. He’s well worth following, which you can do at www.DocNielsen.com.

 Real People Versus Celebrity Testimonials

 Real people testimonials are, in my opinion, a mandatory component of a solid marketing message. These typically come from your satisfied customers. When using a number of these testimonials in one message, you want to try to cover as many claim-benefit bases and as many demographic bases as possible.

-----

##### If marketing to a demographically diverse group of consumers, you need testimonials from whites, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics; men, women, married, and single people; and the old, the middle-aged, and the young. On the other hand, if you are not marketing to a diverse audience, be certain all your testimonials are well-matched with your targeted prospects; any that aren’t are a waste.

 If you’re doing business-to-business marketing, the bases you might want to cover would include small companies, medium-sized companies, and big companies—as well as retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, and service businesses. Or, if you’re aiming at a much more narrow, specific target market, then you must match your testimonial sources to it.

 Celebrity testimonials can be effective, but they can also be tricky. If your product or service is used or your business patronized by a known personality, such as an athlete or entertainer, you can capitalize on it. Sometimes even an endorsement of your general industry is useful. Some years back, Joe Montana, then playing for the San Francisco 49ers football team, stated that he relied on chiropractors to keep him healthy. Any chiropractor who failed to make use of this was just plain dumb.

 We are a celebrity-obsessed, celebrity-dominated, celebrity-driven culture, and it is foolish to ignore it or insist it doesn’t apply to your business; it’s smart to capitalize on it.

 Over the years, I’ve helped clients get and use countless celebrities for various marketing purposes—including Florence Henderson, Barbara Eden, Robert Wagner, Art Linkletter, Danny Glover, several soap opera actresses and actors, sports personalities including baseball pitcher Don Drysdale and Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White, and the list goes on. My long-time client, Guthy-Renker, was the first to use a celebrity to host a TV infomercial in 1986, and since then their use of big-name celebrities has helped them use TV advertising to build multimillion-dollar brands. As I write this, enormously popular celebrities Katy Perry, Jennifer Love Hewitt, and Justin Bieber are featured in TV commercials for Proactiv. At Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™, we bring celebrity entrepreneurs to our two major international conferences to add sizzle to the marketing of these events and give attendees a value-added in the opportunity to hear from, meet, and get photos taken with these stars. Our roster has included Gene Simmons (KISS), Joan Rivers, Ivanka Trump, George Foreman, and Kathy Ireland.

 When marketing on a national scale, you need nationally known celebrities, but when marketing locally, a local personality may prove nearly equal in impact but usually a lot easier and less costly to get. But you should not assume your local business cannot afford a national celebrity. One of our Members got former Chicago Bears player Refrigerator Perry for his local mortgage brokerage’s advertising—very affordably. Another long-time Member and exceptionally astute
