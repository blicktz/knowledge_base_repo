###### until they attended a follow-up live webinar. Give your audience different ways to learn and buy for the greatest ROI.
 • Direct-mail campaign. If your prospect entered your marketing funnel
 through digital channels, it doesn’t mean your conversation needs to stay there. Test taking your conversation offline to gauge whether or not that increases your conversion rate.
 • Social media advertising. Through Facebook’s ad platform, you can
 target your email list by creating a Facebook Custom Audience. Leverage this by uploading your email list and creating messaging specifically for those you targeted with your sales messages, yet did not convert, with a follow-up offer or piece of content. You can distribute your ads on the web, Facebook, and Instagram using this platform.
 • Follow-up call. This is the most effective, yet least often used method
 of sales conversion—the good ol’ follow-up call. Our clients who utilize telemarketing as part of their sales process achieve a better ROI than those who don’t. Sure, there is a time investment involved (which means more risk), but there’s always risk when you’re making money.

 LOSS LEADERS There are almost as many ways to structure your sale as there are things to sell.
 Some of the most successful businesses start with a loss leader in order to secure a customer. They give an incredible offer upfront that they lose money on, just to get the customer in the door. They do this because they know they will make money on the back end. In fact, back when I had my agency and ran the lead generation for the organization Dan founded— GKIC Insider’s Circle—we sent traffic to a three-month free membership program. Giving three months away made more money for the company than one or two when tracked over a year. They lost more money upfront but made a lot more on the back end.
 Another reason why you always measure, track, and test. This loss leader funnel is only advertised after the prospect has seen blog content, by seeing a content-rich ad, clicking on it, and going to the blog.


-----

###### For some smaller entrepreneurs, loss leaders are not an option, at least at the beginning. Nonetheless, the goal should be to spend the most you can to acquire a high-quality customer so you can obtain them and keep them for life.
 Like Dan Kennedy says, the one who can spend the most going after his target market wins.

#### Monetizing the Message: Ways to Drive in Cash

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips If you haven’t yet launched a product, program, or service to sell, or you are looking for supplemental income, then you are just like me a few years ago.
 I have always been a public speaker, sharing my expertise in (at least my momma tells me it is) an entertaining way to audiences around the world. I have also always written a lot of content and used it to connect with my audience.
 Until I was introduced to the world of information marketing, I didn’t sell anything when I spoke. I would get paid by the event organizer and hope that someone in the crowd would become a client.
 Fast forward to today where we have developed programs that teach people how to monetize their marketing (see examples at www.NoBSSocialMediaBook.com). While we run these programs and promotions readily as part of our overall business structure, I can also call upon them to bring us quick surges of cash.
 Before I took my friends and family on the Disney VIP Tour in celebration of my 40th birthday, I ran a one-hour webinar and made enough money to pay for the entire trip without having to dip into my savings. After I sold my agency and focused on Powerful Professionals solely, we dove even deeper into Information Marketing programs, aka e-learning, and in three years we generated more revenue than I had in the 18 years in which I owned Elite Digital Group.
 Still to this day, we can activate our list when needed to drive them to the sale because we have products waiting that we’ve developed with their needs in mind. This is the hidden money in our business.

 Where Is Your Money Hiding?


-----

###### The easiest place to start is with the hidden money you already have in your business. These are moneymakers that are sitting there, waiting to give you revenue. You’d be surprised how many there are.
 If you had an extra $8,333 a month, what would you spend it on? Buying a new car? Paying off school debt? Hiring that assistant you’ve been dreaming of? Taking that dream vacation? Saving for an early retirement?
 That extra money, over the course of a year, equals six figures in revenue.
 And the good news is, you can use the network and list you’ve created with the strategies in this book to do exactly that.
 If you want to break the chain of worry, free yourself of that J.O.B., skip the monthly frustration of figuring out new ways to get your business to work, and fit in your side hustle with your real job so you won’t have to worry about the bills, these next strategies are for you.
 Even if you’ve got a tiny list and no marketing budget, these strategies will work regardless of where you are starting from.
 And this is not just about making money. This is about growing a raving fan base, a loyal tribe that you serve, love, and for whom you get to do things that you love while you earn money every single month.
 Here’s a breakdown of:

 • How you can grow your list for free
 • How you’re going to monetize your audience
 • How to scale your success with things you can do over and over again

 Now I want you to start by imagining you have this magic ball. Put your hands over it and make your business wishes come true. You can start generating more money every single month and have that proverbial “make money while on vacation” life.
 Before you keep reading, one word of caution. Don’t get overwhelmed by the number of opportunities. Instead pick one or two to start with, monetize those, and then you can move on to others.
 First, I want you to write down how much extra money you want to generate.


-----

###### Let’s say you want to hire a new employee, so you want to fund that position. Or maybe you have a business goal, and in order to achieve it, you want to bring in an extra $20,000 a month. Or on the personal side, perhaps you want to buy a new car, so you’re just looking at an extra $600 a month. Whatever it is, there is no judgment, no questioning. You just figure out the amount and then write down exactly how much more money you want to bring in every single month, okay? You’re going to do that.
 Then as you are reading through these strategies, match up how much money you want to make with strategies that will bring in that much. Simple math, right? This isn’t guessing, this isn’t magic. We’re going to add up as many of these strategies as we need to equal the amount of money you’re trying to earn, right?
 It’s super simple. Frankly, this is how we plan our promotions calendar at Powerful Professionals now each year.
 We look at our revenue goal for the year and our list of growth goals. Then we decide which things we like to do as part of our business. We figure out how many of those we are going to pick in order to reach our revenue goals. We keep it simple and numbers focused.
 This is way different than how I used to do it, right? When I had my agency, I would just kind of hope the money would come in, that we would get a new client who would hire us—and hopefully pay us on time. I did a lot of wishing to generate revenue. It wasn’t until we started monetizing multiple channels that we didn’t have to depend upon wishing anymore.
 These are the actual strategies we use inside my company, and our students use them, and you’re going to be able to implement them as well.
 Let’s dive in …

 1. AMAZON INFLUENCER STORE If you have at least a thousand people on your list already (don’t worry if you don’t have a list yet; the rest of this chapter will still work for you), this is a quick win you should definitely have in place.
 Create an Amazon Influencer store. This isn’t just the Amazon affiliate program. Anybody can sign up as an affiliate. But an iInfluencer store actually gives you your own site within


-----

###### Amazon where you can send your list. And you get paid on all of the items in the Amazon Influencer store.
 To get an Influencer store, Amazon wants you to have a list of at least 1,000 people.
 Now in my Influencer store I have things like my favorite work tools, the books I love, traveling tools, and my own bestsellers. Check it out at https://www.amazon.com/shop/kimwalshphillips.
 The nice thing about the Influencer program is that they give you a ton of promotions. It’s not just like, “Okay, you set it up and forget it.” When Amazon has their Prime Day, they send out promotions you can run as an Influencer. Not only do they pay you commissions—they call them “bounties”—but they also pay a higher commission on certain things you can do all the time.
 For instance, during one Prime Day, if you gave away free trials of Audible that day, you got paid more. If you got people to sign up for a free subscription to Prime, you got paid more.
 If you have a list of a thousand people, and you’re not doing this yet, take advantage of it today to bring in an extra $100 to $1,000 dollars per month.

 2. YOUR BLOG If you don’t currently have a blog, I highly recommend it. I’ve had a blog in place for over 15 years, writing a weekly article. What this does is gives you media that you own. We don’t own Facebook, we don’t own Instagram, we don’t own LinkedIn. If they go away tomorrow, and that’s where all of your content is housed, you’re screwed. But if you have a blog, you will own a piece of valuable real estate where your audience is used to coming. (Get a full blog template at nobssocialmediabook.com/powerpack).
 The other really nice thing about this is it trains your audience to visit your site—before you’re trying to sell a product, program, or service. If they are only used to communicating with you inside Facebook or Instagram, or even just in email, then they’re not used to clicking to a landing page. You should teach them to find valuable content on your site that can help them.
 There are three ways you can monetize your blog:


-----

###### • Ad revenue. There are incredible ad platforms you can use in order to
 automatically get advertising on your site. You don’t even have to sell the ads. They get placed on there, and you just get paid for it.
 • Affiliate links in your content. You can promote products, programs,
 or services you like with affiliate links and get paid when your tribe purchases.
 • Run sponsored posts for somebody else. Brands like Disney, Target,
 and Staples will pay you to write a post featuring them in an article.

 For a blog, you can generate between $100 to $50,000 a month. Huge range, yes, but it all depends upon how much traffic you’re able to bring to your site.

 3. THE ALL AMAZING PODCAST Podcasting is incredible because of the listenership and the lack of expenses in having one.
 It costs you nothing to publish a podcast on iTunes. Nothing. While someday this may change, you can right now reach so many people for free, and you should.
 With podcasting, you don’t need to spend hours doing it. I put out quick daily episodes that take just five minutes to produce— quick tips every single day. You can stay short or go for as long as you’d like. To save time, I batch my episodes, spending an hour once a week, and knock out seven daily episodes.
 Sometimes I can even do it on the fly. One day we were on the way to the airport at 6:00 in the morning. My husband was driving, and I recorded my episodes that would post while we were on vacation.
 I take my iPhone and my headset and record my episode. It’s amazing. Now there’s more to it than that, of course, but you don’t have to have a big, complicated studio. In fact, you don’t have to invest in anything to do it.
 The stats behind podcasting are amazing:

 • 51% of the population listens to a podcast.
 • 22% of the U.S. population listens to a podcast weekly. There is not a
 single other television program or channel in the world that gets 22%


-----

###### of the U.S. population.
 • 80% of listeners reach at least the 80% mark, listening to 80% of the
 episode when listening to a podcast episode.
 • 32% are more likely to have an annual income of $75,000. 45% of
 podcast listeners are more likely to have a $250,000 annual income than the rest of the country.

 Your audience is engaged, and they have money. And you can make money on your podcast, whether you do it through promoting your own stuff or you take an ad revenue. Over $600 million was spent on podcast ads last year. People will pay you to produce content that you use to promote your business.
 It’s phenomenal. And you can sell your own product. On my podcast, Made to Thrive, we offer a free giveaway, and on the thank-you page for the giveaway, we offer our Made to Thrive Planner for sale. This campaign drives in leads and revenue every single month. We’re generating an extra $3,000 a month doing it. It costs me nothing, yet generates sale after sale after sale.

 4. PAID NEWSLETTER OR MAGAZINE Create content for your audience and get paid to do it.
 You can promote your products, your programs, your services, and get paid to put it out. This isn’t paying for lead generation. This is getting paid to grow yourself.
 We have RISE magazine and are able to give value to our market and promote our upcoming events and course launches.
 You can charge a subscription or put affiliate promotions inside. You’re getting a valuable piece of content out to your list every single month, and you’re getting paid to do it. Or you can just put your own offers in there.
 Incredible, right? With a magazine or newsletter, you can expect to generate between $100 to $1,000 per month. We’re at thousands of dollars, but that’s because we’ve been established for a while. If you’re just starting out, you can cover the cost of producing your magazine, and then you’ll profit after that— that’s a win.


-----

###### 5. CREATE A PRODUCT You could have a course, program, or offer services, or create a booklet, workbook, planner, or journal. These are products your audience will buy. Again, they’re paying you to market; they’re paying you to generate leads.
 The good news is, you don’t have to be the one to fulfill the orders. Every time someone orders one of my planners, City Blue Print prints it on- demand and mails it for us. I don’t touch it. We just make money from it. City Blue Print charge us per piece, so I don’t have this big inventory of products that I had to pay for ahead of time or worry about. Nope. As people purchase the planner, City Blue Print prints it and mails it, and we get the profit.
 Huge, right? By doing a printed product, you could generate between $500 to $10,000 a month.

 6. LEVERAGE OTHER PEOPLE’S AUDIENCES If you have a smaller list or just want to grow your own, this is for you—an expert book.
 Tony Robbins’ New York Times bestseller, Money: Master the Game (Simon & Schuster, 2014), wasn’t filled with his expertise. In fact, Tony didn’t come up with any of the content in that book. All he did was interview influencers. And then all of those influencers promoted the book.
 He assembled the content, built in promotions plans, and got a bestseller out of it.
 Guess what? You can do that same exact thing. In fact, we’re doing that right now with a book we offered out to our Powerful Professionals and mastermind members as an expert secrets book. It filled out with 25 authors right away. You can prepay an editor to assemble the whole thing and get a bestselling book while only having to write one chapter.
 From this strategy, you can make between $500 to $2,000 per month ongoing. I have a book from 2015 that still generates sales for me to this day.

 7. HOST AN EVENT OR ONLINE SUMMIT


-----

###### I’ve both been a guest on online summits and hosted them myself with other experts.
 Then guess what? Afterward, you can sell recordings of the livecast. Now you’re generating sales, and you didn’t have to create any content.
 Plus the guests on your show will promote the event to their lists. So, you’re also generating leads and generating income. This type of event could bring in between $1,000 to $20,000 when you launch. Then you can sell the recordings over and over again if you want.
