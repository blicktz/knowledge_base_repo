###### INTRODUCTION
#### LEARN THE SECRETS OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO
 HAVE CREATED A FLOOD OF NEW CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS, OR PATIENTS

-----

###### You have finally found it!

 The one place created for entrepreneurs and business owners BY entrepreneurs and business owners seeking to finally answer that common, nagging question:

#### “Why am I working harder and not
 seeing more money?”

###### All business owners, regardless of their current success or

 lack of success, are stuck—either you are growing or you’re dying. There is no middle ground. Which leaves you with

 great opportunity.

 You have worked hard, created a good business with a steady revenue, a somewhat reliable customer base, and

 profit margins that at least keep you above water.
 Yet, you feel like the proverbial hamster on the wheel. You

 keep running faster and faster and yet you can’t seem to

 break that cycle. Every day feels like a struggle just to keep your head above water. You’re wondering what happened to

 that dream of owning a business—a dream where you didn’t have to worry about money, where you could take an

 afternoon off care free to watch your child’s school play. What

 happened to that dream?
 You’ve tried marketing: you’ve spent serious money on ads

 that didn’t work, direct mail that under-delivered, Pay-Per- Click advertising that has drained your bank account dry, and

 probably a host of other approaches, none of which have

 delivered the results promised or expected.
 Like most business owners, you sometimes feel confused

 and overwhelmed; getting hammered on all sides with

-----

###### “advisors” saying do one thing or another after another; and feeling like you have to press harder, to do more and more—

 just to get the same results. Or less.

 I’m here to help you—to mute all that noise and provide you with a set of principles (not tactics) and the resources to

 magnetically attract clients who are ready, willing and able to move forward with you.

 And by resources, I mean my duplicatable machine for not

 only attracting clients, but converting clients and multiplying one client into two.

 Marketing is an ever-changing world, as new media seems

 to pop up every day, but if you learn the principles that allow you to magnetically attract clients, you can make any media

 at any time work. When you develop a system that feeds you new clients on a daily basis, you will never feel the anxiety of

 wondering when or where your next client will come from! In

 fact, you can finally take a vacation without checking your phone every hour.

 If you’re at least open to the notion that maybe, just maybe there’s a better way forward than the one you’ve traveled

 thus far— and if you’re reading this now with an open mind

 willing to cautiously believe in that possibility...
 Then this book is for you.

 WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK

 I’m here to offer a radical and challenging idea that just about everything you think you know and have been conditioned to

 believe about growing your business is wrong.

-----

###### I am here to mute the noise and guide you to clarity about a relatively short list of fundamental principles and strategies

 that can prevent you from being lost in a dense forest of

 media demanding your attention, time, and money.
 If you get it, you’ll smack yourself in the head for not

 seeing it all sooner, on your own. You’ll be in awe of how

 much sense it makes. You’ll never look at an ad, sales letter or website the same again. Traditional advertising and

 marketing will be ruined for you.
 But let me warn you—when you do get it, you’ll also be

 criticized by employees, argued with by everyone, and

 ridiculed by even family and friends. You will need your results and a steel spine to stay strong. The outstanding

 results you’ll see when shifting from ordinary marketing to response-driven marketing will convince you. You will need

 courage and discipline to stay your new course.

 I promise you that being thought a “fool” or “misguided renegade” and having millions of dollars trumps being

 thought of as “normal” and “correct” and “proper” and barely making a living.

 WHERE DID THESE IDEAS ORIGINATE?

 These ideas began with a discovery—or more accurately, a

 series of discoveries—that could well form the most important realization you w
ill ever arrive at as a business person. It’s

 disappointing and frustrating at first
, but empowering if embraced and acted upon.

 I discovered:

-----

###### You can have the most wonderful product or greatest

 service ever invented and still starve.

 You can be a spectacular sales person and still starve.

 You can have a positive attitude that Norman Vincent

 Peale would envy and be as motivated as a participant at a Tony Robbins seminar and still

 starve.

 You can be a master closer, closing sales at will left

 and right, and still starve.

 You can provide great value, great service, great expertise and still starve.

 Your business can literally be a paragon of virtues,

 with the world seemingly singing your praises 24/7, and even as you bask in their applause, you can still starve.

 The realization you must come to is this: you could very well

 starve, you won’t get rich, and you certainly won’t have peace of mind…
 Unless and until you have an affordable, efficient,

 dependable means of attracting a sufficient flow of qualified LEADS and BUYERS.
 Most business owners sort of know this but they still focus on everything but the one thing that will make all the

 difference in the world to their success: Marketing.
 All the frustrations and internal problems you’re experiencing with your business today are because you

-----

###### DON’T have a good Marketing System
.
 Many businesses have good products, good services—all

 that and more—but they fail because they can’t give themselves enough sales opportunities. To paraphrase Thoreau, most business owners lead lives of desperation

 because they don’t know how to create a steady and sufficient supply of qualified customers.

 IT’S TIME FOR A DIFFERENT VISION

 I’ve been teaching these principles in various forms since the mid-1970s—due to the dire economic conditions at that time, I referred to them as “The Small Business Emergency Survival

 Kit.” They have gradually grown into the system I call “Magnetic Marketing
 ” today, which has quickly spread throughout the United States and all over the world.
 The principles in this book have been tested over and over

 again, not just by myself, but by entrepreneurs and business owners of all shapes, sizes, locations, and industries. Today, we have students in 167 different countries using these

 principles to create a steady flow of new customers, clients, or patients in their businesses. They use these strategies to scale, grow, and differentiate their businesses—to rise above

 price competition and to quickly demand (and receive) top dollar for their services.
 As you read through this book, you may feel as if you have

 heard pieces of this before. I hope you have. I have been sharing these principles since the 1970’s. Hundreds of thousands heard my message when I was on the SUCCESS Tour, have purchased my training programs, have

-----

###### participated in my coaching groups, or have been private clients. Thanks to Magnetic Marketing|No B.S. Inner Circle,

 this message, these principles and their influence continue to grow. There are many out there teaching these ideas, some give me credit, some don’t.

 Today, you are hearing the entire story, straight from the horse’s mouth.
 Today, I am here to give you the entire vision plus the architecture that will allow you to make this vision a reality.

 The vision of being the prosperous owner of a real business —not of random or episodic income events, not of endless need for the next new promotion, not of frequent worry where

 the next sale might come from.
 The vision of certainty and security and stability. Of a continuous and steady inflow of desired customers, clients,

 patients, subscribers, or members. Even of creating equity and wealth, not just day to day income.
 The vision based on two specific promises I’ll make

 concerning what you’ll discover as you go through this book:

 1. I promise to take you beyond just another trick or
 two that might
increase conversion on a website temporarily or that everybody is excited about

 momentarily and instead, show you a SYSTEM for marketing that you can quickly begin using to make significantly more money across ALL your

 communication channels and media choices.

 2. I will—in this book—reveal the powerful, proven
 secrets to attracting opportunity, customers and

-----

###### clients in abundance, and creating sustainable businesses. You’ll realize what you must
build for

 yourself
to create true freedom, stability, and scalability in your business

 You do NOT need any special background, education, or skills to use this—other than commitment to use it. You can apply it

 to any kind of business serving any kind of market. I have students using what I’ll share here with businesses in health, retail, fitness, finance, coaching, trades—you name it. You’ll

 meet people later who’ll demonstrate exactly how this SYSTEM worked for them.
 For now, know that YOU CAN turbo-charge your ability to

 magnetically attract and achieve with what you’ll discover on the following pages.
 Let’s begin.

 P.S. You do NOT need to read this entire book before also taking some next steps to connect with me and with Magnetic Marketing|No B.S. Inner Circle. Feel free to take advantage of the invitations on the next page NOW.
