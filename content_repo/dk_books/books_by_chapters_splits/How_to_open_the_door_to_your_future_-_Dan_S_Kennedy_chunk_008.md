   severely limited. A high school diploma is, today, virtually
  a NECESSIPr". Beyond that. Career Training (such as
   that described in Chapter 7) is the big breakthrough for
   tens of thousands of people each year.
    "People are afraid of the future, the unknown. If a
   man faces up to it, and takes the dare of the future,
   he can have some control over his destiny. Thaf s
   an exciting idea to me. Better than waiting with
   everybody else to see what's going to happen."
          - John Glenn, Jr.
      Astronaut, U.S. Senator
   Actually, Career THINKING even precedes Career
   Training. Career THINKING is the change, in your own
   mind, from "jobs" and "paychecks" to a "career" and a
   "career path." The word "path" is important; it says you
   are involved in a career you can develop, move fonA/ard
   with, progress from one level to the next. It says there is
   opportunity for growth, now and in the foreseeable future.
  To stimulate your Career Thinking, a list of such careers
  appears at the end of this Chapter.
   Incidentally, as you look through this list and think about
   career choices and options, it's helpful to remember that
  your own intuition or "gut instinct about which career path
   to follow will probably be right.
  Your subconscious mind is a vast, computerized
  storehouse of information and ideas — many you have
   put away there and consciously forgotten atx)ut. When

   "computer sort" through all the related, stored information,
    quickly organizes and summarizes it, and communicates
        it to you, through that "little voice" inside your head. A
    pioneer of the self-improvement field, Dr. Edward Kramer,
    taught that "no problem ever comes to you for which the
   answer is not already within you" and "man is deaf until he
   hears the inner voice of his own being."
   You can and should place quite a bit of trust in what your
   own "inner voice" has to say about your career.
       Yes, You Can Get A Better Job. .
     Take The Next Step Up In Your Career
       (Even In A "Tough" Economy)
   What do you think the Number One "Workplace Problem"
    of the mid-1 990's is? It may be the misconception that no
   one is hiring! The United States Bureau of Labor's officials
    claim that over 1 million unemployed individuals believe
    that there just aren't any good jobs. The government has
   invented a term for these people. It calls them
   "discouraged workers." These people have, for one
   reason or another, taken themselves out of the job
    market. They aren't even trying to get a job. And this
    doesn't count the even larger number of "discouraged
   employed workers" who may be in jobs they don't like or
   may be overdue for raises, promotions or advancement,
    but are so fearful of the 'lough" job market, they aren't
    looking for better positions either.
    Actual statistics and business surveys do not support
   these fears and feelings.

  read in the newspaper or hear on the news about some
  huge company laying off wori<ers or eliminating jobs — but
  what they don't tell you about in the news are the hundreds
   of smaller, growing companies in that same field hiring and
   eageriy looking for new employees!
   Yes, there is a shift going on in our economy called "Down-
   sizing," and that fuels these news reports at)out the giant
  companies axing 500 jobs here, 1 ,000 jobs there. But this
   trend is offset by growth elsewhere in the economy.
  The plain truth is that there are (and always will be) plenty
   of opportunities for a person who steps fonA^ard with
   sufficient education and preparation, positive references
  from past employers and others, a positive attitude, and
  an honest desire to develop a career.
    4 Proven Keys To Getting A Better Job
  Key#1: An Optimistic. Determined Attitude . Take the
  above facts to heart. Ignore the negative news about the
   'lough" economy or 'lough" job market. Instead, focus on
  the fact that there are always opportunities for top-quality
  people — and thats you!
  Key#2: Organize Your "Sales Story" . Few people think of
     it this way, but you are actually "selling" yourself and your
   sen/ices to an employer. Before even attempting to
  arrange job interviews or going in to fill out any
   applications, make notes of your best qualities, past
  accomplishments, reasons why a company should hire
   you, and references. Carry these notes with you, if you
  are filling out job applications, or use them in preparing a

```

-----

```
   Key#3: Don't Limit Yourself To Advertised Openings .
    Sure, you should check the "Help Wanteds" in your city
   newspaper, maybe nearby city and town newspapers,
   maybe even publications like the National Employment
   Weekly or trade magazines in your particular field,
   depending on how far along you are in your career. But
    don't stop there! Most people further their careers through
    the "hidden job market," not through advertised openings.
    The Secret Of The "Hidden" Job Market
   Based on research done by some of the largest
   employment agencies and outplacement firms in the
    country, we estimate that less than 25% of all the jobs
   paying more than $1,500.00 a month are filled by
   employment agencies or applicants responding to help
   wanted ads. In fact, many of these jobs are never
    advertised at all! About 75% of these jobs are filled by
   recommendation and referral; someone already working
    at that company refers a friend. . .by 'lips" — "I hear XYZ
     is hiring. . ." — or by prospective employees presenting
   themselves to companies without regard to whether they
    are known to be hiring or filling a position at that moment.
    This ["75%] Factor" tells you that you need to DIVERSIFY
   your job search. For example, you'll want to let everybody
   you know who is employed anywhere, as well as "center
    of influence" type people like your, or your family's,
    accountant, lawyer, banker, know that you are interested
     in finding a particular type of position. Put the word out!
    Build a 'target lisf of companies you think you'd like to
   work for and contact them, even if they are not advertising
   any openings or known to be hiring.

   education like Education Direct Career Training, and
   informal self-study with books, other publications, classes
  and seminars, you will benefit greatly by being in the "getting
   ready for my next, better position" mode all the time.
     Three Proven Keys To Job Security,
        Raises And Promotions
   Key#1 : Out-Perform Your Job . It may take a bit longer than
  you would like, but no one doing truly excellent, outstanding
   wori< can go unnoticed or unrewarded very long. Excellence
   at "snnall things" inevitably leads to big opportunities.
    "In effect, the quality of a person's life is
     in direct proportion to commitment to
     excellence, regardless of the field of
    endeavor/'
        - Coach \^ce Lombard!
  Key #2: Create Opportunity In Or On Your Job . There's an
   interesting word: Intrapreneurship." Sort of "an inside
   entrepreneur." [*] A fancy way of talking about creating new
   opportunities within the corporate structure and
   environment. Expanding the scope and value of a job.
  The Intrapreneur*' not only does his assigned, described
   job well, but is alert for opportunities to expand that job,
  and is prone to bring new, carefully thought out kleas for
   improving some aspect of his job or his employer's
   business fon/vard.

     qualified." But a sure way to move up from one job to a
    better one is to develop the education, thinking, habits,
    behavior and image of someone who has that better job.
   Should You Consider ''Entrepreneurship " * ^
   There is a home-based business and entrepreneurial
    explosion going on all around you! By starting your own
    business, from home, in your spare time, you not only have
   an opportunity to earn extra income but also to develop new
   and varied skills, greater self-confidence and useful contacts.
   You may later find a way to grow your spare time business
     into a full-time business, and become your own boss for life.
   Of course, not everybody is cut out to be an entrepreneur,*
    especially on a full-time basis. But you may want to at least
    explore this option. Information about Harcourt programs
     for people interested in having their own businesses
    appears in Chapter 7.
    *"Entrepreneur" refers to someone who takes on a certain
   amount of risk to start his own business enterprise, is his
   own boss.
        "What I want to tell you today is...
         throw yourself into the convulsions
           of the world. . .live in it.
         Take chances. Make your own work,
          take pride in it, seize the moment."
                  - Joan Didion

  How To Gain Favorable Attention
   For Your Ideas And Your Abilities
   Progress in just about any career requires the development
    of certain "people skills." Communication, persuasion,
    influence, and leadership all play a role. Thafs probably
   why, after not just years, but decades, the famous book
    written by Dale Carnegie — "How To Win Friends And
    Influence People" — continues to sell tens of thousands of
   copies every year, year after year.
     In most companies and business environments, there is
   competition for the attention of upper management, for
    recognition, raises, promotions and other opportunities.
   Sometimes that competition among peers and co-
   workers is very obvious and open, other times it is less
   open and a bit more subtle. Still, from time to time, you will
   be thrust into a situation where you have an opportunity to
    "shine." And at all times, you'll have the opportunity to
   "stand out." So, how do you gain favorable attention for
    yourself, your abilities and your ideas?
     First: the ability to communicate effectively . You will
   always be judged by what comes out of your mouth. . .
   your choice of words, the level and diversity of your
   vocabulary, and how well organized the thoughts you
   express are. For starters, the kind of 'street slang' and
   Verbal shorthand' we commonly use with friends is not
   going to gain points for you in the business world. Beyond
    that, any number of surveys and studies have confirmed
    that people do judge your intelligence and ability based on
   the words you use. Fortunately, there are many things you

```

```
  read, very inexpensive community college classes,
  Learning Annex classes (if there's an Annex in your area),
  even audio and video tapes you can listen to and watch.
  Second: your personal image . Here is the best advice you
  can get about dress and personal appearance as it
  relates to a career: look and dress one "step" better than
  your current job requires. If you're a mechanic, for
  example, and could get away with oil-stained, dirty
  coveralls or work clothes, wear clean, neatly pressed
  work clothes. If you can get away with a sport coat and
  open-collared shirt, wear a shirt and tie. Instead of doing
  what you can "get away with," go just one step better. And
  always look your best, under whatever conditions you find
  yourself in. Haircuts, clean nails, neat clothes, ifs all
  important.
 We had a conversation with a young woman who had
  applied for a job in a yogurt/fast food chain store and been
   told that she would have to dress differently and better
  than she had on the interview, to be able to work there.
  She had gone to the interview in a T-shirt with a rock
  group's name and images on it and washed out jeans with
  strategically placed holes. She was outraged over this.
  Angry. Mad. 'What right do they have to tell me how to
  dress?"
  Well, they DON'T have that right — unless you want to get
  money from them, as a result of taking care of their
  customers. Then they certainly do have that right. And
  they're not just imposing their personal ideas and
  preferences. They have a certain image they want their
  business to put out, they believe their customers respond

```

```
       It may NOT be fair, but America DOES judge a book by
      its cover! People make judgments about your status and
    importance, your seriousness about your job, even your
     ability based on how you dress. As a kid, you may have
   heard the adage: 'You never get a second chance to
   make a good first impression." It turns out there is plenty
    of scientific evidence to support this idea! Most people
   form an impression of you in their subconscious minds
    within the first 30 seconds of meeting you, and they are
    very reluctant to change that impression later. Obviously
    that impression cannot be based on what you say or what
   you know — how could they tell much about that in just
   30 seconds? So it IS based on your appearance. (If you
     try to think in temris of "marketing" yourself, then ifs your
    "packaging." And think how important packaging is to
    products you choose and pick off of shelves.)
    Third: be well-informed . In whatever work "specialty" you
    find yourself in as well as the one in which you want to
   develop your career, you should be an up-to-date, well-
    read, well-informed expert. This means having or getting
      all the related formal education you can. It also means
    reading the current literature in the field: any books
    published by people in that field or about that field, the
    trade magazines and journals published for that field, plus
   some general business information won't hurt.
   Lefs say you're an electrician. There are trade magazines
    published just for electricians, others for electrical
    contractors and owners and managers of such
   companies. You should certainly be reading the trade

```

-----

```
  you should be reading their trade magazines too.
   In addition, people again judge your intelligence and
   ability by how well informed you are in general. You can't
   afford to just ignore the news of the day.
   Fourth: personality and attitude . There are very, very few
   occupations where personality is unimportant. When
   Fortune 500 company executives are asked how they
  choose people to promote and what they look for in
   people, they invariably talk about "attitude" and
   "personality" before anything else. But how do you define
   "a good attitude" or "a good personality"? Most people
   react to that like they do to pornography: / can't define it,
   but I know it when I see it! But here are a few hints or clues:
  People judged by others to
  have a good personality
  seem to be patient, active "Everything can be
   listeners. . .encouraging and taken from a man but
  complimentary to others. . . one thing: the last of
   generally cheerful and human fr-eedoms — to
   optimistic. . .and curious, in- choose one's attitude
   terested in learning and in any given set of
  knowing about new things. If circumstances — to
  a person leaves a conversa- choose one's own
   tion, meeting or other en- way."
   counter with you feeling that - Dr. Victor Frankl,
  you really listened to his Author and
   opinions and what he had to psychiatrist.
   say, and feeling "better" than Author, "Man's
  he did to start with, he is Search For Meaning"
   very likely to categorize you
