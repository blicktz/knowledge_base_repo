## You probably remember “body language” as kind of a business fad. For a while, everybody was writing about body language, everybody was talking about body language. It was “hot.” Then the business public moved its attention to the next panacea and it was pretty much forgotten. If you find a book on body language at the bookstore today, it’ll be buried on a bottom shelf with dust on it.
 However, it’s as valid as ever. We communicate much more, much more openly nonverbally than we do verbally. Even while our lips lie, our physical movements tell the truth. (Some people have a real problem with their facial expressions and other physical movement matching what they’re saying so that, while others may not realize it consciously, it makes them uncomfortable subconsciously, so that they do not trust that person.)
 There are two ways to use an understanding of body language. One is in the reading of others’ minds. How do you tell when the person across the desk has “bought” your idea? If there are ten women at the bar, how do you tell which one is eager to be asked to dance? If you’re a speaker, and there are 20 people in the front row, how can you tell which one is alone? In an office setting, how can you determine when someone is really “in a good mood,” to approach them with your idea or request?
 The second use of an understanding of body language is in reinforcing and empowering your own verbal communication. You can first make sure that your physical movements and facial expressions are congruent with what you’re saying and how you’re saying it. You can go beyond that and make your physicality communicate on a level by itself. There are masters at this. If you watch the Personal Power/Tony Robbins TV infomercial with the sound turned off, you’ll still pick up a certain positive, intriguing energy from Tony throughout the show, but if you watch many other people being interviewed (regrettably, myself included) that doesn’t shine through. Glenn Turner has a particular body movement he makes during the course of a motivational speech, hooked to an especially compelling and persuasive

## point, that draws the audience’s attention, pulls them toward him, actually moves them to the edges of their seats.
 In one-on-one selling, I’ve learned there’s a physical “way” that communicates neediness to the other person, and drives away sales. There’s a different physical “way” that communicates complete dispassion about whether or not the sale gets made, that draws sales in. For want of a better way to describe it, the relaxed body language wins every time.
 In Johnny Carson’s closing broadcast, he brought a stool out on stage and sat down on the stool, to talk to the studio audience and viewers at home—I think the first time he had ever sat down on a stool on stage. Why did he do that? By doing that he instantly and more effectively communicated: “Tonight is very different and very special, and I’m going to deal with it and you differently, more intimately than ever before. I’m not going to talk at you; I’m going to share with you” than if he had said all that a hundred times over.
 If you want to end a conversation, you can hasten the other person along with certain body language. If you don’t mind annoying the other person, looking at your watch is the blatant version of this.
 We can convey what’s on our minds and discover what’s on others’ minds with body language, and I suggest blowing the dust off the old body language books and making a fresh study of all this to be a very useful thing to do.

# Mirroring

## Tony Robbins has “popularized” this, but it’s not anything new. The Amazing Kreskin, a mind-reader by profession, wrote this, back in 1984:

 The ideal rapport is a mirror image of those you’re confronting. Let them see their best selves in you. If you’re talking to someone who’s bombastic, be pleasantly bombastic, but not competitive. If the person is shy and softspoken, reflect that tone in yourself . . . there’s a little of everyone else inside each of us, and the challenge is to find what in us is in tune with the other person and reflect it.

 Each of us has a particular way of speaking, a cadence, a speed, a vocabulary. Most of us appreciate a particular kind of humor—we don’t necessarily laugh at the same jokes that our neighbor does. Being in tune means reflecting these aspects of the other person.
 Even your physical presence can enhance or detract from rapport. I’m quick to remove the tie and jacket and roll up shirt sleeves the instant I sense my audience is in a casual mood . . .
 I study the person’s gestures. Does he use his hands a lot? I do too. If not, then I won’t either.
 Simply, people accept, trust, and spill their guts to people who they see themselves in. I’ve often done very well with hugely successful, entrepreneurial men who created their success out of dust, struggled, failed, recovered, made it through hard work and hustle—because they see themselves in me. Conversely, I have a rough time dealing with corporate, middle management bureaucrats who’ve gone from college to corporate environment, and are better at office politics than anything else—because they cannot see any of them reflected in me. But, when you really understand this, you can identify some “thing” about just about everybody you can mirror.
 Humor, mentioned by Kreskin, is a great mirroring opportunity. Recently, I was the odd man out, the new dynamic in a group of five people who had

## already been working together, been at several meetings together, and, although they were not in sync themselves, their corporate-political tendency would be and was to unite in fear and resistance against the “outsider.” As I sat there that morning, hoping for an opportunity to create rapport with somebody, the fifth guy rolled into the meeting room and told everybody a joke. In this case, it was a macho, coarse, “blue” joke, a locker- room joke. This told me a lot about that guy. Among other things, I decided to be a little “earthy” in my language, particularly when agreeing with or piggybacking on this guy’s comments. It wasn’t long before he “bought me,” became my ally, nodded approvingly when I made a point.
 I’ll tell you something very interesting about all this, hopefully in a way that is not offensive to anybody. I have a number of friends in the hair styling/hair salon industry, including a lady I’ve been friends with for many years—in fact, we dated between my marriages. Most of the men in her salon and, in my observation, in the industry, are openly gay. Women love these guys. They attach themselves to them, they confide in them, they tell them the most amazing things. We’ve talked about this, and everyone concludes that the reason is mirroring; these gay men mirror the women.
 There’s a fine line here, to be aware of. I do not suggest becoming a total chameleon, changing to match the other person like a chameleon changes colors to match his environment. That’s going too far. You have to be you; there has to be a core personality that is a constant. But short of cutting into that core personality, you can learn to modify your approach, to “lean” in the same direction as the other person you’re working with at the moment.
 The example of speed of speaking is a good one. Slowing or accelerating your speed of speaking is certainly not the same as comprising your personality. But it can be very helpful in making the other person comfortable.
 When you meet a new person for the first time, that person instantly provides a “snapshot” of what they’re comfortable with—their speed of speaking, their posture, their gestures—and you can immediately make some modifications in yourself, to mirror the other fellow. I think of it as about a 20% adjustment—80% of me stays constant, 20% tries to adapt, to mirror the other person I’m dealing with.

# The Right Image

## Your “outer package” does have an impact on how quickly and easily people accept you, trust you, relax with you, and reveal themselves to you.
 I can tell you for a fact, for example, that chiropractors who meet with new patients dressed “like a doctor” will get farther, faster, than the chiropractor who insists on being “casual.” There are occupational biases, geographic biases, all sorts of biases, and you can use them to your advantage or fight them, your choice.

# Be Prepared

## I’m amazed at the people who go into sales calls, negotiations, meetings, etc. wholly unprepared, either “winging it” or applying the same “canned” procedure to everybody. This is fine if you’re selling a nickel-and-dime commodity, but if you’re dealing in the “Important,” it’s best to be as prepared as possible.
 A lot of the people I deal with have books they’ve written or that have been written about them, tapes, there have been magazine or newspaper articles, or I know somebody who knows them—and, before a meeting, I’ll delve into as much of this as I can to get a feel for that person. For my high- priced seminars, I have attendees complete and turn in detailed questionnaires in advance, so I can get that feel for them before actually meeting them. From this kind of information, I’m often able to correctly anticipate how a particular person thinks, how they’re “wired.”

-----

# Observe

## I like meeting with people in their environments, because their environments reveal a lot about them.
 An office with a wall full of plaques and certificates says something very different compared to one with a wall full of photographs of people, doesn’t it? I deal with several ex-pro athletes. One has an office virtually devoid of memorabilia from his sports career. Another has an office full of footballs, trophies, photographs of teammates, and so on. What do these two offices communicate? I initially gambled and was proved right that the first person’s office says that he has decided to put all that behind him; in fact, he is eager to shed his jock past and be known for his entrepreneurial accomplishments. Talking sports with this guy is a mistake. Ignoring that entirely and zeroing in on business discussion is correct. The second fellow still clings to and relies on his on-field accomplishments and that celebrity. He is comfortable with that, still uncomfortable with the business world. Asking him for an autographed ball is the right thing to do.
 There’s a scene in the movie Shining Through where Michael Douglas asks Melanie Griffith to close her eyes and recall what she has noticed about his office. It’s a good test. When you go into a new environment, challenge yourself to be so observant that you can close your eyes after a minute and recall a lot of detail about the office. Then analyze what that office has to say about its occupant.

# The Chink in the Armor

## Everybody, no matter how successful, has at least one “chink in the armor” and knowing about it may help you better deal with that person. Often, in fact, more often than not, it’s a self-esteem related chink.
 For example, I have one client and friend, a very, very successful, smart, capable businesswoman, in the top 5% income bracket in the United States, probably in the top 5% in her particular profession, and, on the surface, understandably very confident and independent. But she is remarkably “hung up” on the fact that she did not attend college. Her feelings about this “lack” inhibit her and affect her in surprising ways. There’s another individual I deal with, again, in his profession enormously successful, but largely disliked by his peers, not respected by his staff, and totally taken for granted by his spouse. This guy is starved for recognition. I have a client who has gone through years of struggle, then several years of remarkable success; he is terrified that it’s going to end tomorrow. Can you see how being aware of the chinks in these peoples’ armor makes it easier to help them, if you’re into helping them; to sell to them; to manipulate them? To predict how they will respond to a particular idea or situation?

# Five Human Characteristics That Can Be Relied
 On; What Are People Thinking

## 1. Resistance to Change
 Yes, people can be motivated to accept, even welcome change, but, initially, the instant reaction to any and all proposed or perceived change is resistance, for a variety of reasons, including fear, inconvenience, laziness, territorial protectiveness, etc.

 2. Wandering Attention
 People have limited and decreasing attention spans. They lack the ability and know-how to concentrate. Their attention can easily be attracted by anything that is pleasurable, exciting, or entertaining. The more complex the idea you are presenting, the more certain “wandering attention” is. Therefore, at any given moment, you can bet the other person is thinking about personal concerns, his to-do list, a sexual fantasy, just about anything but the subject at hand.

 3. Wishful Listening
 People have the uncanny ability to hear what they want to hear, not what is being said. And they’ll later swear they heard what they believe they heard.

 4. Jumped to Conclusions
 People are impatient, so, rather than hearing another person out, they’ll often mentally cut him off and make an assumption about everything he’s

## saying.

 5. Habitual Negative Thinking
 Most people think mostly negative thoughts. Their first reaction will be to see the negative, the difficult, the impossible, and the unpleasant aspects of something.
 When you keep in mind that these five characteristics largely control the way a person is thinking most of the time, it becomes ridiculously easy to “predict” their specific thoughts and reactions in a particular situation. If using this for persuasive purposes, you then want to prepare with all this in mind and try to control these elements rather than letting them control the outcome.

# How Physical Characteristics Affect a Person’s
 Thinking

## It’s my belief that short men are more aggressive, meaner, if in power, more bullyish than tall men. Overweight men are more easily intimidated and more motivated by a desire for acceptance, recognition, and respect than men of average weight. Blonde, very attractive women are most eager to demonstrate their intellect, to be asked for their opinions on important matters. Women are much more observant than men, so a man’s dress and appearance is more important when meeting with a woman than when meeting with a man. A woman wearing a lot of jewelry is easily influenced by flattery; a woman wearing little or no jewelry will be turned off by casual flattery.
 All this is stored in my memory bank. I don’t think about it much, consciously; in fact, I had to work at dragging it out for this book, but it is there and it does influence my behavior with these types of people.
 What observations have you made about how physical characteristics are predictive of thinking and behavior?
 Sure, these are generalizations, biases. And I know that they are subject to attack as over-simplifications, and certainly subject to exception. But I ask that you keep in mind that I deal in one-on-one situations, with dozens of different people each week, a thousand or so a year, and, in groups, tens of thousands more, and I believe I have sufficient evidence to draw and reasonably rely on these conclusions. And when you consider the pace most of us are on these days, the speed at which we meet, greet, interact with, and move on, the use of pigeon-holing, of quickly categorizing people, is virtually essential.

# Demographic Clues to Attitudes

## People born and raised in the Midwest are more trusting and trustworthy than those raised in California.
 How do you feel about that statement? Sure, it’s unfair. There certainly are very trustworthy people born, raised, and living in California. I have one or two such clients there myself who have the highest imaginable integrity. And certainly there are some people of zero integrity born and raised in Kansas, Indiana, and Ohio. But, setting aside the individual cases and deliberately trying to develop a generalization that is truer than false, I’d bet on this one.
 Let’s stay with California for a second. Image and appearance is more important there than anywhere else in the United States. People in L.A. are much more likely to quickly form very firm conclusions about you based on the car you drive, clothes you wear, and whether or not you have a portable phone than people in, say New Orleans or Indianapolis. If you’re going to do business in L.A., you’d better get a grip on this.
 People raised in high-income families will have very different values and opinions than people raised in low-income families. People living in major metropolitan cities respond differently than those living in small towns, to just about everything. For example, there’s less cynicism in small town residents than in city dwellers. People with children—parents—certainly respond differently than do married couples who do not have children.
 In marketing to groups or people, we consider their demographic commonalities. When we can, we’ll deliver a very different marketing message for the same product to a group of 45-year-olds from Rhode Island than to 35-year-olds in Atlanta. And, different demographic groups are drawn to different products—for the most part, the women who regularly read Cosmopolitan are different than those who regularly read Redbook; the men who read Playboy different from those who read Hustler. Since all this applies to marketing to groups, why wouldn’t it apply to influencing individuals?
