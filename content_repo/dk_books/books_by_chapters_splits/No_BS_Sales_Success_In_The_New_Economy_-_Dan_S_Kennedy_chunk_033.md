## I try to get a “demographic profile” in my mind of the person I’m working with—what are his “vital statistics”?—age, income, marital and family status, home town, educational background, etc. I ask myself: who else do I know who closely matches that demographic profile? What is that person like?
 I happen to know a guy very, very well who is the demographic clone of H. Ross Perot. They both got their early entrepreneurial experience delivering newspapers on horseback. Their upbringing—virtually identical. I mean, their backgrounds are virtually interchangeable. As a result, watching Perot-thecandidate come forward was especially interesting to me. I know what Perot’s going to say before he says it. When Marilyn Quayle attacked him on the Today Show, I knew instantly how Perot would react and what he’d say. There’s a technical term for this: “demographic overlay.” If you can do a demographic overlay, you can quickly read someone’s mind.

# The Biggest Difference: “Think” vs “Feel”

## There is a substantial amount of very good, very interesting, and very sophisticated literature out there about the importance of communicating differently with men than with women, and you can make a study of all this if you like. But the shorthand, shortcut is that most (not all) males respond primarily on a “thinking” level; most (not all) women respond primarily on a “feeling” level . . . e.g., “how do you feel about that” vs. “what do you think about that?”
 If you want to achieve open communication, making this single adjustment and staying on the appropriate think/feel “channel” is very important.
 I’d add that women generally, and probably correctly, trust their “intuition,” instincts, subconscious mind’s opinions, whatever you want to call it, much more than men do. Whether they ever analytically sort it out or not, women seem more tuned into non-verbal communication, to confidence; they’ve got better built-in truth detectors than we do. (Except when “blinded” in a romantic relationship.)

# Be an Informed, Interesting Person

## You have to be able to talk with people about what interests them before you can get them to open up to you.
 I once built a very good relationship with a banker by getting involved with his obsession with fly-fishing. I didn’t know a damned thing about fishing when we met, but when I discovered the incredible commitment he had to his hobby, I went and got educated very quickly.
 As a general rule, the more you know about a broad, diverse range of “stuff,” the better. I have a client who loves horse racing—it so happens, I know a lot about horse racing, so, as Joan Rivers says, “we can talk.” I have another client who’s very into the theater. Before I visit with her, I make sure to get a copy of The New Yorker and the Sunday New York Times, to get caught up on what’s going on in the theater, so “we can talk.” I have a client who is very involved with . . . well, you get the idea. I suppose in any given month, I read dozens of trade magazines, dozens of specialty magazines, I watch TV programs dealing with subjects of interest to a client, and so on.
 I want to be informative AND entertaining. Compare the salaries of Jay Leno with a college dean, by the way, and you’ll instantly know which of the two is most important.

# How to Know When a Person’s Resistance Is
 Irrational

## The signs of irrational opposition are:
 1. VEHEMENCE. If a person expresses his disagreement with more intensity and excitement than the situation seems to warrant, he’s lost control. He may even be fighting an internal battle that has nothing much to do with you.
 2. STONE-WALLING. If a person is unresponsive, refuses to discuss or debate or ask questions.
 3. IRRELEVANCE. If a person introduces irrelevant arguments, goes off on tangents.
 4. OBJECTION PING-PONG. If a person introduces an objection, has it answered, trots out another objection, then another after it’s answered, then another.
 5. PARANOIA. If a person trots out a collection of “worst case scenarios.” When these “signs” occur, know that any attempt at logical persuasion will be thwarted. Your choices are a) to extricate yourself, retreat and return to persuade another day, or b) risk confronting the person about his behavior and asking for the real, hidden reasons for the resistance.
 It is, incidentally, almost impossible to change the mind of “the true believer.” He uses all five of these to keep himself linked to the chosen belief. If you want to understand his unshakeability and/or you are involved in creating “believers,” i.e., members, customers, recruits, etc., THE book to get and study is Eric Hoffer’s The True Believer. This book explains everything from David Duke, Ross Perot, etc. to Amway to Tim and Tammy Bakker.

# F.O.R.M.

## I teach this to people involved in multilevel network marketing, as the process for breaking the ice with strangers, getting conversations going, and very quickly finding out what’s most important to a person . . . but it’ll work for anybody, not just a network marketer.
 FORM is an acronym, to help you remember the four things to ask everybody about.
 F—STANDS FOR FAMILY For some people, family is THE most important thing in their life, and the path to fast rapport is ooh-ing and aah-ing over the snapshots of kids and grandkids.
 O—STANDS FOR OCCCUPATION For many people, their business or career is either their greatest area of pain or greatest area of joy, and expressing interest in that is like turning on a faucet.
 R—STANDS FOR RECREATION Some people live for their hobbies. Golfers, fishermen, and photographers, for example, are rabid about these activities.
 M—STANDS FOR MONEY A lot of people are extremely interested in everything related to money. If they see an art object in your home, they can’t help but wonder what you paid for it. I’ll always remember being in an adult nightclub (topless dancing establishment) with a group of entrepreneurs, noticing that the most successful guy had wandered off, and finding him back in the dressing (or “undressing”) room, sitting, surrounded by mostly naked, attractive women, studiously asking questions about gross sales, average tab, tips, and other financial statistics.

-----

## Each individual is more interested in one of these areas of life than the other three. Once you isolate which one a person is most interested in, you can often accurately predict what he’s thinking in response to certain stimulus.
 For example, take four guys hearing a news item about a very successful baseball player’s new contract. “F” thinks: my kid’s got an arm like a rocket. I hope he grows up and makes the majors. “O” thinks: what a dumb job, running around playing a kid’s game. “R” thinks: oughta get some of the guys together and play some ball this weekend. “M” thinks: geez, two mill a year! I wonder how much that works out to, each time at bat?
 Similarly, when you make ANY statement, the other person “processes” it “through” his primary interest in life, family, occupation, recreation, or money.

# The Power of Suggestion

## Some people bought this book not out of a desire to “read” others’ minds but, instead, to “control’ others’ minds. Without passing judgment, let me tell you that, to a great degree, you can do exactly that, if that is your chief aim. To control a GROUP of people, study Eric Hoffer’s book The True Believer. Probably without intending to, he provided a very practical, precise method for gaining control over a room full or a nation full of people.
 To control or direct an individual’s thoughts, rely on the single power of suggestion. For starters, lock this principle into your mind: people translate the words they hear into pictures, think in pictures, and are most readily led by pictures.
 If I say to you, “If you die, will you leave your family penniless and in poverty?” You automatically get a picture in your mind. Now that may be a classic, Depression-era picture of a woman and a couple urchins, in scruffy clothes, sitting on a doorstep. It might be a gleeful picture of your cheating, bitching, ungrateful wife bursting into tears at the reading of your will. It will be a picture, but I have exerted little control over what the picture will be. I could further suggest the nature of the picture, couldn’t I? And that’s the “trick”—to deliberately extend the suggestion.
 If I say: “Let’s take a week off and go to a beach somewhere” I’m again leaving the picture at risk. You may conjure up a positive, persuasive scene of you on a beach, getting a tan, watching gorgeous girls in skimpy bikinis, etc.—or you may pull up the very memorable picture of your last trip to Mexico, sunburn, stomach virus, and all. But if I fully detail my picture, I can make it your picture. If I say: “Let’s take a week off, go to the beach, get a couple of hammocks in good positions, a cooler of drinks, some good books, leave the cell phones locked up at home and really relax . . . and I know just the place, where there’ll be a good breeze, pure white sand, clear water, and lots of great-looking women . . .” What pictures are you forming in your mind now?

## Try this exercise. Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit. Sit down and clear your mind as best you can. Now think back to the last time you took a good, bracing hot shower—maybe this morning—and concentrate on your fingers and hands, the hot water splashing over them. Switch to starting and building a fire. See yourself rubbing your hands together over that great fire, soaking in the warmth.
 It won’t be long before your hands actually get warmer. The power of suggestion is so great that most people can raise or lower their entire body temperature or any part of their body by 10 to 15 degrees purely through mental imagery. There is a physiological reaction to a psychological exercise.
 Cavett Robert said “people won’t buy burial plots unless they see the hearse parked at the door.” He oughta know—he made a fortune teaching people how to sell burial insurance. And the key word there is “see.” So your job is to speak in a way that conveys the right pictures. Know that everything you say will become pictures—the question is: what pictures?
 When I say, from the front of the room in my marketing seminars, “Think about what it would be like to get up each and every morning KNOWING, absolutely knowing, exactly how many calls you will receive that day, from new prospects ready and eager to do business with you. What would that feel like? How would you like to live that way?” I’m hoping for some very definite pictures . . . that the person in the audience sees himself, getting up spryly, eagerly, rather than crawling out of bed; smiling into the mirror; maybe answering the phone and getting a pleasant call from a customer. But whenever time permits, I go ahead and add: “I’ll bet you’d get out of bed a little differently than you do some mornings now. I’ll bet you’d jump up and say ‘Good morning, God!’ instead of ‘Good God, it’s morning.’ I’ll bet you’d give that mirror a big smile.” This is suggestion at work.
 Now, any good hypnotist or hypno-therapist will tell you that some people are more “suggestible” than others, so this works differently with different people. And it’s rare that anybody gets so good at using the power of suggestion that he can literally, totally control another person’s responses. But make no mistake about it, everybody has some degree of receptivity to this type of suggestion, and anybody can learn to use this power.
