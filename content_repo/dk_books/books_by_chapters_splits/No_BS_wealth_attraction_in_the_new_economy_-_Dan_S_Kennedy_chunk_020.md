## Beware the Gold Star Syndrome

-----

#### There is a little lecture I always give to my peers who are professional speakers about The Gold Star Syndrome. I’ll bring it to you in a minute. But first, here’s what happens when most speakers get a booking. Let’s say someone’s asked to speak on October 7th for the International Hardware Retailers Association. The speaker hangs up the phone, pumps the air with celebratory fist, gets a file folder and writes Hardware Retailers Association on it and files it, goes over to the big calendar on the wall and sticks a big gold star on the October 7 square and writes IHRA on the star with a marker. Then he runs up the stairs from his basement office to tell his wife, and they go out to dinner and have steak and lobster to celebrate.
 This displays the fundamental misunderstanding of speaking as a business (which it isn’t) that keeps most speakers living gig to gig, paycheck to paycheck, as well as most business owners’ fundamental misunderstanding of what making a sale to a new customer is, which keeps most of them broke, too.
 In reality, there’s nothing here to celebrate (yet), anymore than there would be if the garden center delivered and dumped a huge truckload of manure in your backyard at the edge of your garden. It’s the s tart of the work to be done, not an end result or outcome. If you think of it as an end result, your garden would never flourish and you’d arrive at harvest time with nothing but a giant pile of rotting, stinking dung attracting flies.
 In speaking, when I put the gold star on a square on my calendar—and I did, for many years 40 to 70 times a year in addition to the 27 SUCCESS- event appearances each year, for a total of more than 1,500 compensated engagements during my stint [1] at it. The engagement’s included plenty of Iowa and Arkansas and Florida State Associations of this or that, and corporations like Honda, Pitney-Bowes, IBM, and franchise and sales organizations like Floor Coverings International and Sun Securities—it was the same as the starting gun firing; it was the start of a race to engineer as many ways and means and contributing factors as possible between then and the engagement date, to optimize the money made at and after the date. You need not be bored with the specific details, but there is a checklist of 20 smart questions to ask and things to do. A complex process to implement and manage.
 In every business, the same thing is true, the same opportunity exists and is, mostly, wasted. Someone calls and makes a reservation at your restaurant—the Gold Star Syndrome occurs. Of course, you could check

#### your file on the customer and have the assigned waitperson read the customer profile so they could ask about their dog, tell them the chef has prepared their favorite appetizer. If a new, first-time customer, you could Google[®] them to see if they are prominent or special or a potentially valuable center of influence. You could immediately FedEx them a special voucher to add two to four friends to their dinner party that night and receive a free bottle of wine for the table. Etc., etc. In every business, the same thing is true—the acquisition of a new customer is seen as a means of making a sale, and as an outcome ... not the starting point of a process. This reflects focus only on Present Bank, not Future Bank, of course, but it goes beyond and deeper than that, into your view of what kind of business you are in. To use the restaurant owner, is he in the business of selling and serving food? Or of acquiring and developing VIP customers with whom he has strong relationships, and developing and mining maximum equity in those assets? Another way to think about it is—where should the first gold star be awarded? Certainly not in advance of an actual event. Almost certainly not with the first transaction. There should be better benchmarks of effectiveness and success.
 Bring it all the way down to the simplest of situations. Your own daily life. When you go and dine at a restaurant for the first time, get clothes cleaned at a dry cleaners for the first time, go into a different shop of one kind or another for the first time—of the many, many times you do this, how many times have you immediately gotten a follow-up letter from the restaurant or shop owner thanking you for coming in and inviting you back? How many have sent you an interesting newsletter every month afterward, to create and maintain a presence with you? The answer will be: hardly any. Or: none. Your entering and departing their place of business is an “outcome” to them. To me, the person coming in for the very first time is a magnificent “opportunity.” The way you view it will determine what you do about it. Few businesses have any set means of identifying first-time customers, of getting their contact information to follow up. Even fewer do follow up. But I assure you, those few who do prosper as a result.

#### In an interview on CNBC, Lynda Resnick, who built Fiji Water and
 co-owns the POM Wonderful Nutrition Company, was asked what
 most people fail to understand about turning ideas into exceptionally successful companies. She said that they underestimate the work and attention to detail that must occur every
 day.

#### Now let’s talk about “process” versus “incident.” To take this to an “ordinary” business, consider the quick-oilchange shop in your neighborhood. They probably have a process in place to do “upsells”—additional things you need, like a new oil filter. They probably capture your contact information and send you a reminder postcard when it’s about time for your next oil change. But that’s it, and there’s so much more they could do. For example, they could try to sell you a coupon book of pre-paid services at a discount; they could find out about your spouse’s car or other cars in your family; they could immediately identify your neighbors via the criss-cross directory and send them a letter noting you were a happy customer, with coupons; they could be cross-promoting with a car wash; they should put you on their newsletter list so they “visit” you every month; they should get your birthday and send you a card. Rather than viewing your coming in for an oil change as an “incident,” they should view it as the start of a multi-faceted, continuing “process.”
 This requires a shift in the way you view your customers and prospects— as people to randomly sell something to, or as your most valuable assets, to build and maintain a solid fence around, to care for, coddle, develop strong relationships with, and multiply through referrals. Selling things to people

## Why Is Follow Up So Magnetic?

#### Wealth and rarity go together. The rarer the art, the piece of jewelry, the designer gown, the travel experience, the first edition book, the celebrity’s autograph, the professional expertise, the higher the price paid, the greater the appreciation, the greater the demand.
 Many people in many businesses tell me theirs is an ordinary or, worse, commoditized business where rarity and exclusivity just don’t apply. This reflects poverty of imagination, very much linked to financial poverty. Consider Disney for a moment. Their parks are open to and for the masses, and offer no rarity other than excellence. But there are different types of Disney hotels and resorts, from modestly priced to pricey and unique, like Animal Kingdom Lodge. There, if you pay the premium for a savannahview room, wild animals roam nearly within an ¡arm’s length of your balcony. Walk out and look a giraffe in the eye. If you stay on the concierge level—and only if you stay there—you can go on a backstage Safari at Dawn. If you wish, for about $125.00 an hour, you can hire your own personal guide to escort you through the parks. For a fee, your family can have a private lunch with a Disney Imagineer. If you own a time-share in the Vacation Club, there are lodgings with abundant numbers of suites but there are also a small number of tree houses. Disney creates tiers of exclusivity and rarity.
 But let’s assume for sake of argument that such examples fall on deaf ears, and you devoutly and stubbornly believe there’s nothing whatsoever about your products, services, expertise, or business rarer than rocks in the quarry; certainly not as rare as the Crown Jewels. There is still one rarity you can create and own, the rarest of attributes that is extremely attractive and magnetic to wealth precisely because of its rarity: diligent, fail-safe follow up. That can be installed in any business.

 Integrity

#### R elax. I’m not about to deliver a morality lecture. In fact, we can forget all about the very idea of morality for this discussion. We can simply be pragmatic. Pragmatism basically means doing what best serves your interests. Doing what delivers the results you desire. Doing what works.
 You need not think in terms of doing what’s right at all. Let’s just talk about doing the right things as pragmatists. Not what’s right morally. What’s right pragmatically.
 The number-one complaint everybody has about the people and companies they do business with, buy from, get mad at, and stop buying from is: The vendor doesn’t keep his promises.
 I’ve had quite a few lawyers in my private coaching groups. It’s not by design! I try to discourage them, but there they are. And they’ve confirmed for me as fact: the number one reason lawyers lose clients AND the number one cause of complaints about lawyers to the bar association is not incompetence or malpractice, not overcharging, not failure—it is merely

#### and simply not communicating with clients. In the printing industry, where I’ve owned businesses, have and had clients, done a lot of work, and spent millions myself, the number one reason that clients fire printers and go elsewhere is: missed deadlines. In the restaurant industry, the number one reason that companies stop ordering for delivery from a particular restaurant is: late delivery.

#### In virtually every business, the number-one factor in losing customers and turning customers into spreaders of bad news is
 actually very, very simple. It can be summarized as “stated or
 implicit promises not kept.”

#### Conversely, one of the biggest Wealth Attractants ever invented is simply saying what you will do and doing what you say. When you become known for absolute reliability, customers, clients, opportunity, and money will flow to you in ever-increasing abundance. The word spreads because you are so rare. Price competition becomes irrelevant.
 Like everyone else, I occasionally get myself into a situation where I can’t meet a deadline, can’t keep a promise. I am maniacal about not letting this happen, and take every commitment, from simple punctuality to the more complex seriously, so the operable word is “occasionally.” It makes me nuts when it does happen because, as a pragmatist, I know how detrimental to my interests it is. When it does occur, I’ve learned not to run and hide or ignore it and hope it goes unnoticed, but to confront it, to apologize, and to make it right. Again, not out of ethical or moral obligation but out of pragmatism; choosing the best business strategy.

#### And here’s something rather “advanced,” that very few entrepreneurs ever discover: A less appealing promise kept serves you better than making a more appealing promise you can’t, won’t, or don’t keep. I often find myself in discussions with prospective clients, where I may be given a high- fee, very lucrative copywriting assignment, and we have arrived at two issues—potential results and time; how can they know their investment will be profitable? How soon can they get the work from me? With the latter, naturally, they would like it yesterday or at least tomorrow, but the reality may be six, eight, twelve weeks. With the first issue, they’d like to be reassured of certain results. I would be more likely to close these sales by telling them what they want to hear, but I’d be much less likely to have a good relationship with that client over time. And I believe, on a certain level, the other fellow would know I was telling him what he wanted to hear. I say: I know what you’d like to hear about speed, but I am not going to make you promises I can’t keep. I say: I want you to remember there are no guarantees here, other than my best efforts bringing all my experience to bear. I do fail. I might fail with your project. This way I get their respect, not just a sale.
 The New Economy is a place where free, almost wild spending has been replaced with more limited, discriminate spending. There is a new insistence on reliability and trustworthiness. The yearning in consumers, investors, and businesspeople involved with other businesspeople is for authenticity, integrity, and reliability—not anxiety.

 Ask

#### This is even Biblical. Ask and ye shall receive.
 And everybody knows it. You don’t ask, you don’t get. Yet a whole lot of people who know it don’t actually practice it much. They go through life wanting all sorts of things they never seem to work up the courage to ask for. So they’re unhappy in their business because they don’t ask their clients, vendors and employees. They’re unhappy in their marriage because they don’t ask their spouse. By ‘ask’, I mean a composite of things. Clearly enunciating your desires, expectations and, when appropriate, demands. Asking people to do things as you want them done. Seeking co-operation and support.
 Even fewer people ask “outsiders.” I’ve found that it’s perfectly okay to ask for a lot from a lot of people. I ask people for information, advice, ideas, contacts and introductions, and all

_—MAGNET ON MY REFRIGER ATOR_

#### Just for example, I have had more than 250 different people involved in the initial promotion for the book you are reading and the other books in the No B.S. series. I got this publisher to do things they have not done for any other author (which they’d prefer I didn’t mention). I got famous and not- so-famous authors and speakers to send e-mails to their lists, “plug” the books in their speeches and newsletters, put information about the books up on their websites. I received more than 2.5 million (!) e-mails at zero cost. I got people to pay to host promotional events and tele-seminars. On and on and on. Mostly because I asked. Did I get everybody I asked to participate? No. But I got a whole lot more people to participate than if I hadn’t asked anybody. Did I get everybody to do everything I wanted them to do? No. But I got a lot more than if I hadn’t asked.
 I know a few other authors who are great askers. My friend, Mark Victor Hansen, co-creator of the publishing phenomenon, the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, is a phenomenal asker. If he meets a celebrity, king, president, athlete, CEO, anybody and everybody, he asks them for something, to somehow help him promote himself or his books or his causes, to introduce him to somebody else he wants to meet. You might think such asking, asking, asking would repel people and wind up with you standing alone as if you had body odor, but the opposite occurs. The asking is magnetic. Actually people, especially successful people, like being asked for their
