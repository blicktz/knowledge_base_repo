##### downscale college into an explosively growing, vibrant, robust, somewhat Disney®-fied showplace of academic excellence, creativity, and luxury.
 Amid one of the worst economic disruptions in 50 years, HPU has experienced tremendous growth. Philanthropic investors are generously and eagerly resourcing HPU. Armed with over $300 million in gifts and pledges since Dr. Qubein took over in 2005, including 10 gifts of $10 million and more, the university built new facilities to accommodate residential students, new athletic buildings and fields to support 16 NCAA Division 1 sports, and expanded its campus from 92 to 430 acres. It has quadrupled its student population, tripled its faculty, attracting educators with accomplished credentials in large numbers, and attracted students from all 50 states and more than 55 countries.
 One of the many things that distinguishes HPU from other universities is their emphasis on being the “premier life skills university.” Character development coupled with a highly visible mission that every student graduate with a growth and entrepreneurial mindset and confidence to overcome any obstacle that comes their way in the ever-changing, highly competitive world we live in is a message parents and students aren’t hearing anywhere else. HPU lives their tagline, “An extraordinary education in an inspiring environment with caring people,” asking themselves the question for every aspect of how they can be more extraordinary, more inspiring, or more caring. They heavily promote that every student has a success coach and a four-year Development of Life Skills, which includes teaching the art of persuasion, effective communication, and other skills that help students stand out (96% of students are working or in graduate school within six months of graduating).
 Another pillar is their emphasis on modeling values that resonate with the parents. From a recent issue of their magazine, Dr. Qubein’s words:

 It’s true—HPU is a God, family, and country institution. Values are important to us. Generosity, gratitude, service, and patriotism, among others, are cherished here. But more importantly, they are modeled here. You can’t teach values. So, I remind faculty and staff that we live, students watch, and students learn.

##### Parents don’t want to pay a lot for a diploma, but they will spend a lot to transform their child into an independent adult who isn’t intimidated by life’s obstacles.
 To demonstrate they can pull it off, Dr. Qubein’s accomplishments are highlighted front and center: an Ellis Island Medal of Honor winner, a nationally recognized speaker inducted into the National Speakers Hall of Fame, an author, an entrepreneur, a consultant to top corporations, and so on. Stories, testimonials, and interviews featuring faculty, students, parents, and community members are abundantly present.
 Even if a student doesn’t want to be an entrepreneur, many of the parents are entrepreneurs, so the message resonates with them. Every student has a success coach. Students are guided by global leaders and innovators such as Marc Randolph, Netflix cofounder, and Steve Wozniak, Apple cofounder, in HPU’s Entrepreneur-in-Residence mentorship program.
 The extraordinary environment is innovative, inspiring, and pristine. Statues of historical giants from Gandhi to Rosa Parks to Albert Einstein, inspirational quotes, and immaculate study areas are present throughout the campus. Extraordinary living extends to luxury residence halls with incredible amenities such as pools, basketball and volleyball courts, and even pet-friendly dorms. While the norm at most college campuses is that students desire to quickly move off campus, HPU students don’t want to leave, not even seniors. Ninety-three percent of students live on campus as compared to 40 percent that most colleges experience. There are upgraded housing options available, with tiered pricing too.
 Of course, Dr. Qubein’s professional and personal growth books are used in direct-marketing efforts. They’ve found that parents read and share these books. They are seen in the places where affluent, entrepreneurial parents hang out. For example, their magazine is in the terminal of every private airport—a place where they are isolated from other college materials. The magazine is really a catalog about growth mindset, life skills, entrepreneurial mindsets—the things influencers are attracted to, so even if they don’t have teens ready for college, they will talk about HPU with their friends who might be sending a kid off to college. They also polybag the magazine in the Business Journal occasionally in cities with business influencers, and consistently in North Carolina. The strategy is to be readily

#### CHAPTER 33

### How an Optician Repositioned His Business to
 Attract the Affluent

##### By Conor Heaney

# It was 2010. I was 30 years old, and I’d just bought my second optical
##### practice. The first one was ticking along nicely, and I felt ready for a challenge. So I bought a fixer upper, an established practice that was dangerously close to closing its doors.
 This was a business that went bankrupt in the late ’90s, had four different owners in ten years, and was notoriously difficult to make profitable. But unlike the previous owners, I have been able to make it a


-----

##### success. I had something they did not. A guide. And it now sits proudly on my bookshelf, dog-eared and tattered but used.
 There I was, at the beginning of a huge project to transform a failing business that I thought had potential as a high-end optical boutique, and then a copy of Dan Kennedy’s No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent lands on my desk. I couldn’t have asked for a better guide and manual to re-invent this business. It was the perfect opportunity for “testing” on a grand scale. And that’s the story I’d like to share with you here.
 I’m Conor Heaney. I’m an optometrist, and I own an optical practice in Manchester in the UK. Let me give you a quick rundown of how we turned a business around from the brink of bankruptcy to dizzy heights of success and achievement.
 But first, let me show you a few results that came from taking a business and repositioning it to appeal to the affluent:

 • The practice had 50% growth in the first two years. And it has grown
 every year since. We’re achieving an additional 17% growth this year again.
 • Our average sale value is over five times the industry average. Here in
 the UK the average amount spent on a pair of glasses is about £150. Our average is over £750 and clients routinely spend £2,000 to £3,000+ on their “eyewear.”
 • Over 80% of prospects that have an “Eyewear Style Consultation”
 purchase eyewear from us on the same day.

 The Reason Why Most Opticians Struggle Most optical practices are having an identity crisis. They simply don’t know what they are anymore. They create a confused and mixed-up identity of a medical-professional-fashion business. A Frankenstein monster. A business fashioned out of various different parts that don’t go very well together. They fail to differentiate themselves in the eyes of the modern customer. They lack a clear USP (Unique Selling Proposition). They try to appeal to everyone and as a result they don’t strongly appeal to anyone.
 Most opticians see themselves as a clinical or medical professional. But they exist in a retail environment. Most practices take a loss on the eye

##### examination in the hope that the person will buy glasses. That has always been the case. Now there is online competition selling glasses at cheap prices. Many customers go to an optician for an eye examination and take their prescription information and go elsewhere to buy glasses. They shop around for more stylish glasses (which is a big trend), or they go online to buy cheap glasses at a fraction of the price. So it’s a difficult time to be an optician.
 I believe that we are actually a retail business. We no longer have the luxury of assuming customers will come to us, have an eye examination, and buy glasses from us just because we’re their opticians. Customers don’t behave that way anymore. They now have far more choices when it comes to buying glasses. It is no longer seen as a purely functional purchase. People now see their eyewear as statement. For many it is something they enjoy wearing. We have many eyewear aficionados as clients.
 I once read about a shoe designer who said every morning she dressed from her shoes up. She’d pick the shoes and work the rest of her outfit around them. Well, we have clients that get dressed from their eyewear down. And they want the same feelings when purchasing new eyewear that they get when they make any other luxury purchase in any other category.

 A New Sales Process That Eliminates the Headaches of Retail We are a retail business that has developed a successful process that eliminates what all retailers hate: haphazard browsing, price comparison, time wasters, and being used as a “showroom” before buying online.
 If you’re in retail you’ll know what I’m talking about. The internet has trained some customers to behave badly and expect something for nothing. It has trained them to devalue everything that you do. You become a commodity in their eyes.
 And yes, they’re happy to waste your time, use your store as a showroom for trying things on, and take your product specifications to search online.
 I noticed an increasing trend in this kind of customer behavior in my first business. And it was one of the reasons I set out to design a business that cut out all of that.


-----

##### One low point sticks in my memory from around 2008. I was helping a prospect one day who walked in. He was looking for some new glasses for his wedding day and he had never been happy with how he looked in glasses. So he was searching for something different. Something special. And I pulled out all the stops. I introduced him to a new world of eyewear. And an hour later he had found a frame that he had fallen in love with. All he needed to do was to come back with his fiancée to make his final decision. And out he went feeling on top of the world, excited he had found something he would feel great wearing. He was full of praise for what I did and for how amazing the products were that I introduced him to.
 The very next day I got a text message from a friend who owned an opticians store in another part of the country. He wanted to know if we had the exact frame in stock that I had shown the prospect the day before. He said he had a guy who called and wanted to buy it. And the day after that I received another call from a different optician who I knew and he was asking about the same frame. This was a rare frame so it didn’t take much detective work to discover that the guy, who was singing my praises for guiding him to the perfect frame, was now taking the information and shopping around. But to rub salt in the wound, I was being hassled by other opticians to see if they could get the frame from me at wholesale prices so they could undercut me and make an easy sale to this guy. All this wasted time and hassle because we had no process to stop it. It was madness. That was one of the turning points for me to re-engineer my sales process.
 In the new practice we decided to tackle the problem head on. I decided to eliminate “browsing.” So we took the bold move of removing stock from display. No longer could anyone just walk in and try frames on and browse around and use us as a showroom. And I don’t mean that we put the frames in locked displays or behind glass. No. We removed the frames from display. We made the practice look more like an upscale hotel than an opticians. There were no frames in sight apart from a feature display, a display that wouldn’t look out of place in a modern art gallery.
 The environment looked great. But it kind of confused customers. The mantra we heard from anyone who walked in was “um, where are all the glasses?” But at least it became easy to engage in conversation with customers. Suddenly they couldn’t say, “I’m just looking!” We replaced “just looking” and “browsing” with a unique Eyewear Style Consultation.


-----

##### A Unique Eyewear Style Consultation I had two things I wanted to achieve with the Eyewear Style Consultation. I wanted to eliminate all the hassles of retail and regain control of the sales process. And I wanted to position this consultation in a way that differentiated us and gave us the position of “expert.” Something that is very attractive to affluent clients.
 We made it an appointment-based service. “By appointment” emphasized the professional expertise positioning and allowed us to control the sales process. It appeals to affluent clientele who are used to making appointments because their time is important. They like that they can schedule a time, come in, and see the expert. And it also means we can give a higher level of service by being better prepared, knowing who is coming in and when. It adds real value to what we do. And the perception it creates is useful if you want to sell a high-ticket item.
 We went a step further, too, and made the eyewear style consultation a core part of our business and one of our USPs. It is the perfect solution to a significant problem in our target market.
 From experience we know that the main problems our target customer has are:

 • They don’t know what glasses suit them and their face shape. That is,
 they don’t really know what they’re doing when it comes to choosing eyewear.
 • They’re bored of the same mainstream products they find in most
 opticians and they are looking for something different and stylish. They see themselves as an individual.
 • They have had a bad experience elsewhere so they are looking for an
 expert. They may have a complex prescription, or significant vision problems that weren’t handled well by the last optician. Or they may just have high standards and want the best.

 We position our eyewear style consultation as the solution to each of these problems. We didn’t just make this up. We strategically created a positioning as the solution to their problem. Our solution is perfect for affluent clients because:


-----

##### 1. Their time is important so they don’t want to spend one weekend—
 nevermind two or three weekends—shopping around on a grueling search for eyewear. 2. They value expertise. They want to see an expert. That is how they
 operate. 3. They expect the highest level of service. We are the perfect fit for
 them.

 Almost any business could do this. Figure out the biggest and most common problems your customers experience when it comes to your “thing.” Then offer some form of consultation where you address all those issues. Talk about the problems in your marketing. Show the client that you understand them. And position yourself as the expert. Position your consultation as the solution to their problems. Remember, often the biggest pain customers complain about is that the shopping process for your “thing” is confusing, unpleasant, inconvenient, time consuming, and frustrating. If you can transform their experience you’re on to a winner.

 There Must Be Sales Choreography In retail there has been a recent trend for uniquely designed, stylish interiors. Shops and boutiques that truly have created an amazing environment. And here in the UK we have our fair share of “trendy” opticians. But environment alone is not enough.
 The shopping environment is only the stage. It’s extremely important. It sets the scene, it creates a certain atmosphere, and it projects a message. It sets the customer’s expectations. But what matters a whole lot more is the performance that takes place on that stage. It is useful to think of your customer experience as a performance. Or a piece of theatre. Are the actors skilled and practiced at their performance? How well do they use their stage and their props? Do they know lines? Do they deliver them confidently? Is the script actually engaging? Do they know how to win over their audience?
 It’s not just about the building and environment that you create. It’s also about the people and the processes. This is stagecraft. This is sales choreography. Without it, all you have is a building. Yes, it might be a very nice building, an impressive environment. But it is just a building. It is the

##### people inside the building that bring it alive and use it to create an experience. And the way people create a memorable experience is through choreography and practice.
