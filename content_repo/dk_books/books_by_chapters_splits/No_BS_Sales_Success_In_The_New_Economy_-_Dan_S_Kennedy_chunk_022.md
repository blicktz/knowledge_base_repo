## keeping burglars out than the burglars know about getting in!” That single quote from the Cleveland daily newspaper is a very valuable asset this security system salesman can use and profit from enormously, for years to come.
 Another publicity idea for your business would be to exploit your success stories. Suppose shortly after you sell and install a security system in the Browns’ home a burglar tries to get in, and is scared away by the alarms. When Ms. Brown calls to thank you with this story, grab your video camera, get out there, and get her testimonial on videotape. With her permission, you might issue a news release to local media, get an article published, then even mail copies to the neighbors.
 Now, how do you use all this? Well, let me give you one possible scenario, what I would do in this position. When a call comes in from a homeowner asking me about a security system for his home, I would say: “Mr. Homeowner, I’m extremely busy and cannot do justice to your questions today. However, I have a complete information kit that I’ll send to you, and I ask that you review it carefully. Then if you think I’m the right expert to assist you with your home security, call me back. If you choose another source, the information will still help you.”
 Then I would have a messenger deliver a nice, big box to Mr. Homeowner. Inside the box would be my information kit, which would include:
 1. A copy of my book on home security. 2. An audio CD of highlights from my best radio talk show interview.
 3. A couple of copies of my newsletter. 4. A page of quotes, “What the Media Says about Dan Kennedy, Home Security Expert.”
 5. A page that looks like an article about the Browns’, headlined: Even Though We Thought It Would Never Happen to Us, If We Had Waited Just Three More Days, Our Home Would Have Been Cleaned Out by Burglars!
 6. A page titled: “All Sources of Security Assistance Are NOT Equal,” which lists your “credibility items” and statistics.
 7. A list of famous clients and client testimonials. Finally, and this is very important, I would include a certificate waiving my usual $250.00 fee for a home and family protection consultation.

## My term for this is a “shock and awe box,” so named because it’s a (pleasant) shock for the consumer to get such a comprehensive collection of nicely presented information, when, at best, he might get a brochure from others, and everything in it building up your status is intended to create awe.
 Now, when Mr. Homeowner calls me, what will the positioning be like? Will he perceive me as “just another salesperson?” Not likely.

# The Final Component

## Pain—the desire to get relief from pain, physical pain, emotional pain, or financial pain—is the strongest motivational power of all. From the top-of- the-tower corporate boardroom to the working person’s small apartment, people are most moved to stop pain.
 I want two things when I’m selling. First, I want someone who knows he or she has a problem that is causing some pain and, second, I want someone who perceives me as the person best qualified and most likely to solve that problem and end that pain.
 In the example above of the home security business, I first want the prospective client to call me because he or she feels a need for protection. Then, I want to use “tools,” not my time and energy, to let the client arrive at the conclusion that I’m the person best qualified to help take care of that need.

# “Gee, This Sounds Like a Lot of Work”

## Well, I guess it is a lot of work. But when you compare it to all the work inherent in old-fashioned, traditional prospecting, you’ll see that my methods provide a better, continuing pay-off for effort invested. With my methods, the work is front end loaded—you have to do a lot of work to assemble your tools, engineer your system, and get it functional, up and running. But then it does a lot of work for you. If you stick to the old ways, you have to do a lot of work, the same work, work that inevitably becomes mind-numbing, energy-sapping drudgery over and over and over again, day after excruciating day.
 Sales professionals dependent on traditional prospecting have to go to sleep most nights wondering where their next prospect is coming from. They get up most mornings without anybody waiting for them to sell to. These salespeople spend a lot of time hanging around the office, at the coffee shop counter and, in the afternoons, at the movie theater, avoiding prospecting. Then they spend a lot of time doing manual labor prospecting, usually when desperate. Ultimately, they spend comparatively little time selling.
 The sales professional who masters my methods goes to sleep most nights booked solid for the next day with appointments, with people very likely to buy from him or her.
 This is more than a choice of business strategies. This is a lifestyle choice.
