###### doing is far, far more profitable than the limited number of webinars they can do live.
 There is no comparison to what you can do live versus automated.

##### Types of StealthSeminar Events

###### There is no limit to the types of events you can create. Do you want more leads? You can automate it. Do you want more sales? You can generate them daily. Do you want to deliver paid content on autopilot? Done. Bonuses? Great. People are using StealthSeminar in all aspects of their business.
 Let’s look closer at three different case studies: a strategy session close, a direct product sale, and one in the financial industry.

 The Strategy Session Close

 In more complex sales, it helps to speak to someone personally. These types of sales usually involve higher-ticket items or a lot of delivery variables.

 CASE STUDY: STRATEGY SESSION WEBINAR

 ORGANIZATION: CLIENTS ON DEMAND™

 Russell Ruffino is the entrepreneur behind Clients on Demand™. Ruffino is one of today’s most successful internet marketing gurus.

 THE CHALLENGE

 His business success depends on generating leads, establishing trust, and qualifying them to guide those that are appropriate to the next step—a Strategy Session on the phone. Ruffino experimented with all different types of lead-generation strategies to achieve those goals, including downloads, mind maps, minicourses, videos, and even a book. They were doing well but not as well as he wanted.
 Then, he tested an automated webinar. The webinar became his most successful strategy up to that point. His business was growing, but it was


-----

###### not doing what it should have been doing.
 The automated webinar software he was testing was not StealthSeminar. He noticed the other automated webinar systems he tried were not stable. Sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn’t.
 In addition, he noticed none of the other automated webinar software converted for mobile traffic, which now makes up 51% of all traffic. StealthSeminar alone is the only one that runs webinars correctly on iPhone. All others show a video length and fast forward button. That isn’t good if you want to control how your attendees consume the content.

 THE SOLUTION

 Russell Ruffino tried StealthSeminar. He was amazed with the results. His business soared 1503.33% initially using Stealth-Seminar and since then, much more (see Figure 14.2 on page 123).
 Ruffino has found the best way to connect with potential clients, build trust, and qualify them is via a StealthSeminar.
 He has a fantastic webinar that his attendees love. During the webinar, the attendees, who have no previous knowledge of Ruffino, are introduced to him and his system. Ruffino provides terrific content, builds trust, makes the connection with each attendee, and then drives those who are qualified to make an appointment. A link appears for the attendees to click on to set an appointment for a Strategy Session.

###### On the Strategy Session, the prospect learns more about the program and is further qualified. If the match is appropriate, the offer is made for the individual to join Russell Ruffino and Clients on Demand.

 The Direct-Sale Webinar

 In simpler sales, speaking to someone is not required and often can cost you sales. These types of sales typically run from $47.00 to $2,500.00. The sweet spot for direct-sales webinars is $197.00 to $1,497.00.

###### Christian Helmut is the driving force behind Alfonso & Christian (http://AlfonsoyChristian.com/blog). They are business growth consultants running multiple businesses and multiple different webinar types. They help people scale and automate their processes. Lets look at a direct-sale webinar.

 THE CHALLENGE

 Christian Helmut wanted to automate the sales cycle process. In addition, his company wanted to provide value and position itself as the best inside the marketplace—all that without human intervention.
 Helmut and his colleagues tried different ways to generate leads and establish their expert positioning. While successful, it did not satisfy the goals they had set for themselves.
 They were not getting the number of leads they wanted at an acceptable cost to them. They also weren’t selling the amount of products that they knew they could.

 THE SOLUTION

 Christian Helmut then tested StealthSeminar. He created an automated webinar. They started to drive cold traffic from Facebook and YouTube video ads to their automated webinar.
 Helmut’s list started to grow rapidly. Their positioning reached the top of the marketplace. The automated webinar started to generate sales on autopilot. In fact, they are getting a 15x ROI. For every $1.00 they spend, they get back $15.00—all automated.

 The Financial Industry Webinar

 The financial industry is also being heavily impacted by automated webinars. In the past, a lot of individuals would do seminars in a live setting, such as a restaurant or hotel. Now it is getting harder and more costly to get people to attend such events. The online webinar allows you to reach those individuals much cheaper and make it much more convenient for them to attend from their home or office.

###### CASE STUDY: FINANCIAL INDUSTRY WEBINAR

 ORGANIZATION: ANNUITYCHECK™

 Steve Hutchinson is the founder of AnnuityCheck™ (www.annuitycheck.com). He has a lifetime of experience in the financial industry, and he wanted to maximize his success with AnnuityCheck, a SaaS fintech firm.

 THE CHALLENGE

 Steve Hutchinson wanted to help financial advisers automate their financial calculations and maximize the retirement income they generated for their clients.
 He spent the first two years doing live webinars. He would waste 10 to 20 hours every week getting prepped for one or two webinars. It was wasteful and a drain on him mentally and physically. It took away from other professional and personal activities.

 THE SOLUTION

 Hutchinson finally turned to automation via StealthSeminar for his webinars.
 Hutchinson found a “whole new marketing gear” in online optimization. He finally turned to the same type of automation his clients depend upon to streamline the process. “Now I can update a simple file a few times a month as needed and get my life back,” says Hutchinson.
 AnnuityCheck did their first two automated webinars on a Friday through Sunday and Monday. The statistics show they had 538 registrations, 272 attendees, and 46 signed up with credit card—17%.
 As you can see, there are a lot of benefits to creating your own automated webinars. They are a powerful tool that can be used for many different applications, such as list building, generating leads, or converting sales. Get started today. Every day you wait is costing you precious time and business. Getting your webinar up and running is easy to do. I wish you much success!

### FOLLOW-UP TO PRESENTATIONS

### Turning Leftovers into
 Rich Meals

###### by Dan Kennedy

 ou can often make a pretty good meal, or two or three, out of leftovers. If you have ever been relatively poor, or your family was poor when you were a kid, you definitely know about soup or stew full of leftovers from several prior days’ meals as a meal.

# YEverybody turns Thanksgiving feast leftovers into a night of

###### sandwiches and another night of open-faced turkey sandwiches with gravy.
 Presentations leave leftovers on the table, too. There are people who expressed interest but never registered online—at your website, or by calling your office. There are people who registered to attend or watch but failed to show up. There are the people who showed up but failed to buy or take another desired action. There can be recoverable value in all of those lists.
 Sometimes, monetization can be a simple matter of somehow giving them the same presentation again. For a TV infomercial client, I took all the people calling in but bailing out of the conversation with the order-taker before buying and sent them a letter with an audio recording of the very same infomercial they had watched. This converted more than enough of


-----

###### these nonbuyers to buyers to be nicely profitable. For most of the nine years that I spoke on America’s number-one seminar tour, SUCCESS, usually as the last speaker of the day, I came home and mailed a very long letter essentially transcribed from my presentation to all the ticket buyers who had not bought my resources. Many had not stayed all the way to the long day’s end to even see me at all. Others were, by then, spent out, lugging bags of other speakers’ resources. This follow-up mailing never failed to be satisfactorily profitable, and it brought thousands of new customers into my world who would have been left behind otherwise. Similarly, during the several years that I did a lot of consulting with Weight Watchers International, Inc., I determined that people going to introductory meetings and getting the initial presentation but not joining were getting little or no follow-up, and I proved that an immediate follow-up letter built around the presentation sent the next day by Federal Express got a large number of those people to join.
 Other times, more complex and sophisticated follow-up can be warranted. I have a longtime client who sells a service to dentists via a presentation delivered live and in person in seminars and online by a webinar. The doctors attending the seminars or watching the online presentations who do not sign up for the service get not one but three sequential follow-up campaigns, each with 16 to 32 steps, incorporating mail, email, and phone, over eight to ten weeks. The first campaign offers the same service by restating the same presentation carved into pieces. The second campaign offers a stripped-down version of the same service at a lower price. The third campaign offers an entirely different service and drives to a different online presentation to sell it. You should brace yourself for the piece of insider’s information I’m going to share with you: The profit from eating these leftovers is almost identical to the profit from the primary presentation and its sales. In other words, we nearly doubled the income from the same audience by this follow-up.
 This is not a freak situation. To the contrary, I usually find some opportunity to make good meals out of leftovers, with just about every client I work with, by follow-up, often recycling the same presentation or at least the elements and content of the original presentation. Based on this, in acting as your own consultant, you have two questions to give a lot of consideration to:


-----

###### 1. Where are leftovers being tossed in the trash, rather than being used
 to make meals? 2. How many times, places, and ways can I reuse or recycle my
 effective presentations?

 During two years that I was coaching a group of highincome, top- performing financial advisors who all obtained clients by assembling audiences for their own preview seminars, I asked: What do you do with all the people who attend these seminars but don’t book private appointments with y’all? Given the success of these advisors, I got surprisingly poor answers: One said sheepishly, “Nothing much.” Two, “We put them back into our prospect list”—which meant they got future mailings (only) for the same seminar they’d already attended and failed to act on. Three, “If Harriet has time, she calls them.” And how often would you guess that Harriet has time to call them? We developed a 16-step, 8-week follow-up system, using mail and email, entirely automated, and saw conversion rates as high as 25%. This follow-up message leveraged the content of the original presentation.
 Good telephone follow-up almost always pays, and Dustin tackles this in the next chapter.
 To paint a total picture, your presentation should never be a stand-alone item. It has a place inside a business building or marketing system with steps occurring ahead of the presentation and steps occurring behind the presentation.
 While this book has focused on the presentation, the reality is that the depository of all the financial value is the customer and the potential customer, prospect, and lead. These unconverted prospects contain gold like cactuses contain water—it isn’t obviously visible, but it is there.

##### CHAPTER 16

### The Post-Presentation
 Conversation

###### by Dustin Mathews

 lthough we do a lot of follow-up by mail, email, retargeting with social media, newsletters, and other means, including in sequences like Dan just described, I find nothing trumps a one- to-one telephone conversation with a friendly, competent person

# Aconducting the call. We have developed a very effective template

###### for these calls. With some adjustments, it would be a good template for you too. I don’t want you to undervalue this. If you hired a sales script writer to develop this kind of thing for you, it’d be easy to spend $5,000.00 to $10,000.00.
 When you add this process, you are, with those not buying at your presentation, using that fact and the presentation as a very good excuse or reason for the post-presentation phone conversation. Anytime you can have a conversation with a qualified prospect, that’s a good thing, but as you certainly know, there is a high level of resistance to telemarketing calls. In these cases, the calls don’t have to be perceived as telemarketing, and there is a relationship of sorts in place in advance of the call. This is a very different dynamic than a typical telemarketing call.


-----

###### It is definitely best to get every sale you can at your presentation— nothing beats NOW. But if you have what Dan called leftovers to try and make a meal from, here are follow-up questions:

 1. We appreciate your having attended Dave’s presentation. Thank
 you. Could I ask you a few questions about your thoughts about the presentation?

 We ask this question to get people into the Yes State that Dave talked about earlier in the book. It’s an easy way to start. It sounds like the call is more of a survey call than a sales call.

 2. What were some of the things you liked most or found most
 interesting about Dave’s presentation?

 We ask this to put them back into the time when they were excited. You should notice that the question is framed to encourage a positive response.

 3. Dave is very particular about who he works with. He likes working
 with people doing something important, so please tell me how your business positively impacts people and might even change the world?

 People tend to enter sales conversations trying to sell. We take an interview approach instead. With a question like this, we turn the tables and get the prospect to sell us rather than us selling them. This question also gives the prospect an opportunity to talk about his business in glowing terms.

 4. What’s your “bigger reason” for being in your business and doing
 what you do? Do you have a legacy in mind to create?

 This lets people know we’re not just there to sell; we truly want to help people build a legacy for themselves and have their business and life mean something. We’ve learned that buying and price


-----

###### resistance goes down when people are focused on “deeper meanings.” This also challenges people to think bigger.

 5. What’s your greatest challenge?

 This starts movement toward offering our assistance. Depending on the answer, we have two immediate follow-up questions: What about that is your biggest problem? And: What is it costing you? These are pain-inducing questions to establish a disease we can cure.

 6. Do you have a budget to solve this problem?

 This raises the issue of money so you can try to understand where the person is financially. In our business, we have different versions of our services that we can prescribe, at different prices, so getting a sense of the person’s ideas about acceptable price is very useful. An alternative or follow-up question is: What do you think it could be worth for you to solve this problem?

 7. Based on Dave’s presentation and what you know about Speaking
 Empire, how do you think what we do might help you the most?

 This is a key question. Given answers to questions 5 and 6, most salespeople would jump ahead to selling a solution. We prefer to get the prospect to tell us how they think we can help them— essentially selling themselves. This reduces the stress of the conversation. It also allows less skilled salespeople to conduct these conversations.

 8. Would it be OK if I continue with that, and share how I think we can
 help you?

 This returns control to us, in a friendly way. It’s at this point that I am going to lay out a couple, or at most three, options for work with our company on a project, leading to . . .


-----

###### 9. Which option works best for you?

 Because we structured an either/or alternate choice instead of a yes/no, most people who have gone this far will pick one of the options, or at least pick one to ask additional questions about. After answering any such questions and getting a choice made, we usually offer a post-event discount or bonus or both . . .

 10. The good news is that we have a post-event special offer for this . . .

 From here, we move into getting the order written.
