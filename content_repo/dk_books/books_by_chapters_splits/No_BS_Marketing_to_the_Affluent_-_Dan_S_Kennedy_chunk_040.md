### How a Dentist Transformed His Office Into a Hot
 Spot for Affluent Patients

# In the early 1990s, Len Anglis D.D.S added implant dentistry to help
##### grow his practice in Indiana. He didn’t have time for vacations. He relied on other dentists to drive referrals to his business. And he had to customize treatment plans for each dentist, since the dentist wanted to do some but not all of the work, making it less profitable for Dr. Anglis.
 So he changed his approach, targeting affluent customers with a much more specialized service. That was 15 years ago. Today, over half his business is All-On-Four Dental Implant Treatment, a complicated procedure in which Dr. Anglis replaces entire arches of missing or failing teeth for patients all in one day. It’s a procedure no one else is doing.


-----

##### Treatments can range from $30,000.00 up to $75,000.00. Most of his patients write a check for it, paying for it before or at the time of treatment. “Because insurance doesn’t cover this kind of treatment, we needed people who could afford it,” Dr. Anglis said.
 Changing his approach has transformed his business and his life. By becoming very specialized in the All-On-Four Implant Treatment, dentists in the area refer people to him, telling their patients they can no longer help them and that Dr. Anglis is the only one who can do it. Patients arrive presold because they trust their family dentist. This also means Dr. Anglis rarely, if ever, does customized treatment plans for dentists anymore.
 Creating marketing systems that target their ideal patient, they’ve been able to gain control over the flow of patients coming into their business instead of having to rely on referrals only.
 By charging a higher fee, they can do more for their patients to make them feel comfortable. “Over the years, we really own the fact that patients would rather be anyplace else,” Nancy Anglis, a dental hygienist and Len’s wife, said. “We get it, we embrace it. So, we made our office like no place else.”
 The Anglises completely remodeled their office as a “tropical dental resort,” putting a lot of thought into what patients would want, not only to get people talking about it but to intentionally create a more comfortable and relaxing space that would lower anxiety. “Nancy and I looked at every single component from colors to pictures and intentionally picked things that were relaxing rather than stimulating,” Dr. Anglis said. Special components were added that naturally lower blood pressure. They offer cappuccinos, lattes, and cocoa. Neck warmers, blankets, and aloe socks are provided. This has created somewhat of a phenomenon. “We have people come a half hour early because they know we run on time and they want to take advantage of our amenities before they go back,” Nancy said. “People show up just to have coffee. They think of it as a social gathering place. They’ll bring friends and families to meet us, which is how we’ve gotten some patients, too. It’s become a hotspot that people can’t believe.”
 Their marketing approach is different, too. “We were marketing to people in a new way in which they know how much we value them,” Dr. Anglis said, “and it’s been very reciprocal. It seems like they value us more now as well.”


-----

##### Marketing includes things such as a free book, Why You Might Not Need Dental Implants, that Dr. Anglis wrote; a newsletter; a series of notes and gifts; direct mail; and more. A free-standing insert in the newspaper advertises a seminar they host complete with refreshments. The seminar is orchestrated with subtle reminders that attendees really do need to have this treatment done because they can’t even enjoy the simple things in their life without a lot of grief and discomfort. They mail a package with very unique, specific items to prospects so they know who the Anglis are before they ever meet Dr. Anglises.
 Follow-up systems are in place for those who don’t go ahead with treatment to keep Dr. Anglis top of mind. Sensitive to the fact that patients are afraid, worried about the time it will take to have the procedure done, and used to people telling them they are “too old and don’t need this done,” the Anglis choose very specific language for their materials that appeals to their affluent clients. “We have to convince them that there’s a better way to live the rest of their life with a higher quality and higher health level,” Dr. Anglis said.
 Details matter, and the Anglises think of everything that might be an irritant to their wealthy clients and put processes in place to avoid them. For example, nobody waits. “We stay on time in our office and people really appreciate that because there aren’t many dental or medical offices that you go to where they respect your time at the level we do,” Nancy said. “And if we mess up, if we’re 10 or 15 minutes behind, they get a present.”
 All this has added up to the Anglises operating at higher profitability than other offices, needing fewer patients, giving them more time to do things they enjoy … and they even get to take vacations now, usually several per year.

### How an Orthodontist Rose Above All Competition

# In Kansas City, Missouri, where 72 orthodontists are competing for a
##### population of just two million, Dr. Dustin Burleson changed his marketing strategy to focus on the affluent. His average fee has gone from $4,600.00 to $6,500.00. His practice has grown from one location with one employee to five locations and 38 employees. He’s been on the Inc. 500 list twice. He’s increased his business by more than tenfold. Before using affluent marketing, he’d add a couple hundred patients a year. Last year he started 1,904 new patients.
 In transitioning to intentionally marketing to the affluent, he hired a third-party research firm to survey 10,000 people in Kansas City. He discovered the number-one concern was finding a provider they could trust. Number two was convenience. To his surprise, price came in third place.


-----

##### Display Profound Expertise Focusing on creating trust, Dr. Burleson went to work to build his authority. He taught at the universities. He wrote a book and articles. (He’s written three books so far.) He got on the news and built his celebrity.

 Relieve Your Affluent Clients of Hassles Wanting to find out what conveniences affluent patients were looking for, he created a “patient board of directors” made up of 20 of his patients who were centers of influence. For example, they might own a business, be on the school board, or be a board member at the hospital—anyone he believed had huge referral potential. Four times a year, he invites these patients to a nice steakhouse, feeds them dinner, describes his vision for the practice, and asks them to give him input about what they like and don’t like about his practice. “At first they were really quiet,” Burleson said. “They’d never seen this before. But they all came and were good sports about it. And what a lot of them told us were then those things we implemented.” For example, he found that affluent customers want zero hassle. Burleson responded by expanding their hours to be open early in the morning, late at night, and on weekends. He added pediatric dentistry to the mix and dental hygienists so parents don’t have to go somewhere else to have their kids’ teeth cleaned and so forth. Burleson also created membership plans with different tiers where patients get VIP treatment. Family memberships run $24,000.00. For an additional $8,000.00, you can get the platinum plus plan. This includes things such as personal contact with treatment coordinators and guaranteed support no matter when you need it. They answer their phones 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They offer after-hours support, including the promise to drive to the office at 10:00 P.M. if that is what is needed. Somewhat shocking and controversial in his industry, he added a guarantee that patients will be happy, or they get their money back. Even if they don’t wear their retainer and their teeth go crooked, they’ll put the braces back on for free. “They pretty much want a guarantee that if a kid loses their retainer, breaks their retainer, or doesn’t wear their retainer, that we have their back,” Burleson said.

 Be Discriminatory on Who You Will Spend Money Marketing To


-----

##### To find affluent patients, Burleson looked at his existing patient list. We said, “Who has spent the most money with us? Who has referred friends and family to us? Who was either paid in full or has come to us, not because we were on their insurance list, but because of some other reason?” Burleson explained. Using this list, he created a “look-a-like” audience to match to the national database and began using direct mail to reach these patients. “We used a company called Accudata (www.accudata.com) to help us create the look-a-like list,” Burleson said. Examining the list to find out more about his ideal patient, he identified his perfect patient as someone who is really busy, a soccer mom who works outside of the home. Now messages sent out are customized to fit this audience.
 Targeting this specific niche and catering to super busy people who don’t want to take off work or school to bring their kids to the orthodontist has made a huge impact. Burleson’s lifetime customer value has almost doubled. “Obviously our price elasticity has gone up, but they easily bring the next kid and the family too,” Burleson said. “Our referrals have gone up 400 percent. We used to get about 15 percent of our patients from word-of- mouth or other patients and now it’s above 60 percent. The majority of our patients come from a mom who will find out and tell a friend, even if they had to drive past other orthodontists to get to us.” Referrals tell their friends, “He’s just open all the time, and they stand behind their work.”
 Increased referrals aren’t all he’s received. Dr. Burleson has also seen increased loyalty. “Before marketing to the affluent, we took a lot of discount insurance,” Burleson said. He found with discount insurance patients, not only is he being paid less and referred less, but even if there is a strong relationship with the patient, if his practice is dropped from their insurance plan, the parents will take their next kid to someone else who is on their insurance plan.
 Narrowing his niche even further, in 2017, he stopped treating adult patients altogether, choosing instead to only treat kids and teenagers. For most orthodontists, adults are about 25% of their business.
 Applying the affluent marketing principles has allowed Dr. Burleson to increase his margin, allowing him to do more for his patients, which has resulted in tremendous feedback. “Patients looking at spending $6,000.00 versus $4,500.00 say, ‘It’s not that much more considering everything that you have to offer,’” Burleson said. “We hear things like, ‘Man, I wish other


-----

##### doctors’ offices would run like this.’” Burleson is relentless about running on time and he hires the best people he can find and pays them well. “I think everything good comes from margin and we have a significant amount of it because of this principle,” Burleson said.

### How an Asset Management Company Increased
 Revenue 300% Using Information to Attract,
 Convert, and Retain Affluent Clients

# Longtime client Jim Lange of Lange Financial Group, LLC, provides
##### asset management through his registered investment advisory firm, tax preparation through his CPA firm, and estate planning and will and trust preparation through his law firm.
 Before intentionally marketing to the affluent, Lange grossed between $250,000.00 to $500,000.00 for asset management alone, not including the accounting and legal side of his business. Today he is grossing $2 million a year just on the assets under management. Before marketing to the affluent, he accepted clients with assets of $250,000.00 and up. He’s since created a


-----

##### threshold of $750,000.00 and is moving to $1 million by the end of the year. The difference has meant being able to charge roughly four times what he could for the $250,000.00 client. “The big picture is it really takes just as much time to work on a small account as a big account,” Lange said. “And since we have a 98% retainage rate, the lifetime value of a million-dollar client might range from $50,000.00 to $100,000.00.”
 Information and trust is the currency for his affluent clients. Applying marketing to the affluent principles, he can spend more to market and serve what his affluent clients want. Lange stresses that it’s not just about charging premium prices. It’s about being able to afford to provide more value to attract, convert (and keep) a client. “I can afford to be generous,” Lange explained, “When people come into the office I can afford to give them a shock and awe box that costs me $100.00. It might be worth thousands to them, but I don’t even have to think about spending one hundred bucks on a prospect because the prospect is so valuable to me. Affluent marketing changes your math—meaning you can spend a lot more money on marketing to get a client and to maintain the account.”
 He provides his clients with a plethora of extra resources. He’s written six bestselling books, including his latest, The $214,000 Mistake: How to Double Your Social Security & Maximize Your IRA’s, Proven Strategies for Couples Ages 62-70. He now writes two new books per year. He sends copies to all his clients and to many prospects. (He prefers to ask prospects if they want a copy and then sends them a copy whether they ask for it or not, a technique he learned from Dan.) He does offer the books on www.Amazon.com and donates all royalties to charity. Clients also receive a monthly printed newsletter, invitations to multiple workshops, articles, tax cards, and emails. Plus, he hosts parties for them.
 To attract new clients, he holds workshops, and markets with his books. He segments information so consumers can quickly and easily find the answer to what they are looking for when visiting his website. He does utilize Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social media, but does much better in terms of attracting clients through direct mail.
 If someone is referred to him, he sends a personalized package with information specific to their situation.
 Lange’s found that taking his time in other ways attracts the affluent too. His experience has been to not just pump content out but to take the


-----

##### time to create content that the affluent client will value. Taking his time to write a relevant and informative book, for instance, has paid off, earning him testimonials from Charles Schwab, Larry King, and top IRA experts around the country plus a best-seller ranking. This helps build trust in the affluent community and has built his authority in his market.

### Money Spent on Education

# Affluents tend to spend more on education. Households in the
##### $200,000.00+ annual income bracket, on average, spend more than double the amount per year on educational expenses than the $150,000.00 to $199,999.00 group and more than triple that of the $100,000.00 to $149,999.00 bracket. (Source: e-Marketer.)
