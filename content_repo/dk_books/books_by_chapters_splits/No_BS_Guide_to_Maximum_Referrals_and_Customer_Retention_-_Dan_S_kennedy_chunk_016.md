##### you will do to help them realize their goals. Now you ask for their help in return. This is called reciprocity, and you should never be backwards or tentative about asking for referrals at this moment because people inherently want to help each other, especially because you’ve just helped them. Every business has some “point of best opportunity” like this, when the customer is feeling happiest or the most optimistic about whatever he’s signed up for.
 Explain to your clients what a reticular activator is. A reticular activator is that part of our brain that is tuned to situations that parallel our own. For example, pregnant women notice other pregnant women. New mothers notice others with small babies. The week after I bought my red Cadillac, I must have seen dozens of them driving around my town. That’s because my brain was tuned into this particular car. Well, it’s no different with homeowners. When people decide to buy or sell a home, it becomes a natural part of their thought process and conversations with other people. They suddenly start to notice other For Sale signs in their neighborhood, and they speak to neighbors, co-workers, and friends about their moving plans, many of whom may be future home sellers or buyers themselves. You can be assured, they are going to be having conversations with people about buying or selling homes, and because they’re in the process, people are going to ask them questions about it. Those conversations will present people who should know about you. You need to plug yourself into these natural conversations that your clients are going to have at the very beginning of the transaction.
 So when you sign new clients to a contract, there are three things you will want to accomplish before you end your meeting and walk out the door. First, you will want to reconfirm their decision to hire you by thanking them for their business and making them feel good about their decision. Secondly, you will want to give them a sense of exactly what will happen next, and thirdly, you will want to take advantage of their positive frame of mind to ask them for referrals, by equipping them with an easy way to give you referrals.
 I made it easy for my new clients by giving them printed, postage-paid, self-mailer referral cards (see Figure 11.1 on page 100). These cards made it easy for them to simply jot down the name and contact information of the person they were referring, and all they’d have to do to complete the

##### referral was drop the referral card in the mailbox. Even easier, these referral cards also included all my contact information (i.e., telephone number, address, email address, and dedicated referral web page address), making it easy for them to get me this information in whatever way was most convenient for them.

**FIGURE 11.1**

##### Making things easy, however, is not enough. As with all of your marketing, you have to have a big WIFM (“What’s in it For Me”) to compel people to send you a referral. As you’ll see on the referral card shown above, I teach my students to associate a very high value to the referral by linking it with a worthy cause. My most successful members have this WIFM well in place, and that’s what we’ll talk about next.

#### 2. Referral for a Worthy Cause


-----

##### Most real estate agents reward those who send them a referral with absolutely nothing, not even a phone call or email to thank them for the referral. Others send a small gift of thanks, maybe a $50 bottle of wine or a $50 lunch, or something equivalent, so the message clearly sent is that their referral is only worth $50. This is all so ordinary.
 I’ve found that attaching the referral to a donation to an important local charity works far better and is highly motivating to clients. So, for example, you might tell your clients, “When you refer a friend or family member who is considering a move to us, you’re helping a sick child in real need because for every house we sell this year, we are donating a portion of our income to Sick Kids Hospital.” After all, what value can be placed on saving the life of a child? By simply referring a prospective buyer or seller to you, not only are they helping that person find a trusted professional to help them with their real estate needs, they’re also helping those in need in a tangible way. Giving your clients the opportunity to exercise their altruism is a big WIFM.
 This also positions you in an especially positive way. It also actually does support your support of a worthy cause, charity, hospital, school, or animal shelter. Not that there’s anything wrong with Starbucks, but wouldn’t you rather donate $50 to a good cause and a charity doing good work in your community than use it to buy a gift card from Starbucks?

#### Exactly How I Said It and Top Agents Say It
##### Words and language are very important, so all top pros in selling have developed and mastered scripts. Only amateurs wing it.
 Here’s a sample script to use when asking for referrals:

 Thank you for putting your trust in our system, Bob. I appreciate your business, and I know you’ll be pleased with the job we do for you. Now that we have all the paperwork signed, there are several things that will happen over the next day or two. Here’s our 21-point plan which will take you through the process step-by-step. <<Go through some specifics with them>>. Why don’t you take a quick


-----

##### look at these steps, and if you have any questions, I’d be happy to address them now.

 In our experience, we’ve found that when people like you are selling their home <<or buying a home>>, they have a heightened awareness of others who are thinking of selling <<or buying>> theirs. If you do come across someone who is thinking of buying or selling, I would appreciate it if you would pass on my card, and then fill out this referral card and drop it in the mail to us. Or, if it’s easier for you, you can just call or email me, or visit the Referral Rewards page listed here.

 I’m asking you to do this not out of self-interest, but to help us help kids in need. You see, the Craig Proctor Team believes in giving back to those who need help in our community. When you refer someone to us who is considering a move, you’re helping a sick child in real need because for every house we sell this year, we are donating a portion of our income to Sick Kids Hospital. So when your friends, neighbors, associates, or relatives buy or sell their home with the Craig Proctor Team, not only are they assured of the best possible service and results, but they’ll also be helping sick children to get the care they need. We’ve been able to donate almost $XX,XXX to Sick Kids over the last XX years, so you’ll be joining a very powerful force for a worthy cause in our community.”

 You can take this simple strategy to the bank! Many of our members successfully use this strategy, and the bonus is that it’s a triple win: the agent, the client, and the worthy cause. Here are a few examples from my students:

 • Sarah Reynolds from Chantilly, Virginia, adds this postscript to the
 bottom of every email:

 P.S. Your referrals help the kids! The Reynolds Team is a proud supporter of the Youth for Tomorrow Organization. For every referral that is given to The Reynolds Team a


-----

##### portion of the commission will be donated to Youth for Tomorrow.

 Sarah also has her “Referral Rewards” program prominently displayed on her website as shown in Figure 11.2.

**FIGURE 11.2**

##### • Another member, Rudy Kusuma of Rosemead, California, was
 recently recognized as the “2014 Miracle Office” for being the top contributor to the Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles. Figure 11.3 is a sample of Rudy’s referral page.

**FIGURE 11.3**

##### In both cases, these agents have attached a worthy cause to their referrals, and are making it easy, motivating, and rewarding for their clients to act on their behalf.

#### 3. Referral Newsletter
##### The third tool of the referral system is a mailed referral newsletter that you should direct-mail monthly to those most likely to refer. This means you must be tagging people in your database as such. The rest of your database can receive the referral newsletter via an email that works in conjunction with your blog page. I do not suggest emailing the newsletter either as an attachment or embedded in the email itself. Better to post it as a monthly blog and get some SEO value from it as well. Your email will simply be a short bullet-point note with a link to your blog page. But the “hot,” most- likely-to-refer customers should get a printed copy in the mail for maximum impact.
 This kind of newsletter can give recognition to people who have referred, welcome the new referred clients, and provide stories about the charity that’s being supported and its activities. Or it can be a simple letter of news, describing the fundraising goals, the cause being supported, and reminding people to refer.
 Here is a referral newsletter from one of my coaches, a top agent, Todd Walters, from Atlanta, Georgia, leveraging Must Ministries as a Worthy Cause:

 Your Referrals Give Hope to Those Living with Hopelessness . . .

 For every house we sell this year, we are donating a portion of our income to Must Ministries. We are on a mission to raise $25,000 for Must Ministries, Georgia’s Servant Leader for more than 40 years. Now hosting five different locations and several programs throughout metro Atlanta, MUST provides a long list of services to area residents who are struggling. Those services include groceries, hot meals, emergency shelter, supportive housing, clothing, employment services, Summer Lunch and more. All services are made possible through generous donors, volunteers, and a dedicated staff.

 So Again, Your Referrals Help Those in Real Need . . .

 Who do you know considering buying or selling a home that you could refer to my real estate sales team?

##### Not only will they benefit from our award winning service, but we donate a substantial portion of our income on every home sale to Must Ministries.

 It’s easy to refer your friends, neighbors, associates, or family members who are considering making a move. Simply go to www.___ReferralRewards.com or you can call us direct at 000-000- 0000.

 Now let me back up a step, because none of this will work if your business can’t produce a happy client. Once prospects become clients, they become both your salesperson and your teacher. How well they sell your services depends on how well you service them. How well you learn from them depends on how well you listen. In fact, your goal with your business system should be to produce a customer who is not only satisfied with your service, but absolutely delighted with it—“wowed” by it. In other words, the goal of your system is to produce a raving fan. A raving fan is very important to your referral system because a raving fan is your best salesman. As mentioned, people will believe what their friends or relatives say about you quicker than they will believe what you say yourself. By designing and implementing a system to elicit referral business, you’re creating an invaluable network that will feed you with customers. It takes time for this network to grow, of course, but by developing a system to cultivate referrals, you will create massive leverage.
 While the best time to ask for referrals is when they love you the most (and for a real estate agent, this is at the moment they hire you and sign the listing or buyer agreement), the process doesn’t stop there. For those who have just sold (or purchased), your intent is to reinforce their motivation to not only give you referrals, but also to ultimately complete a client survey and give you a five-star testimonial. Testimonials in different clients’ authentic voices describing their experiences are very powerful and can be used in many different ways.
 I constantly reinforce to my students the importance of understanding your customer. I like to tell the story of my very first home sale. I sat in my first client’s home stunned that I’d actually managed to sell his home. When I left his house . . .

##### . . . I accidentally slipped on his shoes and walked out into the world. Now I do this every single day in my business. I make sure that it happens systematically, because no one has anything more important to tell you about how you’re doing than your clients. I want their honest and authentic reports. I want comments I can use, and comments I need to learn from.
 Every single time I achieved some sort of closure with clients—whether I’d just sold their home or their listing had just expired, I systematically collected their feedback on the process. I did this via a client survey that I gave to them along with a voucher for a free dinner at a local restaurant to thank them for taking the time to complete the survey.
 The objective of this survey was to get them to talk about the process from all angles, and what they answered was very important to me because their answers were like a report card on my business. I started off asking them for their “opinion” about the process, and I made it clear to them that everything they had to say was valid. Their “opinion” could never be wrong because it’s simply an articulation of how they feel, and I told them that I was really interested in how they felt because it helped me to keep getting better and better at what I do.
 Once I got these survey results back, my job was to read between the lines to understand why they answered as they did. This gave me an opportunity to launch damage control in order to neutralize any negative feedback, but also to leverage the positive feedback by asking them to give me a testimonial. Testimonials are important. While they are not referrals in the traditional sense, they do serve the same purpose, i.e., to have your clients promote your business. I had my Customer Service Manager collect at least one testimonial a week. We gave our clients the option of writing the testimonial themselves or having us craft it for them based on their comments on the survey and having them sign off on it. When writing these testimonials, remember that a “wimpy” testimonial is like a soggy salesman. Compare the following two statements:

 “Craig’s team did a great job”

 or


-----

##### “Within 30 days, our home sold for $253,000 with just one offer—a full $3,100.00 over our asking price, and $13,100.00 more than the other real estate agent recommended. We would highly recommend Craig Proctor and his team to anyone wanting to sell their home.”

 When you craft your message, do so presuming that you are facing your toughest customer. What do you do when you’re in the middle of a presentation and your prospect throws an objection at you? The words that come out of your mouth matter. Hopefully, you’d answer that objection with some specific, well-thought-out facts and figures that will convincingly handle that objection. The same must go for your marketing. Communicate your USP (Unique Selling Proposition), but then offer the proof so that you break down their natural barrier of skepticism. Accumulating and organizing “social proof” so you can produce exactly the right comments, success reports, stories, and testimonials to counter any question or objection is something every sales professional or business owner should do.
 Here’s a secret about referrals: People tend to refer most and most often to a nonpushy but very confident and capable salesperson! They tend not to refer to a fumbler and bumbler, someone who might embarrass them with a friend or relative by being unsure of himself and unable to make his case. When you are thoroughly prepared, ready to present, and prove your case, you sell with more confidence and more calmly. That not only helps you close that sale but also carries over to the customer’s willingness to refer others to you.
 Shiv Singh, Senior VP Global Brand and Marketing Transformation at Visa Inc., said, “The purpose of a business is to create a customer who creates customers.” This is a very different way of thinking about a business, isn’t it? Most people think the purpose of their business is to get customers, to sell goods and services, to create revenue and profits. The idea that its purpose is to create customers who create customers is pretty radical. It could be a real game-changer for your business, as it was for my own real estate business, and as it is for the agents I coach.
