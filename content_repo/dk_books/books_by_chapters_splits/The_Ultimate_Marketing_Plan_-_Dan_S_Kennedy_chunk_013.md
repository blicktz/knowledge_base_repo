##### In the same community, that same summer, a young chiropractor got ready to open his new practice—with at least a dozen competing chiropractors surrounding his office already established in the area. He spent one full month prior to opening going door to door, house to house, introducing himself, asking the residents about the area and their health interests, and making friends. He knocked on more than 2,000 doors that month. And from the first day he started seeing patients, his practice has prospered. Its first year it outperformed all the established practices in the area.

 There are three types of people: those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who wonder what happened. I think you’ll find that most successful businesspeople you know are in the first category.

 Take-One Boxes and Contest-Entry Boxes

 Everything from cosmetic makeovers and spa memberships to vacation clubs and credit cards are successfully promoted via take-one boxes and contest-entry boxes placed in businesses.

 The purpose of these box systems is, of course, to collect names of somewhat qualified prospects for follow-up by mail or phone. A box can cost as little as a couple of dollars and, located in a busy business, collect hundreds of leads each week. A retail business that I had an interest in for several years had its managers drop off contest-entry boxes at outdoor bank ATM machines on Friday evenings and pick them up Sunday evenings to collect hundreds and hundreds of leads for follow-up. The banks probably would not have approved of this gambit, but I will tell you, it was very effective.

 For several years, I consulted with a company marketing home security and fire protection systems by bringing homeowners to group presentations at local restaurants, as winners of free dinners. They got all their leads from contest-entry boxes placed (with permission, unlike the previously mentioned guerrilla use of ATM locations) in gas stations, convenience stores, other retail stores, beauty salons, etc., all over each town where they had sales reps.

 If I had a business that could effectively follow up on leads by mail or phone, I would develop a contest-entry box and hire a reliable, ambitious college student or, probably better, a retired person in need of extra income to place a number of the boxes and then service them weekly or biweekly, and then pay the person a bonus based on the number of leads or the number of leads converted to appointments or customers.

 When using a contest-entry box system, it’s important to offer and honestly deliver a valuable, appealing first prize. In Phoenix, weekend getaways to cooler San Diego work very well. But, although not announced in advance, every entrant wins a second prize.

##### Let’s say you want to promote an Italian restaurant and you want to specifically increase your weekday early dinner traffic. First, you get ten contest-entry boxes placed in nonrestaurant businesses, probably in a circle around your restaurant. Second, you collect all the leads every week. Third, you or somebody else calls these leads or you send mail to these leads with this message:

 Thank you for entering our San Diego vacation contest. Unfortunately, you did not win the first prize—it was won by Mr. and Mrs. Jones of Glendale, Arizona. However, you have won a valuable second prize: the enclosed certificate entitles you and your spouse or friend to a 2-for-1 dinner deal at our beautiful Italian Ristorante on 12th Street, Monday through Thursday from 5:00 P.M. to 7:30 P.M. With this certificate, you pay for just one dinner and get a second dinner of equal or lesser value free! Enclosed is a miniature copy of our menu so you can see in advance the tremendous variety and reasonable prices we offer.

 Please call for reservations and redeem your certificate within the next twenty-one days.

 If a strategy like this seems primitive to you, you’re right; it is. But that doesn’t negate its stubborn effectiveness. Even as the Internet surrounds us, technological advances abound, and media choices proliferate, you will still find flyers stuck up on community bulletin boards in coffee shops and you will still find take-one boxes all over the place if you open your eyes to them. That’s because they still work.

 If a strategy like this seems labor-intensive and inefficient to you, you are right about that, too. But shoe-leather and manual labor are substitutes for spending money.

 The Power of Cooperation

 Cooperation can be carried too far (a camel being a horse built by committee), and I am not a big fan of groups. But I do believe in strategic alliances.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #13:
 Asset Sharing for Marketing Success

##### Two noncompeting but somehow related merchants—a pet store owner and a veterinarian, a restaurant owner and a theater owner, a sporting goods store owner and a sports-bar proprietor, an auto dealer and a carwash owner—can share their customer bases, their store traffic, even their advertising in order to build each others’ businesses and stretch their advertising dollars. Reciprocal customer sharing became more popular in the recent recession. It should be a big part of your Ultimate Marketing Plan all the time. To be simplistic, if two cooperating marketers each create 1,000 customers a year and spend $50.00 each, thus $50,000.00 to do it, and they begin reciprocally sharing those customers, they double their reach at half their previous cost. If you can’t increase your income with that kind of math, you just can’t be helped!

 In this same category of cooperation, there are joint ventures. In the business world there are basically two groups: those with customers and those without customers. Each has a need, although someone in the first group must often be educated by someone in the second. The person with a thriving business and good group of responsive customers needs to be of greater and greater service to those customers, and he needs ways to make more money with his customers without doing more work. He may or may not understand this, but he owns the most valuable asset in the world: customers. Then there’s you—the entrepreneur with a product or service or business that would be of interest and value to his customers. In direct marketing terms, he could be a “host” and you could be a beneficial “parasite.”

 Simple example: The dry cleaner has 500 good, repeat customers. But he’s nearly at capacity and couldn’t do much more dry-cleaning work without adding equipment and space and personnel. How can he make more money? Well, every one of those 500 customers has carpets in their home, which two or three times a year need a good, reliable carpet cleaner. Mr. Dry Cleaner’s not prone to get into a second business. But you, Mr. Carpet Cleaner, can pay him for access, introduction, and endorsement to his customers. That’s host/parasite marketing.

 A truer joint venture would involve the dry cleaner and the carpet cleaner who partner in opening a new car wash in their town and fuel it by marketing it to both their customer lists.

 The absolute all-time master of this in my kind of business, the information products and seminar business, is my friend and sometimes

##### client Ted Thomas, an expert in teaching tax lien, real estate, and foreclosure investing strategies. Ted sells millions of dollars of his books, courses, and seminars every year with no front end. That means he does not invest money in advertising or direct mail or anything else to get a customer of his own, from scratch. Instead, he spends his time finding and forming good working relationships with hosts who already have customers. To give you a quick idea of the power in this, here are the actual net profits from several host/parasite campaigns Ted has engineered, each covering only a four- to six-week period of time: $57,000.00, $15,000.00, $30,000.00, and—gulp!—$210,000.00.

 I will summarize Ted’s key thoughts about host/parasite marketing:

 1. Businesses spend fortunes finding and rounding up customers.

 2. You can eliminate your out-of-pocket costs, risks, and
 experimentation by simply paying a host to be a beneficial parasite, to use the customers that already exist.

 3. Host and parasite cooperate to exploit the value in the customers
 in a way the host couldn’t or wouldn’t do on his own.

 4. Make it easy for the host to say yes. It should involve little or no
 work for the host, so you need whatever sales letters, materials, website material, in-store signage, etc. that will be used done, tested, proven, and furnished to the host so he does not have to invest time or money creating anything. You need to guarantee customer satisfaction, so the host does not endanger his reputation.

 5. Make it an irresistible financial win for the host. And I would
 emphasize here, do NOT be a cheapskate about this. Consider what it costs you to get a customer on your own!

 6. When you have a success, nurture the relationship so you can
 repeat the same promotion or do other promotions with that same host, and use that host as a testimonial when you approach other possible hosts.

 Resources Versus Resourcefulness

 Virtually every business owner has at least one time, most a number of times, when, for various reasons, they are cash strapped and feel resourceless. It is possible to be without resources. It is inexcusable to be without resourcefulness. That is about character, not cash.

 I teach this fact: There is always something you can do. There is ALWAYS something you can do. There is always SOMETHING you can do. There is always something YOU can do. Pick up the phone and make calls. Get on your horse and get out in the field. Knock on doors. Proposition a host. Hustle.

## Equity

##### In my Renegade Millionaire System, one of the differences between rich and unrich business owners I emphasize is that the unrich operate entirely in the realm of income while the rich think in terms of income and equity. The unrich earn and spend. The rich earn and invest, and create assets.

 When you ask a group of businesspeople to list their assets, they quickly write down such items as equipment, furniture, leasehold improvements, and inventory. Many never get around to listing their customers. This lapse is often reflective of trouble in their businesses.

 In every exceptionally successful business, the customer is, is perceived as, and is treated as the most important asset.

 To really get to that point and own that belief, you have to figure out what your customer is or can and should be worth to you. In my book No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits, I detail the numbers your accountants don’t focus on that you need to, including, importantly, TCV—Total Customer Value. A business’ highest and best, and most fragile, equity is in its customers and its relationship with those customers, and preserving and growing that asset value requires and deserves focus and investment. It is a grave mistake to be overly attentive to getting new customers and neglectful of marketing to and nurturing relationship with existent customers.

 She Hates His Roving Eye

 Men say: I’m married—I’m not dead! when noticing women other than their wives. The wives plot their death. I once saw an entire episode of Dr. Phil devoted to women complaining about husbands/boyfriends out at dinner, in a bar, or at a party with them but gawking at or, worse, flirting with other babes. This was also the complaint voiced by a lady after a first arranged date on the even-more-insipid-than-Phil reality show Millionaire Matchmaker. It’s the last argument I had with my first

##### ex-wife, in a bar, the night before she was leaving, with divorce a done deal. So, how do you think your customers feel when they catch you ardently pursuing new ones while ignoring them? Think they don’t notice? Idiot. If they see your ad in the newspaper, in Valpak, hear it on radio, etc. but don’t hear directly from you, and they remember you at all, they notice, and they’re miffed. That’s why the headline written by Melissa Ward for a book review in Target Marketing Magazine is so good: RETENTION IS THE NEW ACQUISITION. Quote: “The traditional marketing funnel is outdated, lopsided, broken, with its gaping mouth acquiring many, sometimes not qualified customers but retaining few.” She plugged the book Flip the Funnel—in which its author says: “In an acquisition focused world, we pull out all the stops to woo a stranger to sample our wares, yet we ignore the very people who essentially fund our acquisition efforts in the first place. It is tantamount to feeding yourself by holding the steak knife the wrong way, by the blade—not only will you go hungry, you’ll end up in the emergency room.” (There’s more from the book at www.FlipTheFunnelNow.com.)

 Here’s a New Economy factoid for you: Businesses that have managed to make lots of money in the past as churn ‘n burners, requiring a monster-sized new-customer acquisition machine, are experiencing severe reversals of fortunes. The fuel eaten by such machines is becoming evermore expensive, too expensive. And don’t miss the author’s point in this book: present customers (not new customers) fund acquisition. The days of profitable or even break-even new-customer acquisition are just about over, for just about every business (and foolish desire for this has, frankly, been stunting growth of many long before this). If you are going to buy customers, you’d better get better at keeping them and fully monetizing them.

 Here’s why businesses lose customers:

 One percent die. Not much that we can do about that—if they
 insist on dying on us, that’s sort of unpreventable and irreversible.

 Three percent move away. Well, people do move. If they move
 quite a distance outside our market area, there’s not much we can do about that, either, unless, via the Internet, you have a no- boundaries extension of your business. Alan Reed’s dairy has over 3,000 customers in his local area but also ships ice cream to people all over the country. Some of the smartest real-estate agents in the Cleveland, Ohio, area (where I have a home) are also licensed in Florida and conduct business in both places because many Clevelanders buy and own second homes in Florida, eventually retire to Florida, and eventually list and sell their Ohio homes.

##### Five percent follow a friend or relative’s advice and switch to
 that friend’s preferred merchant. You might be tempted to say there’s nothing much to be done about that, either, but I’d disagree. How come we lost our customer to his buddy’s merchant instead of that other merchant losing his customer to us? Best man won, maybe?

 Nine percent switch due to price or a better product. Some of
 this 9 percent can’t be prevented, but I’ll argue that some could. Why don’t we have the best product? Or—if we do—why didn’t our customer know that?

 Fourteen percent switch due to product or service
 dissatisfaction. True—you just can’t please everybody. So some of this is unavoidable, too. But it’s my experience as a consumer that a lot of businesses lose me for this reason, are aware of it, but don’t even make an attempt at preventing the loss, just like the clothing store previously mentioned. Incredibly, they give up without a fight.

 But add all that up and you’ve accounted for only 32 percent
 of the losses. Why do the majority of customers leave? Can you guess? Sixty-eight percent switch because of what they perceive and describe as indifference from the merchant or someone in the merchant’s organization. In other words, they felt unappreciated, unimportant, taken for granted. That’s not my theory, remember—that’s what actual customers have said.

 Neglect and Negligence

 Negligence is dictionary-defined as “failing to take proper care.” If a customer slips and falls on a loose tile in your store’s floor, you are at risk of a successful lawsuit for negligence. That injury could have been prevented had you taken proper care of your premises. Negligence toward the care of customers is not always so clearly visible nor are you likely to be sued for it—at least until you pilot your business to bankruptcy court. But it is just as real. Neglect, as a noun rather than verb, is dictionary-defined as “the state of being uncared for.” In marketing, perception equals reality; the customer’s perception equals reality, so a feeling or sense of being uncared for is the same as being uncared for. Neglect. Failing to make absolutely sure your customers feel appreciated and cared for is sin of neglect for which there will be punishment.

 How many ways can you commit the sin of neglect? To name a few:

 1. The spotlighted advertising of offers to new customers with no
 direct offer of same or better to present customers, in advance, giving them VIP status and recognition (and giving yourself a good excuse to reach out to them).

-----

##### 2. The website(s) purposed for new-customer acquisition getting
 constant attention, improvement, monkeying-with, while the website(s) primarily serving existent customers left in disrepair.

 3. Putting your top copywriter (self, house, or hired gun) on your
 acquisition campaigns but having your secretary’s assistant whip out the e-mails to present customers in between Starbucks runs, walking the office pet lizard, and picking up your dry cleaning.

 4. Obsessing over quantity versus quality, response percentages
 rather than (comparative) customer value.

 5. Disproportionate investment in acquisition versus retention—
 example: willingness to fund an exhibit at a consumer show at the mall or B2B trade show, but refusal to fund a top-flight customer appreciation event.

 6. Insisting on trying to ram what you’ve got, want to sell, or think
 your customers want or should want down their throats instead of getting and responding to customers’ input.
