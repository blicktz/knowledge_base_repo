##### It’s one thing to use social media to try to gain followers and get your name
 out there; it’s a totally different game to use proven direct response marketing principles to drive more leads and profits. This book delivers the
 keys to selling directly to cold traffic on social media, increasing your lead
 flow and opt-ins, to creating celebrity status online. Whatever measurable
 result you’re after with social media, there are step-by-step strategies and simple, effective techniques in this book that will speed up the time it takes
 for you to get there and save you from frustration.

[—JOE POLISH, FOUNDER OF GENIUS NETWORK, WWW.GENIUSNETWORK.COM](http://www.geniusnetwork.com/)

##### This is the best book in the market today to drive sales to your business through social media marketing. It shows you how much more money you
 could be making every day.

—BRIAN TRACY, AUTHOR OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SELLING,

[WWW.BRIANTRACY.COM](http://www.briantracy.com/)

##### Forget about highlighting text or dog-earing pages . . . I actually ripped several pages right out of the book and taped them on my office wall for easy reference. I was just thumbing through at first and found a Facebook
 tactic that I used on my own group page and got massive engagement within the hour. Crazy! This is absolutely the best social media marketing
 book available.

—KEVIN KRUSE, NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR AND FOUNDER OF THE

[KRUSE GROUP, WWW.KEVINKRUSE.COM](http://www.kevinkruse.com/)

##### Doubters Beware! Grizzled, head-in-the-sand marketers take note. Those
 who believe “clicks” are marketing, awaken! Yes, you must measure effectiveness of your campaigns. Yes, you want a highly leveraged ROI.
 And, yes, most firms have not yet figured out how to monetize internet- based marketing. That was me. But it doesn’t have to be you. Each chapter reveals solutions to help you implement a profitable social media marketing
 strategy.

—LARRY V. PARMAN, FORMER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA, AUTHOR OF ABOVE THE FRAY: LEADING YOURSELF, YOUR BUSINESS AND


-----

_OTHERS DURING TURBULENT TIMES,_ [WWW.CEOMAESTRO.COM](http://www.ceomaestro.com/)

##### As the CEO of a company that lives and breathes automation, I can say with
 certainty that the everyday entrepreneur should get their hands on No B.S.
 Guide to Direct Response Social Media Marketing. Kim does a great job laying out the tools, templates, and resources you need to create high social
 media ROI. Dan’s commentary focuses on creating, tracking, and monitoring those social media posts which align with his focus on direct response marketing. All in all, if you are looking to grow your business
 using social media make this book your guide.

—CLATE MASK, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER OF INFUSIONSOFT,

[WWW.INFUSIONSOFT.COM](http://www.infusionsoft.com/)

##### If you want to understand how to move people to action with social media,
 dig into this book.

—MICHAEL A. STELZNER, FOUNDER OF SOCIAL MEDIA EXAMINER,

[WWW.SOCIALMEDIAEXAMINER.COM](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/)

##### This book puts the “direct” in “direct response” with clear, candid, practical
 advice for anyone trying to rise above the avalanche of social media outreach. Their emphasis on results—meaning revenue, not awareness—is
 honest and a refreshing reminder how to allocate our time and resources
 most efficiently.

—NELL MINNOW, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, MOVIE CRITIC FOR BELIEFNET, AND

[FOUNDER OF MINIVER PRESS, WWW.MOVIEMOM.COM](http://www.moviemom.com/)

##### Social media can be a gigantic waste of time and energy or a seriously smart investment for your business. If you want to know the ROI-based
 way of doing it right read this book.

—YANIK SILVER, FOUNDER MAVERICK 1000 AND AUTHOR OF MAVERICK STARTUP,

[WWW.YANIKSILVER.COM](http://www.yaniksilver.com/)

##### FINALLY, a book that cuts through the social media BS and teaches the real secrets for turning leads into new and repeat business. If you’re ready
 to super-charge your business with social media, then read and absorb the


-----

##### strategies from Kim Walsh-Phillips and Dan Kennedy. It will change your
 business.

—JAMES MALINCHAK, FEATURED ON ABC’S SECRET MILLIONAIRE, FOUNDER OF “BIG

[MONEY SPEAKER[®] COACH BOOT CAMP,” WWW.BIGMONEYSPEAKER.COM](http://www.bigmoneyspeaker.com/)

##### A lot has been written about leveraging social media and we have been conditioned to believe it’s easy, and it just happens. I haven’t found a book that clearly tells you how to leverage social media to generate leads—until now. Dan and Kim show you how to get a strong ROI, increased sales, and
 explain why you shouldn’t worry about metrics that don’t matter: “likes”
 and “comments.”

—DAVID H. MATTSON, CEO AND PRESIDENT OF SANDLER TRAINING,

[WWW.SANDLER.COM](http://www.sandler.com/)

##### This book is so valuable that I’ve handed it to my staff to implement its techniques. Kim and Dan lay out exact methods with case studies on how they got the results, which are so often held close to the chest of marketers.
 They teach you how to convert cold leads to paying customers, and the
 exact metrics of options and lifetime value of a customer.

[—DR. JEREMY WEISZ, FOUNDER OF INSPIREDINSIDER, WWW.INSPIREDINSIDER.COM](http://www.inspiredinsider.com/)

##### I’m usually a speed reader who can finish a book in a couple hours, but this
 book is so helpful that I savored it and read it slowly. I freakin’ love how Dan puts down social media because he’s voicing the issues that kept me from buying ads there. And I learned a lot from seeing how Kim’s process
 can lead to the measurable results that Dan demands.

[—ANDREW WARNER, FOUNDER OF MIXERGY.COM, WWW.MIXERGY.COM](http://www.mixergy.com/)

##### Social media marketing takes paramount importance in any business that
 seeks to grow. This book is loaded with ideas and strategies to help you
 grow an extraordinary enterprise.

—DR. NIDO R. QUBEIN, PRESIDENT OF HIGH POINT UNIVERSITY,

[WWW.HIGHPOINT.EDU](http://www.highpoint.edu/)


-----

##### If you are an entrepreneur or marketer, I highly recommend you get this
 book. After reading, and more importantly, applying direct-response marketing principles to your social media presence, you will be ahead of
 99% of the marketers out there.

—SCOTT DUFFY, FOUNDER AND CEO OF CONTENT.MARKET,

[WWW.CONTENT.MARKET/](http://www.content.market/)

##### Walsh-Phillips and Kennedy deliver everything you need to accelerate your
 business’ growth online without any extraneous fluff. In hard-hitting bullets, two masters arm you with actionable tactics you will benefit from immediately. I’m personally starting to implement their strategies and will
 be advising my clients to do the same.

—KAIHAN KRIPPENDORFF, CEO OF OUTTHINKER LLC, AUTHOR OF OUTTHINK THE

_COMPETITION,_ [WWW.OUTTHINKER.COM](http://www.outthinker.com/)

##### If you want to grow your company with social media, you must read this book. I’ve read and reviewed a lot of business books. There’s so much fluff
 out there. Not this book. Dan and Kim go into detail with specific business
 building strategies for a return on your time and money.

—CLAYTON MORRIS, CO-HOST OF FOX & FRIENDS, FOUNDER OF READQUICK APP,

[WWW.READQUICKAPP.COM](http://www.readquickapp.com/)

##### Every time you communicate, you are either adding value or taking up space. No B.S. Guide to Direct Response Social Media Marketing teaches
 marketers how to cater messages for their audience. Dan and Kim’s combination of direct marketing principles and social media know-how make it easy for business owners to target their audience and stand out from
 competitors.

—SALLY HOGSHEAD, NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR AND CREATOR OF THE

[FASCINATION ADVANTAGE® ASSESSMENT, WWW.HOWTOFASCINATE.COM](http://www.howtofascinate.com/)

##### If you want success and a life of purpose, you can’t let fear and doubt bring
 you down. Read this book to empower you to own the social media space and let your light shine to those who desperately need to hear your message.


-----

—MARSHAWN EVANS DANIELS, ATTORNEY, AUTHOR, AND SPEAKER, MISS AMERICA

[AND NBC’S THE APPRENTICE FINALIST, WWW.MARSHAWN.COM](http://www.marshawn.com/)

##### A lot of time and money is wasted on social media marketing. Many so- called “experts” expound theories and strategies that simply don’t work. In
 direct contrast, this book details how to take Dan Kennedy-style direct response marketing and apply it to social media to ensure real results. If you
 are going to use social media marketing for your business, arm yourself
 with this book by Kennedy and Walsh-Phillips.
