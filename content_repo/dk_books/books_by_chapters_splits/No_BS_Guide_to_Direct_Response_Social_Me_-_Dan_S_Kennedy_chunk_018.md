• A 30-second video
 • Instagram Live
 • Boomerang (quick video on repeat)
 • Zoom in (getting closer to your subject)

 Play around with it and see what works best for your brand. Normally stories will disappear in 24 hours, but if you want it to appear longer, click on the highlight button and save it to the top part of your profile.
 Instagram Stories give you free traffic from people seeking your message, so it’s worth spending the time to test.

 MORE INSTAGRAM GROWTH TOOLS There are more tools to grow your Instagram following …

 •  Emojis. Using emojis gets your post more engagement and hence
 more reach each time. Why? I don’t know, but as I’ve shared, my favorite quote is, “In God I trust, everyone else bring data,” and the data shows that Instagram loves those little emojis. Put them in your post descriptions and comments.
 • Engagement with other pages. Follow key pages in your niche where
 your followers hang out. Comment and like their posts for another way to grow your following. Many people will follow you back if you

###### like their page or comment on their posts. Give some love and get some in return. Especially when you are first starting.
 • Use your other channels to promote your Instagram page. Leverage
 your followers. No matter how small, woo followers to Instagram from other platforms.
 If you have a Facebook channel, email list, YouTube subscribers, readers of your blog, or LinkedIn connections, spend one week promoting the bazooka out of your Instagram. Get everybody to come on over and follow your page.
 You can even offer prizes or incentives or a series like, “This week I’m going to be offering tips about XYZ thing on Instagram. Follow me there. Comment on my page and you can win XYZ.”
 Leverage what you have and promote your challenge up to once per quarter for a whole week, putting it on your schedule ahead of time so you are sure to remember to do it.
 • Create or join an Instagram cluster. Instagram clusters are when a
 group of people agrees to like and comment on each other’s posts to spur engagement on a profile. This activity will help distribution of your post to more of your followers. I joined one when I was experimenting, and while it eventually fizzled out, it was great in the beginning and worth doing.
 Get a group of six to ten people and share that “When I post on Instagram, I will message all of you. Go ahead and Like and Comment on my post.”
 This creates a virtual Bat Signal to Instagram when you do it, telling them, “Ooh, people are enjoying this post,” so they will share it with more people. Do that for each other in your cluster, and your posts will tend to spread to a lot more people.

 PAY TO PLAY STRATEGIES Influencer Marketing There is always an audience gathered that is perfect for you. All that they’re waiting for is your message—like they woke up today, praying, wishing they’d hear from you. They’re already gathered together. How do you get to them?


-----

###### The fantastic thing about Instagram is besides just hashtags we can also leverage other people’s audiences.
 Your future tribe is gathered together in little virtual cocktail parties on Instagram, and you don’t need an invitation to join them. Instead, you can find them by leveraging other people’s audiences, also known as “Influencers.”
 You can pay influencers to promote you. It’s an amazing way to get a lot of eyes on your brand and acquire new followers inexpensively.
 You can find these Influencers by looking for pages with a large number of followers, but who are following a small number of others, and without a person in the profile picture. Often it features one of the “top posts” in a hashtag search instead. Influencers’ posts are pulled into the “Top Posts” search listing Instagram’s Hashtag results.
 For example, @Luxuryworldtraveler had a bunch of followers and a link in their bio about sales inquiries. They are a promotion page and Influencer. See Figure 7.10.

**FIGURE 7.10: Instagram Influencer Page**

###### You can go to these pages directly or contact an Influencer broker who will negotiate for you and hold the money in escrow to make sure the brand does what they are supposed to do before getting paid.
 You can also pay to grow your followers on Instagram.

 PROMOTING A POST


-----

###### You can put a few ad dollars behind your most popular posts and promote them to increase your followers.
 When one of my Instagram posts is doing well, I’ll tap the Promote button, and with just a couple bucks, I get massive engagement and followers on Instagram.
 The ROI is incredible. And truth be told, it is significantly more effective than boosting a post on Facebook. Really, with just a few dollars you can get a lot of reach, engagement, followers, and even list growth.

 How to Promote a Post

 1. When you find a post is doing well, simply click on the blue
 “promote post” button located below the post. 2. You then have the option to choose where your ad will send viewers
 to. If you’re trying to grow your followers, you’re going to want to choose to send them to your profile. You then can either create your audience or have Instagram create your audience for you. 3. Next is budget. You can promote with as little as $2 a day. I like to
 test $5 a day for 6 days, spending just $30 and getting maximum results. (Toasting to the good old days of Facebook advertising that are back again with Instagram.) 4. Finally, set up your payment information and click “create
 promotion.” 5. Do a Happy Dance/Superbowl Shuffle/Fortnite boogie (depending
 on your age and interest) to celebrate because you just increased your Instagram followers.

 And you are done! Expect massive engagement and hundreds of followers for just a few dollars. It’s amazing.
 Of course, before spending anything on Instagram, make sure your bio is set up with a link to your Juicy Carrot. In the end, this isn’t just about growing your Instagram followers. It is about lead generation.
 Instagram is vital to growing your audience, your lists, and sales. You can grow quickly with these hacks, building your email list and driving

 If you aren’t on yet, don’t fear. The best time to start is right now. And I have a little cheat sheet for you, as a bonus for reading this book. Visit nobssocialmediabook.com/powerpack for my top ten Instagram Posts to use as a guide for your own content.

 LinkedIn As I shared earlier, before I discovered direct-response marketing, I spent a whole lot of time and money because I was continuously chasing people who were not in my target market. I was busy all the time with nothing to show for it.
 Once I discovered results-based marketing, the core of this book, I knew I wanted to start using it to land more clients. The problem was, I didn’t have an advertising budget.
 After I read Dan’s original book, No B.S. Direct Marketing: The Ultimate No-Holds-Barred Kick-Butt Take-No-Prisoners Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses, I needed to find a way to expand my network and attract better paying clients … without spending money on ads.
 In came LinkedIn. I began sharing content daily about getting leads and sales using social media. Not just likes or clicks, but leads and sales.
 And for the first time in my career, a client came to me that I had never met before.
 On Saturday, January 22, 2010, I was in the kitchen in our tiny third- floor apartment. I was pregnant with our first child and a bit crazy with hormones, so when my husband heard me screaming, he thought I had officially lost it.
 He was delighted to find out that I was just really happy. A prospect had contacted me because of the marketing I was doing online.
 This message came from the president of an accounting firm:

 Hi, Kim. I don’t believe we’ve ever met. However, I’m familiar with you and your company via the social media sphere. I’m looking for a marketing firm with a robust understanding of social media to

###### advise, provide feedback on a periodic basis as it relates to our marketing strategy, and marketing and social media initiatives and campaigns. If this is something you’d like to explore further, please call me or drop me an email. Steve.

 It was so hard to wait until Monday to contact him … but I did. And I got the client.

 SO WHY LINKEDIN FOR YOU? There are over 500 million people on LinkedIn. It’s a huge channel, larger than any television network you could reach. And someone new joins every two seconds.
 Executives from every Fortune 500 company are on there, so these are legit, high-net worth contacts with high executive experience. Members conduct over 2 billion searches each day. So, people are on there—looking for products, programs, and services. And if you want to close a sale, you’ve got to be where the people are, right? Because before you can close that sale, you’ve got to get their attention. They’re on LinkedIn right now waiting to talk to you.
 LinkedIn combines networking with data generation, the ultimate in ROI-based networking.
 Early on, I spent so much time going to Chamber networking events, thinking, “Gosh, I wish I could just see little bubbles above people’s heads, telling me whether they are the decision maker. Do they need what I have to offer?” I wanted to cut through all the clutter to connect with only those who were a best match for my services.
 On LinkedIn you can network that way because you see all the vital stats right on the profile. You’ll know who they are, whether they are a decision maker, what experience they have, and what they are interested in. Is this someone who would be a good match for you? You can find out before you ever waste a single second networking.
 LinkedIn allows you to conduct all this research upfront: You can spy on your competitors. You can see a list of their top clients and activity. You can also check out your prospects to discover who’s recommending them and interacting with them.


-----

###### You can actually click on the activity button on their profile to see all the ways they’ve been interacting with people, letting you know more about their network.
 Use this as an ongoing information-gathering tool. Visit the profiles of your Dream 100. Read their posts and articles. If they are members of any groups, consider these as suggestions for other groups you can join. It will also show you what keywords and skill sets they are interested in.
 When you visit someone’s account, take a look at the “skills” they have listed to understand their interests and focus. This gives you a lot of great information before those prospect meetings you were already engaged in.
 Quick Win: Check out the meetings on your calendar for the next two weeks. Connect with those prospects via LinkedIn now, and check out their profiles to get to know them better. When you meet in person, mention something you read about them on their profile. This will blow them away with the research you did ahead of your meeting.

 YOUR LINKEDIN HOME BASE It is time to get your LinkedIn house in order, following one of my favorite Colin Powell quotes: “There are no secrets to success. It’s the result of preparation and hard work.”
 One great way to get started before you create your LinkedIn profile is to visit a site called answerthepublic.com. Ignore the creepy dude in the background and just type in your topic.
 The website will show you all the questions people ask on Google surrounding that topic. For example, I typed in “Facebook marketing” and received a huge list of questions people were asking right now about Facebook marketing. Because these questions are being asked in Google, using this information can help your search rankings later.
 For example, if someone asks, “How to make money with Facebook marketing,” you can write a blog post or article titled “How to make money on Facebook through marketing.” Then you will be more likely to pop up in similar search results. Now you just jumped ahead of all your competitors because people can find you.
 The same goes with writing your LinkedIn profile. The more terms and phrases you can use from what people are actually searching for, the more


-----

###### often you’ll show up in those 2 billion daily searches on LinkedIn—and more often on Google, because LinkedIn is integrated with Google search. Not only are you now driving more traffic from LinkedIn, but you’ll also benefit from more people learning about you on Google. How cool is that?
 How to do it:

 • Visit answerthepublic.com, type in your topic, then download those
 lists of questions as a PDF. It’s totally free.
 • Use this for content ideas, as mentioned above. You can use the
 questions word-for-word.
 • You will also uncover how people talk about your niche and how you
 should be describing it.
 • Too often marketers and business owners use jargon terms the end
 user doesn’t know. When you design your copy the same way your target market talks about it, you will be light-years ahead in building their trust.
 • Some key things to remember when creating or updating your
 LinkedIn profile:
 • Same is lame; looking like everybody else is not going to help you
 stand out. Standing out is a quick way to tell them, “Hmm, this is something different. This might be a new opportunity, something worth checking out.” It’s going to create curiosity, which will help grab attention.
 • Keywords rule. Use words that people are already looking for,
 borrowed from that answerthepublic search.
 • Make your entire profile about the individual, not about you. People
 won’t care about you until they know that you care first. But they won’t know you care until you take time to develop a relationship with them. However, you can’t develop this relationship until you get them to pay attention. So, what do they care about? Themselves. Make it all about them, giving them what they want. That is the key way to get started.
 • Remember, copy counts—the way you describe things, and the way
 you write. This can give you a huge competitive advantage for standing out and being different from the very, very beginning.

###### Profile Picture When it comes to your LinkedIn profile, make sure you use a profile picture. Not a selfie. Delete that picture of you with your dog. This should be a professional photograph. It is very important.
 As far as your profile picture, smiling rules. You are five times more likely to be contacted by a prospect if you are smiling in your headshot … so if you’re a smirker, or a nonsmiler, or look constipated in all your photos, it’s time to get over it and smile so you could be five times more likely to be contacted.
 Action shots where you are smiling are a bonus. Let’s say you have a great picture of you on stage, at an event, perhaps raising your hand, getting the whole audience involved—great! Or if you’re a scientist or a doctor in your white lab coat and you’re smiling—great. Either way, make sure it looks professional.
 An image or logo is effective for brand building, so if you want to add that detail to your profile picture, go for it. Just don’t use your logo as the profile picture itself.
 A great resource for hiring a professional photographer is thumbtack.com. Search for “headshot photographer,” and you’ll find a lot of great options, typically with portfolios already available. It’s an incredible way to find a pro.

 Headline Next, flesh out your headline, your description, your skills, and your endorsements.
 When it comes to your headline, you can use it for many different things:

 • to establish your authority
 • to go after your target market
 • to utilize keywords so that you’re found more often

 It does need to be 120 characters or less. Decide first what is your goal—just one. Do you want more prospects, more sales conversations, more speaking gigs, or maybe even a book deal?
