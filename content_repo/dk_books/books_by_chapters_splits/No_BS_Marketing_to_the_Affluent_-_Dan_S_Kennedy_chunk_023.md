 When you step down from these ultra-affluent business leaders to the merely affluent, you find even more serious frugality. While they all have one or two things they will spend wildly on, most abhor waste and have an emotional need to buy smart with most things they buy. I believe this is rooted in two things: 1) a patch of thin skin about others’ perceptions of the rich-as-drunken-sailor spenders who are fools about money, reinforced by the news stories featuring those who are; and 2) a vivid memoir of and residual paranoia about from whence they came, when spare change from the couch cushions was needed to buy dinner. Most affluent entrepreneurs harbor a nagging fear of losing it all or having it all taken away from them and winding up broke. This anxiety is always there, like a low-grade infection. If they feel they are wasting money, that anxiety flares up.
 It’s important to know that the price these people will pay for something has to do with how right and justified or queasy and irrational they feel about it. Not about intrinsic value or their own ability to pay.
 In marketing to the affluent, you will mostly be marketing to these people who have made themselves affluent through ingenuity and initiative —not rich heiresses roaming Rodeo Drive between two-martini lunches and hours at the spa, not rappers and rock stars or superstar athletes draped in bling. The way you present yourself to them must be in sync with their values.

 I want to tell you about four people.

 One drives a $400,000.00 Maybach (a luxury auto I also own) and a $360,000.00 Bentley, wears a diamond-encrusted one-of-a-kind wristwatch, lives in a two-floor penthouse in New York in which he removed walls in order to create a big home theater. He is as new-rich flashy as can be.

##### The second guy splurges on $500-a-box cigars, his custom shoes cost $500.00 a pair, his oddball vehicle stable includes an actual M47 tank, and he has ownership interests in over 100 businesses and is a significant stockholder in companies like Weight Watchers and Walmart.

 The third guy wears only perfectly tailored Armani suits, has a large motorcycle collection, and has several homes each worth upwards of $10 million.

 The fourth calls himself a beer-and-pretzels guy, wears jeans and rugby shirts every day, drives a 5-year-old car, and owns a huge home with only a few rooms in it furnished, but owns and uses a Gulfstream V and famously makes large purchases and investments.

 The first guy was expelled from high school and never finished, and after being rejected by every company in his industry that he submitted his demo product to, he produced it himself and started selling it out of the trunk of his car. He is worth an estimated $300 million.

 The second guy is an immigrant, was rejected by many potential employers, and made some of his first money with a kitchen table info- marketing/mail-order business. He began buying cheap real estate before he owned a home of his own or even had an apartment of his own, while bunking with friends. His estimated net worth exceeds $400 million.

 The third guy grew up in a trailer, with his mother and a series of “stepfathers.” He worked in a rock quarry, as an adding machine salesman B2B door-to-door, and at an ice cream stand, before being hired as an announcer by his biological father—from whom he later bought the small business in 1982, grew it, took it public, and made it a multimillion-dollar enterprise. His estimated net worth exceeds $500 million.

 The fourth guy has benefited from a little luck and fortuitous timing—he sold the second company he built to Yahoo! for $5.7 billion, before the dot.com crash. But he’s from a blue-collar family background, and he started his first business after working, selling, scamming, and paying

##### his own way through college. He became a millionaire from it by age 31. His estimated net worth exceeds $1 billion.

 The first rich guy is Jay-Z. The second, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Third, Vince McMahon. Fourth, Mark Cuban. You see him now on Shark Tank.

 How They Spend Their Money

 Cuban is most transparent in not caring about some things and thus being relatively cheap in spending on those things, while caring a lot about other things and spending on them, ludicrously. Nobody needs a Gulfstream V; not for speed, security, or convenience. But if you could closely examine the other three, you’d uncover the same fact. To Arnold, fine cigars and enjoying them is of earth-shaking, prime importance. You can be certain he reads Cigar Aficionado magazine. As Governor of California, he even challenged the anti-smoking rules at the state capitol. He also cares passionately about ownership of iconic American companies and quality real estate, like shopping malls. I am certain we could find other things he has no interest in at all, and may very well be buying ordinary goods at ordinary prices in those categories. Jay-Z is about “bling” impressive to fellow rappers and entertainers, but he is not an accumulator of large residences around the country.

 Appearances, status, and peers’ opinions seem to matter to them all, although maybe less to Arnold than the others. Cuban bought an NBA basketball team, McMahon took a stab at a new pro foot-ball league, and his wife poured money into a U.S. Senate campaign. Jay-Z wants to be known as something much bigger than a rap music mogul; he has a vodka brand, an apparel company, and minority ownership in a pro basketball team. The rich and super-rich buy things that reinforce or raise their prestige. The self-made rich tend to (try to) buy respect and respectability. They are also intensely, perhaps obsessively, competitive. Visibly, notably winning, leading, having the biggest, the best, is important to them.


-----

##### They all indulge themselves, expensively, and openly. There is none of the (artificial) humility of a Warren Buffett here. Schwarzenegger recently retold his story of buying the tank on the Kimmel show—and clearly relished the telling of it. Cuban is happy to have you know his $41 million Gulfstream is the largest online purchase in history. Jay-Z didn’t just buy a fantastically expensive watch—he had a custom Audemars Piguet made.

 And what do you think they think about their indulgent and lavish and mostly showy spending? They are obviously uninhibited. I would imagine, if challenged about it, they would say—contrary to Obama’s ideas—that they created it, they built it, they earned and earn it, and they’re fully entitled to keep it and spend it any damn way they please. They share hard-scrabble starts, and they appreciate and respond well to “hustle” and hustlers. They have all been underestimated underdogs.

 This gives you valuable insight, as a marketer or sales professional, engaging such people—whether worth a mere million or ten million or hundreds of millions of dollars.

### The ¾-Full Glass

##### “In all likelihood, world inflation is over.”

—THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, IN 1959

# As I was finishing this chapter, in November of 2018, the “Trump
##### Economy” was red hot and firing on all cylinders. Breaking positive records with every metric, including lowest unemployment and lowest minority unemployment yet best workforce participation and highest number of open jobs in decades, significant wage growth after a decade of stagnation, stock market highs even with the Fed raising interest rates to point of attractive yield to fixed income investors, and so on and so on. Much of this news was, incredibly, reported in negative terms, with headlines like these:

##### Record Low Unemployment and Wage Growth Raises Fears of
 Inflation

 When Will This Blazing Hot Economy Turn to Recession?

 How Can All The Numbers Be Great? Experts Voice Skepticism No one wants to be guilty of Greenspan’s irrational exuberance, or caught with their pants down celebrating too much good news too cheerfully when bad news rears its head. Remarks like the one on the previous page have bitten experts and pundits and politicians so often there is actually a fear of optimism and of good economic news. This is exacerbated by the morphing of news media into partisan, political propaganda entities acting as two boxers from opposing corners of the ring, so there is always half of the media screaming about a sky soon to fall. This equation has been taking hold for some time, but the unmatched level of anathema toward President Trump has made it far more pronounced and fiery than ever before. For much of the political establishment, mainstream media, and financial media, no success can be acknowledged, no credit given. Any sunny day that might once have been happily acknowledged must now be couched as a dire warning of global warming!
 Of course, no one—me included—can forecast what the economy may be doing six months or so into any future let alone this one, the pregnancy term of this book. So I have omitted reams of statistical data relevant now that may be obsolete, one way or the other, by the time you read this. Instead, I’m going to talk broadly about economic matters, and their psychology, as it affects your successful conduct of business with affluent customers.
 A very important thing to understand about the psychology of affluence and spending or investing by the affluent is optimism. Nothing actually changed (yet) the day Trump was elected or inaugurated except his own address of record, but all sorts of behavior of investors and customers immediately changed purely because their mood changed, from pessimistic or lethargic to optimistic.
 The cynic might think it’s easy for the affluent to be optimistic because they have so much money, but that ignores the fact that the majority of the affluent got to this point through their own initiative as entrepreneurs,


-----

##### business owners, and investors and, themselves, cite optimism as a cause rather than effect. At their core, they are optimists. And they tend to be most responsive to optimistic messages.
 In my own survey of millionaire entrepreneurs, I consistently find that the overwhelming majority rank Ronald Reagan as the best President of our lifetimes and rank John F. Kennedy as second best. The title of worst went to Jimmy Carter. If you carefully examine the speeches, addresses to the nation, interviews, and overriding themes of these three men and their presidencies, you can easily see Reagan and Kennedy as representatives of optimism, Carter as a representative of pessimism.
 I have several clients in the investment real estate field who have been largely unaffected by the troubles that began dominating the news from mid-2007: the mortgage meltdown, tightening of available credit, slow housing market, drops in values. Many of their competitors saw their investor customers freeze new investing. Not my clients. Why? Because they quickly became passionate preachers of a positive message. Citing John D. Rockefeller’s famous “buy when there is blood in the streets” advice, they have beat the drum of now as the best time ever to find bargains and buy, buy, buy.
 Most affluent entrepreneurs are very familiar with Napoleon Hill, author of Think and Grow Rich, and his admonition that “in every adversity lies the seeds of equal or greater opportunity.” This is a belief already in place that any marketer can link himself to when his industry, product, or service category or clientele are actually facing difficult times or are being told they are—or soon may be—by the media.
 Optimists are naturally attracted to other optimists. If you seek to go where the money is, you will find yourself unwelcome if you lack and fail to express an attitude of optimism. I have long told my clients, “Whatever else you are a merchant of, be sure that you are also a merchant of good news.” There is a simple principle I teach about marketing relationships with customers of any and all kinds that applies trebly to affluent customers who nearly always have ample ability to spend, but are subject to mood swings affecting their willingness to spend: After every encounter and communication, leave the customer feeling better about himself and the world around him than he was when you got there. Lift.

### What the Wealthy and Successful Believe That
 the Poor and Unsuccessful Do Not

 If you roam the libraries and bookshelves in any ten affluent or ultra##### affluent individuals’ homes and offices, you will find at least seven well stocked with what I call the literature of the rich. Books like Think and Grow Rich, The Power of Positive Thinking, The Magic of Thinking Big, and other classic perennial bestsellers of similar theme. If you visit the homes of any ten poor people, you will likely find none of these books in any of the homes. It is not coincidence. It is causative. The possession of such books reveals a very particular and specific mindset on the part of the affluent—that there is a profound and direct link between their thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs and their prosperity. Consequently, the affluent of this belief are conscious, even forced, optimists. They deliberately resist their own pessimism or pessimism delivered to them by others. The poor, on the other hand, are extremely pessimistic and welcome delivered pessimism as proof that their lack of success is rooted in circumstances beyond their control. The rich explain the poor as “poor of mind, poor in purse.” The next logical extension of this is that the rich tend away from skepticism, the poor tend to it. Pessimism and skepticism are close cousins. Because the rich strive not to permit themselves to be pessimistic, they automatically tend not to be skeptical.

 So whom would you rather be selling to—a skeptical and pessimistic person or an accepting and optimistic person?

### Peer Deep into Their Souls

##### “I do not wish to be in any club that would have me as a member.”

—GROUCHO MARX

# The affluent are segregationists. Even those loudly proclaiming their
##### liberal or socialist politics and social consciousness. Segregationists all.
 In the old South, white people didn’t want to drink water from water fountains used by blacks. In the new Richistan, rich people do not want to drink the same water or use the same entrances or, God forbid, sleep on the same sheets as ordinary folk. Richistan is the “place” described by Robert Frank in the fascinating book Richistan: A Journey Through the American Wealth Boom and the Lives of the New Rich, a must-read for every marketer

##### to the affluent. Among other things, it gives insight to the tiered and aspirational elitism of the mass-affluent, affluent, and ultraaffluent, each group emotionally validated by its purchased privileges that those one level lower are denied.
 First of all, segregation has been the NATURAL order of things since cavemen. We form tribes. In elementary school, junior high school, high school, and college. At work, at the office, within our professional and trade associations. In our cities and neighborhoods. We form tribes. We form tribes more to exclude than include. We seek separation, differentiation, and disassociation from unlike as well as association with like.
 In an episode of Mad Men, the outstanding AMC dramedy about the advertising agency business—and life—in the 1950s, a new woman moves into the suburban community, and she is, horror of horrors, a mother of a young child, divorced, without a husband. All the other women are married, of that tribe, and quickly close ranks to protect their husbands and themselves from the dangerous influence of this foreign, exotic creature. In a storyline in Grey’s Anatomy, the long-running medical drama on ABC, a young, progressive doctor is brought into the hospital to revamp the surgical residency program. She immediately begins changing things. Her peers close ranks, conspire against her, shut her out of surgeries, and despite evidence of the superiority of her methods, eventually get her fired. The tribe was threatened. The tribe protected itself.
 These reminded me of an episode of the old Andy Griffith Show, when a stranger comes to Mayberry, and everyone becomes convinced he’s an international spy, just because he is a stranger. This speaks to the fear, paranoia, loathing, dislike, and disdain we have for the different even as we seek to feel different. The tribes we form try to reinforce our differences as superiority by excluding a majority of those we can label as inferior.
 Assimilation has remained a theoretical goal but never realized. Each tribe voluntarily segregates. If this were not the case, there would be no BET or NAACP, there would be no gay pride parades or gay and lesbian magazines and websites, no Italian or German neighborhoods, no Chinatowns, no women’s health clubs like Curves®, and, in economic examples, no private schools or colleges. No one would want such things. Everyone would want only to be fully and completely assimilated with everyone else. But this is not what you want or what I want. Nor is it what
