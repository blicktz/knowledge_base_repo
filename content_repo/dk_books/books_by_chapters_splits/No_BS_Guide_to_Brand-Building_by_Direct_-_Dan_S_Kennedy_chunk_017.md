###### Forrest and I thought this test was something special enough to at least apply for the Infusionsoft Ultimate Marketer of the Year award, even though we knew that more than 10,000 businesses around the world use the software, and it’d be tough to actually win the award. However, to our surprise, we not only were selected to present on stage in front of more than 2,000 people, as one of the four finalists for this award, but we were voted the winners!
 Winning the award has had an ROI of its own for the franchise model because we were crowned as the winners on the very same day that we officially began franchising. Since then, the award has gotten us more PR and speaking opportunities to grow our expert status and credibility in just one year than most established brands have earned over a much longer time period, with a price tag that we couldn’t have afforded.
 As for The Bay Door, our developers have knocked it out of the park, building tech that our franchisees can utilize to continue growing the Iron Tribe brand within their own tribes. So it is taking the results of this Infusionsoft test and cranking it up to an even higher standard.
 The back-end staff UI streamlines staff processes that used to seem tedious to allow their jobs to be focused more on prospect and client engagement and much less on the creative external and internal marketing processes that they’d rather not think about.
 The front-end client UIs provide constant brand imprints on the brains of each Iron Tribe athlete through the website, iPad, and iPhone applications. They not only continue to enhance retention but, once again, increase members’ ability to refer and help us grow faster than ever.
 Oh, yeah, and it gives us a place and automated method to sell them further products and services on top of their monthly athlete membership subscriptions.
 You may be able to accomplish a lot of this with basic Infusionsoft or with other technology. Maybe you’ll need to band together with other owners and operators of your kind of business to get a customized or semi- customized automated marketing system built. However you have to do it, you’ll find that automation of marketing and communications is a game- changer and a great competitive advantage.

## Faster Than They Can
 Copy

###### o brand dare stand still. We understood from the beginning that we would never get There, wherever There is. Not be able to rest and take a breather. That building a brand was not a journey so

###### much as an endless process.
 A lot of brand owners get lazy, and then they get commoditized, and then they are gone. Consider the demise of the venerable Kodak, a brand with roots in the 19th century. At one time, you would have had a difficult time finding any home without Kodak cameras, film, or processed photographs in it. But then, Instagram. And something looming will be next. The difference between a commodity and an engaging experience that fascinates and keeps customers is innovation. The chief cause of


-----

###### commoditization is imitation, then proliferating imitation. The only practical answer is innovation.
 We know we can’t rely on our brand—unless we keep people interested in it.

##### Let’s Give ’Em Something To Talk About

###### The latest research shows that people share more than 16,000 words per day and every hour there are more than 100 million conversations about brands. This has put word-of-mouth at the forefront of as much as 50% of all business transactions.
 People hear this and immediately think, “Wow, technology has changed the entire game, because people are doing all of this word-of-mouth on the internet.”
 WRONG. More than 90% of word-of-mouth marketing actually occurs offline! Iron Tribe has a social status to it. Member athletes feel like they just HAVE to talk about it, whether it’s because of their personal transformation, the different things they accomplish in their workouts that most people have never done before, or, of course, the exclusivity and status that come from the premium cost that those on the outside may question.
 Each member athlete feels like an insider, as they should. They are working harder together than most on the outside could ever imagine. They are also part of a group that is much bigger than themselves. It creates an insider feeling of exclusivity that has a scarcity to it because there are only 300 member athlete spots per Iron Tribe gym.
 These are all motivating factors for their word-of-mouth, and so is the gamification aspect that has each member athlete consistently competing with their own workout results, let alone those of their peers.
 However, these are all aspects of our business model that Forrest so eloquently laid the groundwork for with his initial development of the Iron Tribe business model.
 It’s been a blessing to join him in developing this model over time. And while he and I will continue to enhance all of the preceding aspects of the business model and the overall brand itself, our biggest innovation


-----

###### playground will always revolve around the direct-response marketing portion of our business.
 The biggest innovation piece we are working on today is not in our technology or even our unit economics. Instead, it’s a business-to-business campaign to provide our gyms with the ability to sell groups of athlete memberships in one consultation to an entire business group of employees who are scared of health-care costs and need a program like Iron Tribe to keep them away from the doctor!
 We continue to ask our selves, “How can we get our new gyms to 300 faster?”
 The day we stop asking that question is the day we turn toward Kodak- like complacency and away from the innovative tests that have helped us grow to this point.

## Brand-Building Powered by
 Unique Selling Proposition
 and Dynamic Core Story:

### GKIC Case Study Examples

###### by Dave Dee


###### ey, it’s Dave Dee again. We met earlier in the Preface. One of the things I get to do at GKIC is talk with and coach many of our Members, old and new, during the course of each year, at our two

# H

###### big annual conferences, the Fast Start Implementation Boot Camps held several times a year, in my Platinum Mastermind Group, and on question- answer tele-seminars and webinars. One of the ideas that’s just about unanimous with all these business owners I talk to, train, coach, and share information with is a desire to own a great brand. A lot of businesspeople who want one never engage in the kind of thinking we’re all involved in


-----

###### now, in this book, about what such a desirable thing, the great brand, is actually made of.
 There’s a brand you probably know: Intel. Many computer and technology products are labeled and promoted as “Having Intel Inside” or “Powered By Intel.” I like the phrase “Powered By.” It suggests that there’s a force driving things forward, making them possible. Direct-response brand-building and brands are powered by three components: a Unique Selling Proposition (USP), a Dynamic Core Story (DCS), and effective visual presence—which gets to brand image, trademarks, colors, as well as places where you are seen, from the media you choose, to storefront looks, to the charity or community events sponsored. Here we’re going to zero in on the first two, and how people in very different businesses have used them as well as some advice I’ve given them along the way.

##### Example 1: Shaun Buck, The Newsletter Pro

###### Shaun is in two GKIC coaching groups, the Peak Performers/Implementation Group and the Titanium Group, after time in my Platinum Group. He is a very ambitious, very creative entrepreneur essentially in the printing business, but made proprietary and un-ordinary by creating customized newsletters for various kinds of businesses and professional practices to send to their customers and patients. His USP is: Creating unique newsletters, entirely done for you, mailed directly to your customers and prospects for you, that sound as if they were written by you— without you ever having to write a single word, guaranteed. Shaun has absolutely nailed that USP. It tells his prospects exactly what he does for them, it promises ease and convenience without dull standardization, and it includes mention of a guarantee, all in just 35 words.
 Here is his DCS:

 I had my first experience with newsletters when I was looking to purchase my second business. I started my research by requesting information from a few dozen franchise companies. Along with brochures and franchise documents, I got a lot of phone calls, but, after a month or two, the phone calls had all but stopped. Only one franchisor, selling a dry cleaning business, kept in contact with an 8

-----

###### to 16-page monthly newsletter. Every time an issue came in the mail, I read it from cover to cover. I couldn’t wait to read about the success different franchise owners were having. Over months, I felt like I had a connection with this franchise company and the people in it. When a newsletter arrived all about their coming annual convention, I bought my franchise six months sooner than I’d planned so I could attend. Once I got started operating a franchise dry cleaning store, I found out one of the requirements was that you had to publish a monthly newsletter and send it to all your customers. This made sense because it copied the way I’d been sold my franchise. But, with no training or guidance, I took a stab at my newsletter, and I may have created the world’s most boring newsletter! I made mistakes most business owners make trying this —for example, 1) being boring, 2) being entirely focused on my business instead of on my customers and their interests, 3) not seeing the newsletter as a piece of an overall strategy, and 4) not using it to build relationship with my customers.
 After two years of struggling, I went back to the newsletters I’d received that I had wanted to read. I reworked my entire newsletter. Less than three days after my first issue of this new, friendly, interesting, relationship-building newsletter went out, I got my first call from a customer raving about it. I jokingly asked her what she thought about the old version, and she said she’d never seen it, even though I had been mailing it to her for two years! We continued to build our business by mailing this newsletter, but I admit I always had a hard time finding the day it took every month to do. When I decided to move on from the dry cleaning business and thought about my best skill, I realized that I had mastered retaining customers and sparking referrals with a great newsletter. That day, Newsletter Pro was born. It’s not about teaching you to do it, and it’s not about prefabricated, standardized content. I created a company to produce customized and unique newsletters that sound like they are written by you, for your customers, without you having to ever lift a finger or take time away from your business.


-----

###### Isn’t Shaun’s DCS great? He has an interesting origin story about how he first discovered the power of newsletters. He also has a struggle-and- triumph story that shows him getting a hard knocks education on how to put together newsletters that work and that suggests to his prospect that there are a lot of mistakes to be avoided by using his services. His DCS positions Shaun as the go-to guy for newsletter marketing.

##### Example 2: Sandro Piancone, The Mexpert

###### GKIC Diamond Member Sandro Piancone runs a $100 million-a-year organization that helps companies sell and import their products to Mexico. His USP is The leading authority to doing business profitably in Mexico, used by some of the world’s largest companies. I think there’s an opportunity to make the USP more dramatic and specific: Step-by-step processes for profitably exporting your consumer packaged goods into the Mexican marketplace without lawyers or international trade hassles— guaranteed.


**DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: Dave definitely strengthened the impact of Sandro’s**
USP, with specifics and with problems or fears erased, like “without lawyers.” But in my
opinion, he sacrificed what I call Leadership Position in the rewrite. My version is: _The_
_leading authority in doing business profitably in Mexico, relied on by some of the world’s_
_largest companies for step-by-step processes and successful export of consumer packaged_
_goods into the Mexican marketplace—without lawyers or international trade hassles,_
_guaranteed. Obviously, mine is more verbose, but still just 39 words. If it can be said as one_
long or two short sentences, I’m fine with this length of a USP. The key goal is clarity, not just
brevity.


###### Sandro’s DCS:

 I am the Chief Mexpert Officer of Mexico Sales Made Easy. Yes, Mexpert is a real word. I trademarked it. I’m not a Mexpert because I have a degree in international business or finance, but because, in 14 years, I have made more mistakes than anyone and spent more money making those mistakes than anyone in selling into this market. My team and I can make sure you don’t repeat any


-----

###### of those mistakes. While making mistakes, I’ve also hit home runs and grand slams. Since 1998, I have generated over $500 million in sales and profits for my clients and partners, and I have introduced a number of U.S. brands to Mexico, including Miller Beer, Roma Food, and Rockstar Energy Drinks. I currently work with Little Caesar’s and 5-Hour Energy.

 Sandro’s DCS establishes authority, credibility, and expertise. It is specific about his years of experiences, sales achievement, and client roster —not vague or general. It’s made more believable because he mentions mistakes as well as successes. That also makes Sandro come off as a likable guy—which, incidentally, he is.

##### Example 3: Al Watson, Fanfare Catering

###### Al is, as of this book’s writing, new to GKIC and to the way we approach marketing. He has quickly made great strides. His USP was: Fanfares will take your ideas, add our expertise, and create an event you will never forget. While it’s alive with promise, it’s a little too general, and it fails to play to Fanfare’s coolest asset: they are literally caterers to the stars, which I learned only by talking to Al. The better USP we worked out is: Caterer to the stars, Al Watson and Fanfares will take your ideas, add our expertise, and create a uniquely customized event that will make you and your guests feel like VIP celebrities. We’ve brought Al himself into this, added benefit language (customized), and added emotional appeal, telling them they’ll feel like celebrities. When Dan Kennedy saw it, he wanted to tinker further because he hated giving up Al’s original “never forget” idea. That produced: Caterer to the stars, Al Watson and Fanfares will take your ideas, add our expertise, and create a uniquely customized event that will make you and your guests feel like VIP celebrities—and that no one will ever forget!
 Al’s DCS:

 My parents started the company when I was 10 years old. Fanfares started by right place, right time. My dad was a salesman for C&K Distributors, which sold Old Style Beer, and he was


-----

###### making a sales call at Al Pars Liquors, the one on 71st Street. He overheard Al making arrangements to sponsor a concert, heard him saying he needed a caterer, and Dad yelled, “I’ll do it.” Al looked at him and asked, “Do you know what you are doing, Ted?” And Dad said, “Of course, done it many times.” We did not know what to do. We actually hired another caterer and watched them for the next three months, then really started on our own. We started in the entertainment industry, catering for Patti LaBelle, Rick James, Prince, and many others I can’t name. Our staff consisted of Mom and Dad; my grandmother, Mama Jewel; a great-aunt;, and Anne, Mom’s play sister. Our waitstaff and dishwashers were me at 10 years old, another 10-year-old, and an 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old. Guests loved it when we were serving, even though I could barely see over the buffet table. They only paid us $20.00 a day for 10-hour days. Our parents didn’t care—they wanted their boys working. We were rich in our world! I wish I could get away with that today. Now, when people want a flawless event, they call Fanfares.

 I have edited a lot out of Al’s DCS. It was far too long and risked being boring. Worse, he focused on his company as he likes to think about it rather than on how his business benefits its customers. When you talk about yourself and your company, you have to connect it to benefits the customers care about. In my rewrite of Al’s DCS, you’ll see what I’ve left behind and the additional information I pulled out of him.
