One of the things I'm asked most often about my own work
habits is how I manage to do so much writing along with everything else I do. Just to quickly tick these things off, during the
year I speak, spend 30 or 40 single days of consulting with new
clients, service two dozen or so consulting clients at any one
time, attend several major multi-day conventions, run my own
publishing and mail-order business, and attend other business
interests, investments, and my racing activities. Then on top of
all that, I write at least one book a year for trade publishers that
go into the bookstores, edit two monthly newsletters, and do a
tremendous amount of advertising copywriting for my clients.
How do I do all that writing?

There are two answers. First, I write for at least one hour
every morning, virtually no matter what. The first hour of my
morning, sometimes 5:00 to 6:00, often 6:00 to 7:00, occasionally
7:00 to 8:00, I write. At home, on the road, doesn't matter.
Weekdays or weekends, doesn't matter. Tired or not, doesn't matter. Inspired or not, doesn't matter. If I am under a tough copywriting deadline for a client, I'll give the hour to that task. Most
days, that first hour goes to my own books, tapes, and newsletters. Second, I block time often weeks and occasionally months in
advance, as appointments with myself for certain writing projects. If I did not "block time" this way, I assure you, I'd get a fraction of this output done, and I'd be woefully behind all the time.

In short, if you lay your calendar out before you and pre-assign
or block as much of your time as possible, as much in advance as possible—carved

in rock not written lightly in pencil—you will

years back, I was counseling a chiroprac
tor new to practice and advised her to close her office

for one day a week, call that "Marketing Day," and

devote that entire day to calling patients, visiting health
food stores, calling on businesses, giving speeches, and

so on. Left to be "fit in" as time allowed, most of these

very productive things would never have happened.

then leave yourself only a small amount of loose, unassigned
time. Further, by blocking time for important, high-value func-tions

you perform, you prevent demands of others from moving
your highest and best-value activities from number one to num-ber

ten on your list, over and over again.

###### Technique #8: Minimize Unplanned Activity Uy
reducing unscheduled time and unplanned activity, you automatically reduce waste.

If you look around carefully, you'll see that most people just
sort of show up. They arrive at the office and react. If you press
them for their day's plan, you'll find they may have only one or
two scheduled activities—one of which is usually lunch. (That
attitude reminds me of the Peanuts cartoon: what class do you
like best? Recess.) They may also have a few things on a "loose"
things-to-do list. All the unscheduled time somehow gets used
up, but if you again press them at the end of the day, or better yet,
at the end of the week, they cannot tell you where it went.

Just as the person who cannot tell you where his money goes
is forever destined to be poor, the person who cannot tell you
where his time goes is forever destined to be unproductive. And,
often, poor.

Ideally, you should schedule your day by the half-hour, from
beginning to end.

If you do project work as I do, it's important to estimate the
minutes or hours required and work against the clock, against
deadlines. Every task gets completed faster and more efficiently
when you have determined in advance how long it should take
and set a time for its completion. This, too, minimizes unplanned
activity.

###### Technique #9: Profit from "Odd-Lot" Time

Stuck in traffic? Audiocassette tapes and CDs—arguably the
greatest educational inventions since the Gutenberg press—let
you easily and cheaply turn your car into a classroom, a seminar
with America's best speakers, an uplifting literary experience, a
laugh-filled comedy club, or a Shakespearean festival. Just about
every notable self-improvement, sales training, marketing or
business expert, author or speaker has a variety of material
available in audio form. (For a catalog of mine, log onto
[www.dankennedyproducts.com.) But you needn't stop there.](http://www.dankennedyproducts.com)
Information about any and every topic, from experts ranging
from noted college professors to nutrition, health, and fitness
gurus to, well, you name it, is available in audio form. Books on
tape or CD provide great readings and condensations of everything from the greatest literature of all time to the most contemporary novels. If you need some endorphin therapy, pick up

of the great radio comedies of old, or famous comics like Hob
and Ray, or very current stand-up comedians. Or learn a for-eign
language, improve your memory, improve your math skills, ill
by plugging in a cassette tape or CD during otherwise wasted
lime.

Waiting time in offices, airports? Take along a cassette or CD
player and an earplug or a file of magazines and newsletters to go

through at your convenience. Keep handy a notepad, a pen, .ind

a topic to think about and brainstorm. Have mini-projects .ind
throw-away reading with you or Psycho-Cybernetics mental exercises

to do (for more information see Chapter 12). As they
say in Washington, a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon
you're spending real money. Well, five minutes here, ten minutes I

here, and pretty soon you're wasting hours.

###### Technique #10: Live Off Peak
Why make life more difficult than it already is?

There are obvious ways to use this technique. For example,
avoid going to the bank on Fridays, especially after 11:00 A.M., and

especially if it is the 1st or 15th of the month. Avoid going to
the supermarket the day before a holiday weekend. Avoid going
to the post office the day after a rate increase (an unfortunately increasingly

common occurrence).
**I suppose everybody knows these things. But there are many**
similar patterns and instances of "herd behavior" that you can
avoid. In Phoenix, where I lived for 24 years, I could drive from
my home to my office in ten minutes if I did it after 9:00 A.M., but it

took a half hour or more if I tried it between 7:30 and 8:30 A.M.
Thanks to the idiotic refusal by the Phoenix authorities to install

left turn arrows, it was often easier, faster, and safer to make
three right turns and go around a block than to wait in line and
make one left turn.

On the road, I try to avoid having to check out and leave a
hotel between 8:00 and 9:00 A.M. or checking in between 4:00 and
6:00 P.M., because that's when everybody else checks in and out.
When you take note of these things and organize your life to
work around them, you can save a lot of time and avoid a lot of
frustration.
