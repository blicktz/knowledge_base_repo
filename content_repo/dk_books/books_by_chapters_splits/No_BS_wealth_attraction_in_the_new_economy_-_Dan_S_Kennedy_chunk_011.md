## Bankruptcy Alumni

#### A partial list of legendary entrepreneurs who went through bankruptcy:

 • P.T. Barnum
 • David Buick (Founder, Buick Motors)
 • Walt Disney
 • James Folger (Founder, Folgers Coffee)
 • Henry Ford
 • Conrad Hilton
 • J.C. Penney
 • Sam Walton
 • William Fox (Founder, 20th Century Film Corp.)
 • H. J. Heinz
 • Frank Lloyd Wright

#### There are reasons. For one thing, entrepreneurial success and wealth creation, as well as wealth attraction, requires a willingness to risk and experience failure, and the emotional resiliency to recover from it quickly, decisively, passionately, and persistently. Hardly anybody gets to success via a straight line. So the past bankruptcy is revealing of this trait, or may have been instrumental in the development of this trait, or both .
 But more importantly, in my opinion, bankruptcy is one of those profound experiences that leads the entrepreneur to full and complete understanding of just how replaceable money is. When you experience a bankruptcy, as I have, you feel as if life is over, you’ll never recover, you’ll

#### forever have a big red “B” on your forehead, you’ll never get credit. Then when you discover none of that is true, and that money is readily available, wealth replaceable, more quickly and easily than the first time around, the light bulb comes on to full power. It’s a huge “ah-ha!” and a giant “well, I’ll be damned.” From that moment onward, your fears about money are permanently banished and erased. What you feared was fatal turns out to be less than a flesh wound. Now you can’t be scared again.

#### Fears about money inhibit your wealth attraction powers.

 Absence of fears about money releases your full wealth attraction
 power.

#### Everyone who is anyone of achievement and wisdom counsels us against fear. Jesus Christ counseled against fear. Pope John Paul II counseled against fear. The pioneer in self-improvement, Earl Nightingale, pointed out that most of the things we worry endlessly about never occur except in our own negative imaginations. Napoleon Hill wrote, in the classic Laws of Success, about the ghosts of fear. The President wrote speeches for whom he goaded America out of the Depression, and famously said “we have nothing to fear but fear itself.”
 Every client I’ve ever had who has made a fear-based business decision has later regretted it. Every time we say no to fear, we win .
 It’s important to understand that fear is learned. We are born with fears of falling, loud unknown noises, and snakes. Otherwise God sends us here completely free of fear. We learn our fears from other humans. We are conditioned to be fearful by what we hear and observe as children by the

#### influences of fearful adults we associate with. The irrational nature of most fears is well illustrated by the fact that more people fear public speaking than fear debilitating illness or death. More people fear airplane travel than automobile travel even though factually, statistically, air travel is infinitely safer.
 It is my observation and conviction that more people are more controlled and inhibited by their fears about money than by any other kind of fear. People fear not having it, but they also fear being changed by having it. They fear making poor decisions about it. They fear running out of it before they die. Most of all they fear losing it. The best of us, and even the wealthiest of us, still have a whole lot of emotional baggage and B.S. connected to money in our closets!

#### When you jettison all money fears, you instantaneously become
 magnetic to money.

 I now believe your bank balance reflects the ratio of fear vs.
 confidence you have about money.

#### After my bankruptcy, which I feared would be fatal, I quickly discovered it was a mere bump in the road, and my fears were replaced by a rapidly growing confidence. Many years later, after considerable experience, my wife and I divorced, after 22 years of marriage. One half of all the wealth accumulated in the prior 10 years or so, a considerable amount, marched out the door with her. You could say it was at least 10 years of wealth. I easily replaced it in less than 18 months. I nearly doubled it in 24 months.

-----

#### All of my prior experiences, including what I’d learned from my bankruptcy recovery, proved far more valuable than the actual money that moved out with her. I had zero fears about the loss of the money, about the difficulty of replacing it, about it having any adverse impact on my life or lifestyle. I just strolled over to the wall, adjusted the thermostat on my wealth attraction powers, and let the coffers refill, then overflow.
 This is not to suggest license to behave recklessly or foolishly with your wealth. Waste, imprudence, irresponsibility is almost always punished, because such behavior is repulsive to money. But confidence magnetically attracts it, because confidence reflects real understanding and everyone and everything is attracted to understanding.
 Consider an analogy: There’s something you once did not understand, found incredibly difficult if not impossible to do, and hoped you would not encounter or have to deal with. Often there’s some single, simple “trick” that changes everything. For example, if you attempt to assemble difficult jigsaw puzzles with a zillion pieces and you don’t know that it helps enormously to build the outside four sides first, you may be stymied and frustrated until somebody takes pity on you and shows you that trick. The “oh, now I understand!” moment is wonderful, isn’t it? Well, here’s the trick about money. The understanding that it is available in unlimited supply and readily replaceable changes everything.

## From Recession to New Economy

#### P eople who lived through The Great Depression kept a “Depression mentality” their entire lives. They stored and hoarded, they were debt averse, they squeezed the last drop from every tube, repaired rather than replaced anything that might be patched together and made to limp along just a little further. Such thrift is not necessarily a bad thing, and I think our modern society could benefit from a little more of it. The ease and speed with which we dispose of every imaginable thing troubles me. This kind of thrift taken to extremes, however, represents some inner, emotional scarring. It speaks of fear. In business, a certain level of prudent paranoia, of considering worst-case scenarios, and intelligent

-----

#### scheming to avoid them or ensuring against them is necessary, just as it is in ordinary life. If you choose to build a home at the ocean in an area of reoccurring risk of storms, even hurricanes, then you are foolish and irresponsible if you do not equip that home with storm shutters, perhaps a power generator, and do not buy appropriate insurance. But when this rises to the level of outright fear, it is unhealthy and harmful. If, for example, you went your whole life without ever even visiting the great beaches to see and experience the oceans, out of fear of the possibility of hurricane, you accept rule of fear . If you time your vacation to Florida or the Caribbean to avoid high hurricane season, you’re prudent. You should be prudent about money. You can’t afford to be fearful about money. The recent years’ recession instilled new fears about money in a lot of people too young to have any experience with anything but a booming, expanding economy. Other, older people had let that experience fade to distant memory, but had all their old fears reignited.

 Incidentally, as point of comparison, during the Depression over 9,000 banks failed, unemployment topped 25%, there were long “ bread lines,” and hundreds of thousands roamed the countryside, homeless itinerants in search of any work of any duration. During this most recent recession, the lines to buy the latest iPod or video game were long, not the bread lines. This time around, the destruction of the American economy has been greatly exaggerated. I’d further add that the tactic the media relies on to attract its wealth is mushrooming and magnifying every news event into Crisis. This is how they attract viewers, listeners, and readers, which is what they sell to advertisers—just as the carnival barker of old hollered about the horrific three-headed sea monster or giant King Kong-like creature inside the tent, to draw curious customers and take their quarters. Don’t mistake most of what you see and hear in broadcast media these days as “news.” It’s nothing of the sort.

 As we move into the post-recession New Economy, many new kinds of opportunities will present themselves, a great deal of temporarily idle and sidelined wealth will be liberated and begin moving about again with renewed vigor, and ultimately some

#### sectors will again be affected by what Alan Greenspan dubbed “irrational exuberance” and “bubbles” will build and burst. Wealth will be attracted by many, retained and sustained by only some. So it has always been. So it always will be. You can never afford to fear this, nor should you let yourself be irrationally carried away by it.

 To prosper in The New Economy, you must combine the neverchanging principles and forces governing the movement of money with rational thought, reasoned optimism, creative vision, sound and timely strategy, and aggressive opportunism. Learn whatever lessons you can about prudent behavior from recent events. But do not learn fear.

 No Excuses

#### F ew people are attracted to whiners, complainers, excuse-makers, wimps. Hanging out with a victim is not appealing to most reasonably sane people. Who wants to be around or involved with an emotional cripple? The person in the victim shirt tends to wear out his welcome early. As he should. His thinking, his beliefs, and his behavior are even more repellant to money and wealth than they to other people.
 In the No B.S. Business Success book, I explain that power is derived from taking responsibility, weakness from disavowing it. Here, again I want to emphasize as strongly as I can that wealth is attracted by taking responsibility, repelled by disavowing it.
 It is interesting and a bit frustrating to me to watch the debate over the gap between worker and top executive compensation in corporate America play out, especially the strident complaints about extraordinarily high CEO pay. What the argument ignores is the responsibility differential. The pay differential is admittedly extreme, but the responsibility differential is still

-----

#### more extreme. A manufacturing company is a good example. The company makes, ships, sells, and delivers dangerously defective doohickeys, which must now be recalled, costing the company and its shareholders millions of dollars, putting it at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace, thus furthering the economic damage and harming the ability of its distributors, retailers, and salespeople to make their livings. The worker on the assembly line and the factory supervisors get off scot free, with zero responsibility. They do not need to give back any of their pay or perks, they go home that Friday unaffected and unconcerned, without penalty. The CEO winds up with all the responsibility. He must answer to his board, the shareholders, Wall Street, the news media, the distributors, the retailers, the customers, the insurance company. He does not go home that Friday unaffected and unconcerned, not by a long shot. Yes, he has a large income and stock options, he has wealth, and he has power. But he also has enormous responsibility. The two are not coincidentally or incidentally linked. They are, instead, cause and effect. In most cases, he has risen, more accurately climbed. to his CEO post over time by taking on more and more and more responsibility. Others have chosen not to seek and take on more responsibility. Key word: chosen. In fact, most shirk it, hide from it. The CEO’s power and wealth has flowed to him as he has reached out and grabbed more and more responsibility. He has also taken on greater and greater risk. It is his willingness to take on the responsibility that has brought him his wealth and power.
