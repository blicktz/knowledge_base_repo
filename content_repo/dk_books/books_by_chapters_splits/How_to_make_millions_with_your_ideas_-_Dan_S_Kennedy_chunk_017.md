   Problem, Emotionalize the Problem, Solve the Problem.
     If you’re a rank beginner in creating sales letters, you can
    start your education by studying the sales letters you get. There
    are a number of good books about selling as well as about sales
    letters at your library and local bookstores. And you can hire
   professional copywriters to do your first projects for you, while
   you learn.
     Along with the letter, you may have enclosures. There may
   be a flyer or brochure, a page of user testimonials, a reprint of
    a favorable article about the product, and an order form. Whether
   the order form is separate or incorporated in the letter, it is very
   important. Your order form needs to clearly tell the customer
   what you want him to do and how he is to respond. It should
    also summarize the offer.
     Can You Dial Your Way to a Million Dollars?
     Sophisticated direct marketers are increasingly combining
   outbound telemarketing follow-up with direct mail to dramati-
   cally increase overall response and actually improve the rela-
   tionship with the customer. Although a mailing program itself
   may produce a response of | to 3 percent to as high as 7 to 10
   percent if directed at established customers, it is not unusual for
    a combination mail—telephone call campaign to increase a re-
   sponse of 2 percent to 15 or 18 percent, and a response of 7 to
    10 percent with established customers to 30 to 35 percent.
     I often work with and recommend InfoCision, one of the top
   outbound-telemarketing firms in the country specializing in the
    ‘‘relationship call.’’ This means two things: First, they will not
   do cold outbound telemarketing for any client. There must be
   some relationship already established—at the very least, the per-
    son being called must have responded to some type of ad and
   requested information. Second, they will not use high-pressure
    tactics or otherwise endanger the relationship between the person
   being called and the company they are placing calls for. This is

      How Smart Outbound Telemarketing
        Made a Fast $2!4 Million
       for a Fitness Device Manufacturer
    Maybe you’ ve seen the Easy Glider commercials, infomercial,
   or other advertising. Easy Glider is an inexpensively made aerobic
   ski machine, selling most of the time for just $59.95. The same
   manufacturer makes a much more elaborate, sturdier, enhanced
   version of the same product, called Fit One, that sells for $400.
   The manufacturer realized that their 600,000 Easy Glider purchas-
   ers, because they were fitness buyers, would be prime candidates
   for Fit One.
    With the assistance of the people at InfoCision, a strategy
   was developed to mail literature to the Easy Glider buyers that
   extolled all the virtues of Fit One, and then call them and offer
   them the full $59.95 they paid for the Easy Glider as a trade-in
   discount toward the Fit One. In a very short period of time, this
   strategy generated about $2.5 million in Fit One sales that would
   probably not have been realized any other way.
    How a Carefully Constructed Telemarketing
        Plan Put Sports Sciences in the
          Swing of Things
    Here’s another example of telemarketing intelligently applied,
   courtesy of Steve Pittendrigh and Lisa Mueller at Info-Cision:
   Sports Sciences manufactures and markets The Pro-Swing Sys-
   tem, a computerized golf swing analyzer that uses a light beam
   and sensors to generate corrective feedback. It’s sort of a Dr.
  Spock approach to golf. This doohickey sells for a fat $300,
   and runs off a software program called AccessLinks. A list
   of AccessLink software owners was obtained and a package
   of literature about Pro-Swing was mailed to them. InfoCision

   marketers with a genuine interest in the product being offered.
   In this case, they used only those employees who played golf
   and were familiar with computers for this project team. These
   telemarketers could talk the same language as the customers.
     Because most AccessLink owners had purchased the software
    as much for its fun uses as for skill improvement, the tele-
   marketers’ basic script emphasized Pro-Swing’s uses as an inno-
    vative, entertaining, and supersophisticated computer game, not
   just its original purpose as a tool for correcting the golfer’s swing.
     Employing this carefully constructed, telemarketing-driven
   marketing plan, Sports Sciences converted over 5 percent of the
   AccessLink owners to their customers, yielding over $500,000.
   This also gave Sports Sciences an instant database of its own
   customers, which they could communicate with by mail, phone,
    or both, to offer additional products and services.
     New Frontiers in Electronic Direct Marketing
     Some of today’s most interesting and exciting direct-
   marketing opportunities are in TV home shopping, TV infomer-
    cials, radio infomercials, and other ‘‘information superhighway’’
    frontiers. All of these are discussed in the next chapter.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #1:
       DIVERSIFY IN MARKETING, TO FULLY EXPLOIT
            TOTAL CUSTOMER VALUE.
     In the 1990s, largely thanks to the alarmingly high costs of
   acquiring new customers, few direct marketers can lazily rely on
   just one or two methods of selling to and communicating with
    their established customers and their prospective customers. In-
    stead, a diversified approach is necessary, carefully choosing
   from a cafeteria of methods, testing them, and ultimately assem-
   bling them in just the right order for a particular line of products,
   company, and clientele.

  SUPERHIGHWAY TO MILLIONS:
  THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF
 ELECTRONIC DIRECT MARKETING
  ’m in a hotel room in Chicago, after having presented a three-
  hour evening seminar. I doze off and wake up at 1:15 A.M.,
 and channel surf with the remote to see what’s on television. On
  five of the eleven channels available on my TV set, there are
 infomercials. Three of the five are ‘‘mine’’—one I produced for
  a client, and two are owned by a consulting client. I’m getting
 royalties on two of the three. For the last fifteen minutes, I’ve’
 been making money while sleeping.
     The Incredible Power of Television
   Somehow, in the wee hours of the mornings, enough bleary-
 eyed folks set aside their remote controls, pick up the phone,
 and call in and order Victoria Principal’s skin-care products, En-
 trepreneur magazine’s Be Your Own Boss System, which I coau-
 thored, Vanna’s tooth whitener, The Big Green Clean Machine,
 exercise doohickeys, car wax, diet foods, self-improvement
 courses, spray paint for bald heads, and Oriental woks—enough
 to make millionaires of a surprisingly large and growing number
 of entrepreneurs.
  My longtime client the Guthy-Renker Corporation is an in-
 teresting case study for three reasons: (1) its business is driven
 by TV infomercials; (2) it has a sophisticated development of
 businesses within businesses, like those little Russian dolls

   make them interesting.
     In 1978 Bill Guthy started an audiocassette product-
   manufacturing company, which initially focused on recording
   conventions and conferences, and products for professional
   speakers. He started out of his apartment, with a combination of
   new and used, bought, borrowed, and begged equipment; a vague
   belief that there would be major growth in spoken-word audio
   products; and a goal of developing the largest company of its
   kind in the audio industry. Today, Cassette Productions Un-
   limited (CPU) has both a West Coast and an East Coast plant
   with state-of-the-art technology; it is the largest company of its
   kind, and the major audio product manufacturer for the entire
   infomercial industry. CPU also owns Audio Renaissance, an au-
   dio publisher of books on tape, poised for growth tied to the
   current expansion of books-on-tape departments in bookstores
   and books-on-tape stores.
     By Paying Close Attention to How His Customers
     Were Selling Their Products, Bill Guthy Spotted a
             New Opportunity
     In the early 1980s, as CPU produced millions of cassettes
   for the earliest infomercials, Bill became interested in the high-
   margin retail end of that pipeline instead of the low-margin man-
   ufacturing end. A cassette he might make twenty cents on by
   manufacturing it for a customer might be sold by that customer
   for $9 to $15, against his cost of less than $1.
     In 1986 Bill acquired the audio rights to Napoleon Hill’s
   classic Think and Grow Rich and his other works. Along the
   way, he met Greg Renker, who was then marketing director for
   the Indian Wells, California, Racquet Club, and discovered that
   Greg shared his fascination with infomercials and his commit-
   ment to Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich! philosophies, and
   had good marketing instincts, useful contacts, and capital to
   bring to the table. Together, they produced the first ‘‘Think and
   Grow Rich’’ infomercial and

```
  bringing in over $10 million, which at that time was a big num-
  ber for the infomercial business.
    Neither Bill nor Greg had the slightest experience with TV
  show production or TV advertising, but they had a number of
  other successful infomercials to study and from which to extract
  principles of success, as well as their own ideas about improving
  the appeal and credibility of the infomercial. From the very be-
  ginning, they elevated the image and sophistication of infomer-
  cials. ‘“Think and Grow Rich’’ was the first to use a significant
  celebrity as a host (Fran Tarkenton) and the first to use well-
  known, credible individuals as testimonials, such as Tom Mon-
  aghan, head of Domino’s Pizza; Mary Kay Ash of Mary Kay
  Cosmetics; Wally ‘‘Famous’’ Amos; and Senator Jennings Ran-
  dolph.
    Like most things I do, I got involved in the infomercial busi-
  ness by dumb, happy accident. I met Bill and Greg when I sold
  a company to Cassette Productions Unlimited. Bill then invited —
  me to find a way to rework ‘‘Think and Grow Rich II’’ to bring
  its sales performance up, which I did, and I have been consulting
  with them ever since. (In the case of ‘‘Think and Grow Rich,’’
  I restructured the offer, added premiums costing about $2, and
  raised the selling price by $50. We went on to sell tens of
  thousands of units. I'd guess my tinkering plunked an extra
  $500,000 in Guthy-Renker’s coffers just from the premium cost-
  to-price increase differential. They were hooked on me, and I
  was hooked on television.) Guthy-Renker skyrocketed from a
  $10 million company to a $100 million company in just a few
  years, and is doubling again as I put this book to bed.
   To show you the several different ways you might make
  millions through TV infomercials, I’m going to give you the
  background and current state of the union of the industry, reveal
  more of the Guthy-Renker secrets for success, and take you in-
  side my extensive work in this industry. ©

       and Ronald Reagan Accidentally Combined to
                                  _ Launch the Infomercial Business
      In 1984 President Reagan’s penchant for deregulation
   prompted the Federal Communications Commission to drop its
    limits on the length of commercials, giving networks, broadcast
    stations, and cable stations freedom to sell time in virtually any
    size blocks they chose. In that same year, Ray Lindstrom, a
   Phoenix-based promoter of ‘‘get rich in real estate’’ seminars
    featuring a guru named Paul Simon, was watching seminar at-
    tendance decline while the costs of filling the seminars rose, and
    was looking everywhere for a solution.
         A Million Dollars Made in Two Days
     On a whim, Ray brought a video crew in and taped one of
    the seminars, bought a number of one-hour blocks on two cable
    networks, and literally threw it on the air to see if people would
    watch at home and then call an 800 number to order Simon’s
    cassette course on real estate investing. By today’s standards, the
    infomercial was downright primitive: The speaker at the front of
    the room gave his regular talk, using hand-drawn slides on an
   overhead projector before a small audience in a poorly lit hotel
    room. The first weekend this ugly little production aired, from
    less than $80,000 in media, they sold nearly $1 million worth of
    courses.
     In 1985 Ray and a partner, Nancy Langston, bought nearly
   3,000 hours of cable TV time for a total of about $8 million
    dollars, and produced over $21 million in sales of the Simon
    courses. In its coverage of this phenomenon, The Hollywood Re-
   porter snidely noted that ‘‘the population of real estate million-
    aires didn’t noticeably increase, but Lindstrom and Langston
   became the leading marketers of home study courses. Their suc-
    cess quickly brought imitators.’’ In fact, imitators proliferated

       Populated by Snake Oil Salesmen and
    Assorted Oddballs to a Very Sophisticated Media
       That’s Almost Certainly Here to Stay
   In its early years, the infomercial industry was populated by
 get-rich-quick promoters knocking off Paul Simon and promot-
  ers of very questionable (and often FDA-attacked) health devices
 and potions and cheesy gadgets, mostly hawked by their inven-
  tors and authors, no-name hosts and hostesses, or an occasional
 long-in-the-tooth celebrity, and it all worked almost in spite of
  itself. Media was incredibly cheap; the stations and networks
  _ were slow in recognizing the enormous profits being made by
 these ‘‘weird’’ advertisers, and happy to be paid for time in the
 dead of night rather than paying for programming, usually reruns
 of ten-year-old TV shows nobody wanted to watch anyway. In-
 somniac audiences were fascinated and, according to some in-
 dustry critics, fooled by these new kind of shows. Mostly thanks
 to the cheap media, many people put infomercials on the air,
 made millions of dollars almost overnight from the initial sale
 alone, and treated the entire business like an electronic version
 of the gypsy’s wagon with the snake oil pitchperson.
   Three major forces contributed to substantial, relatively rapid
 change. Beginning about 1989, academic critics, regulatory
 agencies like the FDA and the FTC, and some congressmen be-
 gan holding the infomercial up to scrutiny, and didn’t like what
 they saw. Second, a few sizable companies led by people with
 the vision to see past the fast buck, notably Guthy-Renker, were
 succeeding with higher-quality shows offering higher-quality,
 honestly advertised, and honestly guaranteed products. Third, the
  first big jumps in cost of media time started.
   In 1990 Greg Renker led a group of infomercial CEOs and
 producers in forming and funding The National Infomercial Mar-
 keting Association (NIMA) to both self-regulate the industry and
 to lobby Washington and the media on the infomercial industry’s
 behalf. NIMA has been effective in both jobs.

     Today’s Infomercial Business: An Enormous
      Area of Opportunity, If You’re Careful
     Today, the average infomercial costs no less than $80,000 to
   $250,000 or more to produce and another $15,000 to $30,000 to
    test. Then it is ready to ‘‘roll out’’ and air frequently on a mix
   of national cable, superstations, and area broadcast stations for
   months or even years. I have worked on a number of infomer-
    cials that have generated over $50 million each during their life-
   times. However, both risk and media cost are skyrocketing, and
   media availability is increasingly competitive. Overall, only one
    in sixteen infomercials make money; fifteen die in testing and
    are buried in Tax-Loss Cemetery only a few days to a week after
   completion. The viewing and buying public is harsh in its rejec-
    tion of these “‘losers.”’
     Of course, certain product/topic categories work better than
    others. For example, weight loss, skin care and beauty, kitchen
   gadgets, and moneymaking opportunities have been proven very
    reliable. Products that are preventive in nature, such as crime
   prevention, or those that feature long-term, distant benefits, such
    as information about paying off your mortgage faster or invest-
   ing for retirement, have been tried many times and failed mis-
   erably more often than not. Beyond product selection, those of
    us who do a lot of work creating products, offers, and info-
   mercials have our own lists of factors that try to predict a show’s
   probability of success. Given the right combination of factors, -
   with experts creating the show and smart media buyers, the risk
    falls from 16 to 1 to about 4 to 1.
     More importantly, the way money is made from infomercials
   has changed. Instead of getting rich quickly from the initial sale,
   many infomercials often air at break-even or slightly better than
   break-even as a means of acquiring huge numbers of customers
   rapidly, without acquisition cost, so that profits can be made via
   repeat and subsequent sales, direct mail, outbound telemarketing,
   and other means. The infomercial has shifted from a get-rich
   mechanism to a very attractive means of building a business that

 Grow Rich’’ Guthy-Renker had a megasuccess with the first of
 a series of “‘Personal Power’’ infomercials showcasing motiva-
 tional speaker Tony Robbins, with hosts like Fran Tarkenton and
 actor Martin Sheen. The database of the Personal Power cus-
 tomers became a business in and of itself: Other Tony Robbins
  titles, a continuity or subscription program to ‘‘Power Talk,’’ a
 monthly cassette series, seminars, and more are sold to these
 customers. This taught Guthy-Renker a model for developing a
 vertical business within their company that is the game plan be-
 hind over half of the infomercials they produce today.
   Their Principal Secret skin-care infomercials with actress
 Victoria Principal have provided the biggest and most promising
 of such businesses. Through these infomercials and Victoria’s
 related appearances on the home shopping channel QVC, over
 $75 million in skin-care products have been sold. But the bigger,
 much more profitable business is in perpetuating a relationship
 with those customers. Only six products are sold on television;
 there are over forty products in the entire line, with new ones
 constantly in development. There is a Beauty Club, automatic
 bimonthly shipments of products and product kits, seasonal pro-
 motions, and a catalog.
    It’s important to understand that most mail-order/catalog
 companies have to lose money on acquiring new customers
 through advertising; in essence, they are ‘‘buying’’ their custom-
 ers, so the ability of the infomercial to rapidly plug 100,000,
 200,000, or even 500,000 new customers into a direct-marketing
 business at zero acquisition cost is very appealing. That’s why
 Fingerhut, the largest direct-mail marketer of consumer products
 in America, jumped into the infomercial business in a big way
 in 1992.

   Guthy-Renker has built their vertical businesses linked to dif-
