###### This is how companies get themselves into trouble when they use social media. It goes something like this: Company sees trending topic, company contributes to trending topic without understanding its context in an effort to appear “relevant” or “hip.” Then, there’s backlash similar to what DiGiorno Pizza encountered in September 2014.
 To provide some backstory, the backlash occurred when #WhyIStayed started trending on Twitter to bring to light the issue of domestic violence. This was (and still is) a serious topic of public discussion after the NFL released the video of the Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice assaulting his then-fiancée in a hotel. DiGiorno Pizza tweeted, “#WhyIStayed You had pizza.”
 So, what was DiGiorno’s reasoning behind this tweet? Did it think it was funny? Did it think Ray Rice should have gotten treatment that was more lenient? No. Its answer was so stupid it makes me nauseous.
 DiGiorno said that it “didn’t know what the hashtag was about.” A tenet comes to mind that relates (if you’ve ever given an excuse when pulled over by a cop, you’ve heard this one): Ignorance of the law excuses no one.
 The alarming revelation here is that this isn’t the first and certainly won’t be the last example of a company that misstepped in the wild, wild world of social media. As of writing this book, there are over 1.36 billion registered Facebook users, and more than 42 million Facebook pages. There is a lot to learn from companies that are getting social media right and those that, quite frankly, are failing miserably.
 So, how do we separate the winners from the losers? Dollar-measured results, that’s how. Everything else is just a waste of time.
 Provided that you are getting a return on your investment, social media can be a valuable asset to add to your marketing plan. That being said, using social media solely is a dangerous (and not recommended) path to follow. All of Kim’s students have a multilayered approach to their marketing, so if Facebook bit the dust tomorrow, they would still soldier on. The value in social media is how it can complement, not replace, your traditional marketing activities like direct mail, email marketing, so on and so forth.
 This is especially important considering that new social media networks are developed almost daily. If you are going to chase every social media

###### network down the “Yellow Brick Road,” you might as well give your paycheck to the flying monkeys. Seriously. How much sense does it make to deliver a watered-down marketing strategy to multiple audiences, instead of hitting a home run with one social media network? I’ll save you the five seconds of contemplation. None.
 There were multiple social media strategies, case studies, and solutions for the everyday marketer presented in this book. Use these examples as a guide for your own journey to social media success. While you may think, “My business is different. These steps can’t be applied in my situation,” I’m here to tell you that you’re wrong. You must, however, follow the foundational rules for a high social media ROI.
 You’ve read many stellar examples in this book that demonstrated a high ROI from social media. Don’t be fooled. These examples are the exception. And they only occur because of a strict adherence to direct response marketing with a hawk’s eye on measurement.
 If you decide to proceed with your social media marketing strategies, keep in mind these foundational rules at all times:
 You can (and should) make yourself a celebrity through social media. Utilize social media to create your celebrity status to your target market. This is a platform you can control, and it should be leveraged for celebrity positioning. Think of the Kardashians. They practically built an empire off of what most thought would be Kim Kardashian’s 15 seconds of fame. The “video-seen-round-the-world” spawned a reality show that’s currently on its 17th season, multiple clothing stores, and an app that earned $43 million in the third quarter of 2014 (Glu Mobile).
 However, as a business owner, you might take a less extreme approach than a sex tape. But to each their own.
 Niches bring riches. There are niches all over the world—some that you may not even be aware of—that come in the form of associations, groups, interests. You name it, and someone will be willing to lay a pretty penny to work with someone they believe speaks directly to them.
 Whether or not you choose to advertise on the platform, Facebook has powerful tools to help you research your list without giving Facebook a dime. At least for now. It’s worth checking out before it starts charging. If you do use the platform to advertise, make sure you are not only targeting


-----

###### your ad but also your audience, too. Too many businesses get a segmented list to market but use the same ad for each audience.
 Don’t copy someone’s social media ad just because it “looks cool.” I can’t tell you how dumb this strategy is, especially on social media, when you have no idea whether or not the ad is even breaking even on the investment.
 Kmart had a “viral” video called “Ship My Pants” that was the talk of the web. Did it increase sales of online purchases? Kmart’s store sales were down 2.2% again the next year, so my guess? Once again, it forgot who its target market is.
 Do not copy what others are doing just because they are doing it. If someone tries to convince you otherwise, slap yourself in the head. Preferably with this book, so through some act of freakish osmosis, it will remind you of the rules.
 Get to know your best customers better, find out their wants and needs, and fill them. Surveying your target audience is a serious exercise that you should use so you can better deliver your product or service. This can be as simple as drafting a survey with only a few questions. It’s what comes back in these surveys that is really exciting.
 With this data, you can identify potential improvements, referrals, and other business opportunities. These questions can also help you to develop a lead magnet offer (free report, ebook) that will answer a question that is burning in the back of your ideal prospect’s mind. Base your marketing strategies on fact, not guessing.
 Well, this is where I leave you. If you decide to continue on in your social media marketing efforts or begin them, do so armed.
 Kim has laid out a thorough, sensible plan for you to establish your presence on social media and, more important to my mind, get measurable return on your investment. This is what works. Personally, I continue to be fed financially through businesses I have interests in, by the social media strategies Kim has described. I’d be the last guy on earth to suggest not using it for all it’s worth. A lot is done on social media in my name, as if it were me. The work I do for many of my clients incorporates and integrates social media.
 But, if you ever find me personally tweeting, you’ll know the world has ended.

##### BONUS CHAPTER

### How to Multiply Your Results

## with One Post

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

 If you want more out of your marketing (perhaps leads and sales), start by asking this question:

 Anytime you create a piece of content, are you getting the most out of it?

 Over the years, I’ve developed a formula to ensure every piece of content gets us the most leads and sales possible. When we create a blog post, we multiply our results by sharing it in each channel in the way it works best for that channel.
 This doesn’t mean we take the same post and repost it multiple times. It means, we take the same concept and share it in the format that makes the most sense for each platform. Here’s how we do it:

 Day One

 • Write the blog and post it on our website. (Don’t have a blog yet? You
 can start yours in ten minutes by checking out contentpaysbig.com.)
 • Send notification out via push notifications. This alerts anyone who
 signs up for notifications that you have a new piece of content. We use PushCrew (http://pushcrew.com).


-----

###### Day Two

 • Send an email out to our subscribers with a link to the blog.
 • Post an Instagram Story with a link to the blog.

 Day Three

 • Post a link to the blog on Facebook (see Figure B.1).

**FIGURE B.1: Promote and Link to the New Blog on Facebook**

###### • Do a Facebook Live about the blog topic with a link to the blog.
 • Post on Instagram about the blog topic (see Figure B.2). Add in
 hashtags around your topic.

**FIGURE B.2: Post on Instagram About the Blog Topic**


-----

###### Day Four

 • Post a link on LinkedIn to the blog (see Figure B.3 on page 326).
 • Tweet out a link to the blog.
 • Insta-Story with a link to the post mentioning the comments received.

 This distribution method takes one piece of content and multiplies the results. Every. Single. Time.
