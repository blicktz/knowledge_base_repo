STRATEGY 8 PROOF: THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL FOR EXCEPTIONAL
 SUCCESS IN SELLING

## I am about to reveal to you—and attempt to sell you on—the single most important, most powerful selling tool that exists. That’s a big claim. I know that. Yet I have personally seen this single tool transform losing businesses into huge successes, and mediocre salespeople into superstars. I have used it myself many different times, many different ways, for great profit.
 First, a story:

 One afternoon I was visiting the offices of a famous, very successful criminal attorney. By that, I do not mean he was a criminal. He represents people alleged to be criminals. Admittedly, a thin line. Anyway, he and several of his associates were gathered in the firm’s conference room discussing a trial that was to begin the following day. He was asking his associates for their comments about their ability to win their client’s acquittal.

 The client had the risk of serving at least 20 years, possibly longer, in a federal prison should these lawyers fail. In the client’s favor was the fact that this particular lawyer very rarely lost a case.

 The attorney asked his associates for their comments, and a young lawyer spoke up: “I’m confident that we have gathered enough proof for you to prove his innocence if necessary.”

 The attorney came up out of his chair, lunged across the conference table, grabbed his young associate by the neck, and pulled him out of

## his chair, so that they were almost nose-to-nose. He then said, in a deadly voice: “Don’t ever send me into a courtroom with ‘enough’ proof. I want a preponderance of proof.” I have never forgotten the importance of that lesson. Having a preponderance of proof makes it possible to sell with 100% effectiveness, 100% of the time. If you want to win with every presentation of every proposition, make sure you have an overwhelming amount of proof that what you are selling is a great deal, have an overwhelming quality of proof, and have proof that is influential. Influential proof directly addresses the anxieties, doubts, concerns, skepticisms, interests, hopes, and desires of the individual prospect.

# Proof Through Testimonials

## I have now done work with clients in over 250 different product and service categories, from weight loss and cosmetic dentistry to investments to funeral homes to custom-fabricated parts for nuclear power plants. And I have yet to find one business—not one—where using testimonials as proof hasn’t substantially improved sales. Yet 90% of all the sales professionals I encounter—those who try selling to me, those I am hired to observe and train, those who seek me out for assistance—either completely fail to use testimonials or use them sparingly and poorly.
 If you did nothing else as a result of this book but ten times your use of testimonials in “proving your case” to your prospects, your reading time will produce a huge return on investment.
 Testimonial letters and comments can be used in sales and marketing in many different ways. They can be used in advertising, direct mail, and promotional literature. They can be used as part of a one-on-one or group sales presentation. They can be given to the client to read. They can be put in a big notebook and kept in the waiting room or reception area for people to browse through. They can be videotaped and put up on a website, played on a laptop in a one-on-one setting.

# Dan Kennedy’s #7 No B.S. Truth About
 Selling

-----

## What others say about you and your product, service, or business is at least 1,000 times more convincing than what you say, even if you
 are 2,000 times more eloquent.
 In my experience, there is nothing more valuable than a great testimonial letter—other than two great testimonial letters!
 In The New Economy, proof-by-customers’ testimonies rises to a whole new level of importance for reasons I just enumerated at the end of the previous chapter and elsewhere in this book.
 At the end of this chapter, I’ve included one of the best demonstrations of truly powerful testimonials I’ve ever had one of my clients create. His name is Paul Johnson, and he owns Shed Shop Inc., a company that sells backyard sheds. This is a rather ordinary product made extraordinary through the emotionladed, human interest stories collected from satisfied customers and published in a booklet, titled “83 Practical Uses for a Shed Shop Shed.” I originally suggested this to Paul as a “Chicken Soup for the Shed Shop Owner’s Soul” type of story book, mimicking the hugely successful approach taken by my friend Mark Victor Hansen, co-creator of the multimillion best-selling phenomenon, the actual Chicken Soup for the Soul book series. Paul executed the idea brilliantly. I’ll let him tell you of the results in his own words:

 “At a marketing conference for his Members in 1999, Dan was drilling into us the importance of using testimonials. I mentioned that our customers were always telling us interesting, unusual, even heart- warming stories about how they used our sheds, and Dan said I could do a book of them. And I did.

 To get the stories, we held a contest for the most creative or unusual use for a Shed Shop shed, invited our customers to submit stories and photos, and awarded prizes. We wound up with a booklet titled “83 Practical Uses for a Shed Shop Shed,” containing the 83 best stories.

 We send this booklet to every prospect. The impact was immediate and dramatic. Selling became much easier, as the customers were pre-sold

-----

## on doing business with us, and more eager to talk with us about why they wanted a backyard shed. This supported an increase in our prices, it sets us apart from competitors, it helps sell add-on options. I now think of it as my million dollar storybook!” That was in 1999. Since then, the “emotional testimonial storybook”— and extensions of it into various media—has become a staple of selling. I’ve taught it to and had it used by thousands in every imaginable field, from operators of pizza shops to marketers of sophisticated software systems enabling mid-sized companies. In the latter case, it’s not testimony about what the software does that makes the story; it’s what the mid-sized company’s owners feel when they make the Inc. 500 List of fastest growth companies for the first time thanks to use of the software. In the case of the pizza shop, it’s not a customer talking about the pizza; it’s the customer talking about getting the entire family together once a month for pizza night, and what that means to her.
 The New Economy is all about personal, emotional connection, so this can only matter more and more.

# How Dumb Salespeople Work Ten Times Harder
 Than They Need To and Get One-Tenth the
 Results They Could Get

## If you under-utilize testimonials, there you are, huffing, puffing, straining, and struggling to convey your marketing message and convince of your virtues, while you keep an entire army of more persuasive, more instantly believable salespeople eager to do the heavy lifting for you for free, bound and gagged, locked in the closet, out of sight.
 How dumb is that? If you fail to utilize emotional connection story testimonials, you’re taxed with the entire task of trying to link your company, product, service, and deliverables to customers’ feelings, while sitting on the sidelines, silent, are people able to tell the prospect exactly how they feel thanks to using your product.
 Aren’t their stories certain to connect better than your promises? On the next page of this chapter, you will find a sign I gave to all my Members back in 2002. It is copyrighted, but you have my permission to photocopy the page as much as you like for your own use or for others in your sales organization. Stick it up places you’ll see it often to nag you as I would in person if I could.

# A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words

## Another incredibly powerful type of proof is pictorial. The cliché is true: a picture is worth a thousand words. Pictorial proof is interesting and novel, it communicates at a glance, and it has lasting impact. Your camera could be your best friend in sales! Now, of course, it’s ridiculously easy to take photos or get guerilla videos of your customers in their habitats using your products—the phone you carry probably shoots both. And you can upload it all to your website. And so on. You have all this nifty technology at your disposal, how about using it for something other than taking pictures of the squirrels drinking out of your hot tub for You-Tube?
 Let’s go way back in time. The late Ira Hayes, a former top National Cash Register (NCR) salesman, used this technique when he started selling cash registers to small shop owners, when the cash register was a new “technology,” replacing the cigar box under the counter. Yes, imagine that —there was a time when the cash register was a revolutionary piece of equipment looked upon with suspicion, and that time was within my lifetime. He had a 20 to 30 foot black fabric panel that he carried with him. On that panel were thousands of snapshots of happy, satisfied customers standing next to their shiny new cash register. Hayes would take this giant “wall” of snapshots into a prospect’s office and unfurl it impressively. The sale was made before the selling even started—because the proof was overwhelming.

 Ira was once asked, when he was traveling and speaking to general business audiences such as Chamber of Commerce groups, sponsored by NCR, why NCR and he were so willing to reveal his selling secret. Ira answered: “We’re not worried about our competitors’ salespeople stealing this idea. We can’t even get our own people to use it.”
 Another salesperson I’ve seen use it to a similar extent is a top Ford salesman in Phoenix. In his cubicle, the walls are covered with photographs, each showing a customer or a customerfamily, smiling, standing next to their new Ford. Each photo is dated and has the customer’s name on it. When I lived in Phoenix for about ten years, he was my car salesman and, through referrals, my family’s and friends’ car salesman. My photo was there, with my Lincoln. My brother’s photo was there with his pickup truck. My father’s photo was there, with his Mercury Marquis. And

-----

## so on. Some families have many more photos there, from a series of vehicles they purchased over the years. It doesn’t take too long to accept the pictures as proof that this guy treats his customers right—otherwise, how could he have so many of them?
 Incidentally, I recently had reason to buy a Ford from another dealership in another state. I walked in and paid cash for a $35,000.00 SUV. I was never shown any testimonials, never asked for one, never asked for a referral either. Nor has there been one ounce of follow-up from that sales rep. The next year, in that state, I bought two cars—neither one from him.
 Anyway, you can use “photo proof” in any type of business. A retail store might take pictures of happy customers with their newly purchased merchandise. A lawn service company might photograph the customers’ yards and gardens. A florist might photograph the happy, surprised recipients of delivered flowers. In my literature, I often use the photos taken of me with famous people: actors and actresses I’ve worked with in infomercials, athletes, coaches, even former U.S. Presidents I’ve appeared on seminar programs with. Give some thought to how you can apply this principle to your business.

# Statistical Proof

## Statistics provide a third impressive form of proof. For example, I surveyed a group of entrepreneurs who were using my audio learning programs one year, and I’ve since shown the survey results to hundreds and hundreds of audiences. The results conclude that:

 • 98% reported satisfaction
 • 83% reported improved sales
 • 87% made additional purchases At my suggestion, many of my clients who put on annual seminars and conferences survey the attendees months afterward, and document the average income increase achieved—often from $40,000.00 to $100,000.00, and then use that fact as a powerful sales tool for subsequent seminars— proving that it’s not costing you $3,000.00 to come, it’s costing you $40,000.00 to stay home. This supports a particular type of direct-mail piece I like these clients to use, with a very realistic looking and feeling faux check, made out to each prospect by name, for $40,000.00 enclosed, along with a form designed for the business owner and spouse to plan what they’ll buy or do with the extra $40,000.00. This is a creative way to present statistical proof, and to get the prospect involved with it.

# Other Proof

## Consider these ideas for evidence you might use:

-----

## Traditional

 • Customer or client lists
 • Length of time in business
 • Past credentials, qualifications, experience
 • Financial references
 • Number of cities/countries serviced
 • Number of customers served
 • Physical demonstrations, “live” or on video
 • “Flip Books,” Binders, or Power Points presentations of testimonials used in face-to-face selling Untraditional

 • “Story books”
 • Infomercial-style testimonial videos
 • Audio CD’s with interviews with testimonials
 • Toll-free 800-number “eavesdrop lines” to hear what clients or customers have called in and recorded about your product or service

 • Testimonial letters, photos, etc. presented in a website

# How Much Proof Is Enough? How Much Proof Is
 Too Much?

## There is no such thing as enough; no such thing as too much. It is better to have more than you need rather than less.
 I can’t tell you how many salespeople and businesspeople I have taught this to, yet it is still a well-kept secret. No one else at the car dealership where the car salesman I described works will use the ideas, even though he has been a star, award-winning, high-income performer. Even though I’ve taught the same photo and photo + testimonial display technique to at least 10,000 chiropractors, dentists, and cosmetic surgeons, 9,900 won’t do it.
 It’s not your job, though, to worry about why others won’t use these techniques. Their resistance is your opportunity! Successful people do the things that unsuccessful people are unwilling to do. If you choose to join the successful minority, you’ll discover that most of the things you do to get results—even if openly shared with others—will rarely be copied and used by others. For that reason, the use of preponderance of proof as the core of selling or advertising or marketing remains a bestkept, immensely valuable secret. FIGURE 8.1: The Shed Stories
