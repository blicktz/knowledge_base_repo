When Choosing an Audience: Better to Pick a Small Haystack and More
 Needles than a Big Haystack with Hardly any Needles We all know the “needle in the haystack” metaphor. The idea here is it’s better to choose a small, well-defined niche and have a ton of followers in that small niche than to pick a large one where your message won’t be heard.

 HOW TO USE THIS IN YOUR OWN BUSINESS If you already have chosen a niche (whether large or small), you can carve out an even smaller niche for yourself through specialization.
 You can do this simply by redefining what it is you do and finding a smaller group of people who are seeking those specialty services. Experts within their space are constantly redefining themselves to serve a smaller, more defined niche—“a smaller haystack.”
 To define this special space and create that unique niche, you just need to ask yourself a few simple questions:

 1. Who? Who is the specific buyer or person you are trying to reach?
 Get to know them, define them, and understand their behaviors. 2. Why? Why is this important? Why are you doing this? 3.  Needs/Benefits? What need are you fulfilling? What does that
 customer want from you, and what problem will be solved?

 And finally, target a very specific niche market to start. Finding and selecting a specialized target market is a safer and better bet than targeting the masses when starting out.
 Look at it this way. If you want to sell your product or service to the general public, you need a substantial marketing budget because you’ll need

 Why not hitch your wagon to a smaller niche market so you can really start to make hay?

#### Be a Magnet to Your Target Customers

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Kari Voutilainen only sold about 50 of his timepieces each year for the last ten years. And he was satisfied with that.
 Voutilainen is a Finnish watchmaker who specializes in a Vingt-8 wristwatch, a platinum G.M.T. (Greenwich Mean Time) model with hand- fabricated movement. The price of these watches starts at $86,000 each.
 Voutilainen doesn’t try to create products for everyone. He has a niche that he focuses on diligently. His V-8R watch won the Men’s Watch Prize in the esteemed Grand Prix d’Horlogerie competition.
 When asked if he was going to limit production if the market decreases, he said, “Even if there is a 10% decrease in interest, that means only five buyers for me. I can go out and find five more people to buy these watches.”
 50 products, $4.3 million in revenue. Not bad.

 Your Own Million-Dollar Blueprint When it comes to creating a social media campaign that will produce six- plus figures a month, you can’t guess at it, hope at it, or simply manifest it. Sorry.
 If there was a way, believe me that would be the entirety of the book … the one spell you have to conjure to get all of this to work.
 The good news is, you can follow a blueprint and make it happen. It starts with a framework I have named the “M.O.M. Method.” Because after all, Mom knows best.

 • M for Magnet. This is how you get your target market to pay attention
 and be drawn to you. So you can stop chasing after them. The magnet is not necessarily the item you are ultimately selling, but it is just how


-----

###### to get them to pay attention. In crass terms, think of it as the gorgeous half-naked woman on the billboard whose purpose is to sell a man’s watch. Or the large inflatable dancing man outside the retail store on the day of a big sale. Or the samples of Orange Chicken given out in the mall food court beckoning customers in.
 Getting your prospects to pay attention is the first step in getting them to listen to what you have to say next. Luckily, there are easy- peasy ways to know exactly what your target market will pay attention to. We’ll dive into that in the next few pages.
 • O for Opt-In. This is the flood of traffic you need from social media
 in order to get the contact information from your prospects. Growing your list is mission critical because if any of your social channels disappears, you still need to be able to communicate with your list. We will dive into how to get free and paid traffic (that pays for itself) in the chapters to come.
 • M for Monetize. Once you have a list, it’s bank time. Your fans will
 want your products, programs, and services. Your job is to sell them your own—or find others you can recommend and promote. In Chapter 10 we will dive into how to monetize your list.

 Magnetic Success Knowing who you are is important. I used to present my company as a “full-service marketing agency.” But really, what does that even mean?
 For me, it meant a lot of angst. With no focus or niche, we attracted every type of local small business that needed help. They usually had no marketing funnel set up, no list to work with, and no budget. We attracted a lot of businesses like that.
 These small businesses were awful at paying, so even when my contracts were close to covering expenses, we still couldn’t pay our bills. The most important time each day was 3 P.M. because that was when a deposit had to reach the bank to count for that day. Our mail carrier had to arrive before 3 P.M., and there needed to be a check in there, or something would fall apart. Our internet might be shut down. A vendor paramount to a

###### marketing firm, like a printer, might cut us off (rightfully so), or worse, I would risk not being able to make payroll.
 Some days the mail carrier came before 3 P.M. And some days she didn’t. As I think back on it, she usually didn’t. We had a very slow mail carrier in those years who would use my office building to hide out and take an extended break before delivering the mail. I tried using my Italian death stare, but even that didn’t work.
 Being all things to everyone means never being able to choose your customers or business growth. You have no control over the future of your company if you try to attract everyone.
 Narrow your focus. Targeting your audience to as small a group as possible allows you to offer content that is valuable to that group so you can build a strong relationship and increase your chances of brand conversion.
 It is much better to have 500 raving fans than 10,000 tepid followers. You want to attract and engage exactly the type of person who will pay you what you are worth. Remember …

 SOMEONE ALREADY HAS THE MONEY THAT WILL BE YOUR NEXT SALE Your job is to figure out who they are and why they will give it to you.

 • Look at the top 10% of your customers by revenue or, better yet, by
 profit.
 • Make a list of these customers and look for trends.
 • Run the “whose vacation do you want to go on?” test. Think about all
 of your customers, and if they invited you on vacation with them or to a conference they were going to, and there were going to be thousands of people just like them there, whose conference would you want to go to?

 I come from the belief that as long as you are going to work really hard at growing your business, you might as well enjoy it. Whoever you picture can exemplify your niche. As long as you are profitable with this target market and enjoy working with them, then you have found your niche.
 And you can create the business you really want.

###### When we were getting too many looky-loos with more dreams than cash on our webinars, we changed who we were targeting. Instead of basing our demographics on the who, we based them on the “what they have done before.” Meaning, we created Facebook Look-Alike audiences based on similar demographics of those who had spent the most money with us before.
 Our prospects improved, and so did our sales. (Want to see how to create your own super effective look-alike list? Get this and more at nobssocialmediabook.com/powerpack.)

 Once You Determine the “Who,” You Are Just Getting Started Before you start to deliver your message in any medium, you must know who your market is.
 It is imperative that you develop your perfect prospect “avatar.” This is everything about the key perfect customers you want to flood into your business.
 Things to focus on when creating your avatar include sex, age, profession, marital status, sexual orientation, location, native language, education, income, technological expertise, and family composition. Equally important to discover are their media-buying habits, interests, frustrations, and other favorite brand pages. All this research goes into the strategy behind our current clients’ work.
 And go beyond the obvious. At the surface, we target entrepreneurs. But we’ve gone even deeper than that.
 Our most successful members are those who have been in business at least three years and have been relying on word-of-mouth and referrals for lead generation.
 Still kind of obvious, right? We went even farther recognizing that those who have success are the action takers, those who don’t just sit back and wait for things to happen. They are implementers who move with speed.
 Who is this when it comes to targeting? I can’t divulge all of our secrets, of course, but one target market is frequent fliers. They either work outside of their local town which is a sign

###### they are busy getting things done or they travel for pleasure. Either way, they are a mover and shaker.
 Just applying that filter to our marketing has allowed us to directly target our ideal coaching client.

 1. Its customers are married and college-educated, with many having
 attended graduate school. All have a higher income, education, and home value than the average Facebook user (see Figure 5.1 on page 71). 2. Most use desktop and mobile, but a quarter use desktop only. This is
 significantly higher than the average Facebook user and a positive when trying to market online—because this company’s ideal prospects are more likely to be looking at their messaging on a larger screen.

**FIGURE 5.1: Relationship Status vs. Education Level**

###### Only 5% are mobile-only users, which is 86% less than the average Facebook user (see Figure 5.2).

**FIGURE 5.2: Device Users**

###### 3. They spend less money online than the average Facebook user (see
 Figure 5.3 on page 72). Only 45% rank medium to high in online spending. Most would assume you should ignore those who don’t spend online. These metrics say something different entirely. 4. Its buyers are more likely to make business purchases and to take on
 subscription services (see Figure 5.4 on page 72). 5. They own their home (see Figure 5.5 on page 73).

###### 6. They primarily put everything on a credit card, with 20% having a
 travel credit card and 30% a premium credit card (see Figure 5.6).

**FIGURE 5.6: Spending Methods**

###### 7. In looking at their Lifestyle Cluster, 15% of them are “Summit
 Estate Families” (see Figure 5.7).

**FIGURE 5.7: Lifestyle**

###### “Summit Estate” families are enjoying the good life—luxury travel, entertainment, and consumption of every kind are within easy reach.
 The above information is drawn from Acxiom, the data mining company behind the segmentation software “Perspectives.” Just think about the Established Elite (also shown in Figure 5.7). They mostly come from segments defined as Active Lifestyle, Corporate Connections, Top Professionals, and Active. How much more effective can your messaging be with this information? You can speak directly to your best target customers to attract more of them and ignore everyone else. Not only will this bring you more ideal customers, but it will save you money as there is no reason to focus on the masses.
 The key thing is that this is an analysis of its customers’ data, not its list of people who simply opted in and never bought anything. If you take a look at those stats, the picture is much different.
 For a website traffic breakdown, see Figure 5.8.

**FIGURE 5.8: Demographic Breakdown A**

###### Several profiles rank higher than average (see Figure 5.9 on page 76). More people make online purchases (see Figure 5.10 on page 76). Subscription services are no higher than average compared to their fans (see Figure 5.11 on page 77).
 Online spending is fairly average with slightly fewer people purchasing this way (see Figure 5.12 on page 77).
 Subscription services are not dramatically higher than the average (see Figure 5.13 on page 78).
 No one type of interest or demographic stands out.

###### Clearly, when creating a look-alike audience, it should focus on its best customers to get more like them, those who typically do not spend money

###### online but do spend money on subscription services.
 If we had looked at our client’s overall traffic and not its customers, our marketing focus would have been a lot less effective. By comparing what was different among the markets, we could pinpoint characteristics of its most profitable prospect.
 So how does this strategy play out? We learned the characteristics of the company’s members, which were different from others, and targeted them with our ads. In those demographics, we saw that business travel ranked high. So, we started to target a look-alike of its membership list, plus American Airlines. These have produced subscriptions from cold traffic at a return of 300% of the ad cost. These golden nuggets are where your real ROI comes into play because your competitors will not target these hidden demographics. They will stay within the obvious competitors.

#### You Can’t Always Get What You Want, But You
 Can Give Them What They Want

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Getting your target market to pay attention is an art and science.
 Research firms pay millions each year to figure this out for big brands. You could try calling and asking nicely for them to give you all their secrets and research findings. My guess is that they are not going to want to divulge that information.
 Good news is, using Facebook you can get it for free, right now. After Facebook came under attack for some shenanigans involving Trump, Russians, and the election, Facebook decided to let us all see who and how people were advertising. In fact, you can now see all the past and present ads of your top competitors, right now. You don’t even need a Facebook Ads account to access it.
 Simply visit https://www.facebook.com/ads/library and type in the name of another business. If they’ve run Facebook ads before, they will come up.
 Using myself as an example, see Figure 5.14 on page 80 for what this looks like.


-----

###### Research at least ten different competitors in your niche and see their full campaigns, landing pages, offers, and magnets. Opt-in. Then take out your credit card and buy. And do what every good entrepreneur does … be willing to invest in getting this figured out.
 And by all means do not use a cop-out of “I can’t find anyone in my niche that is running ads.” That is a lazy answer, and the road to success is not run by the lazy. Keep looking. It does not need to be direct competitors. Just those that serve the same market as you.

**FIGURE 5.14: Ads Library**

###### For instance, Infusionsoft software isn’t a competitor of mine. We use their software and are a certified partner reselling it with a bonus package, but they do serve the same market as me, so it makes sense to check out their ads that produce results.
 Dive into those that serve your niche to uncover what’s working right now so you know what to model. That’s model, not copy. Use this research for inspiration on what your MOM Blueprint will be.
