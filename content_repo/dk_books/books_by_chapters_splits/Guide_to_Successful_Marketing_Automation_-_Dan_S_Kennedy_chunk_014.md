###### Interspecies marriage is a marketing power secret. Nobody should be overemphasizing online and neglecting offline or vice versa. Full integration of all marketing media is key. In this and prior chapters, Parthiv has described systems and software solutions that accommodate both worlds: digital and print/mail. Furthermore, leads might be generated on TV, radio, at trade shows, at consumer shows, by outbound telemarketing, and by other means. They all must be brought into a funnel. All welcomed and managed by the same CRM or bigger system including a CRM.

 In this chapter, Parthiv has specifically discussed print media. He has mailed over a billion pieces of direct mail for his companies and his clients. He produces print Shock & Awe packages, books, consumer guides. For my clients I do all that and more, often including multiple videos, full-length infomercial format videos, and audio material. While much of it is used in digital forms online, it is also delivered in physical forms: print, DVD, CD, thumb drive. This requires investment in your leads and your customers. If they are not worthy of such investment, I advise getting better leads and customers. If your business’s economics prohibit such investment, I urge fixing those economics. I do not advise surrendering to only being able to do the cheapest things

 The great management guru Peter Drucker cautioned against efficiency at the expense of effectiveness. It was and is a brilliant caution. With your Marketing Automation, you are attempting to— and you actually can—defy Drucker’s gravity! You are going to improve efficiency and cost-efficiency and effectiveness in concert.

# Do You Surrender Too Soon? Too Easily? Because You Have
 No Choice?

##### By Parthiv Shah

###### Wouldn’t it be great if you could make a sale after just one well-done sales presentation? Typically, you or your salesperson puts all their energy into doing a great job of the initial sales presentation and then maybe follows up with one phone call or email. In most cases, fewer buy than don’t buy, immediately. More money walks away than gets collected. The prospect doesn’t buy, and your salesperson believes they are not interested in your product or service and gives up on them. Or your salesperson is blessed with new leads—so why struggle with the recalcitrant? Thanks to your marketing, there may be so much low-hanging fruit, he won’t climb trees.
 This is how most businesses lose a lot of money. It’s one of the chief ways that I step in and “find” a lot of money.
 According to a study by Brevet, a leading sales consulting firm, 80 percent of sales require five follow-up calls after the first meeting. This seems to be a very consistent fact, supported by many surveys, studies of

-----

###### companies’ actual sales results, and work by top consulting firms. But 40 to 50 percent of sales reps give up after one follow-up. Ninety percent of sales pros give up after the fourth call, but 80 percent of prospects say no four times before saying yes. If your takeaway from these stats is that most customers need well-timed and frequent encouragement to say yes by the fifth prompting—you’re right. Further, most marketing also has a long tail. Potential buyers first brought to sales situations where they did not buy reappear 6 months to several years later, ready. A lot of business owners and professionals know this happens, yet they don’t do anything about it. Dan Kennedy teaches that whatever happens randomly or accidentally can be made to happen methodically, on purpose.
 This is why a thorough, patient, and persistent follow-up system is a wise investment. And it can be automated, so it climbs the tree, it struggles with the recalcitrant, it is unaffected emotionally, it has persistence programmed in. My follow-up system uses seven keys:

##### 1. Variety in Media

###### It’s important to remember that different people prefer and respond to different follow-up methods and media. You CAN’T use only what you and your like-minded peers, staff, or friends relate to. Effective sales media includes emails, LinkedIn, or other social media platforms, along with direct mail. Some people process ideas best by reading, others by listening, others by seeing. My follow-up mixes a variety of media over its term.

##### 2. Timing

###### Buying decisions take time, and you don’t want to annoy your prospect with too many follow-ups delivered too soon. The higher the price tag, and the more people involved in the buying decision, the longer it may take to get results. On the other hand, you don’t want to be too slow or so infrequent that you sacrifice impact and created urgency. How often should you follow up? That depends on your prospect, product or service, timing

-----

###### sensitivity of the purchase, and other variables. In my own case, I do a lot of fairly intense follow-up in a sprint, followed, if needed, by a more gentle, less frequent marathon of follow-up.

##### 3. Create Value

###### Delivering value not requiring purchase in concert with follow-up asking for an opportunity to deliver services or products is a very good strategy. The chiropractor following up might include the “7 Best Ways to Avoid or Lessen the Flu This Flu Season” or “Reminders About Safer, Injury-Free Weekend Sports” along with his offer of exams. Dan Kennedy talks about this in his Magnetic Marketing System[®] as being a Welcome Guest instead of an Annoying Pest.

##### 4. Be Interesting and Relevant

###### The best follow-up is segmented follow-up. If Bob didn’t buy chiefly because of price or affordability, but Charlie didn’t buy because of past disappointments with products he thinks of as similar, there is no one- message-fits-all follow-up that can have maximum impact with both of them. They have two entirely different chief interests. You bore them both having to cover both reasons for not buying. This, again, is where your CRM fits. You might have five different lists to choose from, and to put each non-buyer into after the failed sales appointment, each list tied to a different chief objection or concern. Then, five different follow-up sequences of emails, letters, online video, etc.

##### 5. Data-Driven

###### The best automated systems track who is visiting your site and what interests them. Who views which documents or videos and how much time they spend on each one. A quiz or survey each person completes online can harvest a lot of information useful for the first selling attempt and for

-----

###### follow-up. Offering a choice of two of my six specific free reports can segment potential buyers. Notes kept by salespeople from conversations. We get and use a lot of such data. Some clients use more, some less.

##### 6. Data-Driven Email Automation

###### With our system, your email sequences (follow-ups) automate, and you can choose your best emails with the highest response rates. You can track open rates and response rates from different subject lines, different days of the week, and different hours of the day to determine and fine-tune the best times to send emails and the best copy to use in those emails to get your desired action.

##### 7. Live Chat & Calling

###### While your prospect is interacting with your site, you can get their attention and engage them instantly with live chat, which builds instant rapport and closes sales faster. With our unique system, calls can be scheduled, logged into your CRM, and recorded with just one click.

#### Dan Kennedy Says

###### Follow-up matters.

 In my earliest business life, as a B2B territory rep, I averaged six to seven sales calls each day, roaming about five states. Every night in my motel room, I handwrote Thank-You Notes to the NON-buyers, thanking them for their time and consideration, and enclosing a business card. Fifty percent of non-buyers called me within days to say they had reconsidered and would try the product line in their stores—because nobody had ever shown them such respect.

-----

###### As a consultant and a copywriter, I have developed a 3-step to 16-step Appointment, No-Sale letter sequences for over 50 different types of businesses, averaging a 15 to 30 percent response. One such sequence for financial advisors, applied to attendees of their free workshops who failed to immediately book appointments, using multi-media (online AND offline), up to 18 steps, averaged an 18 percent success rate. In their businesses, the average client was worth $8,000+ in fees and commissions the first year. If they had 100 at their meeting, and they were top performers, they’d book appointments with half, leaving 50 they failed with. My follow-up system for all 18 steps cost $200 per person to implement. 50 x $200 = $10,000. It produced 18 percent of 50 = 9 x $8,000 = $72,000. And just how many times a month would you like to swap $10,000 for $72,000? They could do it two to three times = $62,000 x 2, $124,000 or 3, $186,000, x 10 months a year (skipping July and December) = $1.2 to $1.8 million EXTRA, ADDITIONAL INCOME from the same leads, same meetings. Slow down. Study it. Now here is the “dirty little secret”: If we handed them everything and left it up to them and their staffs, NONE OF THEM could ever have implemented all 18 steps properly and on time. Only by fully automating everything for them did this work. Could this work. All they had to do was enter the contact information of those who didn’t book appointments the morning after a meeting, click the “GO” button, and they were done.

 What marketing and follow-up “machines” do you own, that you just plug in contact info, hit the “GO” button, and you’re done?

# How I Doubled My Practice 5
 Times in 8 Years with Full
 Marketing Automation

 A Case History

##### by Dr. Carlo Biasucci

###### I was able to double my practice 5 times over the past 8 years. I’ve also created the Elite Dental Marketing Program for use by other dentists I coach and consult with.
 I want you to imagine you could spend as much time as you want with every single patient before the start of treatment, while they’re in treatment, as they’re approaching the end of treatment, and post treatment. What would you say to them? How would you say it to them? What would happen with the relationship between you and your patient? As a practicing dentist, you know that’s simply not possible when you’re both a chief producer and overseer of the business. So how carefully are these

-----

###### conversations being handled right now in your practice? Is the relationship your patients have with you and your practice the best it could be?
 I have automated this. You would need to hire two to three full-time people to do what this system does automatically. In our internal marketing machine, we have choreographed all the conversations that you could have with the patient and put them in one seamless marketing system with 23 interlocking Infusionsoft/Keap soft campaigns.
 What is Infusionsoft/Keap? Infusionsoft is a CRM, a customer relationship management system, and one of the most comprehensive and complex marketing automation systems available to small business, affordable for small business. It ensures that your ideal choreography is carried out exactly when and how you designed it. For example, let’s say you generate interest in a particular cosmetic dentistry procedure, and a prospective patient downloads your free report. Your campaign would then go on to send, at the time you specify, emails, direct mail, even physical packages to them, all automatically without you ever having to touch it. The relationship with the prospective patient will be nurtured until they become a patient. Even more importantly, the relationship will continue to be automatically nurtured after a prospective patient becomes a patient of your practice to build trust and rapport.
 Most dentists only contact their patients two or three times a year when they’re due for the recall visits. Compare that to the dentist who’s sending regular weekly emails and direct mail. The dentist with the automated campaign can handle all of this easily and have 60 or more touches in the same time frame. By becoming this familiar and delivering valuable content, your patients and prospective patients will trust you more. They will know you, they will like you, they will be more relaxed when they come in, and they are more likely to follow your instructions, accept the treatment that you’re presenting, keep the appointments that they’re supposed to keep, be more loyal to your practice, and be the patient you want them to be. And, best of all, unlike two to three employees hired to do all of this, Infusionsoft never gets sick, never quits, and never has a bad day.

#### The Dynamic Advantage: How to Impress Prospective Patients (Customers) Like No
 One Else Does

###### Every business attempts to favorably impress potential customers and customers. If you fully automate your marketing as I have, unlike your competition, you can deliver customized, personal, helpful content and sales messages to your prospects and patients based on who they are, what they need, and how they behave. This is about having a system that increases conversion, which means that you don’t spend any more money on advertising than you’re currently spending, but you get better results. Before I share this with you, there are three things I want you to understand, and everything I’m going to show you is based on these three things.
 The first is to gather information. This one should be obvious. Just like in our practice, you can’t prescribe unless you diagnose. In marketing, we want to ask questions to determine if prospects are a right fit. Not every patient is a great patient, right? I’m sure you have patients that you like and patients that you’d rather not have more of. One of the first things the eLaunchers team does with our clients is analyze patient data. This helps us know the characteristics of their best patients. This is true for my dental practice, other practices, and many other types of businesses.
 Number two is to customize messaging. The rules have changed. We cannot treat every prospective patient the same. People don’t have a lot of time. And if you’re sending information that’s not relevant to them, they will tune you out and possibly unsubscribe. The good news is that we can send relevant information that’s going to help them specifically. This was a big factor in my 5X-in-8-years result: being able to customize messaging.
 The third concept that many dental practices aren’t consistent with is follow-up. What I mean by follow-up is that every prospect, patient, and lost patient is in a campaign of some sort. This doesn’t necessarily mean we’re sending stuff every day or every week, but it means we have a plan for them in our marketing system.

-----

###### I am often asked to simplify and summarize how I 2X’d my practice 5 times in 8 years. The simplest answer is simple. I did 10 times more with each lead, each potential patient, and each patient than I had ever done before, in 1/5 the time—possible only through automation.

#### More Patient (Customer) Engagement Equals
 More Case (Offer) Acceptance and More
 Referrals

###### There are seven key points of information we have in our system for maximum patient engagement:

 Key#1: Last visit activity, or in other words, recency. This is the last time somebody came into your office. Key #2: How many times somebody visited your office, or frequency. Key #3: Monetary spend or monetary value. Key #4: Accepted treatment. Key #5: If they refused any treatment plan for them. Key #6: If they have given you any referrals. Key #7: Rating or reviewing us for others to see.

 These are measurements of how well we are doing and of how well each patient is succeeding at behaving as we would like them to behave. I drove my 5X by ending the practice of relying on opinions or feelings—Oh, we do very well with referrals. Oh, I think our patient value is quite high. I replaced all that with hard facts. Hard facts can be managed and made better.
 I get a daily report with a lot of data, automatically collected and provided. I see who and how many are opening different emails, filling out forms, opening more emails, clicking links, all sorts of things. Staff didn’t have to do anything for these emails and clicks and opt-in and web forms. This monitors all the different processes and campaigns.
 Let’s say somebody sets an appointment. They’ve gone through part of this. They set an appointment, and they’re ready to come in, but they don’t
