There’s a famous story involving Andrew Carnegie’s steel mills and a consultant, Charles Schwab, asked by Carnegie to somehow boost production of each of the three shifts working in the plants. He did so with a fantastic “technology”: chalk. At the end of each shift, the shift manager wrote the number of their production on the floor, big, in chalk. If the next shift beat it, that manager could erase the old number and write theirs. If they fell short, they had to leave the prior shift’s number there and write their own. Production became highly competitive. Most sales managers, where a number of inside sales reps work, by phone or seeing customers in person, keep a scoreboard up on the wall, and move each rep up or down, above or below each other, every day.

 You can establish quotas, benchmarks, and other “scores” for multiple items in each of the six categories of achievement in a business that Parthiv likes to focus on, as well as others. You can have the scores kept by automation instead of by manual labor. The more you do this, the more successful your business will be. You should be getting a scoreboard spit out by automation put into your hands every day. Just as an example, you’re no longer limited to evaluating tele-sales reps just by their conversion percentage. You can score their sales efficiency, too, with automated readouts of how many minutes they spent on each call, the number of minutes in a day actually on calls, and other

-----

###### facts. Each person they book to an appointment or that they sell to can be “tagged,” automatically followed, so you see differences in the ways that John Rep’s buyers behave over 90 days vs. Jim Rep’s. Jim might have a slightly lower conversion rate, but keep more of his appointments, or more of his appointments become more engaged with sequential purchases than John’s—so Jim is actually the better of the two. Source also often matters a lot, so John and Jim may have better conversion rates with people attracted through Ad Media #A vs. Ad Media # B, in which case you’ll want to consider ways to increase spend with #A, decrease it with # B, and go hunting for another media that works like #A. This dynamic exists with many things not being scored and evaluated.

 I have a client that sells via webinars, to members of a certain industry. There are 11 usable ad media, and for follow-up, four in- house telereps. By carefully evaluating and using a lot of automatically provided data—for example, what percentage of those from each of the 11 media stay on the webinar until its end vs. exiting early—they have been able to boost sales conversions of the webinar by 16 percent and boost productivity of the reps by 7 percent over the course of a year. This equates to well over $300,000.

 A good exercise is to think about and list every item of information you could use if you got it, that you don’t now get. Then set about getting it!

##### CHAPTER 4

# We Begin to Fish Using Automation and AI for WARM
 and COLD Email Outreach

#### by Parthiv Shah

###### Maybe the most basic tool of Marketing Automation is email, so I decided to talk about it first, ahead of other important aspects. You know you can use it to stay in touch with your clients, patients, prospects, but can you use it as a very inexpensive and effective outreach tool to lost, past customers, and even to first-time contacts, strangers? Most of my clients are used to HubSpot and Keap (formerly Infusionsoft). With these tools, there are rules. We cannot simply buy a database and upload it to HubSpot—I’ll get kicked out like that. It’s a problem. Also, if we get mass email sent, deliverability is a hurdle, getting classified as spam is a hurdle, and the open rate is a hurdle. Still, there are ways to effectively use email.
 One of the things my friend Seth Greene discovered was if he sends a single email, from his Microsoft Outlook account, you will get it. It will

-----

###### land in your inbox because it’s a personal email coming from his email account to your email account. It isn’t sent by HubSpot or Mailchimp. He figured out that if he could send one email at a time to one person, he could get 100 percent deliverability, he could get an exponentially higher open rate, and geometrically increase his results.
 For me and my business, Seth figured out that I could send one-on-one invitations to a webinar and I could get a lot more people to show up than by any kind of mass marketing. Even the reminders that come from Zoom, the day before and an hour before, are ignored by a lot of people, but a seemingly personal email is different. I also sent follow-up emails to webinar attendees, saying, “You didn’t take advantage of the offer we made on the webinar,” then making another attempt at that sale. My email didn’t land in promotions, it didn’t land in spam, you got it in your inbox.
 It is my friend’s 16-year-old son Max’s computer code doing the work. He isn’t physically sending tens of thousands of emails. His bot is mimicking the physical actions you would take to do that.

#### Lost ’n Found Money

###### You have unengaged people on your list. Unengaged means they haven’t opened an email in 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. HubSpot, Keap, Mailchimp, they all automatically stop sending your emails to people who are unengaged, because doing that would affect their IP sender reputation. If you just let this be, you have an ever-growing number of people never receiving communication from you again, even though today’s disengaged past customer or unconverted lead can be tomorrow’s interested prospect. I exported out my Keap list of unengaged people. I used the bot to send them an email, they actually got the email, I reactivated a lot of those leads, and actually brought in business. They said, “I wondered where you were; I hadn’t gotten an email in a while.” I said, “That’s because you didn’t open them. Keap automatically stopped sending them to you.”
 My friend Seth Greene was literally spending hours a day working nights at home, upsetting his wife by always working, sending one email at

-----

###### a time. He would go copy and paste hundreds and hundreds of times, an extra couple hours a night before a webinar, to get this done via manual labor. He even went downstairs after his wife fell asleep. It was a lot of manual labor. His 16-year-old son asked a life-changing question: “What can I automate in your business that is working when you do it manually?”
 That’s a million-dollar question. Dan calls it “a writer down-er.” He’d say: Write it in big, bold letters on a 4” x 6” card and tack it up on the wall where you’ll see it a lot. If you have staff, give a copy to each staff member. Tell them to tell you what they do manually that drives sales or retention or referrals that might be automated, liberating them for another opportunity.
 Seth said, “If I send one email at a time from Outlook, I can get through and it works. Can you automate the physical manual labor of sending one email at a time?” And his 16-year-old figured it out. Invented a bot that could fool everybody, and seem like an individual sending one personal email to another individual. We have used this to send 600,000 emails. When you send 600,000 emails, you learn a lot about what works and what doesn’t work. I am going to give you some priceless lessons in email marketing that, whether you use the bot or not, you can apply in your marketing right now. Then I’ll let you use my bot, if you like. Here are the lessons we’ve learned:

When it comes to subject lines, don’t use all caps—it decreases your open rate. The server’s
filters delete these.
Keep it short. If you keep it under 50 characters, you have a better shot of getting opened. If
it is going to be long, you must know it is going to a highly interested audience responsive to
you.
Save the emails you get. We have one of the best swipe files of proven results, getting
emails. There is a priceless training inside your email inbox.
Robert Collier said you need to participate in the conversation that is already going on in
your prospect’s head. If I were promoting a dinner with Dan Kennedy to people who are
going to Funnel Hacking LIVE, then I would talk about Funnel Hacking LIVE—I would
talk about things that were going on.
Ask a provocative question. One of the ways to increase your response rate is ask them a
question and get them to reply to you. Anytime someone replies to your email, that increases
your email sender score because it looks like a conversation.
Use specific results and the time it took you to get there. This email bot can deliver 360
emails an hour. It gives you results—360 emails in 60 minutes, delivering emails every 10
seconds. Stop. Evaluate. Adjust. Split-test.

-----

###### I am even going to tell you our best performing subject line in about 63 different industries. It works business to business. It works business to consumer; it does not matter. We have tested this subject line in every campaign we run. It’s one of our splittests. People are social creatures— they want to feel like they’re not alone in the problem they’ve got. They want to feel part of something. I’d be really surprised if it didn’t work better than whatever your normal subject line would be. Here it is: “You Are Not Alone.”
 Our second-best one came from Dean Jackson. He has a very famous nine-word email—“Are you still looking for [blank]?”— and the blank is whatever you do. Are you still looking to get top dollar for your home when you sell? Are you still looking for a way to really lose weight fast? Are you still looking for a way to find better employees? Are you still looking for blank? It’s an immediate lead qualifier. Will everybody reply to your email? No. Every time we send this, though, we get people who reply and say, “Yes, I am still looking for,” and then you’ve got a qualified lead.

#### You’ve Heard of (Illegal) Money Laundering.
 Here’s (Legal) Lead Laundering!

###### Now let’s talk about some of the use cases. We’ve talked about how you could use this to reactivate an unengaged list— individuals who haven’t replied to your email in one month, three months, six months, nine months. You can deduce they’re probably not even seeing your emails anymore. Use this to get them to be reactivated.
 You can even use this to create lead flow from cold sources. We’ve talked about buying a list of dentists and how you can’t upload it to HubSpot. However, you can use this bot to email them all directly, and that could drive them to your HubSpot landing page where they’ve now given you permission to communicate with them. This is usually done with a Lead Generation Magnet offer, like a free report download, free book, free training. They are now a clean lead in HubSpot and they can go through the HubSpot automation sequence and you can now drip on them until the end

###### of time in HubSpot. If you want to fill your HubSpot with more qualified, interested people, use this bot to get them to go opt in for something through HubSpot, etc. (Or other software like Keap, or moved into ClickFunnels.)
 For me, this significantly increases webinar attendance rates. We did the exact same webinar twice and we had it with the same webinar partner. The first webinar we did without the email bot, just the Zoom automations reminding people to show up. We had 814 registered and 244 people showed up: 30 percent. We had 814 people registered the second time in. We used the email bot to remind them to show up and 454 people showed up: 55 percent We’ve used this to book podcast guests. I scraped an email list of 1,000 estate planning attorneys off of LinkedIn. I then used this bot to, in 2 hours and 45 minutes, send 1,000 emails to attorneys we didn’t know, saying: How would you like to be on a podcast about estate planning? We ended up with 125 podcast guests in two and a half hours with no manual labor. Our podcast producer literally said, “Wow, you got me 125 guests. We were airing once a week—this was going to take 2 years to get through. We’re now airing every day.” She’s said, “Please don’t do that again until I catch up.” That’s a wonderful problem to have.
 You may or may not use webinars or podcasts in your marketing. Maybe you should. Maybe you shouldn’t. But I hope you can see that my experience with this for my business and for clients can adapt to do something significant in lead generation for your business.
 The implementation of the email bot, while innovative and effective, was not without its challenges. A significant aspect of its development and deployment involved navigating the complex landscape of email compliance and addressing various technical hurdles. One of the foremost challenges was ensuring that the email bot complied with various email sending policies and spam regulations, notably the CAN-SPAM Act. This act sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, and gives recipients the right to stop receiving emails. To adhere to these regulations, the email bot was designed with built-in features that automatically included an opt-out option in every email and managed unsubscribe requests efficiently. This ensured that the

-----

###### emails sent were not only personalized, but also compliant with legal standards. Another technical challenge was managing bounce-backs and opt-out requests. Bounce-backs occur when emails are sent to invalid addresses, and managing these effectively is crucial for maintaining a clean email list and a good sender reputation. Max coded a second bot with the capability to automatically update the mailing list by removing invalid addresses and processing opt-out requests promptly. This feature helped maintain the integrity of the email campaigns and ensured respectful communication with recipients.

#### Dan Kennedy Says

###### In direct mail, there are long-lived strategies for “sneaking up.” One of the G.O.A.T. copywriters, Gary Halbert, observed that “a lot of people sort their mail over the wastebasket. You have to survive the cut.” If you look like junk mail, you risk being handled by postal workers as junk that can go undelivered without consequences. There’s a junk mail / bulk mail non-delivery problem just as there is an email deliverability problem. You risk going directly to the recipient’s wastebasket. So, a lot of direct mail is designed to mimic personal, one-to-one mail. As an example, a marketer I spent some time with was very successful with a membership offer, sending his sales letter folded, put in a greeting card–sized envelope, hand-addressed, sent First Class with stamps, and with a mark on the sealed flap of a woman’s kiss in red lipstick. Yes, he had a huge room of women seated at

-----

###### long tables, stuffing, sealing, hand-addressing, and planting kisses on the envelopes. Each looked like it HAD TO HAVE BEEN SENT by a person you knew, personally, to you. I copied this approach (without the lipstick mark) very successfully for a skin-care product, for WeightWatchers International, and for a B2B campaign to CEOs raising funds for restoration of Ellis Island, from Lee Iacocca. What Parthiv has described here for email is this kind of direct mail. It is the same trick.

 All advertising and marketing currently suffers mightily from the massive, monstrous amount of clutter online, existing because the media is cheap or even free. This makes your mandate doing something different, differently, so you can avoid the frantic dumping of 99 percent of what is seen or arrives digitally into the mental or virtual wastebasket.

# When They Arrive at Your Digital Doorway, Then What?

##### by Pathiv Shah

###### I magine meeting Steve Jobs when Apple was in its infancy.
 I have to start this by telling you a story. I showed up bright and early for Dan Kennedy’s big, multi-day Super Conference. In 2015. I was a premier event sponsor, and this is what happened.
 I had been working the room all day and into the night. My feet were tired. My body was still feeling the effects of jet lag. But my mind was so full of ideas from the day’s event that I knew sleep would not come anytime soon. It was around 9:30 at night when one of Dan’s team members, Nick, tapped me on the shoulder.
 “Hey, Parthiv, tomorrow’s keynote speaker just arrived. His plane was late. He’s sitting alone in the bar. Why don’t you go say hi and give him some company.”
 So, instead of heading to my room, I followed Nick into the bar. The place is relatively empty, but as promised, I saw a young man sitting at the bar alone, sipping a glass of water. I stop in my tracks. Surely, this all
