##### our borders. He manages 90% of my real estate investments. In July, he sent this letter: “Dear Partner. Please find enclosed a little gift from me. I thought I would send a little bit of Iowa to you. Please take the time to go through this fine magazine and get in touch with what Iowa is all about. I guarantee the photos alone will almost transport you here and make you feel like you are part of the fabric that not only surrounds the Heartland but, of course, your properties, too.” The letter’s copy is deceptively simple and deliberately a tick awkward, but ingenious. (My only criticism, Darin, is it being in block, businesslike type. Should have been Courier or American Typewriter font or handwritten.)

 The magazine is full of color photos of small town and rural Iowa life, a feature on ‘The Prettiest Farm In Iowa’, ads for the Trucking Museum, Field of Dreams movie site, paddlewheel boat cruise, and four pages of prize winning recipes from readers. If you’re a city dweller and you never get to these places, this’ll feel to you like time travel into a past America that no longer exists. There is nothing in this charming magazine about property values, appreciation, yield, population levels, etc. in Iowa and compared to other real estate markets. There is no information of use to an investor. It has nothing to do directly with investing in properties—that, after all, is (boring) math, pure and simple. But it has a lot to do with why people like investing in properties there. There is something very reassuring about it all. Families on after church Sunday picnics and at ‘Friday Night lights’ together. A city surrounded by farmland, Amish buggies on some of the roads. For some investors, there is nostalgia, for places and times of their own past or their parents’ lives and values. There is a sense of slow ‘n steady and safe. Here, people still send their kids out to play in the morning, instructed “just be home by dinner” and nobody worries. The magazine has articles about predicting the weather by the activity of fireflies, a 93-year-old nun in Dubuque taking a birthday flight on an antique bi-plane at Riverfest, and a Mom in Glidden getting the fancy new barn she’d always wanted built for her by her husband and her three sons. Yes, an article about a Mom and

##### her family and a barn. Darin has wisely used his Place’s narrative in attracting and keeping investors, and has dominated the greater Cedar Rapids market for many years by doing so. Sending this magazine is an extension of that.

 The point is: there is a narrative that has nothing to do directly with what you sell, but that people will like, be reassured by, be intrigued by, and that will make them like, trust and want to do business with you. It is this narrative you need to establish, get organized for yourself, then tell and re-tell and show and stick to and make stick. The Disney Company goes to considerable lengths to keep telling ‘the Walt stories’. You can see a little model of Marceline, the little town Walt modeled his Main Street after, in the Walt exhibit at Disney Studios in Orlando. WHY? Because the history, the man who created the mouse, the sense of place all matter. Most companies dump their narratives in the trash as they mature and grow big. Out of ignorance, stupidity, the egos of the current tenants in the C-suite. Common mistake.

 Bill Clinton recently observed, in a joint appearance with George W. Bush, that the candidate with the best personal narrative who can tell it the best usually wins—but that, increasingly, the press locks in on its own narrative, is very resistant to letting anything in conflict with it make it through to the public, and can so burden a candidate with theirs that he never communicates his. The challenge, Clinton said, is to keep putting forward your narrative, no matter what. He said: if you switch from telling it to defending


-----

##### it or yourself, you’re in trouble. This contradicts something many falsely believe about politicking; that the candidate making the most beguiling promises to the most people wins. Not so. It’s narrative, more often than not.

 For the record, your narrative is more, and more powerful, than just your story or stories. It explains “why”, it doesn’t just tell “what.” It lets people feel they know you, your place, philosophy, personality. There are nearly as many biographies and autobiographies published as there are novels or fiction or cookbooks and diet books, because people are fascinated with other people and what makes them tick. So-called “reality TV” shows set in diverse places, from Louisiana swamps to the Jersey shore to Amish communities, in restaurants, in pawn shops, on farms, etc. are really about the places and the people in them.

 What vat of formative stew has this person come out of? Made him? “Character” is the strength and originality and moorings of an individual, and a person’s narrative reveals character. About the person selling anything to us, we are trying to figure out “is this someone I can have a good relationship with?” Combining Person with Place narrative can be very powerful.

 By the way, if you go to Iowa, don’t miss the Corn Expo held at the Hybrid Corn Pioneers Museum in Earling or the National Farm Toy Museum in Dyersville. But if you’re not going, even they have websites. HybridCornCollector.com. NationalFarmToyMuseum.com. And, of course, the magazine’s is OurIowaMagazine.com. Slogan: There ain’t no strangers in Iowa —just friends you haven’t met yet. As Sarah Palin ill-advisedly said, “Here you’ll find the REAL Americans.” Well, we can’t all live in the Heartland. But we all can put forward a narrative of our own. A lot of mine, by the way, is in my book of autobiographical essays, Unfinished Business, published by Gold Member Adam Witty’s Advantage Publishing, and available at Amazon. People often isolate “authority” and think they can wield it like a big club.


-----

##### But the old caution is right: most don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care, who you are, where you came from, and why you’re here. In my own career, I understand that people may be attracted by my authority; by what I know; by profitable information I can transfer to them—but they stay, many as Lifers, only when they feel that I genuinely care about them succeeding and achieving their goals, and genuinely care about them getting more than their money’s worth from me. This is a ‘secret sauce’ you can ladle onto any burger. Damn few do.

## Secrets of a Relationship Marketing
 Machine

##### by Parthiv Shah

 usiness owners think about marketing as outward, not inward, as external, not internal. They are focused on marketing to the public and new prospects, and never think much about marketing to their existent customers. Some build complex “marketing

# Bmachines” for external purposes but never build a Relationship Marketing

##### Machine. Most aim for sales. Few aim to create relationships that drive sales.
 Building relationships and getting referrals from friends, clients, and joint venture partners is a subject very close to my heart. My own business is complex, complicated, and difficult to comprehend. Before people will allow me to work on their business, they will have to trust my talent, trust my integrity, trust my ability to identify and solve a problem, and believe in the promise I am making. The fact is, no one is going to make a sizable financial commitment and provide complete access to their entire business —its finances, its data, its customers, and its processes—without establishing a deep level of trust. This has pretty much forced me to build a great relationship marketing system.


-----

##### My business lives or dies by relationship building. I talk about the seven steps of business relationship in my book Business Kamasutra, From Persuasion to Pleasure. In my book I draw parallels between how humans meet, date, and mate and how companies prospect, pitch, and close. The seven steps are Segmentation, Approach, Consent, Trust Building, Foreplay, Mate, and Relationship Transformation.
 When a client relationship is created, starting with consent, then trust, then well-performed foreplay, and consummated with care, the client wants to mate more, mate more often, and when they tell their peers about you, they are going to talk about the incredible experience they had with you— which is far more useful than having them talk about you in normal terms, about products, services, and prices. This is how my business works, and it’s how your business can work, too.
 When you receive a referral from a peer or friend, a significant amount of trust is already established, so you will have to do less work before you are ready to engage in a transaction. Doubts are diminished, so everything can be fast-tracked.

#### My Personal Story and Its Lessons
##### I want to start this chapter with my own story. Many people know about the sale of my previous company ListLaunchers and the circumstances under which I started eLaunchers.com in Maryland. I started ListLaunchers in 2002 in Massachusetts, and we got bought out in 2005 by a tech company in India that wanted to move to Washington, D.C. So we moved to Maryland to work for the company who bought us, only to find out that there was no money, no infrastructure, no resources, and no chance to win. Under extreme hostile conditions, in a brand-new location, against all odds, we started eLaunchers.com. We had no business social circle, we had no networking connections, and no one knew us.
 At a county economic development department event, I met the Vice President and Provost of Montgomery College Germantown campus, Dr. Hercules Pinkney. I told him my story. I told him about my business, my strengths, and the kind of clients I was looking for. He made a couple dozen introductions. Some of those people forged business relationships with me,


-----

##### and my little company survived. When I met Dan Kennedy in 2009, the business shifted from surviving to thriving. It was thriving because of others’ endorsements, by direct association with and by visibly “standing next to” leaders like Dan, by association with entities like this university. Almost every client directly referred another client, what Dan describes as the endless chain effect. But referrals from people who had no reason to be clients, but had influence with potential clients, were just as significant. I knew I needed to feed this machine as many ways as I could.
 I call this a machine, by the way, because it operates continuously, ultimately producing a mathematically predictable result. “X” number of good clients + “Y” number of center of influence endorsers = “Z” number of referrals. This is very different from external advertising, marketing, or public relations, where there are many variables creating erratic up-and- down results. For example, Dan tells me, with direct-response TV infomercials, the results of successful shows tank when major news events dominate and all eyes lock onto CNN and other news networks. Clicking around the dial stops, and so do infomercials’ sales. Similar scenarios you can’t control affect effectiveness or costs of just about every advertising media. With online search, your cost and new customer counts are affected by other bidders jockeying for position. Google and Facebook are now famous for changing the rules of their game often, something marketers bitterly complain about. These are all temperamental machines! The kind of internal and relationship marketing machine I developed for myself that now helps clients create the same for their businesses is much more dependable, day in, day out. By the number of good, healthy relationships I’m nurturing and maintaining, I can accurately forecast the number of referrals I will get.
 At one point, I went back to Dr. Pinkney and directly asked him what I could do to return the favors he was doing for me. This is very important. You cannot prosper for very long simply taking from any internal or relationship marketing machine. You have to give back.
 He said, “If you really want to do something for me, do something for my students. I have 30,000 students.” “But I am just one little guy with one little company. What can I possibly do?” I asked. “Take one student at a time and make a difference,” said Dr. Pinkney. That is how my learn to earn internship was born. We take two to four students per semester from


-----

##### Montgomery College and teach them direct response marketing, data intelligence, marketing automation, event management, and telemarketing. These students earn scholarships at the college, and we match the scholarship amount. They stay with us for two to four semesters, and after that they find a real job. As of June 2015, we have had over 36 students graduate from our program. ALL of them are gainfully employed. I picked TWO of them to stay back and be part of my growing company. The mission of the learn to earn internship is to help American kids head-on compete for $10- to $20-an-hour work that is currently outsourced to India, the Philippines, and other countries. My students are winning the battle, and they are winning the battle by the landslide.
 You can get information about my learn to earn internship program at http://elaunchers.com/interns. Maybe you’ll want to create something similar with your business and an appropriate university.
 This internship program takes time, money, and energy. It is not easy babysitting handfuls of students and transforming them into professionals. It is especially hard when there is no monetization model, no revenue model, and you have to write a check for the privilege of taking these kids and training them. You pay the students, you pay for overhead, you pay your staff to train the kids, and you pay the staff and vendors to fix things they break. It’s like being a parent of three dozen kids. But this is an investment, and it pays dividends.
 Dr. Pinkney agrees with me when I say I returned the favor to the college in a really meaningful way. In the process I gained a lot, too. When you do something like this, people take notice. When the word spread among my peers in the GKIC ecosystem and Infusionsoft ecosystem, two big and vibrant organizations of entrepreneurs and business owners (many potential clients for me), everyone wanted to admire the effort and make a contribution. Ryan Deiss contributed his entire vault of information products about digital marketing for ALL of my students. Dan Kennedy generously allowed one of my students to attend one of his private events at no charge. GKIC generously sent us thousands of dollars’ worth of
 resources and allowed my students to attend its Info-Summit[SM] and
 SuperConference[TM]. Infusionsoft offered free event tickets and free training. Several of my friends gave us access to their mastermind


-----

##### recordings and video trainings. Dr. Dustin Burleson shipped me every single resource for my students’ use.
 While we are touched by everyone’s generosity, this phenomenon also built an amazing ecosystem of friends, endorsers, tellers of our story, and referral partners. Today we have several dozen sources of referrals that feed us a steady stream of leads and warm introductions. I have built a reputation for being the “nice guy” who knows his stuff about design and implementation of complex, automated marketing and follow-up systems.

#### Three Ways to Encourage More Referrals from Customers and
 from Centers of Influence
##### First, it is useful to give people an interesting and inspiring story to tell. A lot of people find simple, straightforward referring awkward and uncomfortable, but everybody tells interesting stories they’ve discovered to others all the time.
 Second, as Dan Kennedy always says, you must provide good tools to your referral partners so it is easy for them to direct others to you, with a simple way for those referred to learn more about you. This works best when there is some immediate benefit to the referred person. The easiest way to create this is with information, and you’ve heard just about every contributor to this book talk about how they do this. In my case, I usually lead with my book website, a three-video informative course on how to use marketing automation for internal marketing, or a live webinar or an interview. When someone wants to promote me in technology or Infusionsoft circles, I use the Lifecycle Marketing Planner. The opt-in offer is a free copy of the book and the companion workbook (see Figure 10.1 on page 87).
 Third, it’s important to follow up courteously, diligently, and effectively with every new person sent your way. You never want anyone reporting to your referral source that they were ignored or neglected.
