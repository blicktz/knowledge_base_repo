###### this book. I drew from diverse and eclectic sources. Most importantly, I made myself very deliberate.
 Let me summarize the results of this for me. I became a star salesman, and I have literally sold my way through life. I became a professional speaker, paid to speak, earning upwards from $1 million a year from speaking engagements and seminars for many years, including nine consecutive years as one of only two permanent players on the largest seminar stages and tour America has ever seen, with audiences of 10,000 to 35,000, in sports arenas. By speaking, I fueled development of a company that has since sold twice and a spin-off of that company that has grown very large, all of which made me rich. I created a reputation and a personal brand that has stood me in good stead for four decades and permits my conducting all my business on my terms with enormous autonomy. I even became a much sought after and highly paid writer and crafter of sales presentations and scripts for speakers, for TV infomercials, for online sales videos and webcasts, and for presentations in other media. My fees and royalties routinely run from $100,000.00 to $250,000.00 for one of these projects.
 For all this, I have been self-educated, meaning no courses, instructors, mentors. Had I found something comparable to my co-author’s system for crafting presentations and his “incubator” where people come and craft great presentations with his team in a super-condensed time period, I believe I would have gotten to good, then great, and ultimately my greatest results much sooner, with a lot less time spent figuring it out. I was like Lewis and Clark making my way through wilderness and creating my own trail. They have a road map, templates, plug-’n’-play structure, and the experience of having helped hundreds of clients and thousands of students use their tools.
 If you don’t own one, I’m sure you’ve seen the whiz-bang juicers demonstrated on TV. Into one, the person puts a cantaloupe, a head of lettuce, a carrot, an apple, and a fish, and maybe a brick for good measure, and out the other end comes an incredibly condensed, nutrition-rich juice. That’s what Dustin Mathews and his partner Dave VanHoose have done with all the ingredients of effective presentations. He’s built a juicer. Further, he’s developed a community for people committed to success as presenters called Speaking Empire. Throughout this book, Dustin offers

 What I can tell you with absolute certainty is this: Willie Shakespeare got it nearly right. All the world’s a stage. Most people are merely players. Relatively few people are its masters. To them, the world hands over any bounty asked of it.
 In Willie’s day, the stage consisted only of the physical stage. Today, media is as much the main stage as is the physical environment—land, sea, office, and home. Being able to conceive and craft presentations for media, from four-minute videos to four-hour webcasts, from 140-character tweets to 4,000-word online sales letters, is now critically important. There are few captive audiences for anybody or anything, so knowing how to captivate and control an audience is of paramount importance.
 Powerful presentations and being able to present them have always been keys to extraordinary success, rising far above peers and competitors. Thomas Edison. Steve Jobs. Separated by a vast span of time but sharing these same two great differentiators.
 The foundation of success hasn’t changed: message, media, market, i.e., audience. The level of sophistication you can bring to this triangle keeps advancing and advancing and advancing. It’s really no place or time for amateurs. Make up your mind to be a pro.

### How To Be Fearless
 as a Presenter

###### by Dustin Mathews

 ince Dale Carnegie first brought “public speaking” front and center in the American consciousness in 1912—making executives and entrepreneurs aware that success or failure in their careers or businesses might hinge on their willingness and ability to stand up

# Sand speak to groups about their ideas—a somewhat surprising fact

###### has been verified and re-verified by poll after poll after poll: More people fear doing this than fear snakes, heights, debilitating illness, even death. I totally get this.
 When I first set foot on the campus of Florida State University, I was filled with optimism. It would only take a day before I was scared out of my mind. I discovered that, to graduate, I would have to take a course in public speaking.
 The minute I walked into that classroom, my fear intensified and my heart rate skyrocketed. The classroom was set up like a mini-stadium, with stacked rows of seats that seemed to rise into infinity. Just the roar of 300 students in pre-class conversations was enough to make me want to shut the door behind me—and run!


-----

###### I stayed, only to next hear the professor telling us we would each write and deliver ten different speeches over the course of the semester, some to the entire class of 300, some to smaller groups.
 I am a technical guy. In fact, I was in school to get a degree in computer science. Having to “perform” was not for me. I’d like to tell you I had the courage to stay put, but I slinked away. I hoped to find a smaller class or a less demanding professor. When the next semester rolled around, I found myself with no choice but to enroll in the class again. When I opened the door, I found the same stadium, the same 300, the same professor. I again made myself disappear.
 I next went to a lot of trouble to find a loophole. I found it by chasing a girl . . . right into an extracurricular class she was taking called Model United Nations. If you took that, you could exempt yourself from the requisite public speaking class. I didn’t get the girl, but I did graduate without ever having to stand up in front of those 300 other students and speak.
 Fast forward a few years . . . My business partner Dave VanHoose said, “Dustin, I’m not going to be able to give tonight’s presentation. You’re going to have to do it.” A lot of money was at stake. A commitment by our company. There was no loophole.
 I did what I had to do. And I experienced something amazing. I was a 20-year-old kid talking to older men and women with more life experience, about investing in foreclosure real estate, put forward as an expert. I realized that people looked at me differently just because I was standing up in front of them and speaking. I realized that just being on that stage and delivering my presentation completely changed my position with those people and their perception of me. It gave me instant authority and credibility, despite my age. I also experienced something else equally amazing. My sense of self changed. Stepping way outside my “comfort zone” and doing something I’d avoided for so long raised my confidence level about everything I was doing.

 Being able to build and deliver effective presentations has practical benefits—you can more efficiently sell whatever it is you sell or promote whatever business or professional practice you own, you

###### can speed up a business’s growth, you can use yourself as ad media —but it also has personal benefits.

 Most of our clients report very similar experiences. Whether or not they have already been speaking and making presentations, when they really understand and use the science of effective presentations, they not only get better results but also they feel better about themselves. Dan Kennedy says that “Competence Creates Confidence,” and that trying to mentally manufacture confidence without feeling knowledgeable and competent about it is nearly impossible. Fear is best erased by actually knowing what you are doing and why you are doing it as you are. It is easier to create calm confidence with a strong sense of having and following a reliable blueprint for what you are doing than by psychological and motivational tricks. You don’t have to trick yourself into temporary fearlessness about a journey to an unfamiliar destination if you possess a reliable map or GPS, and an equally reliable vehicle.
 Most people don’t know that there is a formula for creating and for delivering powerful presentations. Most of the fears surrounding speaking —whether to 10 in a boardroom, or 50 at a seminar to get patients or clients or customers for a small business, or 500 as an author or professional speaker—are basically fears of the unknown. My first goal for this book is to help you replace any fears you have about making presentations with a confidence based on formula and process. This is the result of years of helping executives, entrepreneurs, authors, representatives of charities, and others gain both the practical and personal benefits of stepping to the front of a room and confidently, capably delivering a powerful presentation, making sure that when you open the door at the back and see 300 people milling about, you won’t want to close the door behind you—and run!

##### CHAPTER 3

### Knowledge of Your Audience
 Is Power

###### by Dan Kennedy

 ike Dustin, early on, I was scared. Very early on, I also stuttered and had to fight to control that. I totally understand the impulse to flee. Like Dustin, early on, I started stepping to the fronts of rooms and giving presentations under duress—not by desire. Even

# Las I got good at it at one level, trepidation returned as I moved to

###### different levels. The first time I peered through a curtain into a basketball arena and saw 15,000 people there, soon to have me come out from behind that curtain, I briefly wondered if I was up to it. I subsequently appeared on that event tour over 230 times in as many as 27 cities a year for 9 consecutive years and never felt trepidation about it after those first few minutes. By then, I had—as arrogant as it may sound—mastered two kinds of knowledge-producing know-how that provided more than enough competence for more than enough confidence.
 One of those knowledge sets was the architecture for powerful presentations: the script. Its order, its language, its ebb and flow. The best mix of exposition, assertion, story, humor, and more. In this book, I’m leaving most of the discussion up to Dustin.


-----

###### The other set of knowledge I’d learned to acquire and use was Audience Knowledge.
 When a presentation lands a direct hit on an audience’s interests, beliefs, doubts, fears, hopes, ambitions, pre-existing ideas, pre-existing self-talk, its acceptance and enthusiasm for you as the presenter skyrockets and expands, and it is nearly impossible to fail. In fact, you are given more credit than your actual performance may deserve. When you know who the people in your audience are, what their lives are all about, what their daily experiences are, what their deepest-seated emotions are, you can make sure the presentation you assemble and deliver lands one direct hit after another after another. I previously mentioned President Trump. He is President largely because of this. He really, really, really knew his target audience, crafted presentations that landed direct hits, and delivered them with the confidence that comes out of that certain knowledge.
 What is a direct hit? It is an idea, assertion, single sentence, or single story that is precisely and exactly in sync with the audience hearing it. As an example, anytime I talk to entrepreneurs about being the lone polar bear in a forest of grizzlies, and then talk about their sense of isolation and loneliness, of being underappreciated and disrespected, of being negatively labeled (workaholic, greedy, evil 1%’er, etc.), I land a direct hit. When I first heard Zig Ziglar talk to “lowly” salespeople about being in “THE Proud Profession,” being the unsung heroes of the entire economy, the engine on which everything and everyone depended, and as improving lives for a living, I recognized he was landing a direct hit. I’ve borrowed that entire idea for my own presentation, books, newsletters, and dialogue with salespeople. When I first heard Trump roll out “Make America Great AGAIN,” I knew that—especially with that fourth word—he landed a very direct hit on the leading-edge boomer and senior audience that I wrote about extensively in my book No B.S. Guide to Marketing to Boomers and Seniors.
 My speaking colleague, the famous success philosopher Jim Rohn, actually made his main, generic presentation on personal development from his specific version of it for multilevel/network marketing distributors. That presentation landed direct hits with all audiences of salespeople and small- business people, particularly those struggling to get ahead and struggling


-----

###### with their own emotions and behaviors. Jim had them, as the cliché goes, eating out of the palm of his hand. Yet Jim was not the charismatic, super- forceful presenter that Trump was at his campaign rallies. Jim was a calmer, more cerebral, more thoughtful, somewhat professorial (but never condescending), paternal teacher. Jim was not “perfect” on stage either, as “perfect” might well have been insisted on in the college speech class Dustin avoided. Jim would even turn his back to his audiences to write and draw on a giant chalkboard or marker board. Jim was, however, every bit as effective as Trump in connecting because he deeply understood his audiences.
 I have my own somewhat odd “style” for being on stage and delivering presentations. It would likely have gotten me a big, red “F” in that college speaking class. It works for me. But what makes it work, or maybe allows for it to work, is my deep and thorough understanding of my audiences. For 40 years, I’ve gone out of my way to create and deliver presentations to audiences I am certain I have intimate understanding of. I believe I can recite for you, verbatim, the late night, kitchen table conversation that occurs in their homes, when one can’t sleep and comes downstairs and the other notices his or her absence from the marital bed and follows. I believe I can recite for you, verbatim, that person’s major, recurring conversations with himself that he has as he drives his car to and from work.
 From about 1979 to 1983, I spoke to a lot of chiropractic and dental groups. Some of these doctors who first saw and heard me then, in small groups of 30 to 100, or on a few occasions at large events of 1,000 to 3,000, are still with me today, as newsletter subscribers, members of the GKIC organization (http://GKIC.com), and even attending seminars where I speak —34 to 38 years later! It’s important to understand I am not and never was a chiropractor or a dentist, never worked in any capacity in such practices, and cannot adjust your back or drill your tooth. But by my presentations to these audiences alone, I have generated at least $20 million in direct revenue, plus countless lifelong customers of considerable value. For these same audiences/markets, I have written and developed presentations for 18 different clients who all sell various goods and services, and these, combined, have generated much more revenue. One such presentation is the genesis of a $30-million-per-year business, likely worth at least $150


-----

###### million if and when it is sold. How is all this possible without having been a DC or DDS?
 You don’t have to be one of a particular population in order to develop thorough knowledge about that population, how they think, what they feel, and what they truly, deeply want. I am assured there are even men who have developed this level of knowledge about women and that there are women who have done so about men. I’ve never met such an expert, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. First of all, a certain amount of human nature, psychology, and reactive behavior is either hardwired or deeply embedded in early childhood, by about age ten. This is universal, to all groups, and can be used in embedding “triggers” into presentations that audiences can’t resist responding to. Then, second, there are basic questions to ask and know answers to about any target market or audience, for any advertising, marketing, persuasion, or influence effort, regardless of how it is to be done. You’ll find this “magic list” (Figure 3.1) below. Finally, third, there is the sense of a group to be gained by reading what they read, hanging out where they hang out, talking, listening, or playing anthropologist. For instance, a weekend at a boat show will give you a lot of knowledge about boating enthusiasts. From all this comes Audience Knowledge.

###### When I peered through that curtain at those 30,000 eyeballs and 30,000 ears, I reminded myself that the presentation I was going to walk out there and deliver was finely crafted and honed by Audience Knowledge. Out there were (mostly) small business and Main Street, brick-and-mortar business owners, more entrepreneurial businesspeople, people from direct- selling companies, and salespeople attached to very diverse products and services—but all having the same late-night kitchen table conversations. I had a presentation certain to land direct hits. With that Audience Knowledge as the foundation of my presentation, I could not fail.
