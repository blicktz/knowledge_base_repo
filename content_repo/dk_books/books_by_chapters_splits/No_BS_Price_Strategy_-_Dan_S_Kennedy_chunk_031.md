**4. Kids’ Health Spectator. This is the FREE that Jason uses universally; past and present clients**
and prospective clients who opt-in free, online, or through advertising, receive this promotional and
informational newsletter monthly. Giving this FREE in no way de-values any services or products
that are being sold. Each issue has the same basic component parts: a seasonal or topical front-page
article, a different condition-specific article about a particular child development problem,
recognition of clients who’ve referred (providing reminder and reassuring evidence that clients
refer), positioning of Isa Marrs, and direction to websites for more information. As you can see, this
is an information-heavy approach, with the purpose described above in #1 in mind.

## An Offer from Jason Marrs for readers of No B.S. Price Strategy

Dear Friend,

Hopefully, reading this book has convinced you: there’s no better way to break free of
“average” income and the sense of daily grind it produces than increasing your business’
profits, and no better way to do that than by successfully increasing your prices. If you are
ready for a thorough, in-depth, well-organized, foolproof SYSTEM for doing just that,
then you’ll be thrilled with my Simple Pricing System. It is the only pricing system
developed for entrepreneurs by an entrepreneur (not by bean-counters). It goes beyond
introducing and presenting different strategies as this book has done, to taking you stepby-step through the development of a pricing system custom built for your business.
Essentially it is collaboration between you and I. Your use of this System is backed by a
365-day, complete satisfaction guarantee. To learn the details and discover how this
System can give you more profit from the same effort, simply visit:

**[www.SimpleStrategicPricingSystem.com](http://www.simplestrategicpricingsystem.com/)**

While there, you can pick up a really cool bonus, just for stopping by! I’m not going to
tell you what it is and take the surprise away. You’ll have to go to the site to find out what
it is. You can thank me later.

This is your opportunity to follow through on the interests that brought you this far, to
and through this book, and actually engineer and implement improved price and profit
strategy customized for your business.

Offer subject to change without notice.
