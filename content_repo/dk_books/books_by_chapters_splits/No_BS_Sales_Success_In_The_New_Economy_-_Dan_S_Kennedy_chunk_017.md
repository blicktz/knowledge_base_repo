## When I sell my audio learning systems that have to do with advertising and marketing, as well as Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] Memberships, I often include “critique coupons” that entitle the person to send me their ads, brochures, or sales letters for analysis of what they’ve done effectively and what could be done better. This is called a “second opinion consultation,” for which I usually charge from several hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the complexity of the piece being reviewed. It is easy to make the case that each of these coupons has a minimum value of $100.00. With a learning system that I sell at many seminars for $278.00, I might include three coupons, so the customer gets $300.00 of added value with a $278.00 purchase. (A voided sample of such a coupon is shown at the end of this chapter, Figure 10.2. It cannot be used and is here for example purposes only.)
 Interestingly, many sales professionals give away certain services that have real value, but that they do not quantify and present as added value. Others err in giving away “unlimited” service, which can’t then be quantified and value. If I tell you that you can send in material anytime all year as often as you like for critique, that has no value, because you don’t know how much you’ll use and it is vague. But if I give you three $100.00- value service certificates, we can agree on that as $300.00 of value. Ironically, the three is a more limited offer than the open-ended, yet in selling, it is more persuasive.
 Many sales pros have more than one opportunity to add to the value argument by formalizing, quantifying, and placing values on services they routinely include.

# Creating Added Value at Nominal Cost

## One of the best benefits provided by the internet is unlimited “library space” at virtually zero cost. Gold and Diamond Level Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle[™] Members have access codes for different restricted-access websites, each inventoried with different archives including past issues of the NO B.S. MARKETING LETTER and other newsletters, transcripts of my interviews with top advertising, marketing, and sales experts, articles, a different “encore” audio program each month, and other resources, many with a searchable index, as well as online communities for networking with other Members. This expands and grows more valuable every month. It is significant added value to Members, yet costs nearly nothing to provide.
 Many businesses can and do use this idea. In my Membership, that I know of, there are attorneys, CPAs, chiropractors, ad specialty salespeople, insurance sales professionals, brokers, a manufacturer supplying the pharmaceutical industry, and dozens of others, each providing useful collections of information only to their customers through restricted access websites.
 You can also create added value through premiums, guarantees and warranties, special services, frequent-user rebates, club memberships—turn your imagination loose and find an opportunity that matches your particular business. Added value allows you to make your “core” goods or services “free.”
