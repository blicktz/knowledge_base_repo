This was a Critical Day In My Life. I sat down and thought about what had just happened—and how it was certainly a “dirty little secret” among many of my other patients, and other chiropractors’ patients from coast to coast. Maybe you’ve heard the author and speaker Jim Rohn talk about “the day that turned his life around.” This was such a day for me. It liberated me, from being slave to what I thought others could or would pay, and emboldened me to charge what I was worth—and work for no less.

 Break Free of “Fairness”

#### A lot of the authors, speakers, and teachers of “prosperity” in the metaphysical community are far from prosperous themselves. Over the years, quite a few have privately confessed their lack of financial success to me, and expressed puzzlement over it. Typically, the conversation has to do with their idea of “justice.” They believe that because they do “good work” they deserve to be wealthy and that wealth should occur. There are also a lot of these people who perpetually beat themselves up, with the idea that their lack of financial success is about them somehow not deserving it, so they need to work on themselves, to be a more deserving person. While a sense of deserving is critically important to wealth attraction, there’s a much bigger mental and emotional block stopping the flow of wealth to many .
 One of the leading companies teaching negotiation skills to corporate executives, Charles Karrass’s company, has had this as its slogan for many years:

-----

#### “You don’t get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate.”

#### The metaphysical opposite of this is: “I’m just not using the mental principles well enough. If I just think more positively, [keyword: just] things will turn around.”
 If you compare the two ideas, you’ll see that the metaphysical version puts the responsibility for what will happen “out there.” Things will turn around. Not that you will turn things around. It’s a difference between passive and active. The statement about negotiation puts the responsibility for outcomes on you. And it acknowledges a very important fact: The marketplace does not function on fairness. If that were true, top talent would always win out; we know it does not. The safest wager in the world is that, somewhere, there are starving artists with infinitely more talent than Thomas Kincade or Robert Wyland. Doubt it? Ask any starving artists about Kincade! Somewhere, there are starving writers with infinitely more talent than James Patterson or Stephen King. During the nine years that I was one of only two fixtures on the biggest, most successful public seminar tour in America, visiting 25 to 27 cities a year, drawing 10,000 to 35,000 people to each event, and being paid over a million dollars a year, countless professional speakers struggling just to pay their bills puzzled aloud, to others behind my back, some to my face, how this could be—clearly I was not as “good” a speaker as they were or as many others were. And I cheerfully acknowledged they were right about that. I have never been insulted by it. I have sometimes been sympathetic, sometimes amused with their befuddlement and frustration. They just couldn’t grasp that money does not move from one place or person to another simply and purely because of fairness. Talent can attract wealth, but superior talent alone very rarely does. Instead, there is a combination of magnetic forces put to work by those who most successfully attract wealth, notably those described in this book. Responsibility is a very powerful wealth attractant.
 To rewrite the Karrass statement, I would say: You don’t get what you (inherently) deserve. You get what you deliberately and intentionally attract not only by who you are but also by what you think, say, do, and get others

#### to do. By the situations, circumstances, contacts, relationships, and opportunities you engineer.
 Being an exceptionally talented person alone is not sufficient. Being a moral, spiritual, “good,” deserving person alone is just not sufficient. In a purely fair marketplace, it might be. But it isn’t. In many ways, The New Economy is even harsher in its rejection of those who feel entitled by virtue or talent or some similar attribute, because consumers have so many more choices in every category, so much more media vying for their attention, so much more competition by creative, aggressive, determined, and persistent entrepreneurs and marketers who do accept full and complete responsibility for their outcomes. On the other hand, The New Economy offers greater opportunity than ever for those who “get it.”
 Ultimately, as always, the way the majority thinks about money is wrong. Thinking that virtue or talent or superior product quality or service entitles you to success is fantastical and foolish.
 An extension of this sort of thinking is the surprisingly popular argument that the 9/11 attack was our fault, in whole or part, because we have so much and other countries have so little and because we have an immoral society. Our collective ability to attract wealth somehow justifies others’ evil toward us. So if we were just more moral and more generous, we wouldn’t deserve what happened to us on 9/11 and it never would have happened. Therefore, we should close the Defense Department and take all that money and divide it up between the less-fortunate people in all these other countries, and we should spend it on churches and moral education in this country, and we wouldn’t need a Defense Department. If we’re just “better people,” we’ll be more deserving of peace and tranquility and security, and we’ll have it. This idea is championed by fools. If you want to philosophically fantasize that this is the way the world should work, that’s fine. But don’t suggest it’s the way the world does work.

#### “Rules such as ‘if I hold positive thoughts about prosperity, money will just start pouring into my life’ are just too simplistic to work ... money exists in the physical domain. Money doesn’t come as the result of thoughts in the metaphysical realm; it comes as the result of actions in the physical domain.”

#### Money has no moral conscience. It finds its way into the hands of pornographers just as it does Bible publishers. And I mean no disrespect to either. Trying to impose your opinions of “good” and “bad,” “moral” and “immoral,” “deserving” and “undeserving” onto money is even more futile than trying to impose them on people.
 Money moves based on non-judgmental market forces, not morality. The difficult truth is: Being a good person, being a better person, being an exceptionally talented person, making or selling the better or even best product, or delivering the finest service does not automatically entitle you to wealth nor does it do anything to directly strengthen your wealth attraction. If you think that you should be financially rewarded because you are honest, hard-working, and kind to old people and pets, you’re in for a very disappointing life. If you think God should intervene with the lotto on your behalf because you volunteer at the soup kitchen, you’ll wind up disliking God. And clinging to these Pollyannaish, erroneous beliefs stands in the way of wealth moving to you.
 If you want to easily attract a lot of money, you have to come to grips with what money is and isn’t, the very nature of money, the energy of money, and how money moves about from one home to another.
 Money doesn’t have a conscience. It’s paper. That’s all it is. It’s just paper. It’s not significantly different than the paper that’s in your book. It’s green and it’s got some kind of woven crap in it so that, theoretically, we can’t counterfeit it. But it’s paper. It doesn’t know if you’re a priest or a pornographer. Look, it’s paper. That’s all it is. Nothing less. It’s just paper.

#### It doesn’t have a conscience, it doesn’t know what you are, doesn’t know what you do, doesn’t care. It just moves around. That’s all.
 If money or the movement of money functioned on conscience, there never could be a Bernie Madoff, not even for a week let alone two decades. There couldn’t have been a Jessie James or a John Dillinger. The money would stop before it got to them. It would put on the brakes. It would speak. It would say, “Wait a minute! You’re doing something we don’t approve of. We’re not coming into your hands.” The stuff would work like Matrix movie stuff. “Stop! Go back!” And you wouldn’t be able to get it. But it doesn’t do that.
 Money has its own, different definition of “fairness.” It moves to those who do the things that are magnetic to it. If you put a powerful magnet on the tool bench of a good man or a tool bench of a bad man, metal filings will still be drawn across the bench to the magnet. That’s its fairness: simple, basic, primal cause and effect.

 I was recently reviewing a transcript of Jim Rohn’s speech from a Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ SuperConference and caught the most concise explanation yet of why so many people go through life disappointed about money, envious and resentful of others’ prosperity, mystified by others they view of lesser credentials or ability doing so much better than they are; and why all liberal or socialist redistribution of wealth fails so miserably. Rohn said, “Money does not go to need.” A lot of people think it should, and that’s why they are so frustrated. Money does not accept your ideas of its moral responsibility or of justice, and cannot be governed by them. So it is not attracted by or to need. The fact that you need more customers, sales, or profits to meet payroll or stay in business

#### or send your kids to college or retire is of no interest to money, is unattractive to money, on many levels, even repellant to it. Anyone who focuses on their need attracts more need. Every attempt to force money to go and live with the needy fails; the money crawls out the window in dark of night and escapes.

 That doesn’t mean you should be a pornographer. I’m not suggesting that. It doesn’t mean you should run a Ponzi scheme. I’m not suggesting that. In fact, there are very pragmatic arguments for honesty and integrity, and choosing to produce and market products and services that enrich and improve peoples’ lives, and for developing whatever talent you may have and whatever skills you can acquire to their highest and best levels. What I’m suggesting is you’ve got to get out of your head that by not doing “bad” things and by doing things that are “good,” that alone attracts and multiplies. It doesn’t. It may make your next life a better deal. You may be in a cool place instead of a warm place. You may not come back as a toad. Whatever your belief system is about afterlife, it may have impact there. But here and now, there are cause-and-effect principles of wealth attraction completely separated from virtue.
 Forget the entire idea of entitlement. Focus on engineering —on engineering a situation for yourself that weaves together all the magnetic forces that influence the movement of money and puts them to work on your behalf.

## Wealth Magnet 4

 Accepting Your Role and Responsibilities

#### O h, you’re an entrepreneur? Greedy bastard! Surely you know that’s what some people think about you, say about you behind your back.
 A successful entrepreneur drives down the street in his Rolls-Royce or builds his mansion. If not to his face, behind his back, many grumble about his greed. But if they hit the mega-millions lottery they might very well do the same things—most lottery winners do. It’s not a moral objection to greed they’re expressing. It’s the sin of envy.
 Too often, achievement, accomplishment, ambition is defined as greed. Here’s my clarification: greed is attempting to get something for nothing, to take without exchange .
 Is getting the most money possible for the goods or services you deliver greed or intelligence? Is it greed or ambition? Are you a better person if you voluntarily get less money than you could for the goods or the services you deliver? No—in fact, you are derelict in your duty as business owner. You have a duty to yourself, your family, your investors or partners or

-----

#### shareholders, your lenders, your vendors, and your customers, and that responsibility is to attain the absolute highest and greatest profits possible, so you can stay in business successfully to honor every commitment to every one of these constituencies. To settle for anything less than the most is absolute dereliction of the responsibility of business ownership and leadership. To settle for anything less is to leave your business vulnerable, possibly fragile. And you should be fired.
 Now, here’s my question for you: what is your entrepreneurial responsibility? What is the entrepreneur’s responsibility? What must you do in order to deserve and earn your place on the planet? Your success, prosperity, security, wealth?
 A lot of people think your purpose, your responsibility in life is to provide jobs. You see that reflected in the communities that are busily trying to pass laws and, in some cases, communities and states suing companies to keep them from moving or closing; because their responsibility is to provide jobs to the community.
 Is your responsibility to provide jobs? I hope you don’t think so. If providing jobs makes your business successful, if adding jobs makes it more successful, that’s terrific. But if operating the business with fewer employees makes it more profitable, then it is your sworn responsibility as its captain to operate it with fewer employees.
 A lot of people think your responsibility is to pay taxes. Personally, I’d be a little happier with my gigantic income tax bill if the IRS sent me pictures, maybe of citizens of the foreign countries we support and of welfare recipients here in the United States; like when you send money to the starving orphan organization and you get the photograph and a letter once in a while about how they’re doing. I think every taxpayer should get some of those and have people assigned to them. So for your money, you get a picture of 17 people in Iraq or Afghanistan or Gooblesedyburg where we’re building roads and schools and providing food—which we do even for the populations of countries openly hostile to us, like North Korea—and of 4 welfare recipients and 1 retired guy, maybe from GM, so you can put photos of all the people you’re supporting up on the refrigerator. And they should all have to write you notes every once in a while, to let you know how they’re doing. I’d feel better. Wouldn’t you?
 You have a legal responsibility to pay the minimum taxes required of you.
