_THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES_ **BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN** **DOYLE rime**

Vampires are needy, thirsty, selfish, vicious creatures who, given an opportunity, will suck up all of your
time and energy, leaving you white, weak, and debilitated.
Once they have found a good meal, they start coming back every day—so,

even though you regenerate yourself with a meal, a
night's sleep, and a vial of vitamins, it's to no avail; they will be
waiting for you tomorrow just where they left you yesterday,
eager to once again suck every ounce of life from your veins.
Being able to recognize these vampires on sight is the first step in
protecting yourself from them. Being willing to deal with them as
you would a vile, evil, blood-sucking creature of the dark is the
first step in freeing yourself from them.

Maybe the most insidious of all the Time Vampires is Mr. Have-You-Got-a-Minute?

He lurks in the shadows in the hall
outside your office, near the elevator, near the cafeteria, in the
bushes next to the parking lot, wherever it is possible to catch
you off guard. If you give in to him a few times, he becomes
emboldened and starts "dropping in" to your office or home. He
disarms you with "Have you got a minute?" or "I just need a
couple minutes of your time" or "I just have one quick question."
He has a unique knack of pulling this stunt right when you are
in the middle of doing something incredibly important—getting
mentally prepared for a most important phone call, or at some
similar moment. If you are in his vicinity all day, he'll also "drop
by" a dozen times a day—each time needing "just a minute."
Each time he drops by, picture him sinking his teeth into your
neck and sucking out a pint or two. That IS the effect he has.

The temptation to give in to this particular vampire is almost
irresistible. First of all, it just seems easier to deal with his "one
quick question" immediately than to put him off and have it
hanging over you for later. Second, it feels rude and unreasonable
to refuse him. But the truth is, he deserves no courtesy whatsoever.
He is telling you that your time is less valuable than his, that
whatever you are doing is unimportant and easily interrupted.
He is, in street jargon, dissing you to the max. So, go ahead and
stick a stake through his heart without a moment's remorse.

Here's the stake.

_I'm busy right now._
_Let's meet at 4:00 P.M. for 15 minutes,_
_and tackle everything on your list at one time._

This stops this bloodthirsty vampire in his tracks. Freezes
him, like a deer in headlights. Next, it "teaches" this vampire a

discipline. Of course, he won't get it the first time. Or the second.

He'll keep trying for a while. But if you whip out this s.ime
stake every time, over and over again, and jam it firmly I
li rough his chest, eventually he will get the message. Someday,
he'll call you and say something like: "I have five things I need
to go over with you. When can we get together?" After you pick yourself

up off the floor, you can congratulate yourself on having defanged

and housebroken a vampire.

###### "They're in a Meeting" The
next most dangerous Time Vampire is Mr. Meeting. Some
people seem to do nothing but attend meetings. Just as I was finishing this book, a client of mine dragged me into a 20-minute,four-person

conference call to discuss when we could have the
next, longer conference call to plan a meeting. Geez.

Being in meetings is seductive. It is a way to feel important.
It's also a great way to hide from making and taking responsibil-ity

for decisions. Meetingitis is a disease that turns businesses into
unproductive, indecisive, slow-moving coffee klatches. (The two
toughest CEO's I know hold only "stand-up meetings." No
chairs.)

According to a study published in Corporate Meetings
_Magazine in the late 1990s when I wrote the first edition of this_
book, people were spending an average of 20 to 40 hours per
month in meetings, an increase over previous years. The average
time spent in meetings by managers was 1.7 hours per day, and
executives spent 50% of their time in meetings. Those surveyed
said that the most productive meetings lasted under an hour, but
most meetings lasted two hours or longer. It is my observation
that this situation has only worsened, year after year. Even

way to handle this? A conference call? A memo circulated
to each person? Heck, a posting on a bulletin board. Or an
Internet site. An e-mail. Hey, anything BUT another meeting.

If you are going to hold a meeting, there are several stakes
you can use to stop the vampires from making it an endless
"blood klatch." (Time Vampires love meetings, because a bunch
of blood-rich victims gather in one place at one time. It's like a
buffet.)

1. Set the meeting for immediately before lunch or at the end
of the day, so the vampires are eager to get it done and
over with, turn into bats, and fly out of there.
2. Don't serve refreshments.
3. Circulate a written agenda in advance.
4. Have and communicate a clear, achievable objective for
the meeting.

This refreshment thing's a big tip, by the way. My friend
Dave Petito, a great TV infomercial producer, and I both used to
get paid to attend meetings for the same company. These took

place at the firm's palatial Beverly Hills office or sometimes its
CEO's home. Either place, the table was laden end to end with a
fabulous array of food. Bagels, five flavors of cream cheese,
salmon, imported cheeses, sandwich meats, croissants, muffins,
cookies. Really good grub. Added at least an hour or more to
every meeting—after all, you can't advise with your mouthful.
This company has long since gone out of business. I wonder why.

If you must attend a meeting, you also have some stakes
available so you can slay Mr. Meeting. 1.

Determine in advance what information you are to contribute,
then do it with a prepared, minimum-time, maximumimpact presentation.
2. Have an exit strategy: someone coming in to get you at a
certain time, a pre-arranged call on your cell phone, whatever. You can then excuse yourself only long enough to
make a call and return if you need to—but you probably
won't.

###### Playing Trivial Pursuit
Another Time Vampire to watch out for is Mr. Trivia. He either
can't or doesn't want to differentiate between the important and
unimportant, minor and major.

This vampire's talent is getting others off track, getting you
to set aside your carefully organized list of priorities in favor of his—and,

more often than not, his agenda will be of minimal
importance. Mr. Trivia will interrupt to tell you just about anything, ranging from the building being on fire to the office supply store having delivered blue pens instead of black pens.
Usually it'll be the latter.

The best way to deal with this one is to drop a big silver cross
around his neck and kick him off the parapet of your castle. But
failing the opportunity of doing that, you need another stake—
this one is to interrupt the interrupter:

_I have an exceptionally busy day, so I am only dealing with_
_9s and 10s on a 1-10 scale. Everything else MUST wait until_
_tomorrow._

_Are you convinced that what you want to talk to me about_
_is a 9 or 10?_

He will say, "No, but—" and then you must again rudely
interrupt him: "No buts. Thanks. We'll get to it tomorrow." Then
physically get away. (If he's in YOUR office, you leave.)

He will be offended. Good. The odds of him holding the trivial matter over until tomorrow and bringing it back to you are
less than 50-50. He'll go sink his teeth into somebody else's
throat. Or maybe even resolve it on his own. But he won't patiently
wait until tomorrow.

###### Oh Boy, It's Soap Opera Time!
Have you ever watched soap opera diva Susan Lucci overact?
Someone can walk into a room and say, "Ronald has just been
murdered and is lying outside on the lawn with a giant metal
pink flamingo stuck through his chest," or walk in and say, "It's
raining outside," and get the same massive reaction: crying, sobbing, pulling hair, chest heaving, body twisting, overacting. Well,
some people are just like Susan in real life. They turn everything
into an emotional crisis. They react to everything emotionally.
They magnify everything's importance. And if you're not careful,

**they'll pull you right into the drama. When they do,** visualize 1

HEM sticking in the TV and taking out a quart.
The other problem with these particular vampires is that, at
**the very least, they make you give up your time to attempt to put**
**them back together emotionally. They guilt you into giving them**
your shoulder to cry on. And while they're resting their head on
your shoulder, they're sticking their teeth into your neck.

Some people have the amazing ability to turn every molehill Into

a mountain. If you happen to have some of these overreac-live,

emotionally wrought weepers in your organization, get rid
of them if you can. If you can't do that, then, personally, stay .lvvay

from them. There are two ways to drive them away.

1. Cut to the core of their problem (which is usually glaringly
obvious) and tell them what to do. This is not what they
want. They don't want solutions; they want soap opera.
Spoil their fun and they'll go looking for blood elsewhere.
2. Take over the conversation by launching into a long, boring, pointless story; say: "That reminds me of a time when
my Uncle Harold was in the dust bowl during the great
Depression. This story will help you. Here goes!" In other
words, turn into a vampire yourself and start sucking.

###### Are There Other Time Vampires?
There are almost as many different varieties of Time Vampires as
there are birds or butterflies. Your productivity multiplies as you
get better and better skilled at spotting them and driving stakes
through their hearts.

Ask yourself if you're doing something now to invite the
time vampires in for a feast. If so, stop doing it.

**_How I Stupidly Put Out the Welcome Mat for the Time_**

**_Vampires and Let Them Suck Me Dry_**
In an article I read in some business magazine, a story was told
of how a brave CEO, in one of his first acts as president of a medical center, yanked his office door from its hinges and suspended
it from the lobby ceiling to demonstrate his commitment to an
open-door policy This was applauded by the magazine as some
giant act of courage and creativity. I chuckled when I read this.
This guy has my sympathy. To the management theorists who
get all wet and excited when they hear this sort of thing, I say: c'mon

out into the real world, where they eat their young every
day, and try this yourself. You won't last a week.

This tactic is nothing new or revolutionary or innovative.
Heck, I made that same mistake about 20 years ago.

Right after I took the helm of a barely afloat manufacturing
company, I pried the office door off the hinges, nailed it to the
wall sideways, and proclaimed that, from now on, the president's office had a true "open-door policy." High drama.
Incredible stupidity. Dan

###### Kennedy's #ZNo B.S. Tim* Truth

Time Vampires will suck as much blood out of you

as you permit. If you're drained dry at day's end,

it's your fault.

All day long, an endless parade of Time Vampires. Suck,
suck, suck. By the end of the day, my neck looked like a pincushion. I was whiter than typing paper. Almost transparent. Slumped

over my desk, not even enough energy left to sit
upright. Eyes glazed over. Breathing shallow. I'm telling you, I

hey just lined up, marched in, and happily took turns siphoning

5:00 P.M. I put out the vampire welcome mat, and they took
me up on the invitation. My fault, of course.

This sort of thing looks just great on paper. Unfortunately, a
lot of ideas—like this one—is put on paper by goofball authors (!)
who haven't a lick of real-world experience, have their butts safely
parked on a bucolic college campus somewhere, and have a ball
dreaming up clever-sounding psychobabble buzzwords and hot,
new management theories to baffle and bedazzle us with. Well,
