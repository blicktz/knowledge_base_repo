##### instead of as a favor to you. Yes, you want to thank them for agreeing to be featured and be gracious about the time they spend doing it. However, a big deal should be made upfront about their accomplishment. Even though it is helping you, this is about THEM and shining the spotlight on them. For example, “Mary, you did such an incredible job converting your loft into a princess playroom for your daughters, I was wondering if you’d be willing to be featured in my catalog?” Or “Tom, I know our readers will love hearing how you were able to retire at the age of 45. Would you be willing to be featured in my newsletter and give our readers some tips?”
 Once they’ve agreed, it is important to be well prepared for your interview. Details matter and affluents value their time. Don’t be late. Prepare well-thought-out questions ahead of time. (I recommend sending the questions in advance for the client to review.) Do your research. Be organized so you don’t waste their time. Ask the client hero you are featuring to use examples and anecdotes to tell their story. This helps the reader to visualize and can even fire up imagination and emotion. During the interview, guide the conversation to meet your objective, but if you uncover something really good, keep going down that path, even if it wasn’t the original story you had in mind.
 Last year I interviewed a business owner for No B.S. Marketing Letter. Originally the story was going to be focused on copywriting strategies he’d used. However, when we got into the interview, I uncovered that he had overcome some huge fears and had never dreamed he’d even start a business. He attributed this to Dan Kennedy’s guidance. His life had been so totally transformed on every level. It was inspiring and so the focus of the story became about his overcoming his fears to build a successful business with the copywriting tips being the secondary objective.
 I also recommend recording the call (always ask first) so you can accurately quote the client in your client hero story.

 Writing Your Client Hero Story If you think about your favorite books and movies, the ones that you can’t pull yourself away from, they start with a problem. This is especially compelling when there is some question as to whether your hero can overcome the problem.


-----

##### Your Hero’s Struggle This is where you’ll start your story, by introducing your hero and their problem. When introducing your hero, your affluent readers need to see themselves and say, “That is me!” Including descriptive words after your hero’s name will help readers identify with them. For example, John Smith, a retiree; Tom Johnson, an art collector; Judy Walsh, an entrepreneur, and so on.
 The best stories have conflict. Describing the struggle the hero had is a vital part of the story. This is what will hook people in and make them want to continue reading to see how the hero solves the problem. This is worth spending extra time to get it right.

 Your Hero’s Solution The next part of the story gets into how your hero found a solution (your product or service) and how this guided them to success. As you tell the story you want to keep a few things in mind:

 1. Keep your objective and your target reader in mind as you write. 2. Include elements that make your hero likable and relatable. 3. Transparency is important. It demonstrates credibility that gives
 consumers confidence in purchasing from you. Don’t be afraid to include details that show your hero as human. Tony confesses he didn’t open the program for six months after he bought it … After losing 25 pounds and keeping it off for 6 months, Mary gained back 10 pounds at the holidays. However, she re-engaged with the program and has since lost the 10 pounds plus 5 more! 4. This part of the story should paint you, your product, and/or your
 service as the guide and give a plan or ideas for the reader to follow.

 Your Hero’s Transformation Ultimately you want to wrap up the story with the transformation of your hero. This will show how he or she was successful because of purchasing from you. Rather than making it a boring, facts-only conclusion (i.e., John’s


-----

##### business doubled), paint a picture of what the reader can experience when they follow in your hero’s footsteps.
 For example, “John’s business doubled the first year and is now growing 25% per year. He and his wife were able to move into their dream home overlooking a lake and surrounded by mountains. Working just six hours a week, they now go snowboarding three times a week instead of three times per season and never worry about having enough time or money to do the things they enjoy most. Last year, they took off two months to travel to Africa where they sponsored and helped build a school in a small town.”
 Storytelling is perhaps the best way to hit an emotional chord with your customers and won’t make them bored. Stories are easier to remember with greater accuracy too. And when you make your best affluent customers, clients, or patients the hero of your story, you’ll make them feel valued, recognized, and rewarded, which will make them more loyal, and more likely to share their experience with others, referring you more often to their friends. Not to mention, they’ll spend more money with you. Plus, by leveraging their stories, you’ll increase trust in your brand and create a tipping point for affluent prospects to make a purchase from you. Attracting more affluent clients, customers, or patients to your business can mean higher income from a smaller number of customers, which gives you more time to spend doing things you love.

##### How Brad & Morgan Robinson Are Replacing Their Marriage Counseling Practice Income and Making Up to 733% Higher Fees in
 One of the Poorest States in the Country

##### charging $75.00 per hour, Brad was depressed trying to make a go of his new practice. To help Brad focus more time on money-generating activities, his wife, Morgan, quit her job in career counseling to concentrate on marketing the business.

 Now in two locations with six staff, in one of the poorest states in the country, where the average marriage therapist charges around $60.00 per hour, Brad is charging (and receiving) $235.00 to $500.00 per hour. When someone comes in for a retreat, Brad makes more in one day than he used to in a month. And while most therapists have to work in the evenings, Brad works 9:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M., takes an hour for lunch, and only sees three couples per day.

 Here’s how they did it.

 Figure Out Who Your Best Customers Are

 Marriage counseling isn’t covered by insurance, it’s covered by cash. After hearing Dan Kennedy talk about the importance of figuring out who your top customers are, the Robinsons observed that small-business owners were their best clients because of their schedule flexibility, ability to pay large sums, and willingness to travel to see them. The Robinsons did surveys and figured out how long their best clients had been married, how many kids they had, if they’d been in counseling before, and so on. Brad says, “We’ve really nailed down and figured out who they are so that we can give them more of what they want. And figuring out who they are has also allowed us to charge more.”

 They also experimented with price and the length of sessions. Focusing on fewer clients, they extended the sessions and raised the price from $175.00 per session to $350.00 per session. Brad is as busy as ever. “We’ve gone after this market more unabashedly … and there’s more price elasticity there because we know who that person is.”

 Add Info-Marketing to Your Brick and Mortar Business

 Brad says a “light bulb moment” for him was hearing Dan Kennedy say that to be successful as a coach or consultant, you must have an info


-----

##### business on the front end.

 The Robinsons say adding the information business in front (first through a blog and now through their podcast) has made them celebrities in their ideal prospects’ eyes and preconditioned people to want to work with them by creating trust and making them the go-to counseling service. Brad says, “Sometimes they just want to meet me because I’ve helped them so much. They may come in for a day or two, but they’re really just wanting to meet the guy that helped them through such a difficult time. They don’t know you and then all of a sudden they’re going to give you $5,000.00? That’s really tough. That information business was really key.”

 The Robinsons also sell a program called “The Smart Couple’s Academy” for $997.00 that helps couples to heal their relationship from home after big issues like infidelity, communication, trust, and intimacy.

 Through testing, they discovered they needed to do more indoctrination to sell their program. Their current sequence is to attract people to the podcast. From the podcast, they send them free downloads, which bring prospects to paid downloads that invite them to a webinar that sells their Academy.

 Establish Yourself as the Expert

 In the therapy community, they don’t niche. “They’ll say they do one thing, but they don’t. They still do 50 things. So that’s where we are really, really different. We do one thing and we do that one thing very well … and I think that’s a big difference in what sets us apart,” says Morgan.

 Brad specifically focuses on helping couples with communication, trust, intimacy, or infidelity. He says, “I am a true-blue expert in what I do, and that’s because I’ve niched down and really thought deeply about the issues that I deal with on a day-to-day basis, and I teach the public.”


-----

##### They’ve found by focusing on a narrow niche, adding value through the information they put out to prospects before someone even meets them, and positioning Brad as a celebrity, anyone who can afford Brad’s services will choose him above anyone else, even traveling to see him.

 Brad established expertise through blogging, his podcast, writing articles, creating online classes, master classes, and webinars. Their podcast, which teaches their program, “Here’s How to Heal Broken Trust A to Z” (found on https://.healingbrokentrust.com), has helped tens of thousands of people in 144 different countries.

 They do email marketing and use social media too, primarily Facebook that pushes to Twitter, and are starting to do more with Linkedln. This year they will also release their first book and are doing more nationally by getting in front of more media to do interviews with magazines, TV, and radio. Plus, because they niched so tightly, the Robinsons know their audience intimately, allowing them to craft a highly targeted message that resonates extremely well with their audience.

 Brad says by the time people meet him, “they’re already gushing and they’re already happy. They already have the hope that they can turn their marriage around. And that’s a big part of the battle, just convincing people that they can do it. If you get to work with the expert, they’re already pre-disposed to having that hope and that confidence and anticipation that they’re going to see things turn around.”

 Build Your Social Proof

 The Robinsons built in an opportunity for people to share the results of their counseling experience on their podcast. Also, because they can’t ask clients to write a review, they do public speaking and ask people to write a review about their talk. “We’re the best-reviewed marriage counseling practice in the whole Midwest,” says Brad.

 Following the principles of marketing to the affluent has changed the Robinsons life on many levels. Brad no longer worries about having enough clients or income. After working three jobs all through high

##### school and college just to make ends meet, Morgan for the first time in her life doesn’t need to work; however, she enjoys the marketing so much that she spends time in the evening working when her son is asleep. Growing up poor where there were days when Morgan didn’t get to eat, the young couple is enjoying the freedom and ability to do things such as take their two-year-old to Disney World (three times already). An unexpected bonus has been the ability to choose and afford experts to help them with issues they face, such as when an expert in women’s reproductive cancer treatment removed a tumor on Morgan’s uterus, saving her chances of having a family. “I’ve found you really do need to continue focusing on being an expert, continue doing the one thing that you’re really good at because it does change people’s lives,” Morgan says.

#### CHAPTER 27

### You Need to Choose Your Words Carefully

##### “Some things a king never has to say: ‘Can I play too?’. ‘Hey guys,
 wait for me.’ … ‘I never seem to get laid.’”

—GEORGE CARLIN

# On marketing or selling to the affluent, language matters more than in
##### most other selling situations.
 By far, one of the most interesting uses and values of precisely chosen language is what I call romancing the stone, giving rather ordinary products the kind of elite cachet that creates differentiation, competitive edge, and support for premium pricing out of thin air.


-----

##### I would like you to read three different product descriptions from a J. Peterman catalog and see what common strategies—and odd strategies— are in play. We’ll discuss them after you read them.

 Sample 1 Gatsby was amazing. He even managed to see to it that the book about him was regarded as a novel, fiction, as though he didn’t exist. Even Fitzgerald, by the time he was through writing it, believed he’d made the whole thing up. There were those who knew the truth all along, of course; knew everything except where all that money came from. (Even by today’s standards, when millions mean nothing, only billions matter, Gatsby was incomprehensibly rich.) Gatsby walked into rooms wearing a shirt with no collar. Even a little thing like that made people talk. And probably will still make them talk. The Gatsby shirt, of course, has no collar. Only a simple collar band. The placket is simpler also: narrower. (Gatsby had them made in France, originally.) The cotton we have used in our uncompromising replica of Gatsby’s shirt is so luminous, in and of itself, that even a person who notices nothing will notice something. Gatsby, of course, could afford stacks of these shirts; rooms of them. Never mind. All that matters is that you have one, just one. A piece of how things were.

 Sample 2 Fame isn’t gradual; one moment you’re comfortably obscure; the next you can’t buy a cantaloupe without navigating through a thicket of fans and well-wishers. Without consulting you, people will choose a photograph; it will appear in all the documentaries, all the newspaper articles, all the books written by or about you. It will become more than you. Forever. Churchill understood. He decided what he wanted that image to portray ten years before that famous “spontaneous” photo was snapped. What image do you want to leave for posterity? The Irish Tweed Vest …

 Sample 3 New York Subway strike of the late ’70s. Bank presidents start wearing sneakers to work. JFK goes hatless at his inauguration. Good-bye hats.

##### Steve McQueen, Sean Connery, Bill Holden discard ties in favor of turtlenecks. Some of it is progress. Now, marooned for a week in Paris or Osaka, this turtleneck sweater will keep you or me well dressed. Relaxed, but just a little dressy. (Both at the same time.) 55% silk, 45% cashmere. Pretty seductive stuff. Warm, but not heavy, not bulky. Beautifully detailed and finished. Sleek 7” high ribbed turtleneck. Set in sleeves. Good with blazers, old tweedy jackets, slacks, jeans. People expect to see a Walther PPK strapped over it, so you don’t even need to bother.

 The Gatsby shirt sells for $89.00. There are 104 words before the product is referred to! This violates every known rule of mail-order catalog or direct-response copywriting. One of the reasons for such a violation— nearly universal throughout every Peterman catalog—is the who he is selling to: affluent consumers with above-average educations, who wish to perceive themselves as sophisticates, as well as, of course, to a great degree, his own “Peterman cultists.” What is even more important to see here is what he is actually selling—and it is not a shirt. Here is that same block of copy again, with boldfaced type to make what is really being sold leap out at you, rather than gently permeate the subconscious, as was intended by delivering it wrapped in the story.
