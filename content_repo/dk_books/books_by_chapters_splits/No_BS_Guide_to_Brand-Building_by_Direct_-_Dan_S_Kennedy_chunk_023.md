###### runs frequently in Variety. It is an ad for a car saleswoman. I do not know her and I have no idea how well the ad performs, or if she knows, and since it is a branding ad and not a direct-response ad, it’s likely she doesn’t. I plucked the ad to critique here, as I sometimes do ads for my five newsletters. It has no copyright, and heck, maybe you’ll like it, you live in Hollywood, and you’ll buy a car. She looks like a nice lady, and I can help her here, free of charge.

**FIGURE 15.1**

###### Variety is read by lots of affluent, image-conscious actors, producers, and agents who need to make a good impression with everything they do, including the car they drive. Advertising here could be very good Place Strategy, and she is the only advertiser in her category, so she’s practicing my favorite Place Strategy: Show Up Alone. Kudos for all that. She’s reaching the kind of customers who want to deal with super-successful people, so her noting at the top of the ad that she is the number-one BMW


-----

###### salesperson since 1999 is a smart proclamation. Visually, the ad is eye- catching and artful. You won’t be able to see it as well in this copy on uncoated book paper, as the original is on the slick magazine paper, but there the blue sky looks real, the words “Pleasure In The Job Puts Perfection In The Work” from Aristotle are transparent, so the sky is seen behind them yet they are perfectly legible. The car is sleek and shiny. Neda looks good. She’s dressed in a navy blue or black business suit that fits her perfectly, there’s just a hint of sexiness, nice smile. The ID in the lower left corner is in white against the steel blue-grey of the road surface. The whole thing looks terrific. It speaks of class and luxury.
 This is the kind of personal brand ads you see a lot of real estate agents, financial advisors, cosmetic surgeons, and other professionals often pour money into—which I strongly discourage. They are fine as far as they go, and this one is an excellent example of such a brand ad. But they do not specifically invite you to do anything. This is like meeting her at a cocktail party, being introduced, having her tell you she is the number-one BMW salesperson, then abruptly spinning on her heel and walking away or, if you ask her a question, standing there mute. Or, a better analogy, since we are in sales, is having her knock on your door, introduce herself as the number- one BMW salesperson, spin, and walk away.
 The other problem is that this lovely lady is paying this ad to show up in Variety for her, but not requiring it to prove it is earning its cost. To her credit, she hasn’t loaded it up with Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter doorways to make accountability impossible. She’s offered only two ways to respond, both direct, and she can obviously ask prospects where they heard of her. Still, there’s a lot of room for leakage. And if she’s running the same ad in multiple places, it gets murkier.
 But the big, big, big flaw is that this ad only gets immediate response from buy-now customers. It does nothing and offers nothing for the many more who she has intrigued, who are just beginning to think about a new car, who plan to start shopping for a new car when their next residual check comes in. They are left loose, in the hope that imbedding her brand in their minds will be enough 4, 8, 10, 20 weeks later when they are ready to get new wheels. She has paid for those eyeballs to look at this ad, but she has no idea how many or who they are, and can do nothing to build trust and interest with them between now and the time they will actually buy a car.

###### Don’t waste eyeballs you pay for.

##### Three Ways to Fix this Ad

###### The least aggressive option does absolutely zero damage to the branding or to the luxury image this ad conveys. We are not going to plunk a big red- and-white cardboard bucket of chicken down on the silver platter on the pure silk tablecloth in the mansion dining room. I’m not going to replace her elegant suit with a red, yellow, and white circus clown outfit and stick a red bulb nose on her. She does not need to commit image suicide. The ad can be shrunk vertically just a tiny bit, just enough to fit a line or two of direct-response copy, black or even grey on white at its bottom. It can be in a discreet and elegant typeface like this:

 By adding these two offers, we create what’s called Secondary Reason For Response. We give the person not ready right now to buy a car a reason to respond now anyway. To understand what to do with them when they arrive and how to place them in a good sales funnel, consult Chapter 30 of my No B.S. Marketing to the Affluent book, including the funnel diagram. Here, these points: One, Neda still gets the buy-now customers who call her or email her, but she also gets names, at least email addresses, and for the second offer, full addresses of not-ready-now potential buyers that she can continue communicating with directly.
 Again, I haven’t harmed the beauty of her main presentation in the slightest. Her personal brand is unscathed.
 A more aggressive option would be to add a promise/benefit headline to the top or/and place a small testimonial from a famous Hollywood figure in the dead lower right corner AND add the same lead-generation offers I added above.


-----

###### The most aggressive option would be to replace the entire ad with a black on white, article-look mini advertorial, matching the content typeface of the magazine, actually saying something. That headline might be “The #1 BMW Salesperson In The USA Since 1999 Announces Openings For Seven Hollywood/Beverly Hills Area Clients In Her Exclusive Private Client Group.” The article would end with a direct call to action, to call or email her for Private Client details, a test drive, and a gift of fine wine with the test drive, and it would still have the Secondary Reason For Response Offers as well.
 I doubt I’d ever convince Neda to buy this third option. I’d be seen as an uncouth beast. But maybe I can persuade you?

##### How to Accelerate Brand-Building Speed and Buy More
 Brand-Building Power

###### Let’s assume that one of the above three methods results in the sale of, on average, one more car per month than she presently sells via this ad. Let’s assume that equates to a few thousand dollars of commission income. What might Neda do with the money? She could go shopping on Rodeo Drive, but I’ll bet her closet’s already full. So, she could use it to buy a bigger ad. And if that upped sales yet again, she could go all the way up to a full page, cut in half vertically or horizontally, with a big image ad like hers in half its space and a constantly changing advertorial like I suggested in the other half of the space. With this much bigger presence, she’d be impossible not to notice and remember, and her brand would dominate faster, with more people.
 That’s how direct-response can build a brand, bigger, stronger, faster. He or she who spends the most, the most wisely, does win. But few can spend the most out-of-pocket. By ramping up the proceeds of direct response, someone can spend more and more and more in more places or more often and achieve ultimate brand domination with a market.
 Another way to think about this is to envision the paid-for but wasted eyeballs in the eye sockets of not-ready-now prospects who get away and later buy a car from someone else as dead weight your advertising budget has to haul around on its back. The dead weight grows heavier every time


-----

###### the ad runs. Soon it brings the ad budget to its knees. Our ad budget moves slower and more laboriously, bent over and crippled. If we liberate it and lift off the dead weight and convert the dead weight to energy drinks the ad budget consumes as it goes along, it can grow bigger and stronger, stand taller, and move faster. You decide whether or not to load it down with dead weight or to liberate it and power it up with your decisions about brand/image-only versus brand/image-with-direct response or direct response with brand/image, Secondary Reason For Response, and a good follow-up sales funnel.

## Your Brand Is Your Story:

### How to Build Your Brand and Your Business by StorySelling™

###### by Nick Nanton and J.W. Dicks, Celebrity Branding
 Agency


###### he marketing director of one of the biggest fast-food chains in the world had a problem on his hands. His biggest competitive advantage was probably that his food was a whole lot healthier than

# T

###### his rivals’—but his research was pretty clear that promoting that advantage wasn’t going to do a whole lot for the chain’s sales.
 He knew he could go out there with all sorts of statistics and health information and make the case—but, those numbers and facts would just bore consumers, who only considered stopping in at one of his eateries for a quick meal when they were short on either money or time, or possibly both.
 That meant the marketing director wasn’t particularly excited when a Chicago franchisee found out about some guy who dropped a lot of pounds


-----

###### by only eating their food and took the story to the chain’s ad agency. Again, they weren’t promoting themselves as the fast-food equivalent of Jenny Craig or anything like that, so what good would that do? Not only that, but this kind of campaign could get the company in legal hot water. Their lawyers were warning that they could be in for a ton of liability lawsuits should they make any kind of health claims or promises.
 The ad agency was insistent that this was a great idea, however. They put together a legal disclaimer that the lawyers could live with. So the marketing director finally sighed and agreed to try a regional test campaign.
 Jared Fogle, a guy who lost 245 pounds eating the exact same Subway sandwich every day for months, appeared in his first commercial on January 1st, 2000—and the next thing he knew Oprah was booking him on her show. The marketing director was astounded by the instant success of the campaign, and it was soon rolled out nationally.
 During the next ten years, Subway’s sales doubled, the chain moved up from being the number-four fast-food franchise (after McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s) to become number three (displacing Wendy’s), and Jared became a minor celebrity.
 Not only that, but every time Subway tried to dump Jared from advertising, their sales suffered. The first time, in 2005, sales immediately fell by 10%. Jared’s story was now Subway’s—and it made them billions of dollars in the process.
 The success of the Jared campaign is surely based on the premise of our first book, Celebrity Branding You: “People Buy People.” When you effectively promote a real, living, breathing human being that people can connect with, as opposed to dry facts, the audience is going to be a lot more responsive just because of that “human touch.”
 And when you combine that personality with a compelling story, you’ve hit a marketing home run.
 That’s just what Subway did with Jared, who’s a perfect example of the potential StorySelling™ holds for a business. He crystallized for consumers what ordinary nutritional information could never have accomplished: He provided an authentic story that visually demonstrated the benefit of eating at Subway (as long as, of course, you took it easy on the mayo, bacon, and cheese!).


-----

###### But why was Jared necessary to make that kind of impact? Why couldn’t simple and verifiable health facts deliver the same message—and, in turn, motivate the same rise of sales?
 For that answer, we have to examine the power of stories—and how that power could dramatically increase your branding and sales success.

##### Storytelling: It Never Goes Out of Style

###### Cave drawings were the first way we came up with to tell a story. Those later evolved into hieroglyphics in ancient Egypt. Of course, you can only tell so much with pictures—and it can be a real drag having to sketch everything out. That’s why, around 3,000 E1F. the Sumerian tribes in southern Mesopotamia developed the first primitive writing, which they called “cuneiform.” Suddenly stories could be written in more detail—and that eliminated the guesswork involved in trying to figure out what those scrawls on those walls were trying to say.
 Of course, most people back then couldn’t read or write, which is why most stories were spread by simple word-of-mouth. This created a “survival of the fittest” process where the best stories ended up having an abnormally long shelf life, even though they only existed in oral form.
 For example, around 500 E1F., a fellow named Aesop was walking around delivering a great many memorable “fables”—stories that always had a moral lesson (or, as we call it today, a “takeaway”). It wasn’t until 300 years later, after its author was long dead and buried, that Aesop’s Fables were actually written down and distributed.
 The fact, however, remained that these and other powerful stories refused to die. There was something meaningful about them that motivated people to not only spread these stories far and wide, but also to hand them down to their children, and their children’s children.
 That’s how the Bible came to be, of course; hundreds of years of oral storytelling finally resulted in holy men putting these tales together in the Old and New Testaments. The Bible also became the centerpiece of the next phase of storytelling, when Johannes Gutenberg created what we know as the modern printing press. Of course, it’s not so modern anymore due to computers.


-----

###### Which brings us to the 20th century, where we saw the most rapid and transformational change in storytelling. What we now know as “Old Media” was brand-new then—movies, radio, and TV were suddenly able to tell us stories in new and exciting ways. And, of course, the 21st century has brought even more incredible storytelling tools, through the explosion of “New Media”—online video, social media, blogs, websites, and more.
 Stories are more important to us than ever. An effective narrative, even if it’s found in a simple YouTube video, can quickly go viral throughout the world—indicating the public is feverishly searching for great stories more than at any other time in history. Aesop, if he were around today, would no doubt have his own Tumblr blogsite that would attract millions (especially if his fables featured the Kardashian family instead of turtles and birds).


**DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: In my field, success education, there have been two**
enduring stories so powerful that they refuse to die, and are told and retold by so many so
often that they have kept books first published in 1937 and 1960, respectively, thriving to this
day. The stories are what are called Origin Stories, and they are attached to Napoleon Hill and
the book _Think And Grow Rich and Dr. Maxwell Maltz and_ _Psycho-Cybernetics, which I_
updated in a co-authored edition, _The New Psycho-Cybernetics. In the health field, the_
example Nick and Jack just presented of Jared probably trumps all others, although you would
also have to include the Charles Atlas story of “the bully who kicked sand in the face of the
90-pound weakling.” Both are Transformation Stories. The best-known business Origin Story
may be Disney’s. Every business or product category, interest category, or field has at least
several of these stories that never die and hold their value and influence over years, decades,
generations. These are the stories to study as you craft your own.


##### This Is Your Brain on Stories: Why We’re Addicted

###### The question remains—why do we like stories so much? Actually, change that, because we don’t just like stories—we love them.
 Literally. Researchers at the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont
 Graduate University, in Claremont, California[1], discovered that stories activate the oxytocin hormone in our brains—this is actually called “the love hormone” by the scientific community. That’s because it’s associated with romantic attachment, human bonding . . . and yes, sex.
