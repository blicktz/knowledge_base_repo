• What is unique about my product?
 • What is unique about my delivery?
 • What is unique about my service?
 • What industry norms does my company bend or break?
 • What is unique about my personality?
 • What is my story?
 • Who or what are my “enemies”?
 • What is unique about my best customers?


-----

###### Your very first priority as you embark on social media marketing is to get laser focused on what sets you apart. What makes you unique in your industry?
 If you cannot come up with very clear answers to these questions, you’re going to need to make some changes to your business. Period. This is crucial. This is foundational.
 Take a long, hard look at your answers and then ask yourself, “How can I incorporate this uniqueness into my marketing? How can I exploit it? How can I use it in every marketing piece I produce?” Then do it. Take action. Implement. Today.

##### CHAPTER 4

### It’s Not All About You.

## Or Is It?

#### The Most Powerful Marketing Tactic (per Google)

###### by Dan Kennedy An age-old copywriting secret is to “enter the conversation already happening in your prospect’s mind.” One of the easiest ways to do this is to look at what everyone is talking about.
 According to USA Today, Google reported the top three trending searches for 2014 were for Robin Williams following his passing, Kim Kardashian’s wedding to Kanye West, and Jared Leto.
 Yahoo! reported the top obsessions for 2013 included Miley Cyrus “twerking,” Duck Dynasty, the casting of Fifty Shades of Grey, and The Walking Dead.
 According to Business Insider, Google reported the top three trending searches for 2018 were for the World Cup, Avicii following his passing, and Mac Miller, also following his passing.[1]
 BestLife reports the top three biggest pop culture obsessions of 2018 featured the Black Panther movie, the Royal Wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and Beyoncé, as the first female headliner at the famous Coachella music festival.[2]
 The popularity of these searches indicates what is on your prospect’s mind. Obviously, they are celebrity-related. People love celebrities. They’re obsessed with them. A single celebrity death will often trump media


-----

###### coverage over anything else, even if the reality of other news is far more staggering.
 People are fascinated by celebrities, and that trend isn’t going to change. It’s only growing. And, inexplicably, people confuse celebrity with credibility.
 This is good news for smart marketers. Every year billions of dollars are spent on celebrity endorsements. People will buy whatever celebrities eat, drink, wear, and drive. They want to know what celebrities do, and where they shop, live, and do business. Tap into celebrity and you have access to the most powerful marketing force available.
 It’s easier than you think. If you do business on a local level, it’s relatively easy and inexpensive to become a local celebrity. If you do business nationally but in a niche market, it’s also relatively inexpensive.
 Make yourself famous by writing articles and books, giving lectures, and being active in industry and community affairs. Feature yourself in your advertising, videos, webinars, and social media networks. Get interviewed on radio and TV, and post the files on your website.
 It’s worth noting that, these days, the lines between PR, public relations, and paid, commercial advertising as a means of creating celebrity status are blurred.
 When entertainment TV reporter Leeza Gibbons interviewed and profiled motivational speaker Tony Robbins in an infomercial, was that as good as being on the TV show Entertainment Tonight? Yes. In some respects it was even better—because this suggests strategy.
 If you could get three-time NFL Super Bowl Champion Emmitt Smith to appear in one of your ads, do you think it would get more attention than an ad without a celebrity?
 Using advertorials in newspapers and magazines, paid radio and/or TV time, self-published books, and social media networks, you can do the same thing once only accomplished through publicity and public relations. Not to mention you can exert complete control over the process, unlike live interviews where you are at the host’s mercy.
 Whether you hire celebrity endorsers or transform yourself into a celebrity, you want to create a connection between your product and


-----

###### service. Celebrity is undeniably one of the most powerful tools in your marketing toolbox.
 This draws attention, enhances the buying decision, and increases the loyalty of your consumers. Plus it increases credibility.
 One of the smartest moves you can make is to capitalize on the growing trend of celebrity fascination. Build your own celebrity, or connect with others to form an association between them and your business.

#### How to Create Celebrity Status and Why You
 Should

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Three minutes.
 That’s exactly how long it took for Kylie Jenner’s makeup line to sell on its release.
 Its incredible popularity allowed the young “mogul” to be reported by Money magazine as the youngest “self-made” billionaire in the world.
 And while you might argue that she had a little help, you can’t argue that it was the most successful makeup launch of all time. Because unlike other makeup lines, Kylie had celebrity status and a massive following.
 Of course, this phenomenon goes beyond the Kardashians. Early in my career, I did a lot of work in the Palm Beach/Miami Luxury and Celebrity Market. From launching the Nat King Cole Generation Hope foundation, to planning the event and PR for the restaurant opening of Top Chef contestant Stephen Asprinio, to running events for Dine magazine, where celebrities and pseudo-celebrities would sometimes drop by (and there was a whole lot of glam, but little else), I worked with people who valued being “seen” over being “heard.” (See Figure 4.1 on page 53.)
 And even before Facebook existed, before everyone had a camera on their phone, people were making sure to get their photos taken with the celebrities as much as possible. Just being near these famous people somehow made them more famous.
 It’s how a lot of organizations, concerts, and galas make more money with VIP and upgraded ticket events today. They offer the chance to have your photo taken with the celebrity.


-----

###### Like it or not, the people have spoken. And they love celebrity. The good news is, you can leverage this to your advantage. Big time. Let’s fast-forward to today and focus on you. There is something better than rubbing shoulders with a celebrity: being a celebrity yourself.

-----

###### No longer do you need to get on the front page of The New York Times to launch your book, product, service, or company. No longer do you need to get a spot on the Today Show or win a big award to dominate your market.
 Note to The New York Times: If you want to put this book on your cover, I’ll take it.

###### Now, with simple brand positioning, you can turn yourself into the authority and expert in your market. This allows you to increase your attraction to your perfect prospect, decrease the time needed to close a sale, and increase the amount of money you receive from each customer.

 Turn Yourself into a Celebrity Using Facebook to Increase Your Sales
 DETERMINE YOUR UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION What makes you different from your competitors, and how can you leverage that in your marketing?
 My distinction is that I am not just a social media expert, I also empower entrepreneurs to lean into their superpowers so they can grow their businesses profitably and have a company and life that they love. I share this fact often because the more you tell your audience what your story is, the more they will share it with others.
 Creating a following, developing a relationship, and staying in touch— before you make an offer or try to sell something—puts you in a can’t-lose position. Your audience knows, likes/loves, and trusts you. They are ready to buy. In fact, they ask to buy something.
 So, when do you start? Weeks before your launch? Days? Like the old proverb says, “The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago; the second best time is today.”
 The best time to grow your audience is right now. No matter what else you have going on, have planned, or hope to do, you should grow your audience. It is the most important asset of your business. More important than your product, program, or service. Seriously.
 You can always update your program. You can even change your product. But you can’t go back in time and grow an audience.
 It is one of the things I am most thankful for in our company that we have in place. Having an audience has allowed me to land book deals with cash advances and launch to best-selling status. It allows us to win affiliate contests that bring in extra cash, and it gives us the ability to launch new products, programs, and services to sales right away without having to waste thousands in advertising.
 Recently, we launched our new RISE magazine, and in one day, sold thousands of dollars in subscriptions (see Figure 4.2 on page 56). That


-----

###### never would have happened if we tried promoting our magazine on Facebook to people who didn’t know us. Never. Would. Have. Happened.
 We have also come in the top ten for multiple affiliate launches, competing against the “big dawgs,” like Eben Pagan, Brian Tracy, Jeff Walker, and the like. Because I’ve grown my list and keep in touch with them, and continually give them value, when I recommend something (which I only do when it rocks, of course), they listen, take action, and sign up.
 And my favorite thing: We’ve been able to launch two successful masterminds in the past year with the most amazing entrepreneurs I’ve ever met (see Figure 4.3 on page 57). Working with them is literally my favorite thing I do for work. And this is only possible because of building an audience first. Nurturing them. Giving them value. Taking good care of them because they trust me and that is what is called for me to do.
 The future of business lies in the list, in the relationship you build with your audience, and the value you give them. Not in the transaction of the sale.

###### The more value you give, the more value you get from your business. Thankfully, it is easy to create a celebrity-worthy spotlight that sets you up as the superstar of your niche, attracts the perfect prospect, and gets you paid more each time.
 Start with these steps …

###### Mastermind

 1. GET A PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOT When I see someone using a selfie as their headshot photo, it instantly screams, “I am not the expert.” It is unprofessional and gives off the immediate wrong impression. I mean, selfie? Really?
 We have a total of nine seconds to grab someone’s attention and to make an impression.
 If you take into consideration how quickly someone can scroll through their newsfeed, the time is cut in half. What do you want your picture to say about you? What do you want your prospects, clients/customers/patients, and future employees to think of you when they see your photo?
 Get a professional photo taken. And do it when you are at your best. Wear tailored, pressed clothing. Get your hair and makeup done with an on-site stylist (for men and women). I am blessed to have a go-to “make me


-----

###### look my best” team, but you can easily find someone who can come to you via Thumbtack, Priv, Glamsquad, or even WeddingWire.
 This isn’t about changing your look. This is about looking like the best you, and for that, I leave it to the professionals.

 2. HAVE YOUR COVER PHOTOS PROFESSIONALLY DESIGNED Trying to piecemeal together a good look for your Cover Photo with Canva or Word Swag is not easy, and while I used to teach that you should try to do this yourself, I’ve changed my tune. I’ve seen too many DIY cover photos that look terrible. Most people just don’t have an innate eye for design, so it is 100% worth it to hire a professional to do this for you. Check out Upwork.com or Design Pickle if you are looking for ongoing design support. And while you’re at it, have them design a cover photo for all your social media platforms.

 3. PUT OUT EXPERT CONTENT Spend one half-day a month to create your content for that month, and you can leverage it over and over again.
 First, pick a theme for the month, and then write four blog posts to support it.

 • Set goals.
 • Develop a monthly theme that supports your sales goals.
 • Create weekly subtopics that fit in each monthly theme.
 • Develop supporting content.

 Example for IT Services:

 • Set goals: Sell Cyber Security Audits
 • Develop a monthly theme that supports your sales goals: How To
 Protect Yourself From Being Hacked
 • Create weekly subtopics that fit in each monthly theme: Is your email
 being sold on the dark web? Mistakes Employees Make, Policies to Prevent Being Hacked, and Hacking Case Study
 • Develop supporting content: write blog series and newsletter articles


-----

###### 4. SPREAD THE WORD Now that you’ve gotten your “pretty” on with your profile pic and cover photo, and written and edited your expert content, it is time to spread the word about your fabulous self. For each of those blogs …

 1. Write posts promoting the articles and run them on all your social
 media platforms (see Figure 4.4).

**FIGURE 4.4: Facebook Post Promoting Articles**

###### 2. Turn them into a Facebook Live video that links to the blog (see
 Figure 4.5).

**FIGURE 4.5: Facebook Live Video Linking to a Blog**


-----

###### This is the incredible way to get a lot of free promotion for your post. In fact, Facebook gives you 6x more reach with Facebook Live than other posts. (As in free advertising!) 3. Get repeat use of all your posts! Use an automated posting program
 like MeetEdgar to recirculate your content and continue to reach your market. This way, every article you ever write can continue to reach your new prime prospects over and over again.

 5. HAVE GOOD PEOPLE Pull in your “team” to help (after all, celebrities have “people,” don’t they?). There are great resources on sites like www.HireMyMom.com, www.Upwork.com, Fancyhands.com, and www.textbroker.com to get your posts written, images designed, and your posts scheduled for you.
 Ready to walk the red carpet to prospecting success? Then make sure all your networks reflect your brand. Most important, stay consistent. Becoming the celebrity of your niche is not a once-and-done tactic. But playing the long game can reap big rewards.
 Say cheese.

##### CHAPTER 5

### What Is Your Niche?

#### Niche Marketing

###### by Dan Kennedy There are riches in niches for your small-business marketing.
 The first official international convention of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas was held in Branson, Missouri, attended by over 300 professional Santas with real beards (a niche within the Santa niche!), plus some Mrs. Santas and a few nebbishy elves horning in on the fun.
 I was at a National Speakers Association convention in the late ’70s not much bigger than this. Now NSA has 5,000+ members and is the trade association of that industry. And with local chapters around the world, and more getting going, GKIC is an international association of a size to be reckoned with.
 Each of these associations and all others (there are thousands) represents a lucrative niche market for somebody.
 After he failed to gain the support of his employer, James Perez-Foster, a former partner at Bainbridge Advisors, left his job to focus on the Hispanic market. He saw an underserved market with a lot of potential and wanted to focus on this target market.
 He started Solera National Bank, which is dedicated to serving Colorado’s growing population of Hispanic and minority-owned businesses.
 According to a study done by ShareThis, U.S. Latinos are:

 • five times more likely to share content vs. non-Hispanics,
 • twice as likely to click on shared content vs. non-Hispanics,


-----

###### • twice as likely to purchase the products they share vs. non-Hispanics,
 and
 • have four times the brand loyalty of non-Hispanics.

 The point: In every market/business, there are specialty opportunities. Find yours.
