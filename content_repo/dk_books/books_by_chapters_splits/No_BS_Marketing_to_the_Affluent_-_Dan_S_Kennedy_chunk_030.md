##### restaurant tabs at least six times a month i.e., 1.5 times a week, and nearly 10% ka-chinged ten or more times a month.
 From about 2009 to 2015, the industry segments experienced very different trajectories.
 A late 2013 report in Nation’s Restaurant News revealed a troublesome, overall trend: People who were dining out multiple times every week and the larger number dining out multiple times every month were not only cutting back to, respectively, once a week or once a month, but also reducing their spending when doing so. Their research forecast a furtherance of the trend. Significantly, while overarching the entire industry, this reduction in frequency and check size was most concentrated in the middle. Darden Restaurants is a poster boy for this difficulty. In 2014, it got its Red Lobster® chain sold at a fire sale price, after many months of trying, and its Olive Garden® chain was wounded, limping, and scaring investors —so much so that one of its biggest investors created their own 300-page memorandum of cost cutting and other recommendations, leaked to the media. It included a demand that the chain’s “endless breadsticks” be ended, or at least tamped down by serving only one breadstick in place of a basket and waiting for a customer to request another. Darden’s value has since crawled back up, but fragility remains. The mid-level restaurants have the highest labor cost-to-sales ratio, tight margins, intense competition, loss of customers who trade down, and are most directly affected by the shrinking middle class I thoroughly described in Chapter 1. The enormous boom for the mid-level, fast casual restaurants came to a screeching halt, revealing overbuilding and saturation, resulting in quite a few in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, many others teetering.
 In the fourth quarter of 2017, on the shareholder conference call, the CEO of Applebee’s and IHOP and other restaurants proclaimed theirs a company in transition, returning to growth. But a few months later, one of the largest Applebee’s franchisees filed for bankruptcy protection. The entire conglomerate posted losses of $324 million for the year.
 The bottom of this food chain, also harmed and hurting. McDonald’s® same store sales year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter were down, leading up to this writing. The category in which McDonalds®, Burger King®, Taco Bell®, KFC®, etc., live has sacrificed price, transaction size, and profit margin just to keep all the doors open and the volume steady. The “$1


-----

##### Menu,” the “$5 Meal,” and very aggressive promotional offers have taken control of this category, to their shared detriment.
 Upscale, fine-dining chains and independents live on their own island. Some bled a little during the 2008 financial apocalypse, but nowhere near the extent of those in the middle and low groups. Many are doing quite well now. This teaches a lot about where you want to position your business, whether a restaurant or not. The least dramatic fluctuations of patronage, price, and profit are toward the top.
 As a restaurant moves up, from anybody and everybody, to mass- affluent, to affluent clientele—targeted by its marketing and served by design of its product—price becomes less and less of a factor in customers’ decisions about repeat and even frequent patronage. I listened during a staff meeting at an upscale restaurant as the manager explained, “We do not have specials. Denny’s® has specials. We have chef’s features.” And that sums it up. While the lure of low price for a lot of bulk or price- or discount-driven specials is significantly important to the Denny’s® customer and is of some importance to the Applebee’s® or Outback Steakhouse® customer, it is of near zero importance to the Fleming’s® steakhouse customer.
 The same applies to foods delivered to the home. If you compare Omaha Steaks® marketing to Allen Brothers® marketing, you’ll see that Omaha, catering to the mass-affluent, relies heavily on sales, special offers, and discounts, while Allen Brothers, selling to the more affluent, relies much less on price-related marketing. Virtually all the newer, quasi dotcom, prepared meal delivery companies priced to the middle-income consumer are burning through venture capital and losing money with abandon.
 While there appears to be fierce competition in the restaurant industry, it is more about each restaurant finding its market. Certainly the higher up the food chain one moves, pardon the pun, the easier it is to carve out and control a unique segment of the market. And the less competition there is.
 Finally, there’s a difference between a convenience restaurant and a destination restaurant. Fast-food, low-priced, and mid-priced restaurants marketing to mass-affluent and down tend to live or die by convenience to their customers. For fast-food outlets, location—even side of the street— traffic patterns, and population density are of enormous importance. This makes them vulnerable to shifts in such things, and, although you don’t think of McDonald’s®, Burger King®, Arby’s®, and so on failing, there are


-----

##### surprisingly large numbers of such stores that do close their doors every year, usually having to incur costs of relocation to follow the customers’ movements. Better restaurants marketing to mass-affluent and up are only about 50% dependent on convenience and can successfully draw from a bigger radius around their location, as customers who like that particular restaurant will drive farther to patronize it. Upscale restaurants and upscale and unique restaurants are destinations, so convenience can be virtually nonexistent, and they can still draw maximum crowds every night. Affluent customers are, according to a Food, Beverage, and Hospitality Survey of the Affluent, four times more likely than non-affluent consumers to drive farther than 40-minute round-trips to patronize a restaurant of choice. This is important to many kinds of businesses: As a big thumb rule, the higher the customer affluence, the larger the radius around the business from which customers can be obtained.

You have your own personalized entertainment programming, in an iPad®, which is yours to keep. (The crass word “bonus” is never said, but this is a gift with purchase.) There are several different routings each through several countries, with unique experiences in each place—like attending elephant polo in Jaipur, complimented by cocktails, fireworks, and a military bagpiper band. The fee is $9,950.00 (not $10,000.00) per person, double occupancy required —singles pay a $9,950.00 surcharge. This includes the aforementioned iPad® gift and $250,000.00 in emergency medical and evacuation (!) insurance.

##### Money Spent on Travel Travel was the number-one category for spending in the Ipsos Affluent Survey with a 25% increase in spending on travel in 2016. In 2016, $215 billion was spent in the travel industry, with affluents spending 56% of all travel dollars. Ipsos found that luxury consumers are moving away from spending on things and moving more and more towards experiential. 91% have passports. Almost half took a cruise in the last three years. 92% do research before they travel. 66% say that travel publications and TV programs inspire them to seek out new experiences. They also segmented the affluent travelers as follows:

 Affluent Jetsetters. The wealthiest segment, they have a household income (HI) of $175,000.00, have the highest financial resources, and spend the most. 31% are owners/partners in their own business. Forty-four percent are C-Suiters, with gender split at 65% male and 35% female. Twenty-seven percent hail from the West Coast. Eighty-seven percent are married, while 54% have kids. They are highly engaged, frequent business and vacation travelers, with particular interest in foreign destinations. They stay in upscale accommodations and may have traveled on a private jet in the past year. One hundred percent traveled last year. They took 4.3 vacations in the past year, 5.8 business trips, and 93% belong to a frequent traveler program and have a passport. They prefer to stay in five-star accommodations or luxury boutique hotels. They are willing to pay extra for comfort and service, prefer destinations that are off the beaten track, and love collecting frequent flyer points from business travel to use on personal travel.

 Affluent Taste For First Class. This group breaks down on generational lines, with 32% Millennials, 38% Gen-Xers, 27% Boomers, and 3% seniors. They have a tendency to splurge on upgrades such as flight upgrades, and fine food and wine, and will pay extra for comfort and service. Looks for quality over quantity when traveling. There were 89% who took a trip in the last year. They took 2.9 vacation trips and 2.8

##### business trips. They prefer five-star accommodations, rental villas/homes, luxury boutique hotels. Six percent have traveled on private aircraft.

 Affluent Domestic Deal-Seekers. These are mass-affluent travelers who seek out bargains, mainly to destinations in the U.S. They spend above average on personal travel, but their trips are no frills. They tend to return to the same spot again and again. Median HI $147,000.00. Median Net worth $639,000.00.

 Affluent Homebodies. Tend to be more in the Midwest. Includes more singles and full-time students. They are risk-averse so unlikely to include adventurous escapades. They travel, but not heavily, and prefer to travel domestically. They typically stay in “other” hotels/motels rather than five- star hotels or boutiques.

### Money Spent on Liberty

##### “There is only one success—to be able to spend your life in your
 own way.”

—CHRISTOPHER MORLEY, AMERICAN NOVELIST AND JOURNALIST

# There are, I think, three kinds of liberty: day-to-day liberty, lifestyle
##### liberty, and mental or emotional liberty. I’d like you to consider each one as something you may be able to deliver through your products, services, or business.
 We’ll begin with the day-to-day. The affluent are highly stressed. More than 75% of all affluent business owners and self-employed professionals work 60 to 70 hours a week. The average affluent household with children


-----

##### has each child involved in at least three to five separate, organized activities each week, requiring transportation, supervision, and parental involvement. Families are now spread out over the country, requiring more frequent travel and time away from home and business for personal reasons. Add to this the ever-rising intrusiveness and constant connectedness imposed by technology and the ever-increasing complexity of everyday life thanks to burgeoning choice in every product and service category. Also, the more affluent a person is, the more financial responsibilities, decisions, and seemingly endless paperwork flow he confronts. All added together, it equals high stress, low liberty. By “low liberty,” I mean that this person feels as if he has no time for himself, feels as if constantly chasing and never catching, constantly at odds with himself and others, and always disappointing someone. I know these feelings well myself. You might think of us as desperate affluents.
 On the rare occasions desperate affluents find someone of demonstrated, proven, reliable competence to whom they can transfer some responsibility, they will do so eagerly and pay generously for the relief. These desperate affluents often overpay people by normal or traditional standards but consider the liberty being purchased a bargain. I recently had a client tell me he paid his personal assistant $75,000.00 a year, a wage judged by his business partner, CPA, and others as $30,000.00 too much, but because she can be counted on to anticipate his needs, think for herself, and relieve him of having to remember just about everything, he considers it a half-price bargain. Another desperate affluent businesswoman I know has a person who comes to her home twice a week and does the laundry, changes the bedding, goes to the grocer’s and restocks the refrigerator, and takes and picks up clothes at the cleaners—for which she pays $500.00 a week. I imagine that works out to something like $50.00 an hour. Too much? Or bargain? What price the liberty to enjoy an evening out or to be able to come home and relax at end of a high-pressure day instead of having to wash clothes or finding nothing in the fridge suitable for a cobbled-together dinner and having to get back in the car and go out? What price liberty?
 In his book The Art of Selling to the Affluent, Matt Oechsli wrote, “When people are under a lot of stress, they look for relief. They initiate many major purchase decisions to reward themselves for their hard work and as a stress release. The last thing they want is a hassle.” He goes further


-----

##### to give these seven drivers of significant buying decisions by the affluent (boldfacing of key words and phrases, mine):

 1. They want to be respected, even honored, for the level of success
 they have achieved. 2. They are successful because of the professionalism and competence
 they apply to their work, and they expect no less from others. 3. They will react strongly to any attempts to deceive them, and when
 (they feel) that happens, they take their business elsewhere. 4. The define value in their own terms. 5. Instead of striving to keep up with the Joneses, they want to be
 different from the Joneses. 6. They experience enough tension and hassles in their daily work life
 —they want to be free from all that when dealing with people who would like to sell them something (and keep them as customers/clients/patients). 7. They can afford and are willing to pay for the best information, the
 best products, the highest level of competence, and the best professional service available.

 Next, consider the magnification of this, to lifestyle. The affluent are on a search, a life and lifestyle quest.

 They are on a quest for respect. On a quest for competence. A quest for integrity. A quest for status and value meaningful to them. A quest for relief from stress and difficulty and responsibility. Most of all, a quest for competence.

 They often arrange their lives and the locations in it in ways reflective of this quest.
 Many of my clients are impressed by my obsession with “time economics” and time preservation—so much so that one of my most popular books is No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs. Our Ohio home was chosen primarily for its eight-minute proximity to the racetrack


-----

##### where I race most of my horses. It is the best available that is close to the track. There’s an upscale community 20 minutes away I’d prefer living in, but that would mean 40 minutes, sometimes 80 minutes of commuting on race days—unacceptable. This home is also exactly midway between the Cleveland and Akron airports. Only 15 minutes away from a nice hotel that ably hosts my coaching and client group meetings and highest priced, boutique seminars. Our other home in Virginia is minutes from Dulles Airport, but not in flight paths. A penthouse condo with amenities in its building, and shops and fine dining restaurants just outside its doors, a Hyatt hotel a short walk away. I work mostly with a five-minute commute to my spacious basement office. 90% of all clients come to me. I am far from alone in making these kinds of calculations and choices in order to conserve my most precious and perishable asset: time. Watch how NetJets advertises itself to the affluent; the benefit being sold is time, and largely, preservation of personal time—to get home, to be with family, to more easily get away for vacation, not business efficiency.
 They delegate and transfer a lot of responsibility, even though, by nature and experience, they tend to be control freaks. The desperate need for relief from a myriad of overwhelming, stressful responsibilities supersedes their preference for hands-on control of everything. Consequently, many put some or all of their personal wealth under others’ management. They hire personal chefs to choose and prepare the foods and meals they eat. They let a clothier choose their wardrobe. A personal shopper chooses gifts for others. On and on. In all these instances they are not just attempting to buy a little time or convenience—they are seeking to buy lifestyle liberty. Not just a reality of minutes freed up or tasks done, but a sense of liberation from the mundane and time-consuming.
 Which arrives at the third liberty they seek: mental and emotional liberty.
 Napoleon Hill, legendary for his book Think and Grow Rich, wrote a lesser-known book as his last of many, titled Grow Rich with Peace of Mind. That title has a double meaning: that the ultimate aspiration, achievement, and wealth is peace of mind and that you need peace of mind to be truly rich. In that book, Hill told of finally having to disconnect all his phones, as his celebrity had put him under constant assault from all manner of people with requests for his time, money, and assistance.
