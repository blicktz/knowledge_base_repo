##### CHAPTER 10

### The Magical World

## of Email

#### The Monetizing Magic, Crafting Effective Emails

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Let’s start with a little quiz …
 Are you a great friend or an annoying cousin? As in… oh geez, there’s that (insert name of your annoying third cousin). He’s the one who hasn’t seen you in years, but within minutes of being in the same room is pitching you on joining some pyramid scheme, or trying to sell you a timeshare, or hinting that he needs a job and you seem like the perfect employer.
 Or are you that great friend who stays in touch with your bestie? The one who keeps in contact just because you care, who shares things that surprise and delight on a regular basis, who is funny and entertaining … always good for a laugh or a shoulder to cry on … sometimes in the same phone call.
 What type of emailer are you? If you’ve got an email list of ten or more people, it is time to stop being Captain Stinky Cousin Pants and become a great friend to your list. By staying in regular communication when you aren’t promoting something or asking for a sale, your list will be ready and waiting when you do want them to take action.


-----

###### Too many businesses just let those leads sit there. You’ve got to stay in touch to get the most from all you do in social media channels.
 I’ve been emailing my list regularly for years now. They know I care. They know I give value, and they know that when I do sell something, it is going to only be something I have already vetted.
 And I love staying in touch with them. But how often should you email? I am a proponent of daily emailing … that’s right, daily. Just like a daily check-in with a friend, a daily email helps nurture a relationship.
 I know it can seem overwhelming, but once you get into a rhythm of sending a daily email, it becomes second nature. You start looking for things in your life to email about.
 When we aren’t in the throes of promotion, I follow this format, then flip over to more promotion during a launch, and then go back to the daily conversation emails right afterward.
 Here’s the format I like to follow:

 1. Subject line that creates curiosity 2. Personalized greeting 3. Tell a story of something that happened 4. Tie it into a business lesson 5. Mention how it relates to a product, program, or service you offer, or
 an upcoming event. 6. P.S. to one of your programs or events or a regular P.S. with several
 options that you use each time.

 On the following pages I’ve included a sample of my last few emails so you can get a sense of the flow of the daily post. They aren’t long, but they keep in touch and share little moments of my life along with things my audience will value.
 If daily seems overwhelming, start three times a week, and if that’s too much, once a week works. Staying consistent is necessary when building a good relationship with your list, just like building a good friendship. (No flakey friends allowed.)
 Check out these emails, and then try crafting your own.

###### Email 1

 Subject: What’s your room number?

 Hey there, NAME,

 Happy Friday!

 This week I’m off-site at a conference (more on that tomorrow) with our Director of Membership, DeeAnn. Funny story from when we first arrived …

 There are thousands at this conference and before we started, each lunch spot was filled with a long line. We decided to skip lunch and stop by the gift shop and pick up some snacks to tide us over (nuts and Korean BBQ Jerky work great as a lunch fill-in, and mints because you are going to need them after this snack).

 So there we were at the checkout, and as I went to pay for our purchase, the woman behind the register sighed when I said, “I want to charge it to my room.” She then moved to the other side of the register and yelled from a good 20 feet away, “What’s your room number?”

 I paused, looking at the long line waiting behind me, and then I told her.

 She asked me to repeat it again …

 I took a deep breath.

 I could have gotten irritated. I could have told her that type of personal information yelled across a crowded store was a serious customer service faux pas and a violation of my privacy.

 But I didn’t. I simply told her yet again and made a joke by saying, “And my cell phone number is …” And I laughed a bit.

 Right at that moment, someone in the line yelled to me, “Hey, I am in your program! Thank you for getting me 10,000 fans!”


-----

###### Others around her started asking what she meant, so she started explaining our program as an ambassador of sorts. Others in line started to sign up for our weekly free training at 3daysto10k.com.

 So instead of freaking out and making a scene, I got a few new followers and made one of our members feel great about her decision to be a part of our tribe.

 See, the thing is, you’ve always got to act the way you’d want everyone to see you, because you never know who is there and who is watching. And it’s easy when you are always your authentic self.

 Be you. Be kind. And grow your audience.

 More on why I’m here tomorrow …

 Subject: Gift Inside, NAME

 Hey there, NAME,

 Tomorrow I am headed to San Diego as a featured speaker at Traffic and Conversion, sharing the stage with little guys like Sir Richard Branson, Rachel Hollis, and Ryan Deiss.

 But this past week I wasn’t speaking, or coaching, or performing … I was absorbing, learning, and listening … sharpening my tools, and working on my craft.

 I believe to continue to grow, you’ve got to keep both ears open and see the success path that other brilliant souls have laid out before you.

 Being present without “this is why this won’t work for me” or “nope, done that before” thinking, I’ve had a light bulb moment … Will share details soon. (It is pretty freaking exciting and all about you achieving your dreams.)

 You know, sometimes the answer is there all along. You just have to give your brain the occasional moment of stillness to hear it. One of my keys to success in making this happen is attending events filled with people I want to surround myself with.

###### If you haven’t yet, I encourage you to get a ticket to our Power Summit 2019. Plan for space. Plan for growth. Plan for inspiration. Plan to achieve your dreams. Because you are exactly what the world needs right now.

 Cheers,

 Subject: About that subject line …

 Funny story, NAME,

 Friday I sent out an email telling the story of a comical interaction with the clerk as I traveled in Nashville.

 The subject line was … “What’s your room number?”

 It drove in a lot of responses. Yet it wasn’t quite what I expected.

 You see, many didn’t even open up the email; they just skimmed quickly and sent me their phone number. One after another, after another. Some sent me their room number as well …

 Customer service folks chuckled …

 And then I sent my Combat Marine Veteran husband to their homes to set them straight. (Just kidding.)

 But I was reminded about the power of a clear call to action and a good subject line. You see, you can have the best email in the world, but if no


-----

###### one opens it, if no one reads it, if they don’t engage … it won’t get read. And they won’t take action.

 So where to get started?

 Clear over clever.

 Start by trying to just be clear, even testing putting your actual call to action in the subject line. And then test some more. Give value and grow your business.

 And probably don’t ask for someone’s number in your subject line … just sayin’.

 Cheers,

 Subject: He was cursing like a drunken sailor

 Hey there, NAME,

 Saturday I was at an event and the speaker Garrett White came out swinging, using a lot of profanity to the group. I was a bit shocked. (Which is what I am certain he was going for.)

 He was brash and aggressive. Not my thing, per se, but I wanted to see what he had up his sleeve …

 In a matter of one hour, he took the crowd from high-energy aggression to hugging and crying … letting their guard down so they could break their limiting beliefs.


-----

###### Did he have to start crassly to get them there?

 While there are, of course, other methods of doing it, I am certain that if he had started by pushing for tears and hugs at the beginning, this alpha crowd wouldn’t have responded well.

 What he did was first come to them where they were comfortable and could trust him, and then he asked them to get uncomfortable to go beyond their “norm.”

 Now, as a master trainer, he could do this in an hour’s time.

 And not to brag, but I, too, can take my audience from laughing to going deeper as they recognize their “why” and realize the only thing standing in their way is their willingness to take action.

 Yet not all speakers get this right …

 There were several at the conference who went out of order, trying to go too deep too fast, and others who shared too much of their story and didn’t relate it back to the audience. As an audience member, that feels uncomfortable for us and the speaker.

 So how do you do things in the “right” order?

 I’m working on a brand-new live workshop to share the “behind the scenes” of my million-dollar webinar. Stay tuned for details on this in a few weeks.

 Can’t wait!

 Cheers,

###### Subject: What happened when I spilled my entire drink in his lap

 Hey, NAME,

 On Sunday I was flying for work and unlike most first-class evening flights, I didn’t partake in my favorite cocktail. (Vodka and Fresca. Don’t judge it until you try it.)

 I had a long night ahead with two events to attend after landing, so I stuck to a glass of seltzer and a cup of hot water to which I added in my favorite tea … “Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice.”

 So there I was sipping away, working on my next book. As I went to plug my phone into the headrest in front of me, my computer flipped and hit my glass of seltzer and soaked the man sitting next to me, and (worse?) woke him up from his nap.

 While I did all that I could—jumping up, getting the flight attendants to help me clean up the mess—there wasn’t really a way to get him dry without sticking his pants out the plane window … and I didn’t think that was worth suggesting.

 Thankfully, he was really kind about the whole thing and didn’t suggest that I find a seat on the wing.

 Yet it was my fault. I had too much going on and didn’t keep my eye on the danger zone of the potential for an accident to occur. And while this time it was just seltzer, other times in my business it was something else.

 Back when I sold my agency last year, we were busy transitioning the company. Cash flow was strong, and I took my eye off the ball. Because of a small tech glitch, most of our members weren’t charged for an entire month. That meant we lost tens of thousands of dollars.

 Seriously. Tens of thousands.


-----

###### Of course we learned from that and now have systems in place, ensuring our operations run smoothly, including payments. But keeping my eye on the most important things is always a challenge. Because they are not usually the most fun.

 However, I can either wish for accidents to never happen again, or I can do everything in my power to ensure they won’t.

 I choose action and accountability, for that is the only way to ensure lasting change. The same goes for our tribe of Powerful Professionals who do the same with our weekly Made to Thrive Mondays challenge …

 What do you choose today?

 Cheers,

 A Quick Sales Surge Email She wrote one email, took her dog for a walk, and returned to thousands in sales. Did she write a 3,000-word email that took her days? Nope.
 Did she promise to give all of her delicious product away? Uh-uh. What she sent out is what we call “The Credit Email.” Instead of offering a special or discount, you give your customers or clients a credit to use on your products, programs, or services. It works so well because instead of just another promotion cluttering up the inbox, it is perceived as having value and it drives people to action.
 Jenni-Lyn Williams, founder of Snarky Tea, used the Credit Email template after we suggested it on a VIP private consulting day, and she sent it to everyone who had previously made a purchase, giving them a credit to use on another purchase.


-----

###### She then did one follow-up email reminding them of their credit (see Figure 10.1).

**FIGURE 10.1: Snarky Tea Credit Reminder Email**

###### This one campaign produced thousands in sales. Here’s another one, used by a private coaching client, Kinetics Cosmetics (see Figure 10.2):

**FIGURE 10.2: Kinetics Cosmetics Reminder Email**


-----

###### This also works for online courses, giving a credit to use on future purchases; or for professional services, giving a credit to use toward a consulting package, onboarding, or the first month of an ongoing package.
 When I had the agency, we used it to convert our one-time project clients into ongoing accounts.
 Here’s how it works.

 • Get the reader’s attention, mentioning the credit in the subject line.
 • Tell them why they are getting the credit.
 • Explain what they can use the credit for.


-----

###### • Give a deadline to use the credit.

 Here’s an example (see Figure 10.3):

**FIGURE 10.3: Kim’s Credit Email**

###### I recently shared this strategy on a Powerful Professional Business Coaching Masterclass, and one of our Inner Circle Mastermind Members


-----

###### tried it, using his birthday as a credit.
 He shared: “The best part about my birthday was actually running one of Kim Phillips’ credit emails! I sold four of my courses, generating $3,800 in cash and an additional $4K in installments over the next five months!
 The numbers may not be huge, but I still get excited whenever I make a sale without actually talking with someone. ” Some things to keep in mind when crafting your credit email:

 • Make the credit an odd number. It will seem much more real.
 • Give a week or less to use it. Give them too long, and they won’t.
 • Only send once every six months to customers. Too often, and it will
 lose its effectiveness.

 Try a credit email today to create a cash surge for your list.
