Don’t tell me that you can’t alter the perception of any commodity. I’ve just demonstrated it with
air, underwear, and coffee—coffee made from cat crap no less! When it comes to price, “can’t” is a
symptom of commodity thinking, not a reality. You need to change the word to “won’t.” The reality
is that any commodity can be differentiated and sold for a premium price. All it takes is the
willingness to do it and a pricing strategy to make it happen.

## How To Conquer the #1 Enemy of Maximum Profitability: Commoditization

I have a little history lesson, and journey forward in retail, for you—as motivation to resist with all
your might commoditization and the price strategy it compels.

In the late 1800s there was a common scam in which manufacturers and wholesalers would send
merchandise to retailers who had not ordered it. If the retailer refused to take the shipment the
wholesaler would reduce the price in order to make the sale. The wholesaler would apologize for the
“mistake” and, in order to save the cost of return freight, offer to let the retailer keep it for a much
lower price than shown on the invoice packed in with the goods. Oftentimes this tactic worked.
Other times it did not. This same sneaky ploy is still used today, by the way.

One such attempt occurred between a watch manufacturer and its intended bamboozled buyer, a
retail shop owner named Edward Stegerson. You’ve undoubtedly never heard of Ed. Yet his
obstinate decision to refuse a shipment of gold watches created something very big in American
history. A 22-year-old railroad station agent caught in the middle of the dispute made an agreement
with the watchmaker to keep and sell the watches on consignment, and keep any profit he made
beyond $12.00 per watch. The young man was so happy with the outcome he promptly ordered
another shipment of watches and began to sell them through mail-order catalogs. This led him into
the mail-order business. It wasn’t long before he moved to Chicago and met another man who
would become his first employee. In 1893, these fellows created the Sears & Roebuck Company.
Maybe you’ve heard of it?

The company was based on the premise that people will buy if you give them quality goods and
low prices. Their original catalog was proudly titled “The Great Price Maker.” They were selling
against local stores and able to undercut their prices, in exactly the same way that today’s e[commerce variety retailers like amazon.com and overstock.com do. In 1925, they opened their first](http://amazon.com/)
retail store and went on to become America’s largest retailer. Today, some online merchants have
also opened brick-and-mortar stores.

**The future did not stay bright for Sears forever. It was not the only company to have the**
**bright idea of selling more volume for less profit. Aside from five-and-dimes such as F.W.**
Woolworth Company, other companies such as Kmart and Walmart emerged as did the “category
killers” starting with Toys ’R Us. Category killers got their name because of their propensity for
dominating a specific category. Toys ’R Us, Office Max, 84 Lumber, Circuit City, Barnes & Noble
are but a few of the names who came into categories and choked out the competition with advanced
strategies for driving prices lower. Many of these became vulnerable in time. The hazards of change
very much affect retail as well as direct marketing, and a lot of vulnerability is tied to price strategy.
Customer loyalty is difficult to develop and maintain under any circumstance, but the difficulty is
only magnified when you compete primarily on price. Once you start to compete on price then you
can count on there being somebody coming along who’ll beat your prices, even if doing so
ultimately bankrupts them. There is no glory in having the second lowest price. When you compete
on price you have no choice but to be the cheapest. Second cheapest is not good enough. As a result,
price wars are fought constantly and the race to the bottom continues to intensify while the margin
for error continues to shrink.

**This battlefield is littered with casualties. F.W. Woolworth Company is gone. 84 Lumber has**
been squeezed out by Home Depot. Circuit City went bankrupt. Barnes & Noble now stands in the
shadow of [Amazon.com. Office Max finds itself being squeezed out by Staples who is being](http://amazon.com/)
squeezed by Costco and Sam’s Club. The original giant Sears has been bought out by Kmart. That
has done little to help Kmart compete with the 3,000-pound gorilla, Walmart who squeezes just
about everybody.

[But Walmart dare not feel too smug. It now finds itself being squeezed by Amazon.com on just](http://amazon.com/)
about every front. Not content with just being the world’s largest bookstore, Amazon has moved
into selling just about everything under the sun. They also have mind-numbing technological
expertise and a use of logistics that clearly rivals Walmart’s. Another competitive advantage
Amazon has is not being bogged down with the upkeep of brick-and-mortar facilities. More
importantly, they have never been burdened with the task of getting their customers out of their
house and into the store. Amazon’s buyers have always been trained to buy from them while sitting
at a computer. Now that smart phones have evolved, Amazon’s buyers are able to access them from
anywhere. When you combine that with their free shipping options, you have an extremely powerful
force. Now, anytime you are shopping you can compare the price in whatever store you’re standing

in with Amazon via your smart phone. Uh-oh. Make no mistake; Amazon is the rising giant in the
_discount category. However, it is not safe from threats. Amazon may come to dominate the retail_
landscape, but they will not hold that position based on price forever. No one ever has. No one ever
will. A competitive advantage of a low price cannot be maintained forever. It is an unsustainable
advantage. Keep that in mind whenever you head in this direction.

## Just Because You Can Does Not Mean You Should

In 1993 there was a blockbuster movie called Jurassic Park. It was about a billionaire who used a
new genetic technology to bring dinosaurs to life in the present. His plan was to make a theme park
in which tourists would be taken on safari to see the impossible: all of these extinct, prehistoric
beasts come back to life. He ran into a “little” problem that greatly concerned his investors, so he
brought in some scientists to help calm their nerves. He believed if he could win over the scientists
he could win over his investors. One of the scientists was a chaos theorist named Dr. Ian Malcolm
who was played by Jeff Goldblum. Dr. Malcolm made a point that everyone who got so excited by
what they could do never stopped to ask if they should do it. That is something any purveyors of
cheap or free, as well as any marketers allowing themselves to be classified as a purveyor of
commodities need to ask themselves. Even if you can—temporarily—win a price war, should you?
Even if you can make good money—temporarily—selling goods or services thought of by you and
your customers as commodities, should you? At Jurassic Park, it turned out that the problem with
those reincarnated monsters wasn’t very manageable. The beasts insisted on eating the tourists.

**While many business leaders have been busily racing to the price bottom, they have**
**sacrificed the quality of their offerings, their position and relationship with their customers,**
**shareholders’ wealth, and employees’ jobs. They are also driving the throw-away society,**
**trying to price in a way people are accepting of short-lived quality. The founder of Toys ’R Us,**
Charles Lazarus, said that he left the baby furniture business and went into toys because baby
furniture doesn’t wear out and toys do. Of course, IKEA proved that wrong. IKEA led the way in
making furniture disposable. Today it seems like most furniture is disposable. Walk into homes all
across America and you’ll find furniture that looks good but cannot stand up to moderate, let alone
heavy, use. Other than Styrofoam, nothing you or I buy from a discounter is going to last for any
prolonged amount of time. Junk currently litters the landscape, inside homes and offices.

## NO B.S. Price Strategy Warning #3

**The bargain of a cheap price and securing of a big discount may satisfy a customer**
**momentarily, but only real value, quality, and service can retain that customer. If you**

sacrifice the latter for the former, be prepared to endlessly chase and always, desperately
need more new customers that you pour into a bucket with a hole in the bottom as big as

the hole at the top.

Brand names are also deteriorating. There was a time when a name-brand meant something. Now
its meaning is highly place dependent. Many of the big boxes force their suppliers to make their
products to their specifications. This is just, then, a case of paying for the label. A similar thing is
happening with retail outlets. There was a time when you went to the outlet stores to buy something
of top quality from a famous, respected brand, that had some little unintentional imperfection, or
was out of season, or manufactured to point of overstock. Now you go to the outlet and buy
something intentionally made inferior by the company. The only thing that is the same is the label.
Products sold in the outlet stores are made specifically for the outlet stores. Same with outlet stores
online. Obviously, this can be done—it is being done. But should it be done?

**American business, from big migrating down to small, has increasingly focused on shorter-,**
**shorter-, and shorter-term results, with leadership willing to take profits today at certain,**
**serious expense, risk, and damage in the long term. You have to weigh that carefully. If you**
intend to have your shops, stores, restaurants, service businesses and practices prosper in your
community for your entire life, then the price strategy embraced by some Fortune 500 CEOs captive
to Wall Street, obsessed with quarterly earnings numbers and willing to do his five years, grab his
golden parachute, and bail out, leaving the mess for the next guy may not be the best price strategy
for you!

## Discounters Happy Being Commoditized Are Not All Bad

You would think that as strongly as I argue against this approach to business—accepting me-too,
me-same commoditization and relying on discounting—I would not have _anything good to say_
about discounters. That would be wrong; I do. This type of business does serve a useful purpose.
They are a necessary component of competition. We need businesses who seek to make offerings
cheaper so that more and more people can afford them, so that goods are available to all regardless
of their incomes, and as a motivational force for the rest of us to be more creative about product,
service, positioning, and price strategy.

However, presently, far too many businesses are spending all of their time and energy trying to
cut costs so that they can be the cheapest. Not nearly enough of them are spending time trying to
figure out how to increase quality so they can spend more and be the best. The near-collapse of the
economy in 2008, and the recession dragging on since, has many abandoning their successful
strategies in favor of slashing every possible cost despite severe damage to service and quality, then
reputation. The pyramid has gotten very, very broad and crowded toward the bottom. This has
created great opportunity toward the top for those courageous and creative marketers who take
notice.

## The Secret of the Living

Trying to compete with the big chain stores is so scary that during the early part of the last century
the federal government passed laws such as the Clayton Act of 1914 and the Robison-Patman Act of
1936 to restrict discounters’ ability to use price as a weapon. The big retailers were seen as anticompetitive and a threat to independent mom-and-pop shops. Never mind that the legislation
actually did more to hamper competition than it did to promote it. The fact remains that almost one
hundred years later the big chains with their ability to commoditize everything has not killed us yet.
The weak or weakened, frightened, lazy, and uncreative in any industry often turn to government for
protection by regulation from tougher competitors, but even when it is given, it fails to provide
sustained safe shelter, and generally has unintended negative consequences for both business and
consumers. Giants cut down to size and caged break free and return to the fight, enraged.

**I am unaware of a type of product that is not offered by giant discounters who act as a**
**commoditizing force. They cover everything from groceries, to electronics, home goods, health**
supplies, health care, building materials, toys, books, even, ironically, luxury goods. There are chain
restaurants that commoditize dining out. To take that a step further, there are even companies that
are commoditizing dinner at home. Grocery stores now carry just about any pre-prepared dinner you
can get at a restaurant. They even cover many services. There are companies that have
commoditized advertising, marketing, printing, publishing, even legal services. I used
[LegalZoom.com the last time I set up one of my corporations. They also did wills for my wife and](http://legalzoom.com/)
me. It was a simple process. There is very little you can do to escape the reach of commoditization
or discounting.

All this commoditization has been horribly disruptive, intimidating, and confusing, and has killed
many mom-and-pop shops; but for every business killed by it, many survive, and some even thrive.
**Why isn’t the impact of commoditization universal? Why doesn’t discounting force everyone**
**in the category to discount? How can there be a price war with conscientious objectors who**
**prosper? The answer is a big glaring secret hidden in plain sight: some people are willing to**
**knowingly pay more.**

The profitable question for you is: why?

I watched with interest as a local model train store in my community wrestled with this same
question. He was terrified when Walmart came to town and said he’d never be able to survive
against the giant. I challenged him, and told him there could be more opportunity for him in the
giant’s shadow than in the open sunlight BW (Before Walmart). Four years later, he is thriving and,
as I predicted, doing even better than he was before. How? By capitalizing from the increased
traffic. He isn’t even doing anything particularly impressive with his marketing. In his case, he
simply does not provide a single thing that can be found at Walmart. Instead, he focuses on highly
specialized products for serious hobbyists, for nostalgia-driven toy buyers emotionally connected to
products where price doesn’t matter, and on service. He came to understand and profit from the
same kinds of reasons women spend a multiple of what they’d pay at Walmart to buy cotton panties
from Victoria’s Secret. The reason I bought my son a $20.00 handmade wooden baby rattle and why
every year I order my daughter’s Halloween costume from Chasing Fireflies, when I could find
rattles and costumes for less at Walmart. You do it with something, too. No, you do it with many
things. There is always a lower-cost, commoditized version of whatever it is you are buying. Why
don’t you always buy the cheapest commodity?

Everyone defaulting to cheaper or cheapest price strategy and agreeing to participate in
commodity merchandising is always in the process of dying by suicide. Some faster than others,
some almost imperceptibly for a long time then suddenly speeding up. Everyone refusing this death
is living.

## Yes, Everybody in Marketing Points to Starbucks …

There are countless examples of companies thriving while selling what could be considered a
commodity. The one most often given is Starbucks. Ironically, it has become something of a
commodity in and of itself. There is a Starbucks on every corner. There are Starbucks products in
groceries. Even, most recently, Starbucks instant coffee. It seems to me that they’ve given in to
temporary profit strategies that are slowly eating away at their brand value, like unseen termites
destroying a house from the inside out. Time will tell. But they may be on a death march. My coauthor is a fan of Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ founder, celebrated his return to reinvigorate the spirit
of a troubled company, owns stock in the company, is happy with his returns, and cautiously
optimistic about the company’s future—but he admits his best ideas seem to be in the past. There
you can find a number of anti-commoditization lessons. Schultz’ book about the company’s
beginnings, Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time, is well
worth reading.

My favorite company that is currently defying commoditization is The Republic of Tea. As you
might have guessed, they sell tea. Tea. They call themselves the leading purveyor of premium teas.
While you can pick up a box of 100 Lipton teabags for around $5.00 you will need to shell out over
$20.00 for the same size box from The Republic of Tea. That is by no means close to their most
expensive tea. They sell a rare Darjeeling for over $16.00 per ounce. They are very much
positioning their tea away from other caffeinated beverages and alongside fine wines. In fact, when
you buy bottled tea from them it comes in a tall fancy bottle, has tasting notes, and recommended
dishes to help you pair the tea correctly.
