## Endless Chains

##### by Dan Kennedy

 first learned this from Paul J. Meyer, an exceptionally successful insurance salesman, and founder of Success Motivation Institute, one of the top companies at the forefront of the American success movement of the 1960s to 1980s. He posited, simply, that if you never

# Ilet your chain break, you would always have a next customer.

##### His blunt truth was, and mine now is, if you do not have endless chains of referrals from every customer, client, patient, or donor, you are incompetent or at least negligent. You are failing. The only legitimate exception is when you deliberately choose not to make yours a referral- driven business. But if you would welcome referrals, and don’t create endless chains, you’re failing.
 As an aside, highly successful achievers in selling, in business, and in other fields have a hatred of failure in common. And I mean: hatred. They are very hard on themselves and unforgiving of those in their employ over any failure. Personally, I have always been this way. It has not prevented failure, but it has motivated me enormously to seek and use methods that reliably produced successful results. You have to hold yourself, your team, and your business, and even your customers, clients, patients, or donors, accountable if you expect great outcomes. If you want endless chains of


-----

##### referrals, you have to hate and resent any break in a chain, and you have to alertly spot it and do all you can to fix it. If a committed customer does not refer, find out why. If your referral productivity overall is weak, find out why. Never shrug it off. Dig into it.
 Never forget this fact. No one is unable to refer. Every person has some relatives, at least a few friends, neighbors, people they see and talk to often in the course of day-to-day living, co-workers, fellow church members. Everybody knows people and is known by people. And everybody in a career or business has professional or business peers. The opportunity for every person to be a link in an endless chain is absolute. If the chain breaks, it is not because a customer had no possible opportunity to refer and keep the chain intact. It’s never the customer’s failure. It’s always yours.

#### How to Take What They Won’t Give
##### Here’s an aggressive trick . . .
 You can ensure Endless Chain by adding Forced Referrals into your marketing system. The reality is, different people behave differently, so there are some people who refer a lot and refer often and refer continuously over their entire life as a customer. There are others who never refer. But you can leverage them via some variation of The 5-House Rule, fully detailed in Chapter 9 of my book No B.S. Grassroots Marketing for Local Businesses. To be an extraordinarily nice guy, I’ve posted this chapter at www.NoBSBooks.com, and you can get it there, free. But you’d benefit by having the entire book, too.
 Whether as this describes, geographically or nongeographically, and nationally or globally, or by peer connection, the tactic is the same: You let your customer’s “neighbors” know he is your patron and suggest that because he is, they might want to be too.
 In 2013, I convinced a charity to play this game. They had, as a committed donor, a fairly well-known member of a small, upscale community. At my urging, they gave him a version of a “citizen of the year award,” then sent copies of the article about that from their donor newsletter to about 100 people who lived in his community, along with a letter saying


-----

##### they thought his neighbors (definition stretched) would like to know of Bob’s award and generous support of “x” charity. Also enclosed, literature and a donation envelope. They got a higher percentage of response from this mailing than any of their normal, “cold” mailings to compiled or rented lists by a three-to-one margin, and got a higher average donation from new donors by a two-to-one margin. I pulled this same stunt with “peers” instead of “neighbors,” with a charity solicitation recognizing a known CEO in a certain industry for his generous support, mailed to the CEOs of 200 companies in that industry, and I got similar results. There’s nothing to say your winery can’t anoint some customer your Connoisseur of the Year, and mail everybody in a ten-mile radius of him in the same way.
 I call this Forced Referrals for several reasons. First, you’re approximating him reaching out to those peers or neighbors. Second, should any call him or bump into him and ask about it, he’s on the spot to praise your business and acknowledge his frequent patronage and enjoyment of it, so he does refer. Third, you can thank him the minute any new customers come from this kind of campaign, just as if he did proactively refer, therefore setting in motion a greater likelihood of him proactively referring. Last, it’s forced because it’s all done without permission. Permission is highly overrated.

#### CHAPTER 13

## The Big Event: Events for More Referrals

##### by Dr. Dustin S. Burleson

 f you want to be in the referral business, you should get into the event business.
 This first raises the important question of: What business are you really in? Most business owners have a very narrow definition tied to

# Iwhat they do. I am an orthodontist who owns five orthodontic practices, and

##### most people think that defines the business I am in. I don’t see it that way. I am really in the business of marketing orthodontic practices, and as part of that, I decided that I would be in the business of generating large numbers of patient referrals for these orthodontic practices. If you decide to be in the business of generating large numbers of customer referrals for your business, whatever it is, you’ll also want to join me in the event business.
 We use special events as a way of creating a lot of referrals in surges, in a short period of time, by giving our patients an easy, fun way to introduce their friends, neighbors, and co-workers to us. You can, too.
 Sadly, most business owners, marketers, and salespeople are confused about referrals. They cannot accurately report their referral statistics and have no idea what they should be doing in order to consistently generate new customers from existing customers. If you have fallen like this, you’re not alone, but you’ve fortunately found the book to help you get up!


-----

##### To do so, and to gladly invest in any referral marketing including events, you need real knowledge about the referral productivity in your business. A lack of clarity in any area of your business will lead to poor decision making, inaction, or both. I see more confusion and lack of clarity with referrals than I do in any other area of business.
 As a coach and consultant teaching doctors how to run better practices, I’m no longer shocked when a client tells me they aren’t certain how many new patients were referred to their office last month, let alone how many referrals they average per active patient per month, quarter, and year and whether or not that is trending up or down or sideways. I’ve nearly stopped asking what five things they are intentionally doing this month in order to generate more word-of-mouth referrals. The answer is almost always, “Now that I think about it, nothing.” For the few clients who actually have an answer, their strategies are inconsistent, poorly structured, inaccurately measured, and unfavorably rely on the customer for random referrals. All of these failings have been discussed in-depth throughout this book, but no specific referral strategy can be presented without this reminder: Random acts get, at best, random results. The events strategy I have for you should not be grabbed as if a single item on a store shelf; it should be integrated into a complete referral marketing system.
 In my world of professional practices, referrals are mostly taken for granted. Some offices have scripts for their employees to use to ask for referrals, and are occasionally pressed to use them, often when a slump in new patient flow has already occurred, or the week after the doctor has returned from a seminar—but there’s no consistency to it. In most offices, you’ll find one of those cute little wooden signs that says something to the effect of, “The best compliment you can give us is the referral of your friends and family.” In today’s distracted, inconsistent, schizophrenic-like consumer marketplace, you can no longer afford to hope and wait for customers to refer you more business. Earning a referral perk or listening to one of your employees prodding them is not enough incentive to move a customer from nonreferring to referring. You certainly can’t rely on the warm and fuzzy feelings that come from customers who want to pay you a compliment after reading your little wooden sign!

##### Dr. Burleson has a new book, The Truth About Referrals from Patients and Dentists—An Orthodontist’s Guide to Massive Practice Success, providing an in-depth look at internal marketing and word-of-mouth referrals for professional practices. If you would like to get a free chapter of Dustin’s latest book and listen to an interview with Dustin and Dan Kennedy, go to www.nobsreferralbook.com.


##### If you want a lot of your patients to refer, and at least some to refer a lot, your entire system needs certain times when everybody is forcibly focused on referring.
 Even if you get customers talking about you favorably to others, that’s not enough for really great results, either. The people they’re telling are also distracted, time pressed, nodding as their friend talks but tuned out, mind elsewhere, fingers texting.
 You must give your customers a reason to talk about you and actually bring their referrals directly to you.

#### How to Get Customers to Fetch and Bring Referrals Like a
 Well-Trained Dog Fetches Your Slippers or Newspaper
##### One of the most successful ways that our businesses and the businesses of my coaching clients have generated floods of new customers is through exclusive events. But don’t just take my word for it, because there are a host of massively successful companies using events to drive new customers through the door year after year. Some you will recognize, others you will not. Brand companies like Red Bull and other beverage companies, marketers to the affluent like Sentient private jet services and art galleries, civic groups like Kiwanis, gyms like the Iron Tribe Fitness chain featured in the No B.S. Guide to Brand-Building by Direct-Response book, and institutions like the Cleveland Clinic host different kinds of events that, in part, give existent customers, clients, patients, or donors a stress-free,


-----

##### comfortable, easy way to invite a friend or friends to accompany them, and by doing so, being introduced to the brand and its representatives or the business’s owners or leaders in a nonsales environment. In almost every category of local business, there are particularly astute and creative owners utilizing in-store or in-office events built for customers bringing referrals. In martial arts, the best academies use graduation ceremonies for this purpose. In retail, there are “trunk shows.” For bookstores, meet-the-author events. Even GKIC, the entrepreneur organization that Dan Kennedy founded, uses local chapter meetings in some market areas to facilitate member-get-a-member referral activity, and occasionally does a unique teleseminar or webinar “event” to which all the members, Independent Business Advisors, and affiliates can refer people.
 What I’m describing here and have made a big part of my referral business is definitely not unusual—yet, per capita, very few businesses create and promote such events. Dan Kennedy says that most secrets are visible. It’s just that people don’t notice or think about what they see! Since this strategy is so visible, why don’t more businesses use it? I think there are a number of answers, but one obstacle is their locked-down, small thinking about referrals.


### Referral Strategies for the Average Business

##### 1. Hope

 2. Pray

 3. Do nothing

 4. Bitch and moan about the results


##### That’s pretty much it. By this book, you are getting a very different, more expansive and creative array of opportunities shown to you. This can


-----

##### be turned to great advantage. Most business owners including your competitors do not know all these referral opportunities exist, and if they are presented with any of them, view them as too much work or not appropriate for their kind of business or are “too busy,” so they quickly retreat back into this box, limited to the four strategies used by average businesses.
 Utilizing referral events is, bluntly, way beyond the comprehension and embrace of most business owners, which can make it extremely valuable for you. There are virtually no limits to the type of events you can organize in order to generate referrals, from small intimate gatherings of your best referrers or enjoying a spa day or an exclusive fly fishing trip to large record-breaking events with live music, free food, and impressive attractions. In this chapter you will discover the main principles of running events in order to generate more referrals. Although these principles apply to events of all shapes and sizes, you will want to take notes specifically on implementation ideas after reading each example and considering the resources you will need and parameters that you must set in order to create a successful event.

#### Rule #1: Invite the Right People
##### Last time I checked, you can’t have an event without people, so you might as well invite the right ones. First, make a list of every influential customer in your business. Start with those who have referred to you in the past or for whom you feel there is great potential for them to refer if you give the right opportunity to do so. Next, look up the customers who have spent the most money with you in the last year. Our data show that our highest spenders are more likely to refer by a three-to-one margin. Check for a similar fact in your business, and if you find it, exploit it. Third, pull together a list of customers who have purchased one of your books, have left a favorable online review, or who own a small business. These individuals are typically in tune with your marketing message and love to see what you’re up to. They are, as Ken Blanchard says, your “raving fans.” Be sure to invite them. Finally, generate a list of customers who were referred by another customer. Although these people are not a sure-fire bet to refer another


-----

##### friend or family member, with the right message and appropriate invitation, you can remind them that they discovered your business through one of their friends or family and now invite them to “share the love.”
 Accurate thinking about your event and who gets invited is more than an exercise in list segmentation. Your event is designed to generate more referrals. The joke in my office is that we don’t do these events for our health. We do them to generate new word-of-mouth business. If you invite the customers who heard about you from a discount offer or because you were the most convenient or cheapest provider of a product or service, you will create an event that is loved by all and acted on by none. You want results from your event. Be sure to invite the right people. Or, if you feel compelled to invite all your customers, segment them into different groups in which to invest different amounts of time, money, and effort in getting them to attend. Dan Kennedy says, “Everywhere else ‘discrimination’ is a bad word. But for profitable marketing, it is an essential strategy.” As a specific example, regarding customer appreciation events actually designed to generate referrals, he says that some customers should get their invitations by Federal Express and be promised a desirable gift when they check in at the VIP desk at the event. Other customers should get a postcard. Others an email. Pick and choose.

#### Rule #2: Make It Exclusive
##### This principle is complementary to and plays hand-in-hand with the first rule. By asking you to segment your list and invite the people who are most likely to refer their friends and family, I have effectively “tricked” you into creating an exclusive event.
 By the nature of segmenting your list into those customers who are more likely to refer versus those customers who are more likely to enjoy your free event without referring anyone, you have created an exclusive event. Now, go out there and remind your best customers that this event is for your best referrers only. It does not matter if the event is designed for only 10 people or over 500. The only difference that matters is the heightened level at which you can play the exclusivity card. For an event with 500 customers, you could and should mention that this event is for
