###### show. So now they’re a no-show. What do you do? Most offices don’t have a formal follow-up process. It’s usually maybe a phone call, maybe two phone calls, maybe an email. So what I recommend first in this process is: Let’s use more media. Let’s use email. Let’s use text. Let’s send them a letter or two. Let’s really try to get them back into the office for an appointment. And let’s make sure it all happens the same way every time.
 The next sequence is the new patient sequence. In this sequence, we have a specific number of communications to talk about different subjects and establish the relationship with the patient. The first email is the welcome email. The second step of the new patient sequence is a direct mail piece. This is a thank-you note that we send out expressing our gratitude to them. After that is Email #2: “Hey, now that we’ve established a relationship, we’re in this together. It’s my job as a doctor to keep your mouth healthy, keep your teeth straight, make sure that you don’t have any major mouth disasters, and so on.” Email #3 says: “Here are the guidelines and the boundaries in which we work. We need to set appointments, you need to keep them, you need to be on time, you need to let us know how we can do better. And if we do all this, we expect referrals to your friends and family.” Email #4: “We share resources. Here are some resources we have available. Now that you’re a member of our family, now that you’re a patient of ours, here’s our website where we have online resources.” This continues.
 The next thing I think about is the rating sequence. Usually we want to ask people for ratings and reviews a couple times a year. People usually interact with the dental practice at least twice a year if they’re coming in when they should. We use the NPS survey. If you haven’t heard of this, this is called Net Promoter Score, and it’s one question. We ask them, what is the likelihood you would refer a friend or family member to us? If someone rates us low, we obviously want to follow up and make sure we can maybe better that situation or redeem ourselves. But if someone says, maybe a 9 or 10 likelihood that they would refer a friend or family member, that’s great. Then what we do is something really cool. If someone rates us high, we’ll know exactly what email address they have. Now everybody wants Google reviews. If you have a Gmail address, we invite you to review us on

-----

###### Google. If somebody has a Yahoo address or a Bing address or Hotmail or whatever, we can invite them to that specific platform in order to review us. And then we get more reviews in those places. And we’re not asking people that don’t have a Gmail address to review us on Google because that’s pretty unlikely and a little difficult for them. We will also direct referral stimulation campaigns to those ranking us 7–10.
 We also have a lost patient reactivation sequence. We make this happen automatically. If someone hits a year and they haven’t been here, we’re going to start this campaign automatically. There’s a treatment-not-accepted follow-up sequence. Some of that stretches out for 6 to 12 months.
 The more different, specific sequences we built and automated, the more the practice grew.

##### CHAPTER 10

# Solving the Case of the Very
 Messy Marketing Kitchen & More about How to Pick the
 Best Software for You

##### By Parthiv Shah

###### Here’s more of the Dr. Biasucci story.
 Dr. Carlo Biasucci is an extremely successful dentist and the founder of Elite Practice, Canada’s largest training provider for dental teams. Many years ago, he came to me for help with a specific part of his business. We’ve enjoyed a multi-year, multi-six-figure relationship ever since. Dr. Carlo is one of the smartest men I know. He built a wildly successful dental practice. Sold it. Started a dental coaching business. And became a wildly successful dental coach. He understands his business exceptionally well.
 He knows when he needs help. He looks for and hires only the best. He was my first client to hire Dan Kennedy to write Shock & Awe packages and sales letters. He did this back in 2017. He bought ClickFunnels and Infusionsoft the same year on my recommendation.

-----

###### Still, we were only part of his team back then. We never implemented a CRM (customer relationship management) or a CMS (customer success management) system for him. He hired someone else to build his website. His blog strategy was all over the place. His tracking tools were homegrown. This led to lost opportunities and unsealed deals. If this weren’t bad enough, he hired a sales automation firm that brought in Salesforce.com. This turned out to be a huge mistake. His business processes, team, and customer life cycle were not sophisticated enough to justify an enterprise-level solution like Salesforce. This meant his experience was grossly underwhelming. He never harnessed the true power of Salesforce.com. It was never connected to the rest of his business. His core problems were never solved. Ultimately, he wanted out. He came to me with a problem. He was suffering from a multi-system technological nightmare. He was trying to do too many things all at the same time. This meant his time and resources were spread too thin. His assets were all over the place. He had many brilliant, moneymaking ideas. But none were being properly implemented. He knew things were not going well. He was like a cook in a messy kitchen with no place for his pots. No place for his ingredients. And soup all over the walls.
 If you’ve ever had a successful business seem to spin out of control like this, if you’ve ever found yourself with a very UN-integrated operation, if you’ve ever found yourself exhausted and frustrated by being unable to implement your vision, you know “the messy kitchen” problems can happen to anyone. To very smart people. Sometimes, for brief periods of time, this is unavoidable. In fact, Dan Kennedy says that success is often cooked up in a messy kitchen. True. But it can’t be sustained in one.
 Dr. Biasucci asked me to come in and take a look. If you’ve ever cooked a pot of soup, you know the soup is only valuable if it’s in the pot, in a bowl, or in your belly. Spilled soup, soup on the counter, soup on the stove, or soup on the wall is just a wasted mess. What I saw was like a kitchen nightmare. The soup was everywhere. That is to say, there was systemic data loss, with lead-generating data leaking out of every corner of his business. Dr. Carlo and I had a long conversation. We discussed the

-----

###### importance of keeping a tidy kitchen with all your soup in the pot. He got the picture.
 Dr. Carlo asked, “So, Parthiv, what do you know about HubSpot?” “Quite a lot,” I thought, but didn’t say. I could have told him that HubSpot is ideal for anyone looking for an all-in-one inbound marketing, sales, and customer service platform. I could have said it helps you attract clients, convert leads, and close customers with a focus on inbound marketing practices. I could have gone on about its Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, and CRM integration. I could have kept him on the phone for an hour, chatting him up on all that HubSpot can accomplish. I did none of that. I told him I could help. I knew exactly what to do.
 HubSpot has a bridge that connects to Salesforce.com. Migrating his underwhelming installation of Salesforce.com and all his data into one new, functional system was doable. We went to work, to build his HubSpot portal, so all his digital assets would be in one place. One platform. Connected to one data set. And instead of all the wasted potential he experienced with Salesforce.com, he would use every millimeter of HubSpot. This means he got more out of his investment. He has a platform that fit his needs. With all his digital assets in one spot. His kitchen was now clean. All the soup stays in the pot. No more systemic data loss. Every lead, every opportunity, and every client got adequate attention in an automated environment.
 He went from multi-system technology chaos to ONE SYSTEM on ONE PLATFORM. With HubSpot, we can easily manage customer interactions, marketing campaigns, sales activities, and website analytics. There is seamless data flow and collaboration across the various parts of his business. Efficiency is up. Productivity is up. Dr. Carlo can now easily track customer behavior, marketing performance, and sales activities all in one place.
 Dr. Carlo has always been an intelligent man. He’s focused. Driven. And it shows. He grew from a start-up (when he first hired me to work on a limited part of his marketing and automation efforts) to a multi-seven-figure coaching business. He did this while throwing things all over his kitchen

-----

###### and spilling far too much soup. He did this with systemic data loss seeping out of dozens of holes in his pot. It excites me to think where he will go from here. What his future has in store for him… All of his soonto-be- realized accomplishments… All the milestones he will hit then blow past in the next 10 years. If he could grow to the level he’s at now while juggling a technological nightmare, I expect him to move mountains now that he’s operating with HubSpot.
 I first heard of HubSpot many years ago. It was on my radar for a long time. I watched it evolve from its inception back in 2006 to the powerhouse it became over the following decade. I held off on purchasing it, content with what I was using at the time. By 2017, I was convinced I was missing out. I made my purchase—a great decision. Soon, I became a HubSpot Partner, and in 2021, I earned HubSpot Platinum Partner Status. I quickly realized that my company, eLaunchers, is a perfect HubSpot installation. We use every inch of the platform. We’ve demonstrated a considerable ROI on the non-trivial investment of the software, technology crew, implementation crew, copywriters, and designers. We are truly using HubSpot as intended and are very proud of what we’ve done with it.

#### Is HubSpot Right for You? Maybe.

###### Technologies like HubSpot, ClickFunnels, and Keap are evolving. They have massive R&D budgets. This means their capabilities, strengths, weaknesses, and the reasons why they may be the right tool for you change almost quarterly.
 HubSpot is an incredible platform, but it may not be right for you. It’s not cheap. There’s a learning curve. If your business is not large enough, then it’s likely overkill. That being said, there are many reasons why HubSpot blows other platforms out of the water. I can speak from experience with this. I use HubSpot. I love HubSpot. And I highly recommend the platform to the right business owner.
 With HubSpot, you keep EVERYTHING in one system.

Every Domain
CRM Data

-----

Contacts and Leads
Marketing Assets
Email Marketing Campaigns
Blogs and Website Content
Social Media Accounts
Analytics and Reporting
Sales Activities
Forms and Landing Pages
Customer Service Tickets
Automation Workflows
Integration Data
Feedback and Surveys
E-Commerce Data
And More…

###### Like I said…everything. This is not an exhaustive list. HubSpot is constantly expanding its features and capabilities.
 Keeping everything on one system reduces systemic data loss to near zero. At eLaunchers, we keep our websites on HubSpot. This includes our main website, our DentalGrowthMachine. com, Pixel Estate microsite, our Next100K.com pixel estate, and many other funnel properties. Even the funnels we built with ClickFunnels have HubSpot web forms integrated into ClickFunnels. This bypasses the data interface of ClickFunnels and sends all data directly to HubSpot and nowhere else. While we don’t use SEO, PPC, or social media advertising (digital marketing or paid traffic) to grow our agency, we have a comprehensive blog strategy. And our blog CTAs convert these into income-producing assets. Best I can tell, this can only be done with HubSpot. There may be another way to do this with another platform, but I haven’t found it. And this is how WE handle our blogs at eLaunchers. We write two blogs a week. They are short, one-idea blogs without soap opera sequences. Each stands alone. They are typically around 750-ish words and have an image to draw attention to the article. Our writer creates a blog header and the content of the blog, then adds a compelling image. They write a month’s worth of blogs in the last week of the preceding month. This means that February’s blogs are written in the last week of January. This keeps them timely and relevant. Next, our tech crew places the blogs on HubSpot and queues them up for publishing twice

-----

###### a week. This is then done automatically. This means on the designated day and time—for us, Wednesdays and Fridays—HubSpot publishes the blog and pushes it to our social media platforms as posts. On top of that, HubSpot automatically sends an email to our entire blog subscription list once a month. This goes to several thousand people. These blogs contain no pitch. No close. Nothing. Just pure education and some good, wholesome fun. At the end, there’s typically a soft offer and call to action, basically inviting them to contact us if they want help or have questions. We keep an eye on WHO opens the blog emails and WHO clicks on the blog links to read more.
 Our office manager (also our database administrator and business analyst) goes through the ACTIVE READERS and sends a sales letter with Shock & Awe packages via FedEx.
 This powerful way of communicating with leads and generating new clients is an important benchmark test we use to determine if converting to HubSpot is right for a new client. We call it our $75K Rule. Unless you’re likely to generate $75,000 in net new revenue using HubSpot with the formula I just outlined and a few other HubSpot automation tricks, we do not recommend you buy the platform. This is why many of our clients and friends use Keap instead of HubSpot.
 If you’d like to experience our blogs and compare them to your own, I invite you to do the following. Schedule a Zoom meeting with your staff. Go to www.elaunchers.com/blog. Read some of the blogs. Check out the CTA (call to action) on the blog and article pages. See how I use the top right-hand corner (the golden spot) to my advantage. Explain to your team what you like and dislike about my blogs. Ignore the typos. They are there for reasons I won’t go into in this book. After this, go to your blog page and explain what you have to your staff. Then, compare the two experiences. If

#### What about Landing Pages and Funnels?

###### When we need a simple funnel, we use HubSpot or Keap. We reserve ClickFunnels for more complex funnels that require certain functionalities unique to ClickFunnels. The site www.meetparthiv.com is an excellent example of a simple landing page we built on HubSpot.
 We use “cookies” to track someone who comes to one of our landing pages but does not fill out the form. If someone is already on our list and clicks on a blog article and then moves on to a landing page, but leaves without saying hello, we can reach out to them. Here’s an example of how this might work. You’re on my blog distribution list. You’re going through your emails. See my blog. Click to open the email. This blog has a default call-to-action (book a time with me at www.meetparthiv.com). You click the link. You’re directed to my appointment page. You look around, but, for whatever reason, decide not to book. But I know you were there. I know you’re thinking about booking an appointment. I know you hesitated. Now, I get to act. I could use an automated response. In my case, I prefer having my staff reach out to you. You’ll get a phone call. You’ll get an email. A text. Maybe also FedEx. With HubSpot, I manage my funnel and landing page AND gain valuable insight into who is responding. This allows me to automate my marketing efforts and capture valuable information about prospective clients.

#### What about Web Forms?

-----

###### Web forms are precious digital marketing property. You use them to collect user information, generate leads, and communicate with clients and prospects. There are various types of web forms, including:

Feedback and Survey forms—great for gathering feedback from clients, patients, and
patrons about their experience with your business or product. This helps you understand the
customer experience and identify areas for improvement.
Order forms—vital to anyone selling anything online.
Referral forms—an easy and inexpensive way to drum up business and turn satisfied
customers into your biggest fans.
