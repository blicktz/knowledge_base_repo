#### INTRODUCTION

## What to Expect in this Book and How to
 Best Profit by It

##### by Dan Kennedy

 ou are smarter than the average bear in the woods!
 Congratulations. Most business owners foolishly focus morning, noon, and night on—new customers. The people captaining America’s big,

# Ydumb corporations are the biggest fools about this, but small-business

##### owners who can’t afford the luxury are often just as guilty. Here, quickly, are the sins . . .


#### #1: Reluctance to Invest in Retention
##### Key word: invest. While spending untold—and often unknown—sums on pursuing new customers, dollars poured into advertising, marketing, exhibiting at shows, producing videos, running deeply discounted promotional offers “for first time customers only,” business operators get the shakes at the thought of investing money in the customers they’ve already acquired and are doing business with. In order to achieve maximum retention and referrals, you will have to change your investing priorities!


-----

#### #2: No Alarm System for Customers About to Be Lost
##### Few customers depart abruptly. Those are obvious, typically over an unresolved complaint or dispute. Most gradually lose interest and wander off. They show signs, but business owners don’t bother to read or respond to them. In Chapter 16, we discuss the Alarm System needed to catch customers before they become lost to you.

#### #3: No Rescue System for Lost Customers
##### Incredibly, most business owners just accept their losses—as normal, as inevitable, or as beyond their control, blaming cheaper competitors or even blaming the customers for lack of appreciation and loyalty. Some customer loss is unavoidable. They move away, they die, their brother-in-law gets in the business. But most lost customers have the potential to be rescued. Chapter 16 describes a Rescue System.

#### #4: No Customer Multiplier System
##### Referrals are expected and taken for granted. A lot of this is due to the disease of our time: entitlement. It is rotting our society. Referrals are also viewed by most business owners as unmanageable, as random acts by customers. The idea of organizing a system around referrals seems like trying to get backyard fireflies to fly in formation. But, by the time you have finished this book, you will have all the makings of your own Customer Multiplier System.

#### Confession of an Ad Man: A Few Words about Sticky Glue and
 Solid Foundations
##### As I said, you are smarter than the average bear. Proof, that you are reading this book about a subject that most business operators are not interested in. You might argue that, as an “ad man,” I’m not very smart, writing such a book, but I have ulterior motives, which you may well deduce and find as worthy of being a key objective for you as well. Anyway, you are here, at


-----

##### least open-minded about doing some different things to keep customers active over a long tenure and to grow by “customer get a customer.”
 I am an “Advertising Man,” a modern day Mad Man, like Draper and the others at Sterling-Cooper you watched on TV. I started in the ’70s, not the ’50s, but the ad business hadn’t changed much in those 20 years. It was, and still is, about getting clients to spend as much as possible in vague pursuit of new customers in the least measurable ways they could be seduced into using. Please read that again: about getting clients to spend as much as possible in vague pursuit of new customers in the least measurable ways they could be seduced into using. This is because ad agencies are customarily compensated by a disclosed percentage of your expenditures, plus, usually, undisclosed “under the table” money from the media outlets they place your advertising with. Make no mistake about the media itself either, whether “old” or “new.” Google and Facebook are not about delivering customers to you at the lowest cost or with the best efficiency. They are about having you spend as much as possible using them. I started with a traditional, normal, and customary approach to the ad agency business, but quickly became allergic to the stench of the b.s. sold to the clients, and I switched to direct marketing. You can—and should—read about the conversion, and the way you can make over any business’s marketing as an investment instead of an expense, in the book No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses, Second Edition.
 I have made much of my living and, ultimately, my fortune over 40 years by developing effective direct-response advertising and direct marketing campaigns for clients and by teaching my methods to both professional advertising copywriters and agency teams and to independent business owners of every stripe so they can be better DIYs. Yet I often advise against my most immediate self-interest. Often, a client comes to me to get new or better ads—be that print, direct mail, online, radio, or TV. And often, after a little investigation, I discourage them from such investment because they do not have their internal act together and they are squandering so much opportunity with their existing customers (and leads) that producing more by more advertising is like forcing more gasoline into an overfull tank. It just spills out all over the pavement.

##### My co-author and chief organizer of this book, Shaun Buck, is more obvious about his role. He presents himself as a retention and referrals guy, far more than a new customer generator. His main company, The Newsletter Pro, specializes in custom customer newsletters that serve as sticky glue to keep customers interested in a business and as stimulus to get customers telling others about the business. The same kind of newsletter program also provides the solid foundation for marketing more to existent customers, to increase their value during their life with you just as it extends that tenure by months or years. I have strong appreciation for this because I have never been without at least one of my own newsletters performing these functions for me throughout my entire business career. Interestingly, a number of my peers and competitors have copycatted many things I do but have not copied this, the most valuable thing of all. Consequently, I built companies with equity, executed sales, and amassed wealth through my businesses while they just kept earning most of their income through unchanging manual labor and uncertain, erratic income events, and after 30 or 40 years, still need tomorrow’s new customer to pay yesterday’s bills.

#### How to End INCOME UNCERTAINTY
##### My work and Shaun’s work intersect—to keep, escalate value of, and multiply customers so that your entire business grows ever more valuable and sustainable, and income uncertainty is replaced with very predictable income.
 Having very predictable income should be a vital goal. Income uncertainty plagues most business owners and often perpetuates an underlying tension and unhappiness at home with spouse and family. It’s why even quite successful business owners and sales professionals often half-joke about the people close to them still hoping they’ll “settle down and get a good job.” Income uncertainty or unpredictable revenue also injects underlying anxiety into the staff of the business, and gets in the way of their top performance. When you steady the income, you gain authority with those around you. People have confidence in you. They are more cooperative. There’s less complaining. You and they can focus on forward achievement rather than worrying. One of the best cures for income


-----

##### uncertainty is improvements in and systemization of customer retention and multiplication through referrals.
 Very predictable income makes businesses more pleasurable to own, easier to manage, and much more valuable when the day comes for exit by sale. When properly presented to potential buyers of a company, predictable income has a higher multiple value than does unpredictable income. Recurring revenue has an even higher multiple. One of the key things an owner actually sells when he sells his company is projected future earnings at a discount. The more certain those future earnings appear to be, the less he has to discount and the more money he exits the scene with.
 When you go out the back door of this book, three things should have occurred: one, you having a far richer and better understanding of the financial importance of retention and referrals; two, you having all the elements needed to assemble systems for achieving maximum retention and referrals in your particular business; three, you being highly motivated and determined to get those systems up and running. Arguably, presuming some of the first and third are already present, the second of these is most important. And the key word is systems.
 I teach that all wealth is the product of systems. Henry Ford’s wealth and the Ford family dynasty wealth he set in motion is not the product of any invention of combustible engine or automobile. It is thanks to the system of the assembly line for manufacturing (vs. the traditional one-man- makes-one-product approach) and the system of franchised auto dealers (investing their money in the inventory and distribution). You can peel back the curtain of just about any successful company in any field and make similar discoveries. Our friend Michael Gerber popularized the idea of systems in business in his groundbreaking, bestselling book The E-Myth. Preceding Gerber, credit is deservedly given to Peter Drucker. But most business owners apply the direction given by such men only to management, to business operations, not to marketing or sales, and almost never to retention and referrals. If you do so, prompted by this book, you will gain significant competitive advantage, you may gain price and profit elasticity, and you can build a stronger and more valuable company!
 One last point: this book contains chapters from a small, select group of Special Guests. All have their own way of maximizing customer interest, retention, and value or of multiplying customers through referrals. Each

##### does an outstanding job at this, in very different businesses. Do NOT make the common, dumb mistake of quickly deciding their examples can’t help you because your business is different. First of all, no business is fundamentally different. All businesses have to get, make active, keep as long as possible, grow as valuable as possible, and clone or multiply customers. At least, that’s what every business should be doing. Don’t be myopic. Second, most breakthroughs in one type of business come about by borrowing ideas from other, seemingly unrelated businesses. Don’t be Amish. Be curious and imaginative.

#### CHAPTER 1

## NOT Running with the Pack

##### by Shaun Buck

 re you a “pack animal”?
 If you live in, follow, and hunt with the pack, you may feel safe and safer than you really are, but you will also be controlled, regulated, sometimes bullied, and often go hungry.

# APacks starve together. Packs sometimes are mass-hunted and killed as a

##### group. Packs go extinct as one. If you carefully examine business history as well as contemporary business, you’ll find that nearly all the really big winners have defied and distanced themselves from their peer packs.
 I was 16 years old when I got the phone call that would set my life on a trajectory I never could have imagined. It was my ex-girlfriend calling to tell me she was pregnant. For a few seconds, I was confused. Why was she calling me? That’s when she said it: “The baby is yours.”
 My response was what you would expect from a 16-year-old guy. “Are you sure it’s mine?” I asked. She was sure. Suddenly, I was one of two parents to this unborn baby, and we had a number of decisions to make. As a teenage dad, I had to make a couple for myself as well: Would I stick around? Would I (or even should I) try to be a part of this baby’s life?
 At 16 years old, I suddenly had to decide the kind of man I wanted to be. I had a few friends, most of them older, who also had to make the


-----

##### decision of what to do with an unexpected baby. Unfortunately, without exception, they all bailed on their responsibilities in one way or another. I decided to head in a different direction; I decided to be a dad. That single decision was my first real experience in breaking away from the pack and heading down my own path.
 It has since been my experience that, in life, and in business as well, breaking away from the pack is most often exactly the right thing to do. So, the fact that the overwhelming majority of business owners invest comparatively little or nothing in customer retention and invest almost every dollar they can into customer acquisition speaks loudly about the right thing to do.

#### They Can Take Their Jobs and Shove ’Em!
##### At 21 years old, I made another big decision. At the time, I was working for AT&T and was making a six-figure yearly income. Not bad pay for a young guy. After reading a number of business books and taking a few business courses over the years in college, I developed an idea: A job, even a good job, was never going to give me the size and scope of opportunity that I wanted. I decided to quit my job and become an entrepreneur. My first business? A pair of hotdog stands located in front of Lowe’s Home Improvement.
 My first year of income was $36,000. Not horrible for a young guy, but a far cry from the six figures I was making with AT&T. Many of my peers and family members thought I was crazy (my mom still thinks I’m crazy for not getting a safe and secure job), but sticking with the safe and secure job at AT&T was not what I wanted for my future. My pack circled me and did all it could to discourage my leaving! Although entrepreneurship is more in vogue today than it was in 2001, it is still considered risky and odd. The focus of polite society is still on jobs and careers, not taking on the outsized responsibility and risk of starting a business. While the media does make heroes out of Silicon Valley business creators, the lesson seems lost. And people starting hot dog stands are rarely glamorized. The news media coverage of the recent years’ reputed drought of proper jobs for college graduates, the debt burden with which they exit campus, the big number of


-----

##### them living in their parents’ basements, and the news coverage of high unemployment and stagnant wages stays stubbornly, narrowly focused on jobs—as if that was the only answer that exists. This is not so. In fact, if you learn; really, really learn “marketing” and how to apply it, your choice of opportunities in your choice of fields, professions, or industries opens up and you don’t need to wait for anybody else to confer your hoped-for wages on you. That puts you in opposition to the thinking and behavior of the pack.
 These days, I spend a lot of my time as a facilitator and supporter of people traveling their own chosen paths, building businesses of their own choosing.
 One of my more recent departures from the movement of the pack was when I founded my current company, The Newsletter Pro. While most of my friends were starting internet-based marketing companies or SEO (search engine optimization) companies, I was going into the “old- fashioned” print newsletter business. Yes, printing. On paper from trees. With ink. Producing newsletters for businesses, sent to their customers. By mail. With stamps. Not email. Not ezines. Not social media. Print newsletters.
 Naturally, there were naysayers who told me my business model would never work, but again I disregarded the pack. I ignored the numerous articles predicting the demise of the post office (a constitutionally guaranteed service). I ignored the articles on predicting Facebook world domination and went on creating my business, which in four short years went from an idea to mailing millions of print newsletters annually, and it is still growing month in and month out today. At The Newsletter Pro, we have clients in professional practices and various businesses, some mailing thousands, some mailing tens of thousands of the newsletters we prepare for them every month. Combined, we are a little “underground resistance movement” against digital depersonalization. Most importantly, we get stellar results.
 While I have found success in the print newsletter business, I understand that others still find it to be an odd choice of niches. I agree—it is a bit odd—but there is a method to my madness.
 Since 2002, I have always been hyperfocused on customer retention. So much so that when I bought my second business, a dry cleaning pickup and
