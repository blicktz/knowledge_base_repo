discipline alone is so powerful it literally determines success or
failure?

The discipline that I am talking about is punctuality. Being
punctual. Being where you are supposed to be when you are supposed to be there, as promised, without exception, without
excuse, every time, all the time. I cannot tell you how important

I believe this is. But I'll tell you some of the reasons why I believe
in its indescribably great importance.

First of all, being punctual gives you the right—the position-ing—to
expect and demand that others treat your time with
utmost respect. You cannot reasonably hope to have others treat
your time with respect if you show little or no respect for theirs.
So, if you are not punctual, you have no leverage, no moral
authority. But the punctual person gains that advantage over
staff, associates, vendors, clients, everybody.

Punctuality provides personal power.

###### The Tragic Case of the Doctor Who Couldn't Tell Time
Some years back, I had a client, a doctor of chiropractic, with a
million dollar a year practice and a rather large staff. It was particularly vexing to him that he was unable to rely on any of his
staff members to be punctual. Some were habitually late getting
to work on time. Others were habitually late getting back from
lunch. Others habitually fell behind in getting important paperwork done. And so on. He tried everything—punishments and rewards—and
nothing worked. Why? In all the years I knew him,
I can't recall this doctor ever getting anywhere on time himself.

le was even 20 minutes late one morning picking me up at my liotel

so I could go and teach a time management seminar to his
staff! Incredibly, my client never acknowledged the obvious
problem here. Maybe there weren't any mirrors in his house.

###### The Telling Connection Between Punctuality and Integrity It
is my conviction that a person who cannot keep appointments
on time, cannot keep scheduled commitments, or cannot stick to
a schedule cannot be trusted in other ways either.

Fundamental dishonesty expresses itself in many different
ways, but this is definitely one of them. I think it is significant that
the man I consider to be the most frequently and consistently dishonest and disreputable U.S. president of my lifetime, Bill Clinton—famous

for his tortured deconstruction of the word "is"—was
also notorious for being on "Clinton Time"—meaning
anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours late to everything, thus
being disrespectful to everyone.

There is a link between respect for others' time and respect
for others' opinions, property, rights, other kinds of agreements,
and contracts. A person reveals a great deal about himself by his
punctuality or lack of punctuality. So, as a general rule of thumb,
I use this as a means of determining whether or not I want to do
business with someone. And, when I violate this, as I occasionally
foolishly do, I always get burned.

Let me give you one example: a person seeking to do business with me arranged to meet me at an airport, where I had a 90-minute

layover. We agreed, and I confirmed by fax that we
would meet at my arrival gate, at my arrival time, and then go to

that airline's club room right there on the concourse for the meeting. When I arrived, the guy wasn't there. Some ten minutes
later, I'm paged and told to meet him in the main terminal where
he is because he ran late getting to the airport. It takes me ten
minutes on the tram to get to the main terminal, and I have to cut
another ten minutes out of our meeting to allow time to get back
to my gate. I have to go through this to meet with a man so disrespectful of a commitment made and of my time that he cannot
organize his life to arrive at a meeting on time in his own home
city. If he could not be relied on to honor such an easy commitment, why should anybody believe he would honor more important ones?

Still, violating my own rule, I went ahead and accepted this
guy as a client. It was predictably ugly. He lied, he cheated, he
was completely disorganized, dysfunctional, and unreasonable.
He sucked up a pretty good chunk of my time and cost me thousands of dollars to get rid of him. It's not the first time this scenario has taken place in my life. I suppose it won't be the last. But
it IS a very reliable principle:

_People who can't be punctual,_ _can't be trusted._

For ten years, I appeared 25 to 30 times each year on the numberone speaking tour in America, often addressing audiences of
10,000 to 25,000 people at each event. I was privileged to appear
on these programs with many famous speakers, authors, politicians, entertainers, and business leaders, including Paul Harvey,
Larry King, the late Coach Tom Landry, Coach Lou Holtz, former
Presidents Bush and Ford, Rev. Robert Schuller, "cookie queen"
Debbi Fields, Olympians Mary Lou Retton and Bonnie Blair,
speakers Zig Ziglar and Tom Hopkins, and the list goes on and

on. As the last speaker on a long, full day's program, it was very
i mportant to me that the speaker ahead of me stuck to his allotted time and finished on time. It is the professional thing to do. It is

respectful to the audience, respectful to the person hiring the
speaker, and respectful to the speaker who follows. Most of these
speakers understood this and performed accordingly. However, General

Colin Powell, who I followed some 40 times, couldn't
quite get it done for some reason, typically running 5,10, or even 15
minutes long—but at least he graciously urged the audience to
be sure and stay to hear me. Each year, I sent him a gag-gift clock
of one kind or another as a Christmas gift and gentle reminder of "our"

little problem.
One time, I spoke after then New York Governor Mario
Cuomo at one of these events. He was an unbelievable time hog.
He didn't just go 5 or 10 minutes beyond his 45-minute time—he
went an unbelievable 20 minutes over! On stage, facing the governor, was a big, digital, red-lighted timer flashing 00:00 after his
time ran out, flashing 00:00 for 20 minutes! He ignored it. Staff
people signaled him from the side of the stage. He ignored them. I

wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him.

###### A Simple Way to Favorably Impress Others
Now, here's a "success secret" for you: I'm not the only person
to have figured out this punctuality-integrity link. I'm just not
_that smart. I've stumbled on something that a whole lot of_
other smart, successful, and influential people already know
and secretly use to make their determinations about who they
will buy from or not buy from, do business with or not do business with, help or not help, trust or distrust. If you are not a

punctual person, others you wish to positively influence negatively judge you.

If you think that successful people—people you want to deal with—do
not have their own little "systems" for judging people,
you're very naive. Not only do they have such a system, most
successful people make a point of having "instant reject criteria,"
to save time in determining who they want to deal with and who
they don't.

Just recently, the owner of a printing company was referred
to me by a mutual friend. The printing company owner knew we
spent a lot of money on printing and was understandably eager
to try and get a piece of that business. He came to a meeting prepared with a beautiful portfolio of samples, carefully calculated
price proposals, and enthusiastic promises. I sat through it all
politely, but I'd made up my mind not to try him out before he
even got to the meeting—because he was 20 minutes late getting
there. Harsh? Maybe. I'd call it "tough-minded." Getting our
printing on time, as scheduled, as promised is critically important. Printed component parts of my products arrive on

Wednesday to be assembled Thursday to ship Friday to a seminar site where I'll be appearing next Tuesday. A day late is as bad .is

a year late. For a direct-mail campaign, we may have half-a-ilozen

workers showing up on a given day to assemble sales let-lers,
brochures, and order forms; stuff envelopes; and get out a
mailing. If they arrive but the printing doesn't, nothing happens.
So when a printer can't get to the first meeting on time, I make
the "mental leap" to presuming he can't be relied on to get our jobs

done and delivered on time either.
One of my earliest business mentors said that there were only
two good reasons for being late for a meeting with him: one,
you're dead; two, you want to be.

So, to borrow from Dale Carnegie, if you want to win friends
and influence people, be punctual.

And, if you'd like to save yourself a lot of time and trouble,
start using this as a means of judging those who would do business with you.

###### Are Even a Person's Deepest, Darkest Psyche Secrets Revealed by Punctuality?
Punctuality even reveals a lot about an individual's self-esteem.
We all know that kids who vandalize other peoples' property for
sport, abuse their bodies with drugs, engage in promiscuous,
casual, unprotected sex, and otherwise sabotage themselves are,
in part, painfully demonstrating low self-esteem. They do not
feel that they are important; therefore, no one else and nothing
else is very important, and anyone or anything that does seem
important is deeply resented. I'd suggest that the adult who does
not keep such simple commitments as appointments is not only

to you that you and your time are unimportant but is
unwittingly revealing that he does not feel he and his time are
important either. He is, in essence, making a low self-esteem
statement.

Some people are deliberately late as a means of trying to be
and seem important. Their intended message is: I can keep you
waiting because I'm more important than you are. But the message they actually deliver, to those perceptive enough to read
behind the lines is: I don't have much self-respect, so I'm desperately trying to make myself feel more like a big shot by stealing
your time and getting away with it. Pathetic. And a big, fat warning signal. Deal with this person and you are letting yourself in
for all manner of abuse.
