###### An audience needs some reassurance that you deserve being listened to. The same presentation gets very different results if delivered by two different people and only one has and gives reasons why he has the right to talk about the subject and to talk to the audience in front of him. Are you part of a respected group or association? Are you an author? Have you been seen in relevant publications? Have you been seen on TV or heard on radio? Are you just another cosmetic surgeon, or are you THE cosmetic surgeon who wrote The Official Consumer’s Guide to Cosmetic Surgery . . . who lectured at known hospitals . . . who has been a guest on a popular TV show . . . who is certified in the technique favored by major movie stars? In short, you need to lay out your claims to fame at this point in your presentation.
 If you do not have any of this now, getting it is one of the many things we assist Speaking Empire clients with, in addition to the development of their Signature Presentation.

##### 4: Target Problems

###### Your audience entered the room, came to the webinar, started listening to your audio CD already in and with pain—if not physical, then in the broader sense: disappointment, frustration, recurring failure, anxiety,


-----

###### confusion. Everybody has something of this nature going on. For many people, it is simmering—not acute or urgent. At this point in your presentation, you want to draw it out and state it, turn up its heat, and make it acute and urgent. Relatively few people can be motivated by gain alone. Most move toward gain as a way of escaping pain.

##### 5: Deliver Solution

###### After you’ve dialed up the pain, it’s time to show the audience your solution. This may be your product or service, your diagnostic process, an appointment with you or exam by you, or otherwise engaging with you. I’ve made this fifth in the sequence. If you get to it too quickly, you have not laid groundwork needed for your solution to be readily accepted. If you get to it too late, you may frustrate your audience. There is a sweet spot in the sequence for this, and we’re confident from experience with literally thousands of presentations that this is it: fifth.
 A big mistake that a lot of people make with presentations is to move from stating the solution to teaching the solution. Unless you are a school teacher, with kids in a classroom, you do not want to actually teach. I guess I’m a salesman by instinct or impulse, so this was not hard for me to understand and accept, but Dustin is a technical thinker, so his temptation is always to explain how and why something works as it does and exactly how to use it. He and I watch many people struggle with this. Decide on the purpose of your presentation: to influence or persuade, to make an immediate sale, or to set in motion a selling process. Decide on the action you want from the audience. Everything in the presentation is to serve this purpose, and anything that doesn’t gets left, as they say in Hollywood, on the cutting room floor. Real teaching almost always goes six steps too far and raises as many doubts and questions as it answers. You want people to know you have a solution and to be excited about it without getting bogged down in its details.

##### 6: Set Expectations


-----

###### An audience needs to know where they are going with you. They don’t want to board an airplane, embark on a cruise, or join you in your presentation without a good idea of the destination and the landmark points along the way. Any uncertainty raises anxiety. So, you need to tell them what you are going to tell them.
 Also on a more sophisticated level, you want to try to direct and control their reactions to your presentation. This is sometimes called framing or pre-framing. By setting these expectations, you create an open loop in their minds, particularly in their subconscious minds. How they feel about and respond to what you say, do, and ask of them during the rest of your presentation will loop back to what you told them to expect.
 I often use a very simple, four-point “rap” in my presentations that goes something like this:

 I’ve got three rules before we begin . . . Rule #1: We’re going to have fun. Is it OK with everybody if we have fun? Good. Rule #2: I promise to give you 110%. Is it OK with everybody if I give you 110%? Good. Rule #3: This is going to be an interactive presentation. The more you give to me, the more feedback I get, the more I give to you. Is that fair? Great. Then the bonus Rule #4 is: You’ll take action. You won’t just listen and leave. You’ll decide and do. You know success comes down to taking action, right? Great . . .

 This creates a “yes energy” with the audience. When the time comes for them to make a (buying) decision and take an action, they have been pre- framed to do it and have even agreed in advance to do it.

##### 7: Social Proof

###### When you present a product, service, or just an idea, people have objections and doubts. Most buyers start out as nonbuyers. Most believers start out as skeptics. Maybe, in their mind, they’re saying, “I don’t have time,” or, “it won’t work for me.” They’re saying something, and it will likely be a reason not to go forward. The antidote is targeted social proof. When we build a presentation for and with a Speaking Empire client, we typically


-----

###### identify 5 to 7 typical objections or doubts likely held by large percentages of their audiences. Then we find 5 to 7 matching social proof stories, testimonials, or fact-filled case histories. Each erases one of the 5, 6, or 7.

##### 8: Show Benefits

###### This is elementary, but it still needs to be said: People do not buy a product to have the product or even because of its features. They don’t even buy the benefits of the product. They buy the benefits of the benefits. Nobody buys fast-drying paint because it dries fast, or even because of the benefit of that: less chances of it being touched, smudged, dirt falling onto it. They’re buying time and freedom (from drudgery). Virtually every presentation needs at least one slide that lists or depicts the benefits of the benefits.

##### 9: Irresistible Offer

###### Think about offers as “1 to 10.” 1 is basic, ordinary, and/or unexciting. 10 is absolutely overpowering, “must have,” urgent, and exciting. Think about the offer you are going to make with your presentation. Is it a 1, a 3, a 5, a 7? It is hard to get to 10—to absolutely irresistible—but the closer you get, the better. A great presentation can fall flat and fail if it brings everybody to an unexciting offer.
 Usually, you will build value by listing and describing every separate item of the product or service, or even of something like a private appointment, call, or exam. For health-care practices, Dan Kennedy invented the “5 Questions That Will Be Answered at Your Exam” and “What To Expect at Your First Appointment” lists back in the 1980s and has kept these in health-care practice and financial services marketing to this day.
 There’s a lot more about this in Dustin’s Chapter 6 on Irresistible Offer Architecture®.

##### 10: No-Risk Guarantee


-----

###### The number-one reason people do not respond to the offer you make with your presentation is that they feel they were let down by somebody else. As you are presenting, they are remembering! A strong, simple, straightforward guarantee gives them needed reassurance that they can make a decision with you without getting burned.
 You might ask: How long should a guarantee be? I’ve done extensive testing of this myself. In over 3,000 presentations for my own products and services, I’ve offered 7-day, 30-day, 6-month, and 12-month guarantees. Which do you think converted the best?
 Most guess 12 months. Actually, there’s very little difference between 7 days, 12 months, and anything in between. What matters is that you have an appropriate guarantee. If they can judge in 7 days, then that’s fine. If they need a month, then a month. What’s most important is that you have a guarantee, period. (See Figure 5.2.)

##### 11: Give Deadline

###### In Point 9 on page 36, I talked about how you build value as part of an Irresistible Offer. You create urgency to act immediately with a deadline and with fast-action bonuses. People procrastinate. It’s what they do.

 FIGURE 5.2: Guarantee


-----

###### The last thing you want is a presentation that lets the audience off the hook and lets them meander out of the room or exit your webinar to think things over. The whole point of doing powerful group presentations is efficiency. The last thing you want to wind up doing is chasing people who saw your presentation, by email, mail, or phone. My goal is to have a presentation that will have people dancing and running—not walking—to the back of the room to buy or sign up for whatever next step is offered.
 A lot of people will do this with now-or-never discounts. This can be effective, but I personally never like lowering prices because it’s what everybody does. Other techniques are fast-action bonuses, a limited bonus only for the first x-number, or an impending event, like a fast-start class, breakfast, lunch, or online session within hours or the very next day. In any case, the deadline itself must be very clear. If for some reason, it is not immediate and it is within, say, 90 minutes after the webinar, consider displaying a countdown clock by the order page and sending at least one email going out: “Just 29 minutes left.”

##### 12: Call to Action

###### I see so many people who seem afraid to make the call to action and tell people exactly what to do and to do it now. You need to be very direct about this. You can tell them to get up and go to the table at the back to schedule an appointment or quickly complete a form and buy the product. You can have forms handed out as you are getting to this point in your presentation and tell them to fill them out and take them to back tables, “the folks in the red jackets at the doors,” or to bring them up to the front to you. If you are delivering your presentation in a physical location, it’s a bad idea to be sending them to some location outside of that room and out of your sight. If you are delivering a presentation online as a webinar or webcast, this step should be easy and seamless. Whatever they are supposed to do as the response to your presentation, they should be told exactly what to do.
 I want to emphasize that you can count on this Formula. I have written over 500 presentations for use in 43 different industries and professions, in 109 countries around the world! With a Signature Presentation built with this Formula you really can go ANYWHERE and sell ANYTHING.

##### CHAPTER 6

### Irresistible Offer Architecture®

###### by Dustin Mathews

 ersuading people can be extremely difficult, just difficult, comparatively easy, or very easy. One of the things that moves the needle on that scale is the offer itself. A lot of people do not understand this. They worry over every other part of a presentation,

# Pparticularly the visual elements—slides, graphics, video, stories,

###### and themselves. Ultimately, people buy what they really want and do what they really want to do. When an offer connects with that, it alone can drive extraordinary results from an un-ordinary, just serviceable presentation.
 When you have an irresistible offer advantage, you can:

 • Sell without having to hard sell;
 • Sell at a premium price instead of a price like competitors’ or at
 discounts;
 • Attract new clients, patients, or customers easily.

 I created what we now use at Speaking Empire for just about every presentation we build, our Irresistible Offer Architecture®, out of a need to have a blueprint that would enable any speaker or presenter to offer any product or service to any audience anywhere, by any media, and get a


-----

###### desirable result. Further, I wanted it to be “fill in the blank” quick, because, frankly, a lot of people find themselves getting opportunities to speak and giving presentations without the time or without taking time to properly prepare. This blueprint or template allows you to put an offer together on the fly. I confess, I’ve done it myself.
 There are nine keys to Irresistible Offer Architecture®, which I’ve organized into three triangles shown in Figure 6.1 on page 43.

##### Triangle 1: Hot Buttons

###### Different people have different Hot Buttons (see Figure 6.2, page 44). A Hot Button is the one that, when pushed, sets off the strongest possible “I want that—and I want it now—regardless of what I have to do or pay” response. Think about yourself: You do have at least one if not several such buttons, just as you have a Hot Button that triggers your temper, a Hot Button that triggers sexual arousal, and so on. This is why the Audience Knowledge that Dan Kennedy described in Chapter 3 and the benefits of benefits secret that Dave revealed in Chapter 5 are so important.
 Let’s assume you have a product or service that is just not connecting with the Hot Buttons of your audience members and you can’t figure out why. I always challenge myself with this: I suppose that no one in my audience will be Hot-Button motivated by any part of my product, service, or offer. Maybe I’m doing a presentation about cancer, offering colonoscopy exams, or I’m a CPA offering a second-opinion review of your last three years’ tax returns. They have benefits and benefits of benefits, but still, they aren’t exciting. I will turn to the bonus. One of the most famous examples of this, from TV commercials—which are presentations—comes from Sports Illustrated magazine. A great presentation about Sports Illustrated might sell an acceptable number of subscriptions, but offering the “football phone” (yes, before smartphones, in the days of landlines) sold an amazing number of subscriptions. People who didn’t really care about the magazine couldn’t resist the football-shaped phone. Keywords: couldn’t resist. This ties to Triangle 2.

##### Triangle 2: Added Value

###### Everything has intrinsic value. Here is the dictionary definition of intrinsic:

 intrinsic adjective belonging naturally; essential: access to the arts is intrinsic to a high quality of life.
 • (of a muscle) contained wholly within the organ on which it acts.

 DERIVATIVES intrinsically adverb ORIGIN late 15th cent. (in the general sense [interior, inner]): from French intrinsèque, from late Latin intrinsecus, from the earlier adverb intrinsecus “inwardly, inward.”

 Thesaurus


-----

###### intrinsic an intrinsic eye for fashion, inherent, innate, inborn, inbred, congenital, connate, natural; deep-rooted, deep-seated, indelible, ineradicable, ingrained; integral, basic, fundamental, essential; built- in.

 In other words—it’s about what something is. But a truly powerful presentation of any product or service focuses on personal and emotional reasons to have it. Its value is made by those things. For example, we know that scarcity or assumed or perceived scarcity causes people to make buying decisions faster and to pay more than they would if buying in a calmer environment. Go to an auction and watch this happen all around you. You’ll even hear bidding stall, often at a right price, then start up again in a renewed frenzy when just one person surrenders to pressure and bids a new, higher number.
 Marketers talk about price-value equations (see Figure 6.3 on page 46). You could picture a two-sided scale, with price on one side and value on the other. When value feels like it is much, much higher than price, people in an audience surrender to an irresistible price-value equation. They literally sat there watching, saying to themselves, “No, I’m not going to buy this. No, I’m still not going to buy this. No, I’m s-t-i-l-l n-o-t going to buy this. Oh, OK, gee, how could I not buy this?”
