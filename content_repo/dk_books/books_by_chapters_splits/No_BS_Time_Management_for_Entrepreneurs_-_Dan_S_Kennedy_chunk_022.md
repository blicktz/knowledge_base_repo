So, if you insist on hanging around people with nominal
integrity, you will soon find yourself lying, cheating, conning,
stealing, and abusing with greater and greater ease, less and less
guilt. Hanging around poor people is no way to grow rich. And
if you hang around people who place very little value on time—
theirs, others', or passing time in general—your own productivity will diminish.

Any tennis player, golfer, or other athlete will tell you: if you
really want to improve your game, practice and play with people
a notch or two better at it than you are.

That's why it's best to associate yourself with busy, productive, effective, successful people. And to eradicate the real time
wasters from your life. Manana

When you go to Mexico—or for that matter, Nassau, a favorite of mine—you
have to take off your watch and force yourself into
slow motion, because these people have absolutely no sense of
urgency whatsoever. And nothing you might do will alter that. If
you can't put yourself into that mode and enjoy it, stay away. You
might hurt somebody.

Of course, that's fine on vacation. But it is very frustrating
for me to deal with so many people in business who have so little urgency. Most people do take the attitude that whatever we

don't get done today, we'll get to tomorrow, and what's the big
deal?

Instilling a continuing, constant sense of urgency in others is
extremely difficult. A few get it. Most don't. This is one of a collection of reasons that, contrary to all of government's ill-fated,
Robin Hoodesque efforts, 5% of the people get 95% of the money.
We have a sense of urgency the 95%ers don't.

If it really matters to you whether a letter gets out today or
tomorrow, whether a mailing makes it out on Friday so it moves
over the weekend or waits until Monday, or whether a project
gets finished as promised, then you automatically get more done
than just about everybody else because those things matter little
to them.

Most folks work slow. Watch 'em. There is an old time management axiom: work expands to fill the time available to do it.
For most people work expands, period. And very few people
ever complete a project before time runs out and come looking
for something else to do. In my operation, when my mother left
the office, it would have taken three "regular" employees to
replace her if my wife hadn't stepped in. But most people work
slow. I watch them with amazement. Make a phone call, take a
break.

You should learn to work fast(er).

It makes you sharper.

I like to put myself under the time-gun to get things done.

you're a caretaker, when the trainer takes your horse out for his
morning workout, you've got about 15 minutes or a bit less to get
that horse's stall mucked and bedded down with fresh straw, the
feed bucket cleaned, fresh water in the water bucket, and the next
horse harnessed and ready to go before the trainer returns. It
takes about 13 minutes to do all that if you work fast and non­
stop. That's a time-gun. In many cases today, I know in my head
how much time it should take me to do a certain project, and
that's all the time I allot for it.

###### How to Use the Home Office to Increase Personal Productivity

_You can't have everything. Where would you put it? —COMEDIAN_

**STEVEN WRIGHT**

My client, friend, and, most recently, joint venture partner Jeff
Paul wrote a marvelous little book, How to Make $4,000.00 a Day,
_Sitting at Home, in Your Underwear. More than 300,000 copies have_
been sold. The book is actually about how to succeed in the mail­
order business, but it turns out that the title has struck a chord
with hundreds of thousands of people. Response, when the book
was advertised in national magazines, was incredible. Why?
Because people have just about had it with one-to-two-hour commutes, bumper to bumper, inch by inch, surrounded by toxic
exhaust fumes.

There are now an estimated 65 million people working from
home, some full-time, some part-time. And that number keeps
increasing, thanks to evolving employer flexibility, entrepreneurial growth, new and improved technology, and worsening commutes. Those of us in marketing have coined the name "S0H0

Market" to describe the small or "micro" business and homeoperated business explosion. Most new home builders are putting home office rooms in the model homes.

Back when I wrote the first edition of this book, Home Office
_Computing magazine's surveys indicated that 96% to 98% of the_
people working from home were happier than they were working at an off-site store or office, and would recommend it as a
lifestyle to others. I hear both viewpoints from my clients. Some
find they cannot work at home, mostly because of their own
inability to avoid readily available distractions. Most, however,
prefer it, and believe they are more productive. A telecommuting
consultant quoted in Paul and Sarah Edwards' book Working
_from Home insists that measured productivity increases by 15% to_
25% when working from home.

**I can be from bed and bath to productivity in five minutes.**
If you have a 45-minute commute, that 90-minute daily round
trip takes nine work weeks of possible productivity right out of
your calendar. On January 1, you can cross off two months plus
a week. Making this up, just to get back to even, takes a multiple
of that. Not to mention the attitudinal impact of a smelly, grungy,
aggravating, and often hazardous, daily commute.

When I am able to spend the entire day working at home, I
do not take off for an hour or hour and a half to go to lunch; I
walk over to the kitchen, make myself lunch, (eat healthier more
often than not), and happily munch while I mush on. I get to
make telephone calls while sitting in my massager-recliner, having a back massage, or out on my deck. There are few, if any,
interruptions, so I gain momentum, and get more done. So much
more that I can take an hour-or-so afternoon nap and still be way
ahead of what I would have accomplished in a conventional
office environment. Why wouldn't you want to work this way?

Yes, there are trade-offs. Office invariably expands from its
confined, single room to other places in the house. Maybe the
business is more on your mind (I'm not sure). To me, it's a trade
worth making.

Different people find different settings lead to their best productivity. Thoreau had to go off and sit by a pond, away from
everybody else, to be productive. If that's what you find you
have to do, grab some mosquito repellent, hook up a cell phone
and fax in your car if you want, pack a lunch, and head off into
the sunrise. My friend Jeff Paul cannot stand the sight of a neck­
tie and is at his best in old, grubby sweats, at home. Fine. Some
people need the socialization of being in an office or office building with other people. If that's you, then the whole idea of working from home may be wrong although there are ways to inject
socialization: taking a coffee break and calling a friend, for example. You ought to experiment a bit, figure out what works best for
you, and do that.

###### How to Drown in Opportunity and Success Just

_say "No."—NANCY_

**REAGAN**
Most entrepreneurs go through long periods of struggle and suffering before achieving what often looks to the outside observer
like "overnight success." I spent years laboring in oblivion, even
ignominy. I have had cars repossessed, been hounded by creditors, gone bankrupt, been so broke that I've had to scrounge
change from under the couch cushions to get something to eat,
driven old "beater" cars. I have been ridiculed, ignored, and
abused. I have had enough of all this to be very, very appreciative of opportunity and good fortune. And to worry that it could

all dry up tomorrow morning, too. In some respects, this paranoia is healthy. I have seen the opposite many times: the person
on a roll who starts buying into his own PR, believing it will
never end, spending like a drunken sailor, piling up overhead,
and treating people arrogantly. Then it does dry up. The crash is
brutal.

On the other hand, this paranoia makes it difficult to say "no."
Yet, the biggest single job of the time-conscious, productivityoriented entrepreneur is saying no.

Saying "no" to opportunity is painful. But necessary. Because
the more successful you get, the more opportunities flow your
way. People line up. But if you say "yes" to everybody and
everything, you will soon drown in your own success.

Determining what not to do today is also important. There
will always be more things to do than time available to do them.
More calls to make, more people to talk to, more places to go,
more details to check up on than there is time available to do
them. And this doesn't diminish with success; it becomes more so.

For the person eager to do things right, who aspires to "excellence," it is emotionally difficult to leave things undone, to know
that there are things that should have been attended to that
weren't. But you have to make that adjustment or age rapidly
before your time. You can only do what you can do; you cannot
do anymore. There's never a day that goes by without a phone
call or two I would like to have returned that are never made, letters I would like to have written that are undone, projects I'd love
to have completed that are never even looked at. All I can do
every day is start out with a plan, a list of priorities, make as few
reactive adjustments as possible during the day, and deal first
with the life-or-death priorities, and then on down the list. Have

_a powerful sense of urgency and do all that you can do, but then,_
when the clock runs out on your workday, relax.

When you make your "to-do lists," by the way, it's important
not to hopelessly overload the list. The tendency to pile on more
than can be done is understandable. I catch myself taking more
work with me on a road trip than I could possibly handle in three
trips. It's the same thing. But done consistently, it becomes
depressing. It decreases productivity. Again, deciding what not to
do is very important.

###### Short-Term, Medium-Term, and Long-Term Thinking

_If you don't know where you are going,_
_you might end up somewhere else. —YOGI_

**BERRA**
Early in my speaking career, a speaker and friend of mine, Keith
DeGreen suggested that a speaker should have a short-term market, where you work a lot early, to get experience, make money,
and pay the bills; a medium-term market, where you want to
become known and successful over a two-to-five-year term; and
a long-term market, where you want to sustain a career over 5 to
15 years. And you must devote some time to all 3 at once.

I used this idea specific to speaking, but I also apply it on a
broader basis. In fact, I think every entrepreneur ought to use it.
Right now, your short-term thinking has to be applied to the
exact business you're in today, as it is today: what can we do to
increase sales, attract new customers, better retain and do more
business with past customers, boost profits, solve management
problems, improve employees' performance, improve vendor
responsiveness, find capital?

But, at the same time, you must devote some time to mediumterm thinking: what do I want this business to be like two years,
three years, four years from now? What changes are happening
in my industry, in my community, with my customers that I must
keep pace with? The great speaker, the late Ira Hayes, called this
kind of thinking "keeping pace with tomorrow."

And, at the same time, you should devote some time to longterm thinking, integrating business with lifestyle: what do you
want your life to be like five to ten years down the road? I think
you need to be investing some time (and some money) in longterm plays, designed to start yielding benefits years down the
road.

###### Get Rid of Nuisances

_Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal nagging_
_on of an uncompleted task. —WILLIAM_

**JAMES**
From time to time, a "chore" will land in your lap that is repugnant. It may be an accounting matter, a problem employee, a government report, whatever. You'll catch yourself taking this off the
top of the pile, moving it to the bottom of the pile, over and over
again. Don't. The best thing to do with such a nuisance is do it
and get rid of it as quickly as possible. It ain't wine; it won't get
better with age. The longer you let one of these things hang
around, the more reluctance to deal with it you build up.

By the way, the best management advice I ever got was: hire
slow, fire fast. If you've got a problem employee hanging around,
you know it, he knows it, and, believe me, everybody else knows
it. The less decisive you are in dealing with it, the more problems

you'll have later with the other employees. Cut out the cancer
early and quick.

If you have clients, as I do, you'll want to get tough and quick
about ridding yourself of nuisance clients, too. Skip Ross, a very
successful distributor in a direct sales organization, impressed on
me that vacuums fill. Skip said: nature abhors a vacuum. Nature
will do just about anything to fill a vacuum. If you'd like some
nice, new clothes, go through your closet and take all the stuff
you don't wear to a charity. Leave two-thirds of that closet starkly
empty. You'll be amazed at how fast that thing will fill back up.
This "principle of vacuum" has served me very well over the
years. Just about every time I say no to or fire a troublesome,
high-maintenance client, that vacuum quickly fills with better
business. I know you'll find this to be true, too.

Montana do it. Even journeymen quarterbacks like Dave Krieg
have done it. We watched more contemporary quarterbacks pull
one of these off. We've seen entire teams play poorly for three
quarters, then suddenly seem to emerge from lethargy and ineptitude to score more points in four minutes than in the previous
40. And, if you're with a group of people watching one of these
fantastic finishes, some will always, logically ask, "Hey, why didn't
he play like that during the game? Where was all this talent an
hour ago?"

These guys suddenly get into "a place" where there's magic.
They can do no wrong. They can't fail.

Earl Nightingale once observed "that a time can come for
each of us when more will happen to us in six months than transpired in the previous five years. Compound events in our lives
can be compressed into remarkably short periods." This is a phenomenon. It is often the payoff an entrepreneur gets from years
of hard work, struggle, and sacrifice. It is peak productivity time.
Everything works. Opportunities abound. Doors swing open
easily. Recognition, even celebrity, occurs. Income soars.

When The Phenomenon occurs, everything speeds up. If
you're accustomed to a few new client prospects developing in a
week, you'll be flooded with a big multiple of that. The worthwhile demands on your time multiply like rabbits. Here's what
you do. Say "Thank You." Sleep less, gulp more vitamins, and go
with the flow. Be alert for this happening, then fan the fire. For a
brief time, you will want to loosen up your cautions about taking
on more than you can handle and embrace it all.
