144 ® _HO B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs_

A: The subject of "goals" or "goal-setting" is a very big umbrell.i.
What most people mean by goal-setting is writing down, usi i
ally in some detail, lists or collections of long-term, mediuir
term, and short-term goals. Most time management system
include weekly and daily to-do lists, which are really
another way of listing goals. And most goal-setting teaching
breaks down goals by category: business or career, financial,
personal, social, family, love relationship, self-improvement,
spiritual, and so forth. And J would say that there are a lot more
_successful entrepreneurs who follow this approach than there are_
_who don't._

Also, for many people, the disciplined act of focusing on
questions such as What do I really want? What do I want my
_business to be like in three years? and writing down answers is_
very productive in and of itself. _I've never known or met a suc-_
_cessful entrepreneur who wasn't a list maker. So I think it's diffi_
cult to mount a good argument against goal-setting. As you
get really good at goal-setting, get more in control of your
mind, and get more successful, you may do less of it and may
be a bit sketchier or broader in your view, but you'll still benefit
from the process. Personally, I have a bank of short-, medium-,
and long-term goals, some very clear and well-defined,
some fuzzy and evolving. I tend to work on them and check
my actions against them at least once a month.

As I understand it some lecturers contend that most people
just won't set goals, so why teach what people won't do? Not
much of a case, I think when you understand that highly successful people do what most folks aren't willing to do in all
aspects of behavior. Actually, the fact that 90% or 95% of the

people randomly surveyed have never written down
detailed goals and have no intention of doing so is the best
argument of all for doing it. When I did a lot of speaking on
this topic (I now specialize in seminars on marketing), I used
to spring this on audiences: I'd pull out a big wad of $100
bills and offer one to each person with some kind of written
goals on them in pockets, purses, or briefcases. Typically,
with 100 salespeople or entrepreneurs in a room, I'd only
have to give away a few bills. But here's what's instructive:
when I would later quiz those people, I'd routinely discover
that the ones who got the $100 bills needed them least
because they were the most successful individuals there.

**Q: What do you do when you fail to hit a goal? Or, more mun-**
danely, find that you can't meet a deadline?

A: Let's take the second one first. Business is all about the setting and meeting of deadlines. Meeting them is usually a
combination of being adept at estimating or forecasting the
amount of time you'll need, then blocking out that time, as
we discussed in this book, delegating or obtaining help if
possible, and having the self-discipline to do what proves
necessary to get the job done.

_If you are going to miss a deadline, and you wonder what to do,_ _just_
_do the right thing. Doing the right thing is magic. I've spoken_
a number of times at events where General Norman
Schwarzkopf has also been a speaker. His topic, appropriately,
is leadership—although every point he covers applies equally
well to peak personal productivity, because we are our own
leaders. Anyway, one of his keys is simply "Do the Right
Thing." And, you know, we almost always know what the

leadership—although

right thing to do is. We may not like it. We may not want lo
do it. But we know what it is. And when we do it, we gain
stature in the eyes of others, we gain self-esteem, and we gain
personal power.

As to a missed goal, I think "failure" is too harsh of a word,
in most cases. If every coach, coaching staff, and team who
set out to win the Super Bowl quit trying the first time they
missed getting there, we'd watch the same two teams in the
Super Bowl year after year, forever. Actually, a high achiever's secret that was taught to me very early in my career
defies logic, but it works. Here it is: don't reset the same goal.
Don't back off to a less ambitious goal. Instead, create a similar but bigger and more exciting goal with a new, appropriate time line.

Failure is a part of success. The most commonly used illustration is Babe Ruth, "The Home Run King," famous for his 714
home runs. But he also struck out 1,330 times. R.H. Macy
failed in seven businesses before hitting a home run with the
now-famous Macy's Department Store. The batteries we use
in our cars, in flashlights, in toys, and in electronics all exist
as a result of Thomas Edison striking out with five years of
experiments. You have to learn to master failure in order to
have success.

**Q: When you delegate, when you turn things over to other**
**people, aren't you inevitably going to have a lot of prob-**
**lems, foul-ups, even outright theft?**

A: Different businesses have different kinds of problems in this
area. But there are two overriding supervisory rules that
you'll want to remember. One: expect the best. Expectations

have enormous impact on results. And conveyed expectations
have great impact on most people. Most folks are smarter and
more capable than we give them credit for. Some never get
challenged. But rule number two is: know that you only have the
_right to expect what you inspect. If you want to know what hap-_
pens with zero accountability and zero supervision, read the
novel Lord of the Flies. The fact that performance improves
with measurement and accountability to someone else has
been proven everywhere from sports to weight loss to business. So, you have to walk a fine line between empowering
and encouraging but not turning loose; between inspecting
and critiquing but not micro-managing.

**Q: What's the biggest single problem with delegating? And**
what do you do about it?

A: The biggest problem is with the little things. Let's say you
ask someone a question; says he has to check records or
otherwise get the answer for you, but he never does that
unless you remember to ask him again. What do you do
about it? Suffer. Make notes and remember to ask again. Of
course, you can insist that your employees jot these things
down. Or you can do everything by memo; you create a
paper blizzard, but you have total accountability. For me,
this area is the most frustrating part of dealing with
employees or associates.

Here is the best insurance policy against things falling
through the cracks: for each person you delegate to, have a
list of everything, big or small, that you turn over to that person. As each one responds, you can mark off the items. Every
so often, check the list for the lagging items. Frankly, this is a

-----

**<gf** **NO B.s. Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

bit cumbersome. However, I've used it off and on over the
years, and it's the only reliable control method I've found.

When I was office-bound for a few years, I used a storyboard.
One whole wall in my office was cork-covered, and in one
section there was a vertical section for each person I worked
with. I always had a little stack of VA x 2M-inch square cards
with me. Whenever I gave someone a question, task, project,
whatever, I wrote it on a card, dated the card, and stuck it up
on the wall. When they came back to me with the completed
task, I took the card off. In an instant, at a glance, I—or anybody else—could see who was working on what. And this
worked pretty darned well.

**Q: What about the idea of only doing things you really like to**
**do? Some people teach that as a success strategy.**

A: Well, I've never advocated that. I just saw an article in our
local newspaper with a photo of a homeless man sitting
under a tree reading a book, and the caption said that this
man passed his time doing only what he wanted to do: reading great literature and playing cards with friends. But he's
_homeless. I think doing only what you want to do is a prescription_
_for poverty. But diverting as much of your time as you can to_
those few things you do extraordinarily well, that's a prescription for peak productivity. You can never eliminate
doing some things you dislike and some things you may not
even do well. I like speaking, especially to large audiences,
and I like being highly paid for doing so. I hate travel, but I
found out they won't bring those really big audiences to my
house. So I got good at traveling. I still don't like it, but I'm
a savvy, efficient, comfort-and-convenience trick-laden road

warrior. I don't particularly like pitching my books and
tapes from the platform either; I'd rather just speak, get a
standing ovation, and get back in the limo. But if I want to
appear at certain events, and if I want to make $20,000.00 to
$50,000.00 or more per speech, I've got to sell my stuff—and
do a damned good job of it. So I've gotten quite good at it.
So good that other speakers pay me sizable fees to help them
do it better.

I've read a few really airy-fairy, way-way out there metaphysical authors who insist they'd rather do only what they
enjoy, without exception, and be poor than do things they
don't like doing in order to have material things. Some of
these guys are outright phonies: telling large numbers of
lazy people what they want to hear in order to separate
them from what little money they have. Others really
believe what they are saying but are, privately, insanely
jealous of others who do well. I know one such sackclothand-ashes lecturer and author who, although pretty well
known, barely scrapes together a living each year, who
insists that he is happy and that happiness counts more
than material wealth. But mention Tony Robbins to him and
he goes on a 20-minute tirade. He is violently jealous of
Tony's phenomenal financial success and his fame. And that
reveals what he really wants. I've concluded that, one way
or another, these folks are full of B.S.

Highly successful people do what they need to do, whether
they like it or not, in order to get the results they want. This
is objective orientation versus activity orientation. BUT don't
miss the point that you should redirect energies to the few
things you do best at every opportunity.

**Q:** **H o w do you conquer procrastination?**

A: Heck if I know. I procrastinate. And I believe everybody
does. Fortunately the things I do it with most are relatively
trivial. For example, I hate shopping, so anything I can't buy
out of a catalog, I usually don't buy until it's a blatant, urgent
necessity. Most of the successful entrepreneurs I know tend
to be most productive under deadline pressure and often
need imposed or self-imposed pressure to get into a difficult
task. The often taught advice is: first, do what you want to do
least. Sometimes that works for me, sometimes it doesn't. I
also think there are areas where you SHOULD procrastinate.
For example, if I have an idea, question, decision, or whatever,
and I can't make a decision quickly, I'll deliberately set it side
for a period of time before revisiting it. I have a procrastination place" for reading material that can wait and a "procrastination pile" for correspondence or other work that has no
particular urgency. I'm always amazed at how much of that
stuff takes care of itself when it is left alone for a few weeks
or months. 1

_think the important thing is to be honest with yourself. If you are_
putting something off, don't pretend otherwise. And it's also
important to keep controlling, setting, and addressing your
own priorities rather than reacting to those of other people.
Too many overloaded entrepreneurs still operate on the
"squeaky wheel gets the grease" basis. Although that is understandable and although it can provide survival, that philosophy cannot produce peak productivity. You want to be the one
making very deliberate decisions about how you invest your time—then

stick to those decisions as much as possible.

Lisa Kanarek, author of the fine book Organizing Your Home
_Office for Success,_ uses the term "selective neglect." See,
"selective" means you are in control, doing the selecting and
doing it for the right reasons.

**Q: I'm a salesperson, and I wonder: how can I sell effectively**
**to super-busy people like you? Entrepreneurs and CEOs**
who do not have a minute to spare.

A: The way to get through to us is the same way you get
through to anybody; it's just that the need to hit it right on
the mark is magnified with us. The key is speaking to our self_interest. If you can perfectly match your message, your prom-_
ise to MY fears that haunt me at night, MY concerns that are
foremost in my mind right now, and MY desires that I would
kill to fulfill, then, believe me, you'll get as much of my time
as you want. Most salespeople are much too product- and
process-oriented, not sufficiently prospect-oriented.

You have to come to grips, totally, with the unhappy fact that
these busy prospects do not have one whit of interest in your
product, your company, your company's credibility, your prices—none

of that. You've just got to let loose of all those
concepts. You must put together what I call a "Magnetic
Marketing Message" that focuses on things of prime, overriding interest to the people you want to reach.

For example, a few years ago I did a little pro bono consulting with the Arizona Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation
about securing more, new corporate sponsors for their
telethon. The Foundation couldn't get the key CEOs it wanted
to talk with to give them the time of day. That's because

**CHAPTER 14 / COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT PEAK PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY**

-----

**^** **NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

Foundation representatives were talking about the Arthritis
Foundation. I created a new message aimed at these CEOs—
telling them about new, creative, very-low cost opportunities
to get massive, prestigious public recognition for their companies featuring prime TV advertising at about 25 cents on
the dollar vs. what they would normally pay. I created a letter that played to their egos, presented a logical case, had
something new to offer, and hit the fear button—that their
competitors might beat them out for an exclusive. Some of
these busy CEOs called the very same day they got my letter.
Companies such as Federal Express and Domino's Pizza
raced to get involved.

If you're going to sell to me, for example, there are six, maybe
seven, things of such enormous interest to me that would
force me to drop whatever I was doing, suspend my skepticism, and give you my undivided, enthusiastic attention. If
you can figure out what one, or some, of those things are and
link yourself and what you offer to those interests, you break
through. If you don't, odds are excellent that the busyness of
my schedule will shut you out.

Q: How do you handle all of your communication? You must
get a zillion letters, faxes, and phone calls.

A: You're not kidding. I get a lot of correspondence. I try to
make instant decisions and move the paper immediately and
quickly whenever I can. With people I work with frequently,
I'll often type my response right on the bottom or even up the
side of the letter or fax they sent me. I also try to throw out
everything I can. Even though I need to read my "junk mail,"
as a practitioner of direct mail, I keep only a few pieces for
