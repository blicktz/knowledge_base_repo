Some years back, I was speaking at the national convention of the Advertising Specialty Institute
and encountered a spectacularly obtuse company owner. ASI’s population is comprised of all the
companies that sell imprinted ballpoint pens, baseball caps, coffee mugs, and every other sort of
promotional product. At the time, the internet was just beginning to exert real influence, and many
—maybe most—in this field felt terrorized by price shopping made mouse-click easy. I began my
speech by saying: if you believe you are in a commodities business, get out. This woman took me
_very literally. She stormed out of the room. Later, she sent her complaint letter to all parties_
concerned, accusing me of being ill-informed, ill-prepared, and vile, because, of course, they all
_were in a commodity business. But her facts and mine differed. No one in the promotional products_
and ad specialty industry needs be in a commodity business unless they choose to, but they don’t
need to exit their industry either.

Keith and Travis Lee, owners of 3-D (for 3-Dimensional) Mailings, Inc.—who contribute their
own price strategy elsewhere in this book—are great examples. They sell all those products, but
they specialize in selling them for use in clever direct-mail campaigns, with the copy, graphics,
offer, and theme of the mailing matched to the imprinted doohickey, and they work with the client to
[devise the entire campaign. You can see their approach to this business at 3DMailResults.com. Yes,](http://3dmailresults.com/)
you can buy most of the doodads they sell other places, but you can’t buy their expertise. Further,
they focus on reaching clients in clumps, as vendor-partners of marketing gurus, trainers,
consultants, and coaches like me and many in different niches, from dentistry to financial planning
to lawn care. They match their theme campaigns and doodads to the strategies the gurus teach, and
are brought to the guru’s clientele as a resource. The combination of these two positioning and
marketing strategies permits the best price strategy of all: ignoring all price competition. Ironically,
this has made their business so successful they can buy in big volume and buy direct from overseas
manufacturers, so, often, they now also have the lowest prices. Another in the industry, who I’ve
also coached in business as I have Keith and Travis, is B. Shawn Warren. He sells the same kind of
imprinted items as part of his business, but he has specialized in serving fraternal organizations like
Kiwanis, the Elks, veterans groups, and civic clubs. Another, a company called SmartPractice,
created by my friends Jim and Naomi Rhode, specializes only in the dental, chiropractic, and
medical fields. Their products might be commodities, but they have made sure their businesses
transcend commoditization with target market specialization.

Personally, I have been in B2B my entire life, beginning in the traditional ad agency business but
quickly morphing to the consulting/copywriting practice I’ve had for 30 years, where I’ve
consistently charged higher fees than just about everybody else. There is, in fact, an entire directory
called _Who’s Charging What? in which copywriters foolishly publish their fees—and mine (not_
listed there) are 4X to 100X higher. Hasn’t slowed me in the least. I have also, at different times,
owned a manufacturing company competing head to head with others, and been part-owner of an
awards/trophy company selling to corporations, fraternal organizations, and government agencies,
including the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Marines. Never have I had these companies claim lowest
prices or sell based on price, and it has generally been known that our prices were higher than

-----

competitors. In some cases, such as my consulting/copywriting practice, having very high fees is not
only widely known, it’s promoted as a reason to retain me if you can—if you want the best guy on
the planet.

**The reality of B2B commerce is that only about 20% of all purchases made by professional**
**purchasing agents, other executives or managers, authorized department heads, and business**
**owners are based on lowest competitive price, and over half of that 20% occurs within the**
**context of pre-framed competitive bidding. The other 80% of the purchases are made based**
**on more complex criteria. That criteria ranges from the quasi-fraudulent, such as bonuses, gifts,**
and bribes, to simple quality of relationship to rational reasons, such as the vendor’s positioning,
reputation, value proposition, and added value, service, warranties, to emotional issues such as CYA
for the person making the purchase or bragging rights by having the vendor. In some B2B instances
“Made in the USA” once played a big role and is returning as a factor. It’s new-age equivalent is
“green.”

Years back, a friend of mine, Pete Lillo, smartly located his print shop immediately adjacent to
the area’s busy post office, in a shopping center surrounded by fast food restaurants. He knew that
office employees and secretaries out for noontime errands, to the post office, and to grab lunch,
would drop off printing and copying work to him because of his very convenient location—without
ever considering comparing his prices with other shops a few miles away, east, west, north, and
south. Consequently, he quickly built and maintained a thriving, exceptionally profitable business
generating approximately 300% more revenue than the national average for a shop its size, in large
part thanks to prices 20% to 40% higher than other area shops. Top quality helped, but a convenient
location was much more of a deciding factor in a lot of his business rather than either quality or
price. For the record, accounts obtained this way, for this reason, included some very large
corporations spending thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars every month on business
printing.

**The bottom line is: 20/80. Only 20% of the purchasing is based on competitive pricing, 80%**
**is not. But 80% of all sellers and salespeople behave as if it was the other way around, and**
**devote 80% of their efforts to competing on price. This is the equivalent of having a genetic pre-**
disposition for a horrible disease, being shown irrefutable, empirical evidence that 80% of the
reasons people with your genetic pre-disposition for the disease get it have to do with eating red
meat, then making 80% of your entire food intake red meat.

As comedian Ron White says: “You can’t fix stupid.” But ignorance is repairable, so if, until now,
you just haven’t known the facts and have been pricing, marketing, and selling in the false reality of
competitive pricing, that’s good—you can fix yourself. And fix the way you approach your market.

**Why then, you might ask, does it** **_seem_** **so many B2B sales and purchases are made based on**
**competitive pricing? Two reasons. One, because that’s what you believe to be true, so you see,**
hear, and accept everything that verifies your belief and reject without actually seeing or hearing
everything that contradicts it. Two, because 80% of the marketers and salespeople in the B2B world
advertise, market, and message price despite it being a purchase determinate only 20% of the time.
So the noise is much about price. And the excuse ignorant or ineffective or ignorant and ineffective
manufacturers, wholesalers, vendors, professionals, and salespeople give for their failures is losing a
competitive pricing battle they could not win. People love placing fault elsewhere rather than
embracing personal responsibility—think overweight folks and their bad genes, big bones, low
metabolism, food industry conspiracy theories.

**The more important question is: Why does** **_any_** **B2B purchase get tied to competitive pricing**
**and the lowest price? After all, buying by price alone is rather stupid. It ignores countless other**
factors that may be as important. Would you choose a babysitter for your kids by lowest price,
despite the fact that he’s a convicted child molester or she’s a drug addict? Then why choose a
computer system for your company that way?

**Three key factors are responsible. One is: opportunity. The easier it is for a customer to price-**
shop, the more tempted he is to do so. In the consumer marketplace, a person can now stand in his
local furniture store with his iPhone and check the price there against Amazon, Costco, etc.
instantly, online. Sears idiotically advertises that they’ll do it for you, thus boxing themselves into
selling at lowest price. The B2B buyer has the internet sitting on his desk, knows how to use it, and
because he can, feels he should. Price shopping goods or services has never been easier, so the
temptation has never been greater, nor has the pressure from above in big companies. Two is: the
**surrender in advance I’m discussing throughout this chapter, which directly links to number**

-----

**three: Absence of other persuasive information provided by competent marketers and sales**
**professionals. Few buyers really want the cheapest price; all intelligent buyers want or can be made**
to prefer the best value. These things are rarely the same, but in the absence of persuasive
information about matters other than price, shown two apparently identical items, we’ll all take the
cheaper priced of the two.

As example, you want a simple navy-blue blazer. If you see two that look and feel alike, and have
no brand bias, and one is $199.00 and the other $499.00, surely you’re tempted to shrug and take
the cheaper one—even if your Bentley is being guarded outside by your chauffer. But if somebody
who is articulate explains the difference between single-stitch and double-stitch tailoring, sewn
versus glued, full versus half lining, why one fabric will soon look shiny from dry cleaning while
the other will not, odds are very good that the jacket selling for four times more is leaving that store
with you.

Now let’s assume you are me and you wander into a very good clothing store with top sales
professionals—like I did in Las Vegas, at the Bernini store the first time I was sold a very expensive
Bernini suit. There, before you even get to the product features/benefits differentiation story, you’ll
be engaged in different dialogue. And you may never get to the features/ benefits differentiation, as
it is somewhat assumed based on the Bernini brand, and may be rendered unnecessary by the other
dialogue. That dialogue began with what I did for a living and under what circumstances I might be
wearing a suit? Answer: professional speaking, on stage. What was my objective or what might
come of such speaking? Answer: attracting a major client. And what might a client be worth?
Answer: $100,000.00 and up. Hmmm. Having the best possible appearance, presenting a rich and
successful appearance was therefore an important investment for me, wasn’t it? As this conversation
took place, I was de-jacketed, put in the suit coat, paraded in front of the mirror, oohed and aahed
over, led to dressing room, swapped pants, measured and pinned, and had yet to even hear the price.
In reality, what did it matter?

**The B2B buyer is no different. In the absence of persuasive information about differential value,**
he will buy the cheapest product that meets his need, and he may very well go searching for it. As
he should. The problem here is not the buyer. He’s doing his job given what he has to work with—
an absence of persuasive information other than price. It’s the seller who’s failing at his job—
providing persuasive information other than price. It’s you, not your customer.

Here is a million dollar fact for you. If you will hammer it into your head, it will easily be worth a
million dollars during your career, probably more. There is **_no_** **B2B buyer of** **_anything for whom_**
**some factors other than price aren’t relevant and important. Please stop, think, read it again.**
And again.

There is the argument, of course, that the customer is simply, purely, irredeemably a cheapskate.
Really? Let’s take a very thorough tour of his office as well as his home, investigate which hospital
and doctor handled his by-pass operation, see what car he drives, and where he stayed on vacation,
etc. At his office we damn well better find the desk is nothing more than old doors secured from the
city dump up on sawhorses, the bookshelves just boards on bricks, no framed pictures on walls, no
brand-name copier or other equipment—all off-brand, everything bought second-hand. He better be
driving a 10-year-old Yugo. His last family vacation at Motel-6 and Travel-Lodge way, way off the
beach. Not the case? Then stop with the cheapskate talk. A horse is a horse, of course, of course,
unless he’s Mr. Ed, but no human is a cheapskate about everything. Few are cheapskates about
anything when they are provided persuasive value differential information.

If you’re losing price wars, you’re in the wrong war to begin with.

There are but two possible outcomes to price wars—neither one victory. The B2B price
competitor either bleeds and starves to bankruptcy, slowly and painfully over time, as his profit is
taken away bit by bit by bit, or he loses more skirmishes than he wins, and more importantly fails at
getting good customers, obtaining only bad ones.

Many companies who let themselves get sucked into this become debt burdened, financing their
present poor profitability with future obligations. The young founders of a promising software
company I once advised chose this path. They were charging significant up-front fees in order to
have their excellent system installed and users trained, and acquiring good, committed clients by
doing so. In a paean to the gods of volume and speed, they tossed aside this model, dropped their
monthly maintenance fees, and took on new accounts with no up-front financial commitment. Two
calendar quarters later they expressed shock that their turn-over and churn of accounts had
skyrocketed, and the achievement of profitability was now stretched out many more months into the

-----

future for each month’s new accounts—requiring taking on more debt. They may yet get rich, but
only if a white knight arrives to buy their company. They are gambling all on that single possibility.
I suppose this is a gamble made often in the software and tech fields, and the news reports the
winners, but ignores the far greater number of losers. Only you can decide for yourself, as an
entrepreneur, if this is the wager you wish to make with your business. But if it isn’t, then the
decision to compete on price or to succumb to downward price pressure from competitors is a poor
one.

## CHAPTER 10

 Breaking Free of the Price-Product Link

 Dan Kennedy

**In their minds, most business owners and salespeople tightly link price and product. The consumer,**
however, is very willing to break this link, given sufficient motivation.

**If product and price were tightly linked in consumers’ minds, Starbucks, a Rolls-Royce or**
**Bentley, a $25 T-shirt, or Advil[®]** **would never sell instead of its cheaper, generic exact**
**equivalent. If Starbucks was about coffee, a Rolls about transportation, a team-logo T-shirt about**
clothing, or Advil[®] about pain relief, they could not exist. Instead, all these things are, in part, about
a brand identity that adds to price but adds little or nothing to intrinsic value. Further, each is about
something else, and in most cases, about different things to different buyers.

Howard Schultz conceived Starbucks as a third place between home to work and work to home—
the cool kids’ club. A statement is made to self and others by making a Starbucks run—or having
one made for you—versus bringing a thermos of coffee with you from home (the much, much
cheaper substitute) or being seen with cup from Denny’s, Dunkin’ Donuts, 7-11, or a no-name
corner store. The meaning of driving the Rolls is rather obvious, but clearly you could drive in
luxury for less. A $5 T-shirt becomes a $25 T-shirt by adding some logo for which the wearer has
emotional affinity or the wearer is using to make a statement. The person who buys Advil[®] instead
of the cheaper generic that is an absolute equivalent, revealed by comparing the ingredient
disclosures on both labels, often does so without comparison despite how easy, quick, and available
the comparison is—because they are buying belief in safety, reassurance of efficacy, the comfort of
familiarity. Interestingly, there is clinical research that reveals a “panacea plus factor” to results
experienced by consumers/patients given brand name vs. generic prescription and OTC drugs, and
when told the prices, from higher-priced vs. lower-priced drugs. I imagine you could have most
people taste test two cups of coffee, one in a Starbucks cup, one in a 7-11 cup, and have most insist
the Starbucks tastes better, richer, etc.—but have both filled with the same Maxwell House instant
coffee you heated up in the microwave. A fantastic demonstration of this is the episode of Penn &
Teller’s outstanding exposé show, BULLSHIT, on Showtime, about “designer water” taste tests.

## NO B.S. Price Strategy Warning #4

There are two chains that bind product to price: one is in the customer’s mind, the other is

in yours. BOTH must be cut. It’s a near certainty that the chain in your mind is bigger,

thicker, stronger than the one in the customer’s mind. Customers embrace de-linking
product and price routinely given reason to do so. Business owners and salespeople are,
ironically, more committed to the linkage. In this case, as in most, income improvement

will follow self-improvement!

**Point is,** **_your_** **product-price price-product link is in** **_your_** **mind. It is not necessarily fixed in**
**the same way in consumers’ minds. It probably isn’t. Yours is more rigid, theirs more elastic**
**and flexible. Further, the marketplace consistently displays its welcome of creative de-linking of**
price from product. Income limitations businesspeople live with based on prices they believe they
can charge are more of their own lack of creativity and imagination, than of the products they
