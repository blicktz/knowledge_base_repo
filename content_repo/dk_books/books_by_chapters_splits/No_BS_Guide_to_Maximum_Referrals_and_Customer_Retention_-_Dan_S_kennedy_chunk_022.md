##### Glazer told me, when he ran his super-successful menswear stores, that for some hyperactive customers it might be four weeks without seeing them; for all the others, a season. Any customer not in for each of the four seasons was straying and shopping elsewhere. If you own a neighborhood diner and Billy Bob comes in every morning for grits ‘n gravy, and he’s not there on Tuesday, the alarm should go off. Don’t wait to see if he shows up. Check on him. Call. If he doesn’t answer, drive over to his trailer and peek in. He might be dead. But it’s more likely his buddy asked him to meet up for breakfast somewhere else and he did, and if he liked that place, and Bertha smiled at him extra nice, and burnt his toast just like momma used to, he’ll be tempted to go over there again tomorrow. If he does that three mornings in a row, he’s lost to you. You needed to put an end to that on Tuesday afternoon. Every business has these timing-sensitive issues.

#### #5: Increase Profits from Each Customer
##### It’s profit that can be reinvested as capital for growth, and it’s profit that can be withdrawn for savings and investments, for debt elimination, and for lifestyle. Achieving maximum possible profit with each customer can be micromanaged. Somebody should do so, and marketing to each customer varied by use of this information. For example, if Walmart has a customer who very prudently and penuriously buys only staple commodities like toilet paper, paper towels, and a few supplies but never buys its much higher-profit-margin toys, games, apparel, electronics, or seasonal gift merchandise, that customer is a problem. There’s almost no profit value in that customer. This is, incidentally, the exact kind of customer that Walmart got at the peak of the recession: “trade down” customers who grudgingly came for the dirt cheap prices on necessities but refused to buy a lipstick or set of bath towels or a giant tub of caramel corn, and went to their usual, more upscale stores to buy high-profit goods. If you were micromanaging that business, you would identify and isolate those customers and concoct a customized sales program just for them, designed to tempt them into buying high-profit goods, hopefully being surprised and satisfied, and then changing their habits.
 This is called account management.


-----

##### Most businesses have different products and services with different profit margins. The task is to direct each customer into purchase of high- profit items.
 Most business owners are hyper cost conscious, but not nearly as profit conscious as they should be. This is a form of what my friend mega real estate investor and coach Ron LeGrand calls “stepping over dollars to pick up nickels.”
 Most businesses should have three different kinds of marketing going on with their existent customers. One, generic messages and promotions everybody gets. These are very suitable to mass media, like email and websites. Two, segment-specific messages and promotions crafted differently for different groups of customers. For example, when I’m working on seminar marketing for GKIC or a client, I want to deliver different campaigns to a) customers who attended in prior years but skipped the most recent year, b) customers who’ve been around long enough to have attended but have not yet done so, c) customers who’ve attended one kind of event but not another, d) customers located in easy driving or “puddle- jump” flying distance of the event’s location, and, sometimes, e) lost customers. Three, customized and personalized messages and offers different for each individual, based on what we know about that person.

#### #6: Recover Lost Customers
##### Not all customers are irretrievably lost. Not all broken relationships are irreparably damaged. Lost customer recovery and reactivation campaigns are rarely the highest return on investment things a business can do, but that’s no excuse for not doing them. Deciding on what you’ll spend is relatively easy; the lost customers have individual and averaged purchase history. Don’t write them off without a fight.
 The best lost customer campaigns include the following:

 1. Acknowledgement, if not apology, that something must have gone
 awry causing them to wander off 2. Reminding of core reasons they were a customer


-----

##### 3. Introducing “Exciting News” about how you are “New and
 Improved” 4. Presenting an exclusive, extremely generous, irresistible offer(s)
 and/or 5. Offer of a VERY appealing FREE gift just for stopping in, calling,
 etc., to see all the “New and Improved” firsthand 6. Imposing deadlines on the offers

#### #7: Referrals
##### Again, about half the book is devoted to this. Let me just say a word about creating a Referral Culture in your business. Whatever you want from people, they have to know you want it before they can give it to you, they have to know it is expected of them before they can live up to your expectation, and they have to know that they are capable of doing it successfully. So, there are actually 11 things that customers need to know for there to be a Referral Culture in play:

 1. Our customers refer. 2. Our good customers refer often. 3. Our best customers refer often and a lot. 4. Referrals are expected. From you. 5. Referrals are genuinely appreciated. 6. Referrals are well taken care of. (You’ll only get happy reports and
 thanks from those you refer.) 7. NOT referring is weird and inappropriate. You should feel bad
 about it. 8. There are a LOT OF different reasons people do business with us—
 not just the reason that brought you in. Keep all these reasons in mind . . . 9. Most people don’t really know how to find a good, trustworthy
 provider of what we do, so you are doing others a great service by telling them about us.


-----

##### 10. There are easy ways to introduce people to us and to get our
 information into the hands of people you think we can be of service to . . . 11. So—here’s how to refer. Exactly what to do. 1, 2, 3, A, B, C.

 I can train for an entire day just on this list, but you can glean the basic idea just from the list. It’s up to you to consistently and effectively communicate these messages.
 Years back, I invented an audio program for use by chiropractic physicians titled Ten Ways to Get Well Faster. One of the ten was that the patient’s level of emotional commitment actually affected his mind-body- linked acceptance of treatment and speed at which his body responded, and the best way to telegraph commitment to the body was by telling the story of chiropractic to others, and referring others to the doctor—which then led into a rundown of this list with some detail. This is just one of dozens of ways we taught the doctors to communicate these 11 points. The most successful ones did it by in office visuals and handouts, monthly newsletters, recognition for those referring, verbally in conversations with the doctor and the staffs; with every media, often and consistently.

#### Conveyed Expectations
##### Conveyed expectations matter a lot.
 Disney has done a thorough study to determine how far apart trash containers should be and how they should be made visible, to get the most number of people using them, resulting in the least amount of trash on the ground. You might think that’s just about convenience for customers, but it’s not; it conveys an expectation. Just as the incredible number of sweeper- upper people you see every few minutes keeping the place tidy. They are making sure you know certain things—like: We value the cleanliness of the parks; we work hard to keep them clean; guests do not throw trash on the ground here (look, there’s a trash can within a few steps of you!); we expect YOU to use the trash containers (look, there’s a trash can within a few steps of you!). None of this is accidental. I’ve spoken directly with Disney Imagineers, executives, and former executives about it. In so many ways,

##### they ingeniously manage the behavior of their customers by conveying their expectations.
 The person who donates repeatedly to a particular charity is, as I explained earlier in this book, a committed donor but not an evangelical ambassador. The donor feels good about herself because she donates. She must be made to feel bad about herself because she is letting the charity down by not evangelizing for it. She must see all around her, often, gratitude and recognition given for referring others. If this sounds manipulative or harsh, that’s because it is. It is a tough position: Being a good and loyal donor is not enough . . . not enough to make you a really good supporter . . . not enough to merit a lot of recognition. Creating a desire on someone else’s part to do what you want them to do so that they feel better about themselves is manipulative. Just as Disney’s no-trash campaign is.
 The person who frequently buys from a business is, as I explained earlier in this book, a committed customer but not an evangelical ambassador. The customer feels good about himself because he is a frequent and loyal patron, because he comes “where everybody knows his name,” because he’s a part of this business’s crowd. But he must be made to feel bad about himself because he is letting the business down by not evangelizing for it. He must see all around him, often, gratitude and recognition given for referring others. If this sounds manipulative or harsh, that’s because it is. It is a tough position: Being a good and loyal customer is not enough . . . not enough to make you a really good supporter . . . not enough to merit a lot of recognition. Creating a desire on someone else’s part to do what you want them to do so that they feel better about themselves is manipulative.
 This specific manipulation is a major driver of most behavior. People do all sorts of things for emotional self-interest, even though they may consciously think and would certainly insist they are doing these things “for” someone else, out of love, appreciation, friendship, religiosity, charity or generosity, or civic duty. If there is one uniting motivation affecting everybody every single day, it is pursuit of feeling good about themselves and better about themselves. We are all defending ourselves and defending our lives day by day, to the critic in the mirror, the embedded, judgmental voices in our head, and to those around us including family, friends, and

##### even foes. If you get past denial of this as an ultimate fact of human behavior and get past any squeamishness or reticence about using it, then getting people to desire doing what you want them to do is suddenly a whole lot easier—including bringing you referrals.

## The End Is the Beginning, and There’s No
 Time to Wait or Waste

##### by Shaun Buck

 ou can no longer take your customer retention or referrals for granted. We live in a time in history where customers have more choices of places to do business with than ever before. We all joke that there is a Starbucks directly across the street from every

# Yother Starbucks, and, of course, that might be true. We have all witnessed it.

##### But did you know Starbucks is not the worst offender? Did you know there are 12.87 dentist offices for every Starbucks in America? There’s literally one on every street corner. What about lawyers? There are 107.12 licensed lawyers in America for every Starbucks. Heck, that’s enough lawyers to support a Starbucks—maybe they should put a Starbucks in every law office. When you go home at night, you may want to make sure one hasn’t set up shop under your bed. Plumbers? There are 8.77 plumbing companies in the U.S. for every Starbucks.
 Pretty much whatever you do, there are a lot of other people and businesses doing it, and vying for the same customers. If you are local, chances are you are no longer just competing with other local businesses. Lawyers have www.LegalZoom.com, retailers have Amazon, restaurants

##### have www.BlueBox.com. This is just to name a few. Even if you are in a field that has minimal competition, you still have to guard your customers against choosing to go in a completely different direction or making a convenience or impulse decision and dividing their spending or being seduced away by an exceptionally aggressive predator.
 We live in the single most difficult time in history to get someone to make an initial purchase with your business. Never have there been as many choices. Never before has a business’s existent customers been so surrounded and bombarded by invitations and inducements to leave that business and try something different. So, in one way, retention is harder than it has ever been. Fortunately, most of your many competitors don’t act as if that were true, and are terrible at creating and sustaining relationships. Their ignorance, sense of entitlement, laziness, and unwillingness to invest in retention is your saving grace!
 But only if you act. Act differently. Act aggressively. Act comprehensively. Act now.
 This book is the start of all that, not the end. You must take action. If you can’t do it, find vendors to help you. Still don’t have time? Hire another employee and figure their compensation into your total cost for each referral, and into customer retention. Whatever you do, don’t just sit idly by doing nothing. A great place to find really expert, helpful vendors who understand all this is at the GKIC conferences. Start with their offer on page 182.
 One of the first steps in getting started and putting everything you have learned in this book to use is to go to www.nobsreferralbook.com and grab all the free resources I have put on that site for you to model your retention and referral program after. If you have specific questions, you can email me at that same site.
 Somehow, right now, get started really working on retention and referrals. Don’t let yourself put this book away on a shelf, out of sight, out of mind. Put things in motion. Get your partner, team members, and employees to read it, and get them working on retention and referrals. Don’t let all this end as interesting ideas you nod your head at, but do nothing about.
 Oh, and one other thing—tell somebody you know who can benefit from it about this book, would you? It’s easy to refer them to it, at any book

##### Dear ___________________,

 I just finished going through the most _____________ (amazing; eye-opening; provocative; valuable) book I’ve read in a very long time. It’s all about getting a lot of business growth without pouring money into advertising—instead, by improving retention and referrals, and I promise, this is not the same old, typical advice we’ve all heard a million times about this. For example, this book’s authors, Dan Kennedy and Shaun Buck, advise NOT asking for referrals! Anyway, the book is the No B.S. Guide to Maximum Referrals and Customer Retention. It’s new and it IS different! It’s available at all fine book and ebook retailers.

 I wanted to tell YOU about it because I know you will ______________ (appreciate; respect; be impressed by) its blunt, straightforward approach and can use many of the specific strategies in it, in YOUR business.

 Let me know what you think after you’ve read it!

 Your name goes here
