#### messages. While we always had a small number of subscribers and members overseas, today revenues from outside the United States are approaching 30% of our business. But everybody should get beyond local or regional to national or international. Let me give you a few examples.
 Darin Garman was a real estate broker specializing in apartment buildings and commercial properties in Iowa. Naturally, most of his buyers and investors were also in Iowa. He was enormously successful, so he controlled more than 70% of all such transactions in his primary geographic market, Cedar Rapids and neighboring communities. At my urging, he began advertising nationally in publications like Forbes and Investors Business Daily, to interest investors all over America in the conservative “heartland of America” real estate investments. Today, more than half of all his sales of Iowa properties are to investors in New York, California, almost every other state, mostly sight unseen: he never even meets the investors in person. There are many benefits of bringing these investors in from all over America rather than just seeking them locally. For example, they are less price sensitive, not biased by what they “know” as are area residents; they are making their decisions purely based on the mathematical merits of the investment. Also, while there is obviously a limited, finite number of wealthy individuals interested in owning apartment buildings in Cedar Rapids, there’s a virtually unlimited, infinite number of such wealthy individuals spread all over America.
 Matt Furey, like me, is an author. His first book on fitness, still a bestseller (although never on a “bestseller list”) is Combat Conditioning . For a long time, the only means for an author to attempt converting his knowledge and intellectual property to wealth was through bookstores, a very limited means of distribution, provincial multiplied. Matt chose to ignore the traditional publishing industry entirely, and has sold hundreds of thousands of copies entirely via his own direct-response ads in magazines and his web sites. But for Matt, the book is just the beginning. If you visit mattfurey.com, you’ll enter a complex web of websites, e-mail newsletters, and other online marketing generating millions of dollars a year. Matt spends two months a year on combination vacation and research trips in China, spends an enormous amount of time with his family, works as he wishes. I’ve consulted with and coached Matt in the early stages of his business, and most recently sold one of my publishing companies to him (The Psycho-Cybernetics Foundation, www.psycho-cybernetics.com ).

#### mastery of the internet makes a person in an isolated town in Afghanistan, a U.S. soldier on a base in a foreign land, a young man “with sand kicked in his face” in Africa just as viable a customer as someone working out at a local gym. But Matt is not alone, nor is the globally expansive power of the internet limited to books, tapes, and other information products.
 Think of entire industries liberated from local or locale-tolocale boundaries by direct marketing; mail-order, toll-free numbers, the internet. It wasn’t all that long ago that the only way you could buy or sell stocks was through your local broker at his local office. Antiques were sold in antique shops, art in galleries, not through eBay or on websites. We could fill the remainder of the book with examples.
 Even the reach of the professional practice has gone from a five-mile radius to the world. You only need skim the pages of any airline’s magazine, stuffed in the seat pockets, and you’ll find full-page advertisements from cosmetic dentists, doctors treating carpel tunnel syndrome, doctors treating menopause. They advertise nationally, they attract patients who fly to them from all over the country. Why would someone who lives in Illinois go to a dentist in Houston, Texas? If you read this entire book carefully, you will understand the market forces and Wealth Attraction Magnets that make this happen. Incidentally, I live in Ohio, but my dentist is in Richmond, Virginia, and my financial advisor is in Durango, Colorado. I travel to the former several times a year. I never need to see the latter; all our business is easily done at distance. But in both cases, the controlling factor is expertise, not location.
 When you transcend geographic boundaries, you instantly and automatically increase your wealth attraction power and opportunities.
 This is a major issue for The New Economy. If you remain bound by geographic limitations, you will find yourself at ever-increasing disadvantage. Money is no longer concentrated anywhere, because people can do business from anywhere. During the month I was finishing this book, I flew to New York for a meeting with a very wealthy entrepreneur who has adopted the practice of taking his family to a different city each summer and living there for three months—this year New York, next year Paris. As he put it, “All I need is internet access. I can do business anywhere I choose to live.” The idea of Wall Street as the capitol of finance, Manhattan as capitol of advertising, Dallas and Houston as twin capitols of oil, is antiquated. Money is more mobile and moving than ever before, so

#### you must be too. The fastest practical way to attract more money is to broaden the territory from which you invite it.
 The other important thing to remember about boundaries and The New Economy customer is that this customer expects easy and instant access. Think about the demise of the corner video store and the struggle for survival the biggest chain of such stores, Blockbuster, finds itself in, in the era of Netflix and instant movies on demand from your cable or satellite provider. A similar tempest is brewing with this thing you hold in your hands: books. The Kindle[®] and competing technology products give readers instant access to tens of thousands of books. You can instantly make books materialize on your iPhone[®] . The New Economy customer at his Caribbean island hideaway, where he can run his business by remote control, who hears of a book he is interested in on a morning financial news show need not try to find a bookstore or wait for delivery from Amazon; he can get it zapped to him instantly. Setting aside a long discussion about the destruction of intellectual property protections, the authors’ interests, and the many reasons for developing your own library of treasured books in physical form, this still tentative evolution speaks to the “demand for now” that seems to increasingly control the movement of money, thus the attraction of wealth. Removal of physical boundaries and distances and related delays is the engineering feat of The New Economy.

 Clarity

#### I t’s instructive to ask business owners how much money they expect to receive today, tomorrow, next week.
 Most are playing blind archery. Few have clear, definite expectations. This is grievous negligence, as expectations have a great deal to do with results. It’s also dereliction of managerial duty. It is up to you to decide— key word: decide —how much money you will receive today, this week, this month, this year, in advance, based upon your marketing and management plans, your pre-scheduled actions and initiatives. If you board an airplane and ask the pilot “Where are we going today? When are we scheduled to get there?” and he’s not sure, exit immediately! For the pilot of a business, today’s destination and arrival time is measured in dollars going into the bank account, customers captured for development, and a few other key pieces of data. If you’re not sure about those things, the odds of arriving at the right destination by happy accident aren’t good.

#### Ask a restaurant owner: “How much business are you going to do today?” He’ll answer: “I don’t know. It depends on who comes in.” That’s a lousy answer.
 If you’re running a restaurant, you have to have a very good idea of how many are coming in, if not who’s coming in. You have a number of customers who’ve bought membership cards so you’re dinging their credit cards the first of each month and sending them five coupons, you’ve sent a certain number of birthday cards out with coupons the week before, you’ve FAXed the week’s specials to your business lunch customers, and you have certain expectations based on all this activity.
 This gets us to the big topic of clarity. Clarity about what you don’t want, what you do want, the income you expect, the net worth increases you expect, and the reasons for your expectations. I have long operated my businesses by numbers, knowing what the minimum amount my time must be worth, what a project must produce, what sales will come from an appearance in front of an audience. Tracking day by day, whether or not I am “on schedule” to hit my income and wealth targets for the week, month, quarter, year. If you don’t know whether or not you are on schedule, it’s a safe bet you aren’t. If you’re assessing how well you’re doing with your goals for the year in October, it’s too late. You need to assess how well you are doing at noon on January 2nd. And January 3rd, 4th, 5th.
 I have clear, vivid mental pictures of what my business, business life, and personal life are to look like. I have detailed, constantly updated plans to support the pictures. I’m very clear about intentions and expectations. Sure, there’s the axiom: if you want to hear God laugh, tell him your plans, and sure, things go awry. Fortunately, unexpected, better opportunities sometimes present themselves. But imperfect results from clarity are still far superior to random results. Clarity sets up magnetized targets you are drawn to. It allows your conscious and subconscious minds to work in tandem.
 I’m also very clear about my schedule and work days. They aren’t just planned, they are scripted, and well over 80% unfold exactly as scripted, producing exactly the results intended and expected. If this interests you, read the book No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs.
 Wealth is attracted to clarity . Paul J. Meyer, founder of Success Motivation Institute, a former insurance salesman who turned himself into a very wealthy entrepreneur with a number of business interests and

#### extensive real estate investments, as well as an author on success subjects, said “If you are not achieving your goals, it is probably because they are not clearly defined.” It’s not that the individual lacks essential skills, opportunities, or resources to achieve his goals, or the ability to procure them, it is a problem with the goals themselves.
 I have found, personally, the times that I wander astray from productivity and profit, and am not seeing the money stream in as it usually does for me, I’ve gotten foggy about my own intentions and objectives or negligent about measurement of progress.

## Numbers

#### C hapter 43 in my book, No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits, titled “Management by the Numbers (The Right Numbers)” describes in detail 13 different numerical and statistical measurements you should be tracking in your business constantly; some day to day, some week to week. These are not the numbers your accountant gives to you after the fact in historical documents, like financial statements and tax returns—these are living numbers you use to manage your business for maximum profit . One of the attractants of wealth is respect for it, and one of the ways you can show that respect is by paying attention to and knowing the vital statistics in the source of your wealth, your business or businesses. You may recall the line from Kenny Rogers’ song about never counting your money while sitting at the table ‘cuz there’s time enough for counting when the dealing’s done. That was advice for gamblers, and it’s based entirely on superstition. And the gambler dispensing the advice was dead broke. The most successful, wealthiest entrepreneurs I know and have known are on top of the important numbers.

 In The New Economy there is less margin for error than ever. This does not mean you become the beady-eyed, tight-fisted bean counter worrying over the cost of paper clips, nor does it mean being a cheapskate always looking only for the cheapest bargain—

#### which is, often, a false bargain. Entrepreneurs make poor accountants, and I’m not suggesting becoming one. And excessive anxiety about money attracts the polar opposite of wealth. On the other hand, you can’t manage what you can’t measure. Knowing THE RIGHT NUMBERS and using them in live-time decision- making (not historical analysis) is both pragmatic and motivational.

 “I zero in on a vision of where I want to be in the future. I can see it so clearly in front of me, when I daydream, it’s almost a reality. Then I get this easy feeling, and I don’t have to be uptight to get there because I already feel like I’m there, that it’s just a matter of time.

 “I set a goal, visualized it very clearly, then created the drive, the hunger for turning it into a reality. There’s a kind of joy in that kind of ambition, in having a vision in front of you. With that kind of joy, discipline isn’t difficult or negative or grim. You love doing what you have to do—going to the gym, working hard on the set. Even when pain is part of reaching your goal, and it usually is, you can accept that too.”

 Independence

#### W ealth is attracted to wealth, money to money. But because independence is the prime outcome and benefit of wealth, wealth is also attracted to independence. One is as good as the other as a magnet.
 Consequently, the less you need income, the more opportunities present themselves, the more eager people are to do business with you and pay you money, the more easily wealth is attracted . This mandates the simple practice of living beneath your present income, so that you can get and stay debt free.
 There are major differences of opinion about this, but this is my book, so I will give you my opinion, based on what has worked so very well for me. I have been very consistent in my position on this, going back well before the most recent recession. I realize this is very conservative financial advice. But from my perspective, it is not just financial advice. It is directed at your inner being, subconscious mind, confidence, and outer behavior. It is, again, about attracting wealth more than it is part of a debate about using

-----

#### debt as investment capital. That debate ignores the psychology of attracting wealth.
 Dave Ramsey, a popular radio and TV talk show host and personal finance expert I like and respect, who deals with money topics, agrees with me about getting and staying debt free for practical purposes. Many other financial gurus differ passionately. They might advise, for example, fully mortgaging your home in periods of low interest rate and investing that money in real estate or stocks or whatever, to make the spread, and build up assets. This was very popular advice in the years immediately preceding the recent bubbles bursting and stock market and housing market collapse. Many of the people who were most passionate about such advice—and most likely to ridicule “money chickens” like me—are now broke. I have never gotten comfortable with debt as an asset, with leveraging debt into more debt. I also have a much longer view of history than most seem to have. I remember, for example, the Jimmy Carter years and the Houston real estate crash, when people so leveraged were wiped out en masse. I also find that the leverage-the-debt advice often comes from people who earn commissions selling investments. However, here, now, this is not about that debate. The debate ignores and omits the psychology of attracting wealth by feeling, at your core, wealthy (not indebted), and by feeling and being independent.
 Debt doesn’t just enslave through compound interest reversed. It enslaves by imposition, by telling you that you should do work you don’t want to do, accept clients or customers you can’t stand, and otherwise compromise every which way because you need money. I insist your objective should be to get to the position of not needing more income, so you can act independent, be selective, call your own shots, entirely free of actual or felt pressure. What I call “The Independent Position” rolls finances, attitude, reality and emotions, conscious and subconscious together, and it is magic.

 DEBT IS EVIL because ...

-----

#### • Every dollar you bring in is instantly diminished in value by
 its need to contribute to servicing your debt.
 • It compels you to do things you would otherwise not do. Debt
 produces Need. Need is completely counterproductive.
 • It leaves you vulnerable to short-term competitive or
 marketplace challenges, economic slumps, aberrant events (e.g., 9–11), etc. that you might otherwise painlessly withstand.
 • It is habit-forming . It is easy to get good at juggling debt,
 comfortably living in debt. You can get so good at survival skills that they are in the way of developing success skills.
 • It is a source of worry, anxiety, frustration that interferes
 with wealth attraction, productivity, even physical health.
 • It lengthens the time required to get to your Financial
 Independence Number; sufficient assets and investments to never need work or earn another dollar for the rest of your life.
