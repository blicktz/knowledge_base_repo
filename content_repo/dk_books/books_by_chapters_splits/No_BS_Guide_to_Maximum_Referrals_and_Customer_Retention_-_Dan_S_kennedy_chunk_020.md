#### A Lot of Referrals from a Customer, Fast
##### Remember, asking a customer to refer is asking him to remember to do it, to do it when an opportunity arises, and to do it capably. It’s asking a lot. And it’s very random. There is an alternative that gets you introduced to his entire circle of influence all at one time. If most business owners took a good customer to lunch every week and laid out this plan and asked the customer to do it, and half agreed, he’d probably increase his business’s new customer flow by 2x to 20x that year.
 You’ll get a lot of referrals from one customer, fast, when a person or business agrees to send a letter or email to everyone they know or to all of their customers, as a way to introduce them to you. They may offer a special, on your behalf, to their friends or customers. They may offer some free information available from you, as we just discussed. Maybe the letter does both. There are three primary ways to use this strategy, typically called “The Endorsement Letter Strategy.”

#### Family, Friends, and Neighbors
##### I recently set this up for Bud, a friend of mine, who owns a new and growing lawn care company in the Louisville area. Here is exactly what I did:

 • Step One. I wrote the letter for one of Bud’s happy customers, to
 come “from him.” It described his initial skepticism and his and his wife’s happiness now with their magnificent lawn and garden, perfectly maintained every week. It said they used to get warning


-----

##### letters several times a year from their pesky homeowners’ association, but since putting Bud in charge, no more notices. Their lawn made their neighbors, pardon the expression, green with envy. The letter referred to and was sent with a limited-time special offer just for the neighbors of Bud’s happy customer. Also, a separate offer to go to Bud’s website and download a free report about having weed-free gardens. I also suggested that when Bud sent out the letter, he should include a picture of the person’s house and their amazing-looking yard with it. A nice little ego stroke for the customer and a piece of proof for the recipient.
 • Step Two. I wrote a simple script Bud could use to ask happy
 customers if they wouldn’t mind allowing him to send out a version of this letter, customized for and approved by them, to all of their neighbors. My suggestion was to use this script anytime he got a compliment, either in person or over the phone.
 • Step Three. Bud bought the list of names and addresses for all the
 people who owned a house in his happy customer’s subdivision and mailed a letter to all of them. He also got from the customer names and addresses of all his friends and family members who lived anywhere in Bud’s service territory and mailed to them, too. At my suggestion, Bud used a six-by-nine envelope, a live stamp, and a print-photo-enclosed-do-not-bend sticker to put on the outside of the envelope, guaranteeing a virtual 100% open rate. The sender name and address on the envelope was Bud’s customer’s, not his or his company’s.

 Bud’s new lawn service almost instantly maxed out with the number of customers he can handle by himself, and he is looking for his first employee to help out. If Bud delivers good service, and if Bud hires wisely, and if Bud follows up on prospects that these mailings created but that did not immediately become customers, and if Bud uses this mailing as often as he can in the future, he will grow a very big business with just this one strategy.
 Dan Kennedy began teaching this strategy in speeches in 1983, inside a now famous story of his called “The Al-The-Plumber Story.” He told me he put the very same strategy to work last year for a charity, mailing a letter

##### from a donor to all the donor’s neighbors in his community, and produced stellar results. This is a time-proven strategy!

#### Business to Consumer
##### Another way to use the Endorsed Letter Strategy is for you to work with a business that has customers who would also make good customers for you and your business. In this case, you create a letter from the business owner to their customers where the business owner is introducing your business and presenting a special offer for just his customers. This allows you access to all of the customers and/or prospects of that business, which with the right list and letter, is an easy way to get a massive number of referrals, fast.

#### Association to Members
##### Another great source for endorsed mailings and one that adds considerable credibility to you is an association or other membership organization. Obviously any industry association has considerable clout with its member base. By bringing them a free information gift that they can offer to their members, you give them value to deliver absent cost.

#### “Shaun, This Sounds Like WORK”
##### To be successful with any of these endorsed referral campaigns, you need to be willing to do all the work and cover 100% of the costs yourself, including printing and posting the letter. If, at any point, you rely on the association, business, or customer to pay for a single part of this process or do any work, it will be dead in the water. And it should be. You may encounter an association or business that isn’t willing to give you their list, but most of the time, they will happily supply it directly to your printer and mailing house or facilitate your getting it done by theirs, and paying them to do it. You will have to make all the arrangements and carry the water all the way.
 One of my managers, Tasha Wise, recently was introducing a new system to her team, and the team grumbled about it. When she asked what


-----

##### the problem was, one of the members of her team said it seemed like a lot of work. Tasha came up with what is currently my favorite team chant:

 “Where do we go every day?” “Work!”

 “What do we do every day when we get there?” “Work!”

 Sure, creating a referral system involves work. Inspiring customers to cheerfully choose to continue to do business with you is work. Singling out key customers to do individual, personal referral activity with—like the Endorsed Letter Strategy—is work. Isn’t that what you go to the office or store to do every day?
 The good news about this is that a lot of the work only has to be done from scratch once, then used again and again and again. Some can even be put in place once then automated. I only had to write my book and set up its website once—not every Monday. Every day or any day, any hour, day or night, one of my clients can refer somebody to my site at www.TheNewsletterPro.com to get my free book sent to them. The site automatically sends them a thank-you and confirmation email, gets the book sent, and commences a follow-up marketing sequence. I could be at the beach, taking a siesta the entire time. This is why you want to build your marketing systems to last. As the cliché goes, work smarter not harder. There’s a lot of different kinds of work. Doing work once to facilitate your customers working for you a lot is very smart work.

## Thinking WAY Outside the Box, to Put
 Your Referral Growth on High Speed

##### by Susie Nelson

 m I the “odd person out” here?
 When a business owner asks me “What do you do?” and I explain that I’m the leading business strategist and coach for home party selling and network marketing companies and their

##### appear. “Oh,” he thinks or even says, “you’re one of those home party ladies.” Or: “Oh, you’re associated with pyramid schemes.”
 I can’t totally fault the reaction. I felt exactly the same way when I first bumbled into the home party, direct-selling world. I did not consider home party plan selling to be a “real” business. This was just something desperate housewives did as an excuse to get together and drink wine. Or a way for people to make a little extra spending money. My attitude changed dramatically when I replaced my dull engineering job and quickly created a six-figure income in the home party selling business. And, no, the many fine companies using party plan selling, and allowing sales agents to develop their own sales teams, are not illegal pyramid schemes. This is a legitimate, well-established alternative distribution channel for a wide

##### variety of products and services, and a path to entrepreneurship and six- figure and even seven-figure incomes for people from all backgrounds in the U.S. and all around the world. It is very misunderstood by many. Further, this business model can be overlaid or integrated with all sorts of “normal” businesses to foster fast growth and referrals. Even doctors did in- home Botox® parties when that cosmetic procedure was first becoming popular. This is what I want to get you thinking about in this chapter, whether you’re a financial planner or restaurant owner or chiropractor or tutor or real estate agent, etc.: how you might harness the power of party plan selling for your business!
 If you’d like to fast-track your business’s growth—without a huge advertising investment (or gamble)—you’ll keep an open mind.
 First, some context. According to industry statistics posted on the Direct Selling Association’s website at the time of this writing (www.DSA.org), sales of goods and services sold directly to consumers by independent sales agents and distributors, home party plan sellers, and network marketing companies’ distributors totaled $34.5 billion in the U.S. in 2014, a 5.5% increase from 2013. Of that number, 23% came from the party plan channels. There’s good reason. In my experience, the home party selling approach is the easiest, simplest, least expensive, and most effective way of organizing referral marketing ever invented! Even the celebrated super- investor Warren Buffett is invested in a home party sales company.
 No, I never pictured myself building such a business. I had not enjoyed attending home parties, and I dreaded being asked to host them. I felt that, given my engineering career, I’d be “lowering myself” to participate in this as a business. But frankly, I needed extra income, and my Dad connected me with his secretary, who was making a lot of money selling clothes through home parties. I was reluctantly intrigued. Then I was recruited. The company she was associated with was ill-fated. When it failed, a group of the top sales managers, with me along, found a manufacturer in the same goods category and convinced them to start a home party division. That lasted only a year. Through these misadventures, I learned a lot about what not to do if you are going to start selling or promoting through home parties. For me, as the saying goes, the third time was the charm. I connected with a startup company led by a woman who had a highly successful career at Avon, had a clear vision, and communicated it well. I

##### was at its first national conference, along with only about 150 other women. That company grew and thrived, and I was one of six people who rose to its National Sales Manager level. My personal organization topped $1 million in revenue eight separate years, and we were always in the top 10% of the entire company.
 Now, here’s what should be interesting to you: the numbers. Every time I promoted an agent out of my organization, I had to replace her, her team, and that revenue, and I always did it quickly. A number of times I relocated to new territories in different states where I didn’t know anybody, and still quickly built a thriving sales organization. My entire success revolved around just three people and my “Start with 3 × 8 System.”
 I only needed three people—friends, strangers I met and befriended, a neighbor—who would each hold a party with only eight of their friends, relatives, neighbors, and co-workers attending. I did carefully coach each hostess on who to invite and how to invite them. Getting that right is an important key. With that, here’s how the growth happened and happened quickly:

 • 3 home parties × 8 guests = 24 potential customers
 • In addition to sales, I booked 8 new parties out of the 3:
 8 parties = 64 potential customers
 • In addition to sales, I booked (at least) 13 new parties:
 13 Parties = 104 Potential Customers

 In total, 192 potential customers. I averaged seven out of eight placing orders. I also turned eight of these into consultants in my sales organization.
 All from getting just three people to play along in the first place. Just three. So, the question for you—regardless of the business you’re in—is: do you have just three raving fan customers who could be enticed into getting just eight of their friends, family members, neighbors, co-workers, or peers together at their homes for fun, refreshments, and a fascinating presentation, demonstration, or class about your “thing”? I’ll bet you have the three. If you do, you can multiply them into 192 potential customers in a matter of a few weeks to, at most, a couple months from just 24 evenings’

##### work. If you really take to this, you could create a “consultant opportunity,” turn several of these customers into party plan sellers, and have your own little self-perpetuating marketing machine feeding customers into your business without you ever doing another home party yourself. Yes, it’s work to put this into motion. But 192 good potential customers are not easy to come by any other way, either.
 I have used this same “Start with 3 × 8 System” as a coach, to raise many party plan companies’ agents to top performance, fast. I’ve installed it across entire companies or organizations as a consultant and then provided group coaching to support it by conference calls and online media. There really is no reason you can’t apply it to your business, too, and I’ve made it very easy to think it through . . .

#### Referral Marketing on Steroids
##### Truth is, most methods of growing a business by referrals have a lot of factors not conducive to speed, that party plan selling end runs. Usually, you can only get referrals from a customer you’ve already obtained, sold to, satisfied, and built a relationship with. You can get somebody to agree to host a party with a lot less of a relationship in place. Most customers refer one person at a time. My plan gets them to bring together eight all at one time, and some of them multiply instantly. This really is high-speed referral marketing on steroids.
 Just like regular referrals, this is friend-telling-friend. It’s just well organized and sped up. A lot.

#### Multiple Purposes
##### Let’s say you will be opening a new store, gym, practice, restaurant, etc., in an area two months from now. If you can come up with just three people in that area to host home parties for you, you can put as many as 192 customers in place before its doors open, lined up outside when the doors open. Let’s say that your business is established but stuck in a slump— would generating 192 new customers in a few weeks to a couple months with zero advertising expense help? Maybe you want to launch a new

##### product or service—will just three of your customers agree to organize home parties? If you can’t think of a way to use this strategy, you just aren’t thinking!
