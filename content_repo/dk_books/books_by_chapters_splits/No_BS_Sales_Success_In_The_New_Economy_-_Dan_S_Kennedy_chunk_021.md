# CHAPTER 16

POSITIONING,NOT PROSPECTING

## It has been my observation that the weakest link in the selling chain for most salespeople is prospecting. Most people can do at least an adequate job of presenting their products or services, if there’s a reasonably interested prospect in front of them. But most of the salespeople I’ve encountered simply hate prospecting. Consequently, they avoid it, both consciously and unconsciously, and do it only when the dire necessity of imminent starvation pushes them to it, and then they do it poorly.
 And do you know what? I hate prospecting too. If I had to acquire my clients, my speaking engagements, my consulting assignments, and my writing projects by prospecting, I’d be driving a cab for a living. To me, prospecting is grubby, unpleasant work. To me, there’s no worse way to spend time than talking to people who are not interested, are not qualified to say yes even if they were interested, and who view me as someone they have to defend themselves against.

## I’m here to tell you: I do NOT think you should prospect. Especially now, in The New Economy, when potential customers and clients, by recession conditioning, step back and away from the sales professional coming toward them as if he were a drooling, rabies-infected, flea-infested dog—even when what he has to offer is of interest to them. Traditional prospecting is going to be less productive than ever, for the foreseeable future. Just being visibly engaged in traditional prospecting makes you glow toxic.
 What you need to do is to focus on positioning. By that I mean positioning yourself so that good, qualified prospects find out about you and seek you out to obtain your expert assistance in solving their problems…or at least feel they are finding you and seeking you out.
 Incidentally, it’s perfectly okay to pursue them in follow-up, once they feel they’ve discovered you, made the first move toward you, and invited the communication. In fact, it’s foolish and irresponsible not to follow-up. But that first move needs to be theirs.

 Selling

## Prospecting sucks.
 Why is this so important? Because when you go to prospects and present yourself, their guard goes up. They perceive you as someone there to get something from them. This is when “sales resistance” sets in. But when somebody discovers you, and takes the initiative to seek you out for your expert assistance, then that person’s guard is down. “Sales receptiveness” rules.
 Here are some opportunities for prospects to discover you.

# Writing

## Writing and being published is a powerful way of helping others discover you. I’ve written many articles, for free, for all sorts of publications, and I work hard at having books I’ve written available in bookstores. Why? Because business people read these articles or books, reach the conclusion that I am the expert who can help them, and then seek me out. If I sought them out and put the same information in front of them, as a sales letter or brochure or even by giving them my books, that would not have a tenth of the impact as when they discover the information for themselves.
 How does that apply to you? Let’s say you’re a car salesperson. You can write an article or a regular column for your community newspaper about the inside secrets of buying, trading in, selling, and financing automobiles. You can write about the tax benefits of buying versus leasing and vice versa, what to look for when buying a used car, how to sell your own car, and so on. If you write a whole series of such articles, there may be newspapers, magazines, “shoppers,” local union newsletters, and other publications that would be thrilled to publish them.
 You could also write a book. Need ideas? How about Confessions of a Car Salesperson: How to REALLY Get The Best Deal, or How To Help Your Teenager Buy and Care for That First Car, or Everything Women Should Know Before Buying a Car. Then you could have that book printed and bound and donate a half-dozen copies to every branch library within 100 miles of where you sell cars. Get local bookstores to take them on consignment. Get a busy local car wash to give them away as gifts to their customers. You could even advertise and sell the book by mail.
 Years ago I consulted with Dr. Robert Kotler, a cosmetic surgeon in Beverly Hills, California, who wrote and published his own book, brilliantly titled The Consumer’s Guide to Cosmetic Surgery. Thanks to that book and its well-chosen title, he had the credibility of an author. The book got him invited on local talk shows and invited to lecture. He advertised the

## book rather than directly advertising his practice, and it ranks as one of the best things he ever did for his business. He’s since become really famous— including a stint for a couple seasons on the popular TV show, Dr. 90210. I have used The Consumer’s Guide To . . ., The Official Guide To . . ., or The Insider’s Guide To . . . idea in creating hundreds of different comparable selling tools for clients in many different fields. One even landed its author, the owner of a handyman services company, on Oprah.
 In addition to or instead of your own book, you might write for others’ publications. If you sell business-to-business, for example, selling advertising time for a radio station, you could write a series of articles about the how-to’s of radio advertising and then do everything possible to get them published in local business journals, newsletters, newspapers, and magazines. You could also write and publish a newsletter about the success stories of radio advertising to send out to your clients and selected prospects every month.
 Today, there are many nonbook self-publishing and selfsyndication options in online media, notably beginning with your own blog and strategic contributions to other blogs. The internet has made it easy for everyone to publish, to such an extent that some blogs have achieved equal status with newspapers and news magazines. While I would insist none of this packs the punch of a book, it is all worth doing.

# Public Speaking

## Public speaking is another very effective way to attract favorable attention from people qualified to do business with you. It is also efficient because of the numbers of people reached via each speech.
 Open up your local or nearest major city Yellow Pages and look under Associations or Clubs. In one of the cities where I live, there are over 2,500 listings in this section of the phone book. There are business groups, civic groups, and special interest groups. Most have monthly meetings. Most need speakers. Most don’t pay their speakers.
 If I’m that car salesperson, and I have a speech—Confessions of a Car Salesman: How To Get a REALLY Great Deal—I would contact local chapters of national associations and local groups, starting with the A’s, the Agri-Business Council, The American Citizen and Lawmen Association, the American Legion Posts, the American Subcontractors, the Association of Realtors, and so on. You get the idea. I’d say to these groups: “Listen, I’ve got a 30 to 45 minute speech that’s fun, funny, and will save your members money the next time they go to buy a car.”
 Even though I get paid to speak, as a professional, I still say no to some engagements and yes to others based on how well they position me to be discovered by good, prospective clients. For ten consecutive years I appeared in 25 to 30 cities a year with Zig Ziglar on big, public seminars, with up to 35,000 people in attendance. So why would I travel all the way from Phoenix to Key West, Florida, on a weekend, to speak to 65 people for a lot less immediate income than I get from one of these events with Zig? Because most of those 65 people had paid $7,000.00 EACH to come to a week-long, intensive seminar to learn how to apply new kinds of direct- marketing methods to their established, existent businesses. They were highly qualified prospects for a number of my professional services. By speaking there, I let them discover me.

-----

## Thirty-five years ago, when I was just getting started in public speaking, I had limited financial resources for promotion, but I had a lot of time. I did my own telemarketing and spoke for free at in-office sales meetings, real estate offices, insurance offices, and other businesses. In those speeches, I promoted my own seminars. In one year, I did over 150 of these little presentations. I improved my presentations with the practice and I made over $100,000.00 from promoting my seminars.
 Just about anybody could use this same strategy. My Platinum Member Dennis Tubbergen has an entire company devoted to helping financial advisors fill seats at seminars where they can deliver the canned, proven presentations he provides, to attract key, targeted clients, like large sum IRA account holders. And it is relatively common to see “high transaction” sales professionals like investment brokers, as well as cosmetic surgeons and cosmetic dentists, putting on seminars to attract clients or patients. But I’ve taught hardware store owners, golf school owners, and home security system salespeople—to name a few—how to effectively sell through seminars. We have a Member very effectively promoting her restaurant, another promoting her wine business, both by speaking to women’s clubs.

# Big Breakthrough from Seminars

## From Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle DIAMOND Member Peter Ursel M.D., Ontario, Canada: “I’m a cosmetic surgeon and I’ve been getting your No B.S. Marketing Letter for many years now, and have used your concepts haphazardly with pretty good results. I was happy but not ecstatic. Now I’ve had a breakthrough! I decided to put on a ‘What’s New In Cosmetic Surgery Seminar.’ I did a classic Kennedy style promotion. I announced it in my monthly newsletter, I put a tabloid style, ‘unprofessional’ ad in the newspaper, I recycled the ad as a postcard to my list, and finally did a voice blast to my list. Results: 300 registered, 250 showed up, 140 booked appointments, and so far,

## over $100,000.00 in procedures! All this in a little town of 20,000 people.”
 Today, just as the internet has provided a portfolio of media for writing and publishing other than books, newspapers, and magazines, the internet and other technology has provided new alternative ways to use public speaking to promote businesses. Last year, my companies and my clients, combined, brought more than 10-million people to “teleseminars” and “webinars” and other “online events” for promotion and for direct sale of everything from my newest book to laparoscopic surgery to computer software systems to investments. The online events quite often feature a speaker delivering a live presentation, even writing on a whiteboard, and ending by taking questions from viewers. These speaking-via-media opportunities can erase traditional geographic boundaries of business, allow you to present to small groups efficiently and cost efficiently, and enable you to offer an interesting, alternative way for people to learn about what you do or about your products and services without putting themselves in an intimidating or uncomfortable sales environment, like an actual seminar room at a hotel or a classroom at your store, office, or showroom. They also make you a bit of a TV star, and that never hurts.
 For Glazer-Kennedy Insider ’s Circle[™] Members, we have a wide range of resources, home study courses, and assistance for people who want to master persuasive public speaking and use tele-seminars, webinars, and similar media, all accessible with free trial membership at FreeGiftFrom.com.sales.

# Publicity

## Publicity can change your entire life experience as a sales professional. When somebody writes an article about you and it is published in a newspaper or a magazine, or you appear as a guest on a radio or TV show, you gain credibility, authority and celebrity.
 I believe any sales pro, selling anything, should make a concerted effort to utilize publicity, to get media exposure, to “get famous” to some degree: because we live in a celebrity and fame dominated culture. “Celebrity” is the most powerful marketing force I know of.
 Most sales professionals don’t need “as seen on Oprah” level fame in order to be accorded celebrity status by the customers important to them. Being famous to a few will usually do. I can still walk through airports, shopping malls and hotel lobbies without being mobbed by groupies or accosted by paparazzi, but within communities that matter to me—such as entrepreneurs passionately interested in direct marketing—my name is known, I’m referenced and talked about constantly, there are even internet sites where people gather just to talk about me, and at certain conventions and conferences I am mobbed by fans—including those asking for autographs. If you doubt my fame, just Google[®] me. I call myself a famous person nobody’s ever heard of. I seek publicity and celebrity only selectively and strategically. You can do the same. The smaller the pond chosen, the easier and faster you can become the big fish.
 Determine who your customers listen to and consider influential, what they read and consider most authoritative, what websites they visit most, and work at being interviewed by, quoted by, published in those venues.
 Here’s why all this—positioning, writing, speaking, selective publicity— is so important.

# Are You Just Another Salesperson?

## You might have the solution to a client’s greatest need, the answer to his or her most earnest desire, but if you are perceived as “just another salesperson,” the client won’t pay attention to you or will feel hesitant about placing trust in you. That’s what these techniques are all about: positioning yourself in clients’ minds as the trustworthy, respected, and celebrated expert so that they seek you.
 By now you may be wondering how to apply some of these ideas to your own business. These ideas are transferable, nearly universal strategies that anyone can use. Suppose, for example, you run a home security systems business.
 Easy. Write a book: Burglars’ Seven Secrets for Picking the Houses and Families They Attack. Write a column for your community newspaper: Crimestopper Tips. And so on.
 You’ll find that, just as I said earlier, the writing of a book or a newspaper column will generate business. But you can also use your book to get onto some of the talk shows. Then, watch the news for a new reason why you should appear and be interviewed again, such as a string of robberies occurring in a neighborhood and going unsolved, or the annual release to the media of the crime statistics report.
 Next you could target an appropriate geographic area and start sending a quality newsletter to all the homeowners. Call it Smart Strategies for Safe Living: How to Safeguard Your Family and Your Home. Provide useful information and tips. Offer your book free.
 You could use your book and newsletter to contact and keep contacting reporters, columnists, and editors of every publication in your area as well as talk show hosts and program directors of radio and TV stations. Be polite but persistent. You’ll get written about. You’ll get publicity. Then you can quote what they say about you. You might wind up with a selling asset like this: The Cleveland Plain Dealer said “Robert Bogart knows more about
