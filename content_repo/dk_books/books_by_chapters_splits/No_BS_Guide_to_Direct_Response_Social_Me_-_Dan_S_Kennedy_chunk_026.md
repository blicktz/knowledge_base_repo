###### ability and willingness to buy. My 90-minute presentation was completed in less than half that time, including a tour of the mock Hawaii property. The salesperson didn’t ask me any qualifying questions, like “Where do you work?” or “How do you plan to pay for the timeshare?”
 If he had, he would have found out that I own the largest custom print newsletter company in the world and mail millions of pieces each year. He would have learned that I have a team of 35 employees, four young kids, and a serious commitment to Disney. In fact, he would have discovered that I was ready to lay down the cash for a timeshare right then and there, but he judged this book by its cover and, in doing so, he lost a huge sale. In the months that followed, that salesperson made one very brief follow-up phone call and promptly marked me as a “bad lead” in the system.
 If you think the above examples are rare, or unlikely to happen to your business, think again. Disney is arguably one of the best marketing companies on the planet, and even they failed at landing the follow-up sale.
 There are many reasons leads don’t turn into customers. Hundreds of books have been written on the subject, but the number-one reason leads don’t turn into sales is due to the lack of follow-up. Just because you are ready to sell a prospect and turn him into a customer doesn’t mean he is ready to buy.

 • 18% of prospects are ready to buy right now.
 • 82% of prospects take greater than three months to make a buying
 decision.
 • 61% of prospects take greater than one year to make a buying
 decision.
 • 44% of salespeople are only making one follow-up call after a
 meeting.

 When you look at those facts, does it make you wonder how many sales you’re leaving on the table? What would happen if you implemented a follow-up process that would continue to nurture your leads until they were ready to buy?
 Here is an example of a near perfect prospect follow-up sequence:


-----

###### Many years ago, when I was in my early 20s, I was looking to buy a franchise. Being the nerd I was (okay, am), I requested UFOCs (now called FDDs, or Franchise Disclosure Documents) from dozens upon dozens of franchisors. At the time, I was 9 to 12 months out from making a purchase, but I wanted to research my options.

 Within six weeks of requesting these UFOCs, all communication had stopped with every franchisor but one. This single franchisor called occasionally, but her primary way of following up was with a monthly print newsletter. Now, as a guy who creates hundreds of newsletters per month, I can tell you it was one of the best newsletters I have ever seen. Each edition featured a cover article either about herself or a fellow franchisee. When it was a franchisee, they most often talked about how excited they were to be a part of the business or how fast their franchise was growing. They talked about their upcoming convention and all the exciting benefits of attending.

 Each time this monthly newsletter hit my mailbox, I immediately opened and devoured it. I even forced my wife to read it so we could chat about it over dinner. This franchisor reminded me each month who it was, what they did, and why I should be excited about its opportunities. I ended up buying a franchise nearly six months earlier than I had originally planned—primarily so I could attend the annual convention.

 The above story lends itself to an important question: Why did I buy early? Was it because she sent a newsletter? Was it the follow-up? Was it something else entirely?
 Because I’m a self-acclaimed newsletter guy, you might assume I’m going to give all the credit to the newsletter, but the newsletter was just the vehicle used to deliver the message. The reason I bought early was because of the relationship I had developed with the franchisor, a person I had yet to meet face to face. After months of receiving her newsletter, I felt I knew and liked the person I was getting into business with. I felt connected to the franchisees and the business model the corporate office was selling. I was

###### excited about the opportunity and truly believed this franchise was going to benefit my life and the lives of my loved ones.
 It all comes down to this: People want to do business with people they know and like. When you take the time to build a relationship with your qualified prospects, and both educate and entertain them through the buying process, you will close more sales at a faster pace. You can accomplish this by inviting your customers over for Sunday dinner each month, but unfortunately that’s not a scalable technique and it could very well lead to a divorce.
 In years past, you could simply send an email, but with the average person receiving 147 emails per day, that’s no longer a viable option. On the other hand, with the average person receiving 2.7% the number of direct mail pieces per day as they do emails, a print newsletter, delivered directly to your prospects and customers, can have a huge impact on conversions, retention, and referrals.
 Now that we have a plan for turning your social media prospects into new customers, let’s look at the single biggest mistake entrepreneurs make after the sale.

 CONGRATULATIONS … YOU MADE IT TO THE FIRST SALE By now you’ve managed to create an ad, get your ad approved by the powers that be, convinced someone to click on your ad, redirected them to a landing or sales page, encouraged them to take a positive action, and ultimately, with some nurturing and follow-up, persuaded this lead to make a purchase. Your job is done, right? Wrong. It has only just begun. Right about now is when most entrepreneurs miss the boat. You have just done an incredible amount of work to make a sale—now is not the time to forget about your new customer. As Dan Kennedy would say, “The purpose of making a new sale is to get a new customer.” If you implement a long-term relationship building a value-adding system, these new sales will turn into repeat sales, long-term customers, and referral sources. But that begs the question, how do you begin to build that relationship?
 The first step is to stop participating in customer neglect. Many businesses are treating their customers all wrong. But in most cases, it is not even the business owner’s fault. They are just copying what they have seen other companies do.


-----

###### There are two very common customer neglect scenarios. The first: The business successfully lands a sale, but never communicates with the new customer again. Can you imagine? Who would do this? Well, as I pointed out earlier in this chapter, businesses and salespeople alike abandon customers and prospects all the time.


###### “We live in the single most difficult time in history to make a first sale, but we live in the single easiest time in history to make a second
 sale.”

 —Perry Belcher, cofounder of Digital Marketer


###### The second and more common type of customer neglect is to land a new customer and then bombard them with nothing but bills and sales material. Like any red-blooded entrepreneur, I’m all for selling, but the “buy or die” strategy some employ is not my cup of tea. When I see a business that’s always selling but never adding value outside of those purchases, it reminds me of that friend or relative—you know who I’m talking about—the one who never calls unless they need a favor or a cash advance. I have one family member I tend to dodge simply because they constantly suck both the money and the life out of me and never add extra value. Most entrepreneurs have at least one of this type of person in their life and work hard to avoid them, but many of us also are this person to our customers. Crazy, right? You don’t want to be known as an annoying pest to the people who have proved they are willing to spend money with you.
 Both of these very common business practices are killers when it comes to overall customer lifetime value and referrals—they even interfere with additional short-term sales.
 Once you get a new customer, you must immediately pivot and start focusing on the long-term retention of that new customer. Remember, people do business with people they know and like. Businesses that live and breathe that phrase thrive:


-----

###### • A 5% increase in customer retention can increase profits 25% to
 125%. (Management consulting company Bain & Company in Harvard Business Review)
 • The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60% to 70%. The
 probability of selling to a new prospect is 5% to 20%. (Marketing Metrics, a think tank)
 • Companies that prioritize the customer experience generate 60%
 higher profits than their competitors. (Leading on the Edge of Chaos by Emmet Murphy and Mark Murphy, Prentice Hall, 2002)

 If you take nothing else from this chapter, make sure you get this point: The real money and long-term growth for your business is in increasing the relationship you have with your existing customers. Nothing can maximize profits faster.
 The single best vehicle I have found for building relationships, increasing lifetime value, and skyrocketing referral rates is a monthly print newsletter. Dan Kennedy himself has said, “My single biggest recommendation is the use of a monthly customer newsletter. Nothing, and I mean nothing, maintains your herd better.”
 If you have tried a newsletter before and determined it didn’t work, it’s probably because you did it wrong. I can confess that my very first newsletter was horrible. To make matters worse, I mailed it for over two years. You can see an example of this awful newsletter in my book, Newsletter Marketing (2013). To help prevent you from making the same mistakes as so many others, let me give you a few guidelines when it comes to “what not to do.”

 Mistake 1: Ineffective Content Every communication you send shouldn’t be about your business. You need to focus on subjects that will interest your customers (even if they don’t interest you). When I look at dental newsletters, most of the time the newsletter is all about dentistry: how implants work, the signs of dry mouth, and what a cavity really looks like. In all honesty, if I was that interested in dentistry, I would have become a dentist! We work with a good number of dentists, but reading about and seeing before-and-after pictures of dental work is frankly scary, boring, and could be a form of cruel and unusual


-----

###### punishment (a clear violation of the 8th Amendment of the Bill of Rights, I might add).
 The same goes for all businesses. Would you want to read a newsletter about newsletters? What about a newsletter from your dry cleaner about getting grass stains out or from your plumber about unclogging clogged toilets? Do you want to know what people really want to read? Just check the second most visited site on the internet: Facebook. People are interested in you and what’s going on in your life. If that wasn’t true, Facebook wouldn’t exist.

 Mistake 2: Sending an Email Newsletter Only People have way too much email, which means way too much competition in their inbox. The USPS found that a print newsletter can linger around a home or office for up to four months. Granted, an email might linger in someone’s inbox for four months, but by then it’s extremely unlikely that it’s going to be read. How many emails do you refer back to from four months ago? Don’t be cheap here, your customers know email is free, and because of that, they’re likely to pay little to no attention to your email newsletter. If a customer is not worth spending $1.00 per month to maintain a relationship with, you might be in the wrong business.

 Mistake 3: Not Mailing Monthly I have a small percentage of people who ask us to mail quarterly newsletters; however, as a company we have decided not to take on those clients. As I write this, we send out over 3 million print newsletters per year. We have offered a quarterly service in the past, but after a lot of data crunching, we determined that quarterly newsletters simply don’t work. When you send a quarterly newsletter, your customers won’t realize it’s a regular publication. A monthly newsletter requires about six months to see best results—on the other hand, a quarterly newsletter might take years.
 Think about it. How many close relationships do you have with people you only talk to four times a year? Even if you consider them a close friend, how close can you really be? Relationships need to be nurtured, and once a quarter just isn’t enough.

##### CHAPTER 14

### Creating the

## Slam Dunk

#### Effective Calls to Action

###### by Dan Kennedy The most common failure of struggling business owners is not product, place, price, or profitability. Their businesses basically work. They just fall down when it comes to selling. This is something of a lost art and a newly disdained activity. People want to send out proposals by email instead of getting face to face to present them. They want an iPad on the wall in their store to do the work of a live, human demonstrator. Sometimes, they hear customers say they prefer such approaches, but it’s vital to realize that the customer is not always right. We must never surrender to expressed preferences that sabotage the most effective selling. For a lot more on selling, I urge getting a copy of another book in this series, No B.S. Guide to Sales Success (Entrepreneur Press, 2004).
 The worst of all selling failures comes when it is time to ask for specific action. Most advertising peters out and meekly ends, without a clear and direct call to action. People are routinely permitted to wander around in stores, look at merchandise, and leave empty-handed without ever being put through an organized, scripted sales presentation that leads to a “close” or even having their names and contact information captured for follow-up. In social media, there is a cultural idea and a fear about moving people too quickly or definitively to an offer and a call to action—only somewhat


-----

###### justified by the interference of the gods of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. The fact is, there’s no money made until somebody sells something, and damn little gets sold without somebody directly asking for the order.
 My famous friend and colleague, the great Zig Ziglar, observed that “timid salespeople have skinny kids,” and said that what separates the poorly paid professional visitor from the kingly compensated professional salesperson is asking for the order. All advertising, all marketing, all media —social and otherwise—must be engineered to get prospect and seller to a time and place where the order can be requested. Anything else is mere professional visiting.
 In advertising, the vital skill is knowing how to ask your prospect to take action. Your experience in effectively closing in-person sales will pay off when you sit down to create effective advertising. The same techniques, words, phrases, and ideas used in personal selling should be used in your marketing.

 A “Slam Dunk” Customer If you’re trying to target the entire world, you’d better be prepared to go head-to-head with big, dumb companies with billions of dollars to waste in the effort. Going after every possible person who could ever use your service is a fool’s errand.
 Instead, you need to figure out who your favorite clients are. Where do they come from? How do they act? What do they read? How much do they earn? What do they like to do for fun? What is it about you that they resonate with?
 Get a grip on who this person is, where to find him, and what he really wants that only you can provide. And then figure out what price you want him to be able to pay. This should be your first step to building a smarter lead-generation system.

 An Easy Layup—Your Lead Generation Magnet Give your leads a clear reason to contact you and get that reason in front of your “slam dunkers.” Narrow down your perfect clients from the unwashed masses. This “thing” you’re creating is an incentive to respond. It’s your Lead Generation Magnet. It can be informational, like a report, guide, book, CD, or webinar, or it might be some other kind of “gift.” Obviously, the
