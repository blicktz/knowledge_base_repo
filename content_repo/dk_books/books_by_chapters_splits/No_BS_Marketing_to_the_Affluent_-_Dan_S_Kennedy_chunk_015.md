##### The Smiths spend 58% of their income on the same necessities. The Jones spend 85% of their income. The Smiths have a wider margin for error and for extra choice spending. They can be sold an expensive night out at the ballgame, a Disney® vacation, and new school clothes for both kids. With financing, they can be sold a new car or even a kitchen remodel. In dollars, they have $27,500.00 a year to use this way—nearly as much in discretionary spending ability as the Jones’ entire income. That’s $2,291.00 a month of flexible spending, saving, and investing power. A blown water pump, a broken furnace, an emergency room bill for Tommy may take a bite, but there’s quite a bit left afterward. Also, should the Smiths choose to live beyond their income—a blessed thing for us marketers—they can get a lot more credit than the Joneses, and they can service a lot more consumer debt. As of this writing, the credit card debt bubble is at its all-time high, in some ways a concealed cancer growing inside a seemingly vibrantly healthy economy. All bubbles burst. The question is when and exactly how, not if. So, this group’s ability to spend is artificially inflated and their willingness to spend subject to abrupt disruption. When I wrote this, in late 2018, interest rate increases from the Fed were happening, and more threatened, in reaction to a “too good” economy. That increases interest rates and, therefore, minimum monthly payments on all these credit cards. It also increases monthly payments on variable rate mortgages and the costs of trading in a car. Ooops. This is the danger of having your business tailored to and dependent on the Smiths. They can go sour on you with little warning. Their ability and/or willingness to buy rises and falls with winds and tides over which you and they have no control.
 Now, the Barons. They only spend 25% of their income covering the same basic and essential necessities that take 58% of the Smiths’ income and 85% of the Joneses’ income. Just 25%. That means 75 cents of every dollar stays loose. No locked-in commitments. In dollars, the Barons have $225,000.00 to spend, save, or invest flexibly. If they wisely split that in half, they can plow $112,000.00 a year into tax-deferred retirement savings plans like 401(k)s, into stocks and bonds, into real estate—so that, in less than ten years, about seven years, and every seven years, they accumulate another million dollars. By comparison, the Smiths can save or invest very little. The Joneses, zero. And even if the Barons act that responsibly, they still have $112,000.00 left over to buy all sorts of unnecessary goods and

##### services and gifts and trips. A big, fat $9,333.00 a month. Should the Barons choose to throw all sane behavior to the wind and live beyond their means—a blessed thing for us marketers—they have the ability to get a whale of a lot more credit and service it than the Smiths.
 In big-thumb terms, the Joneses can handle almost no debt service, and are likely maxed out with their debt. The Smiths can handle about $200,000.00 of consumer debt, tops. But the Barons can handle $1 million of debt. Or, irresponsibly, even more.
 Simply put, if your customers are low-wage or middle-wage earners, the Joneses or the Smiths, you are in very serious peril. Think of these customer populations as a place. You live or have your business in this place. Once, it was a nice neighborhood with well-kept homes, safe streets—salt of the earth type people. Gradually, it changed. Homes declined in value, got bought up by landlords—more renters, less homeowners. Soon drug dealers were on corners with unsafe streets. Such decay rarely reverses.
 You have to get out. You can. Where to go? While the middle class collapse happened (and is in recovery), the affluent population has steadied, proved resilient and reliable, and even grown. From 2011 to 2013, the number of U.S. households with incomes exceeding $100,000.00 grew by 6%. Better, the average household income among these affluents also grew by 5%. Net worth also increased by 2%, to an average $1.1 million. The Royal Bank of Canada’s big, annual Wealth Report, released in June 2014, stated that the number of high-net-worth households with multimillion-dollar net worth rose by 11% from 2011 to 2012, and rose again by another 16% from 2012 to 2013. The wealth of those households rose as well; nominally, but a 2% boost to $5 million is not chump change. Throughout the top 5% of the pyramid, there is a growing number of customers to sell to and they have growing spending capability.
 More recently, even more wealth has risen to the top tiers. And since Trump’s election, truly amazing things have been occurring to the benefit of the affluent: corporate/business and personal tax reductions, record- breaking stock market gains, and with this, almost unbridled optimism.

##### If you are going to choose your customers—as you can and should— why not choose ones with strong ability and willingness to buy, broadly, in diversified categories, with price-elastic decision-making, and imbued with optimism or, if need arises, resilience?
 Consider Comparative WILLINGNESS to Buy. Obviously, ability links to willingness. But there is a broader optimism vs. pessimism. A Gallup Poll in late 2014 showed 56% of Americans saying the economy was continuing to get worse—only 39% said it was getting better. An NBC News poll had a whopping 70% saying the economy was headed in the wrong direction. Within these numbers, there are biases by bottom, middle, or top of the pyramid.
 Optimism about the economy and about one’s personal economy favors marketers. Pessimism about these things stands solidly in the way.
 By late 2018, the situation reversed. Polling on consumer optimism and business leadership’s optimism were at record highs. It was hard for people not to feel this way. Unemployment hit a 50-year low, the stock market hit mind-boggling highs, and the daily economy news was virtually all positive. President Trump exuded optimism, unlike any presidents since Reagan and, before him, Kennedy.
 Pessimism is a headwind against willingness to buy with all but those of significant affluence and enough age to view negative economic situations as temporary. Optimism is a tailwind that spurs a much broader demographic swath of the population’s willingness to spend. It is fine to take some advantage of times of optimism, but also smart to reinvest the extra money that flows into organizing higher income and higher net worth customers so that when the next wave of mass pessimism washes through, your business will be on higher, safer ground.
 A collection of Gallup, The Wall Street Journal, and other surveys and polls that I re-examined when writing the new edition of this book revealed something most instructive about consumer attitudes from 2004, good times, to and through the crash of 2008, through the slowest recovery in history, to the present boom: the greatest fluctuations, the most erratic moves from pessimism to optimism to pessimism occurred with middle- income consumers. Low-wage earners and the working poor stayed pretty steady, from pessimistic-only to barely-better-than-pessimistic through all those years until late 2016, when they began to show a significant lift of

##### optimism. High-income and high-net-worth people also stayed pretty steady, never dipping much below optimistic and at times more optimistic. Those in the middle were most subject to big mood swings; to excess exuberance and to fear and despair. In short, the middle-income consumers are least reliable with willingness to buy.
 There is a very nice neighborhood to move your business into, where you can be welcomed by a growing number of consistently optimistic consumers with fat, open wallets. It is the affluent consumer population.
 This book is the roadmap. It gives you the insight, information, inspiration, and practical how-to directions for moving from selling to Joneses or Smiths to Barons and even Big Barons. For many, this is admittedly far from a simple thing. You don’t just flip a switch. Your own thinking and attitudes and self-image may need a lot of recalibration. You’ll need vision and courage. Your positioning, your products or services, your price strategies, your marketing and selling process, and your salespeople may have to change. But I’m here to argue this is no longer a choice. The luxury of time to procrastinate about this is gone. Death is imminent for huge numbers of businesses refusing to move up the consumer income and net worth pyramid. You must now, aggressively, adapt. Or die.
 The Amazon-ing of retail is but one of these compelling urgencies. It is all about converting consumers from making differential judgments by comparative expertise, experience, credibility, quality, and everything else that supports price or fee elasticity and profit to buying based on convenience, speed of delivery, and lowest price. This moves the middle- income consumers. Only particularly affluent consumers can be depended on for continuing discernment. The middle-income people will get their wills done by LegalZoom, play orthodontist at home with SmileDirectClub, and maybe even buy their car from a website and have it delivered. The affluent person will NOT have their estate plan done at LegalZoom. They will take their daughters and sons to orthodontists. They will patronize the high-end, full-service luxury auto dealership or possibly even use a broker of exotic and luxury autos. This separation of behavior is occurring at a fast pace, so you getting on the right side of it must also happen at a fast pace.
 Also, inevitably, a stall, a stagnation, an episode of runaway inflation, a hefty stock market drop—as likely precipitated by meddling by the Federal Reserve as by anything else, or a variety of other kinds of economic winters

##### will occur. People made “soft” by as big a boom as is occurring as I write this may react more badly to it than they did to 2008. Consumers greatly overextended on credit may have no choice but to stop all optional spending. This may be as much as seven to even ten years away. But it may not. It could occur gradually. It could arrive abruptly.

 Your Choice Ultimately, business owners have one of two attitudinal, behavioral, and leadership styles, choosing either complacency or urgency.
 Those who tend toward complacency are often late to see, predict, and act. Of big brand-name companies ruined, at least in large part by such management, you can list Borders, Sears, JCPenney, and General Motors. The entertainment industry’s ravaging by the #MeToo movement reveals a systemic complacency about a known problem. Facebook’s explosion of crises is the result of systemic complacency and, in concert, arrogance about known problems. Huge entities sometimes take a long time to bleed out and die from their wounds often self-inflicted by complacency. Small and mid-sized companies often move from leadership complacency to crisis to extinction much faster.
 Those who lean toward perpetual urgency, exhibiting a strong bias for decisive action, for proactivity rather than reaction, are often either advantageously early or at least on time. Instead of arrogance, these leaders live by healthy, motivational paranoia. They are never coasting, always innovating. My favorite big companies with CEO’s and other leadership on this list are Disney, Apple, Amazon, Cleveland Clinic, and many of my own clients, not with famous names, but with entrepreneurs making fortunes. These are companies and people who can walk and chew gum at the same time. They can execute on a current game plan, implement a future-oriented collection of next game plans, and envision and begin development of even more distant creative changes simultaneously. They act with urgency about both. Now and Next. If you examine the companies I just named, you will find a commonality of at least the past ten years and their present activities: an emphasis on being for and doing business with affluent consumers as a bigger and bigger part of their businesses.

##### My friend, the late, great Zig Ziglar, often told the “cooked in the squat” story: a frog thrown into a pot of boiling hot water will immediately leap right back out. But a frog placed in a pan of pleasingly cool water will stay put. He will continue to stay put as the heat is ever so slowly inched up, until the dumb frog is cooked in the squat. That’s what has happened to many small-business operators as well as big retail and restaurant chains and entire categories of businesses. The fundamental, adverse trends of middle-income consumers have worsened slowly, gradually, and these business owners have sat there, getting cooked in the squat. They are getting ever closer to a boiling point. Some even know and are splashing around trying to cool the water by blowing on it. Others are surrendering. CEOs running out the clock on their own careers, retiring, taking golden parachute treasure, and slinking away into the night.
 Don’t emulate any of these dumb frogs. Use your big, long legs. Now.

### Who ARE These People, Anyway?

##### “With money in your pocket you are wise, you are handsome, and
 you sing well, too.”

—YIDDISH PROVERB

# I have always wondered about the monkeys on monkey islands in our
##### zoos. As we stand there looking at them, amused at their funny expressions and antics, are they entertained by looking at us in our funny clothes? Are the monkeys asking themselves, Who are these goofy creatures, anyway? I do know, from numerous conversations with my clients, that the rich are strange and odd and incomprehensible, that figuring out what motivates their behavior is as difficult as figuring out why the monkeys act as they do.

##### While we’ll never need to decipher the monkeys’ thoughts and actions, we do need to decode the rich.
 We can begin by organizing the population itself. Throughout this book, I’m going to subdivide the affluent population many different ways:

 • Ultra-Affluent
 • Affluent
 • Mass-affluent

 … and specialty market groups, like

 • Affluent Boomers and Mass-Affluent Boomers
 • Affluent LGBTQ
 • Affluent Entrepreneurs and Business Owners

 … and then by gender, women and men. These divided groups meet, converge, and also act separately. It is up to you to ultimately develop your own carefully defined target group within the affluent population that is ideally matched with your products, services, even your own personality.
 Let’s begin with some basic definitions.

 •  Mass-Affluent. The income markers of this group have been raised
 since earlier editions of this book, reflecting the happy fact that, starting in about 2013, and dramatically accelerating now, all incomes —even those of the decimated ranks of the middle class—are rising. Most credible research sources, including the Federal Reserve, the Economic Policy Institute, and Ipsos, note sizeable hikes in median income. In earlier editions, I pegged the mass-affluent as having household incomes of $85,000.00 to $150,000.00 and/or a net worth exceeding $250,000.00.
 While the incomes of this group have shifted only slightly upward, the net worth is now above $350,000.00 and still rising.
 Another way to think of the mass-affluent is “upper middle class.” A mass-affluent consumer may shop at Kohl’s but also at Macy’s and sometimes at Nordstrom’s, probably shops at a main supermarket but
