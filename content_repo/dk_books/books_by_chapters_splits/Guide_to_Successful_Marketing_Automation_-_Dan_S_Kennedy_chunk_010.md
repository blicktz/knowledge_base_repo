# “READY. FIRE. THEN AIM.”

 (Automate THIS? Automate
 WHAT?)

##### by Parthiv Shah

###### I was drinking some coffee at a local coffee shop, when a man sat down at the table next to me. He saw my laptop bag with the eLaunchers logo on it and asked what it was. I explained that it is the logo of my company and that we help small entrepreneurial businesses all over the world implement and perfect all aspects of digital marketing—including track the marketing so they understand, in real time, moment to moment, which marketing channels are working best for them. Ultimately, we make an automated system for each business.
 This guy’s eyes lit up and he was full of questions. It turns out he owns a local HVAC contractor and has been trying to make Facebook work for him. So far he said he had failed miserably. “It’s been 4 months and I haven’t gotten a single call! I’m doing everything that Facebook tells me to do, but so far nothing. I’m really considering just giving up, but I’m not

-----

###### sure what I’ll do then because the newspaper ads I survived on for 17 years just aren’t producing the results I want either.”
 I smiled, very sure that I was going to be able to help him fix his issues quickly, and said, “What is your market?”
 He responded, “Huh?” “Who do you sell to?” “Anyone with a heating and air-conditioning system in their home,” he said while looking at me like I was an idiot.
 I sighed because right then I knew we were starting from square one. As a matter of fact he hadn’t even got to square one yet. He was still getting ready to take the first step.
 As a basic foundation, we might start with The Kennedy Marketing Triangle:

 To use it, we have to define exactly who you and your particular business is most appropriate for and can be most appealing to. That may come from your knowledge, from experience, and/ or from data mined from your own customer records and/or from other research and/or from a lot of soul-searching. Then we can develop your main messages that match that target market. Then we can choose the best media and make the best use of it. To give you an example, Dan Kennedy told me about several clients of his in the highly competitive retirement investing and annuities businesses.

-----

###### Everybody in one of their families was a college professor or retired professor. University professors in his state had particular, specific retirement savings plans to be converted to their own investments before or at retirement. He made them his market, he “re-positioned” everything he did to be “for university professors,” he used “professor speak,” and he used media they read, watched, or used online. All this instead of marketing to any and all retirees, as his local competitors did. By this, he got substantially better ROI on all his marketing. A different financial advisor / annuity company was also generic; for everybody, thus for nobody. In-depth conversations by Dan with its owners, customer data, and other inputs led to determining their best target market was Christian conservatives, married, paying for Medicare Supplement ($300 to $600 a month, not just on Medicare or Medicare Advantage), with modest, midlevel wealth. This, then, governed messaging, media, and made both online/social and offline media more effective.
 Now more than ever, you need digital marketing skills to determine: WHO buys from you, WHY they buy from you, WHAT they buy from you, and HOW to approach them. Not just “anyone with a heating and air- conditioning system in their home,” but specifically WHO. What age are they? What income level are they at? What part of town do they live in? What’s their occupation? Much more. Looking for the answers to these questions is not new to marketing, but it has been made MUCH easier thanks to technology. There are tools that address all of these issues, but they come at a cost. As an entrepreneur you need to be a master marketer of your business and have the skills (and time) to interpret the analytics that track website traffic, such as reports, page performance, keywords, and competitors. Something like Facebook can feed you “perfect” customers or fail entirely, not by its own doing, but by how much you know about your target you are using Facebook to hunt for.
 Let’s not forget the expert SEO content you are expected to create for your personalized blog posts, and the advanced knowledge of the ever- changing keyword research in your blogs, and blog headings. But that’s not all. Email marketing, online products, online sales funnels, landing pages, and social media platforms are a critical part of your branded marketing

-----

###### strategy. You also need to accommodate customers who respond better to direct sales letters and postcards. WHEW! And we haven’t even discussed the metrics for offline sales you do.
 There is no way that anyone can have all this information stored in their brain. And tracking it with a pen and paper is just too laborious. You would need multiple employees whose only job is to constantly look up these metrics by hand and update them. And that STILL wouldn’t be tremendously accurate. Skills aside, how can one person possibly master, let alone remember how, where, and when all the moving parts should be turning to attract, convert, and close leads? Thankfully, you don’t have to because a Business Relationship System can do the heavy lifting for you. This kind of structured system includes marketing and sales platforms to help attract visitors, convert leads, and close customers. It can combine a variety of functions that allow marketing and sales activities to be managed all in one place.

#### The Secret of Repositioning What You Do for
 Exact Message-to-Market Matching

###### You have already assembled something to sell. My coffee shop acquaintance had solutions to home heating and cooling, heating and cooling costs, some rooms colder or hotter than others, clean air circulation, and more. But every HVAC has those same things. Facebook, Instagram, other digital media is full of companies offering these same solutions, talking about them generally and generically. To stand out, my acquaintance will need to reposition his solutions and find ways to talk about them differently, even to the point of being proprietary. Help with this can come from the WHO he decides on as his best, most desired customer. Taking a “generic” out into the marketplace, using every available digital marketing platform for it, being one of many in the same places, is a losing proposition. You have gotten ahead of yourself. Spending money and time BEFORE having a defined target and BEFORE having offers specifically appealing to that target.

-----

###### Just as quick examples relevant to my coffee shop acquaintance’s HVAC business:

1. Save $200 to $300 a Month on Your Home’s Heating/ Cooling Bill!
2. Fund Our Son’s or Daughter’s College Fund with the Savings I’ll Get for You, on Your

Monthly Heating/Cooling Bill!
3. Enjoy Your Retirement More—Pay for Two Great Vacations or Cruises a Year with the

Savings I’ll Get for You, on Your Monthly Heating/Cooling Bill!

###### #1 is generic. #2 and #3 are targeted. If we can match #3 with relatively young retirees of modest means, who own their own homes…if we can match #2 with parents of high school–age kids, who own their own homes, and are mid-level income earners…or if we can use these separate appeals, “fleshed out,” in social media to attract the matches…we can be much more efficient and effective. Now we have something worth applying the full force of Marketing Automation to. In fact, we have two such things.

#### Case History: Get More Patients, Better
 Patients, at Lower Costs

###### Let me give you an example with one of my clients. They have a multi- seven-figure clinical practice with a great reputation in the market for clinical excellence. Patients travel from long distances and check in to a local hotel just to see the fine doctors at this clinic. The clinician is a highly educated individual with significant investment in continuing education. He is an avid reader, astute student, and a prolific writer. He has a great “chairside manner.” His staff is excellent. Despite all this, he was in a constant struggle to attract enough suitable patients, and found it nearly as difficult now as it had been years ago. His question was: Shouldn’t this be easier and less stressful by now?
 The difficulties with sufficient new patient attraction were not inside the office or with him. They were with the media representing the practice. For starters, their website (online practice) ambience did not match their physical clinic. It was incongruent. The website infrastructure was poor. Capture of visitors’ contact information and data was ineffective—many disappeared back into the water like slippery fish. Automated follow-up to

-----

###### site visitors who did not immediately book appointments was nearly nonexistent. Data was not used to fashion messaging. Quite a bit of money was being spent on media like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc. to bring people to this site, but it just wasn’t ready to perform.
 We did a deep dive of what the goal of the Pixel Estate (website and online media) was as well as who the ideal patient is. We mined his existing patient data for clues to the ideal patient’s demographics and psychographics. Frankly, we knew more about his patients, ideal patient profile, and many facts about his practice within days than he knew from years. Using this information, we built a much more targeted, appealing, and functional site using HubSpot (one of a number of technologies you’ll be introduced to in this book), allowing for automation, direct downloads of a consumer’s guide to choose a pain management doctor, easy access to other information, video presentations, and direct booking of appointments. We also better connected all the digital media he was using.
 With all this, we achieved much better prospective patient engagement, ROI on dollars spent to get them to the website, and the boost in overall percentage of people who became patients was dramatic!
 We, incidentally, have a version of all this work combined with ready- to-use marketing just for implant dentists. You can see it at SellMoreImplants.com.

 When you have a consistent, trackable, well-thought-out process designed to engage, build trust, and excite prospects about working with you, you end up with lower acquisition costs and increase profits almost automatically. Most business owners have not accomplished this. They have hurried into “digital” with Ready, Fire, then Aim. They have disjointed, disconnected presences in different online places and platforms. Frankly, their digital marketing is a mess! Their offline marketing is usually also

# David vs. Goliaths, Punching above Your Weight Class and
 Going from Confusion and

 A Patented Growth Strategy System for Small Businesses in
 the Digital Age

##### by Parthiv Shah

###### Small business owners today face an increasingly complex and competitive landscape. With the rise of digital technologies and online platforms, customers have more choices than ever when deciding where to start a buying journey, where to get information, and where to spend their money. At the same time, larger corporations with big marketing budgets put

-----

###### constant pressure on small businesses fighting for market share. Most small business owners struggle to keep up. They know they need to have an online presence and use digital marketing channels to reach new customers. But the vast array of technology options, from websites to social media to email marketing, and more, can feel overwhelming. On top of that, few small business owners have extensive marketing knowledge or large budgets to spend on a big agency.
 The key is finding the right growth strategies that align with your core business strengths while leveraging smart digital tactics. With the right strategic approach, you can use today’s marketing technologies to punch above your weight class, despite limited resources.
 The Growth Strategy System is a unique, patented system and method of studying historic revenue and other internal data to identify reasons why a brand or business has been growing, who its best customers are, why those customers were attracted to it, and use that data as a model to create a customized business growth strategy, targeted messaging and media, and ultimately automate it all. In November 2022, U.S. Patent #11,507,967 was issued to Parthiv Shah for this invention. That’s me! I don’t know if you hold any patents, but securing one for a marketing process is very unusual and rare. This speaks to how unique my methods are.
 The system will increasingly use the power of “Predictive AI” to analyze the current market data while using the power of “Generative AI” to generate each customized growth strategy. The Growth Strategy System is being developed as a SaaS software, and someday will become a tool for agency owners, consultants, and brand CEOs. I’ve used the system with hundreds of clients and thousands of projects.
 The system guides owners to evaluate their business across six key areas and identify the best marketing tactics to pursue. Rather than throwing money at the latest marketing fad or newest platform, the system takes a more calculated and strategic approach.
 The six elements of the Growth Strategy System are:
1. Brand Awareness
2. Lead Generation
3. Sales Conversion
4. Client Retention

-----

5. Client Referrals
6. Revenue Growth

###### BRAND AWARENESS MADE SIMPLE is how immediately recognizable you and/or your company and its core promises and main story are to and within your target market or audience. If 100 people in your market are picked at random, given a generic description of what you do or the solutions you provide, and asked to provide a specific business by name —how many would name you as the first to come to mind? Would you score 80 percent? Fifty percent? Uh-oh, 10 percent? How many people in your market will bring you up by name in any occurring conversation about the solutions you provide?
 LEAD GENERATION MADE SIMPLE is the quantity and quality of new, interested potential customers coming to you as a result of your advertising, marketing, PR, word-of-mouth, and other sources, at what pace, and at what consistency. Do you have a system or systems working for you that generates a satisfactory quantity and quality of leads, for follow-up, to convert to customers? Online, incidentally, this is not measured in visits or views or likes, etc.—it is measured by the number coming into your funnel and by the appropriateness of those entering your funnel, appropriateness meaning they match up well with your known criteria for a desirable customer.
 SALES CONVERSION MADE SIMPLE is the percentage of leads that engage in an initial transaction. That buy. This, incidentally, must be tracked by source. As an example, in examining one marketer’s data, he had 50 percent of his webinar attendees coming from one source, only 30 percent from the next best, then single digits from others. This was as deep as he looked to score the first source “the best.” But only about 20 percent of the 50 percent bought, while almost 60 percent of the 30 percent bought. You might play with that math.
 CLIENT RETENTION MADE SIMPLE is the number of months (or years) a customer or client stays “active” with you, however you define “active.” This, too, has to be tracked by source and by other variables, such as different initial transaction, initial price, and ascension.

-----

###### CLIENT REFERRALS. Most business owners take what they get. Little is done to organize and manage a system for maximum possible referrals. For this, you should get the No B.S. Guide to Maximum Referrals. Dan Kennedy taught me one way to measure your success with this, which he got from Paul J. Meyer: the percentage of customers you create with what Paul called “endless chains of referrals.” With an endless chain, each customer provides at least one referred customer, and that customer provides one, etc, endlessly.
 To be a necessary broken record, a lot of what you can do to improve measurable results in each of these six categories can be automated, via your CRM (Chapter 6), your marketing software (ClickFunnels, Keap, HubSpot), and other tools. To do everything that can be done to improve results in these six categories, it will have to be automated.
 The power of the Growth Strategy System comes from accurately assessing your business across each of these elements, developing integrated strategies to capitalize on strengths and overcome challenges, then closely tracking execution. Everything you do or use or spend on becomes measured and data driven.
 My friends at Keap label this “conquer the chaos.” I find that, by working within each of these six categories of marketing, getting relevant data, setting up scoreboards, and measuring results in as close to live time as possible, we can replace guesswork and stress with knowledge, accurate forecasting, and organization.

###### Every pro athlete, coach, and business consultant being honest will tell you that measurement automatically improves performance. Often, if you change nothing going on in and with a business, but measurement of every “little” thing, you create documentable improvements.
