Now, a confession of sorts. In our business, at most of our multiday events, we actually use this template—slightly tweaked—to sit down with prospects right then and there and close our sales immediately. This is how our on-site salespeople carry on their conversations with each person in attendance. We want to fully capitalize on the excitement and energy of the moment. But, as I’ve shown here, the very same template can be used for post-event or post-presentation follow-up on phone calls.

### The Best Story Wins—or
 Does It?

###### by Dan Kennedy

 hat has this book really been about? Presentations? Storytelling? Persuasion? Process? All those things.
 Certainly, a great presentation tells a great story: a story about your business, practice, or charity. About you and why

# Wand how you do what you do. A story in which your

###### customer or potential customer stars and sees himself starring. So, do the best stories win? A chief point of this book is: It’s not that simple.
 One of many good and important books about storytelling is Annette Simmons’ Whoever Tells the Best Story Wins.
 There are many kinds of stories. There is the overarching, life-evolving narrative of a person, place, business, or product. There are stories adapted for different audiences, different purposes, and different times. There are stories that influence, stories that bond, stories that outright sell. Most of the time in most competitive situations—even if only competing for an audience’s attention in an attention deficit disorder world—it is the best story that wins. Yet that is deceptive by oversimplification and omission.
 The best story without a well-matched, attentive audience can’t win.


-----

###### In sales, the best story without a well-matched, attentive audience with the willingness and ability to buy, to buy at your prices, and to buy now can’t win.
 And so on. It’s complicated. In this book, you have gotten our best efforts at simplifying some of what’s complicated about success in the marketplace and the marketplace of ideas. Although it was principally about the conveyance of story—the presentation and its all-important structure—we also provided experience- based insights on presenting on stages, in meeting rooms and by media. I want to acknowledge, though, that we have dealt with only a middle piece of a total success process. A great deal of success or failure with a presentation has to do with everything occurring with the audience before they ever see the presentation. Another major contributor to success or failure is everything occurring after the presentation. To use a trendy term, the presentation needs to occur inside a closed, controlled ecosystem you build, own, and control.
 If you happen to already have that in place, you will be able to immediately go into it: to the places where you already have presentations in use and to places where there is opportunity to use presentations realized by reading this book and do profitable things immediately.
 If you do not have such an ecosystem, then we have given you a start point and very good reasons to start, get smart, get busy, and build one. I make no apology for taking you to a Starting Line instead of carrying you across a Finish Line. After all, it is going to be your success.
 I’ll close with a story . . .

 On a dark and stormy night, a very young man—a writer for an obscure, small-town publication—sat in the library of a home of one of the richest men then alive in the world: a baron of industry named Andrew Carnegie. A fire in the fireplace warmed the room. The young man interviewed the industrialist about his success and impressed Carnegie with his probative questions. They were different than the commonly asked questions. Instead of focusing on how rich he was, what he had done, and—often—being implicitly


-----

###### skeptical or critical about the economic injustice caused by his wealth, this young fellow was interested in why and how he had risen from nothing to his wealth and power. Carnegie had long nursed a pet idea—that success could be codified and taught just as mechanical engineering could. He envisioned a course or encyclopedia, a masterwork of some sort—the manual. On impulse, he presented this idea to his interviewer, along with a proposition: if the young writer would take on this project, Carnegie would use his influence to get the writer meetings with all the greatest achievers, entrepreneurs, industrialists, and inventors so that he could unearth and document the principles of thought and behavior these great men and women shared and adhered to—the secret “laws of success” they operated by that others did not. Carnegie said he would not financially subsidize the project, but he would retain no rights to it either. He asked for a decision. Unbeknownst to the young writer, Carnegie had a pocket watch held beneath his desk, and intended allowing a scant 60 seconds for the boy to prove decisive—or to fail that test. Napoleon Hill said yes, and 10 years later, in 1936, his encyclopedia, Laws of Success, and in 1937, his summary book, Think and Grow Rich, were published.

 Think and Grow Rich has sold tens of millions of copies, reigned supreme as the most famous success book to this day, and continues to sell well absent any advertising or promotion all these years later. It’s a good and worthy book. But without the story about it that I just told, it is just one of thousands of how-to-succeed books. New ones are published and promoted every year. Celebrities write them, powerful CEOs write them, ministers write them, academics write them, and people like me write them. Hill outperforms us all— because of the unique and compelling origin story behind the book.

 Hill went on to a good career as a speaker, seminar leader, author of a number of other books, and for a time, a celebrity able to collect appearance fees just for being at a meeting, somewhat like a Kardashian gets paid just to hang out in a nightclub. He developed a number of powerful presentations as a paid lecturer.


-----

###### Many, many years later, a man whose name you may know, Robert Kiyosaki, followed the Napoleon Hill blueprint and made himself valuably famous with a single story about his “rich dad, poor dad”—also his book’s title.

 My own business life has been largely made by a handful of stories told consistently for 30 to 40 years.
 Back in 1992, by the way, there are records in TV and print interviews of a brash fellow telling a certain story about himself and telling a story about his frustrations with America losing, being taken advantage of, and needing to start winning again. Twenty-four years later, telling that same story, he won the Presidency of the United States. This year, he had an ecosystem for it, an organized way to use it, and a powerful presentation crafted around it.
 Kiyosaki made a real business out of his story. Napoleon Hill didn’t, and his later years were not secured by wealth despite all the fame he had created.
 I put my stories into well-crafted presentations and have used those presentations to create an ecosystem I own and control. I kept putting new presentations into that ecosystem, and I became wealthy by doing so.
 This is the point I want to leave you with: What you do with a powerful presentation is at least as important as having it in the first place.

### How to Fuel a Business with Effective Presentations Case History

###### by Mike Crow

 f you’re like me, you’re always looking for new or better ways to grow your business and to find a competitive edge in your market. If the reason you bought this book was more narrow and specific— maybe you had a looming need to deliver some sort of presentation,

# Ifor example—I imagine you’re happy to discover the topic is bigger

###### than that. This is also a book about marketing and growing businesses. Also, if you’re like me, you’ve seen and heard and been sold a lot of ideas that turn out to be a little thin, so you may be skeptical about how much impact using effective presentations can really have on your business. Doing so has certainly helped mine.

##### $52+ Million Businesses with the Same Fuel

###### As the founder of the Millionaire Home Inspector community, I’ve developed many different strategies and methods for the thousands of independent home inspectors and owners of home inspection companies


-----

###### who follow my lead, based on my own outsized success at building a multimillion dollar a year company in this industry—twice. Within the association I created, I’ve helped over 50 of these small service businesses top the million dollar mark, a very high mark in our industry. Of all the strategies that I provide to them, I think making effective presentation to groups of real estate agents and others who can refer business to the inspectors is the most powerful and affordable. Fortunately for home inspectors, most real estate offices have agent meetings and the managers are usually open to having an outside speaker, so most of the inspectors who use my methods for this are doing in-office, small group presentations and can, if they are willing, do a lot of them.
 Although all businesses can be different in different ways, Dan Kennedy is still correct when he says that no business is different. Every business needs customers, and every business has some type of connector persons who can be gathered into groups or who already gather into groups. My definition of a Connector is a trusted expert, influencer, or advisor who serves the customers or clients you want. Often, the Connector is the first point of contact from which a number of purchases flow.
 For the home inspector, the best Connector is the real estate agent. No one can buy or sell a house without getting a home inspection done, but much more often than not, the real estate agent is the first person to deal with the customer, and that agent, by his or her recommendations, can control the home inspector used, the mortgage lender used, and the title company used. This means that agent can refer to the home inspector again and again and again. Every business has similar networks of connectors. For example, personal injury attorneys are the equivalent of real-estate agents to a chiropractor,. For the wedding photographer, it may be that the managers of wedding sites—hotels, resorts, special destinations—are Connectors. I don’t know who the Connectors are for your business but I do know that whatever your business is, there is undoubtedly a group of Connectors.
 It is obvious that having good working relationships with a number of Connectors can be great for your business. It can be a stabilizing force, leveling out the ups and downs of getting new customers by way of your own direct efforts or advertising. It can speed up growth without requiring a lot of money to invest in advertising or marketing. On the other hand, not


-----

###### having good relationships with Connectors can have them blocking business from coming to you, no matter how much you spend on advertising and how known you are in your market. They can also be deal killers, diverting customers away from you and into the hands of your competitor. For all these reasons, establishing relationships with Connectors is important. This is more important than many business owners think.

##### Why Don’t You Already Have a Great Circle of Connectors Bringing You all the New Customers
 You Can Handle?

###### The problem standing in the way of maximizing your relationships is that there are also pre-existing relationships between every Connector and your competitors. To start getting a stream of referrals from a Connector, you have to disrupt that relationship. I find the best way and definitely the most efficient way to do that is to get the opportunity to speak to a group of them. You get a certain lift of status by doing so, and you get an opportunity to demonstrate that you may be superior in some ways to the provider to whom they currently refer business. If pursuing the Connectors individually, one on one, you may get rejected a lot. You may be told, “I’m already working with someone. Thanks but no thanks.” But imagine what might happen when that same Connector is in an audience of peers, and you appear as a speaker delivering an effective presentation. His hasty “no thanks” can convert into a “yes.”
 You need several things to win over a Connector. First, you need visibility. They have to know you exist and know what you do. Second, you need authority or credibility. You need trustworthiness. They have to know you are capable and competent, and worthy of referrals of their clients. Third, you need preference, reasons to favor you over other providers of the same or similar services. To get to this, you need opportunity! That’s where getting invited in to speak to a group of Connectors comes in.
 In my other business, Coach Blueprint, a company that supports business coaches in every field, I have cultivated relationships with the top Connectors in information marketing, speaking and coaching, including


-----

###### GKIC and Dan Kennedy. Either I or my daughter, Christa Trantham, who runs all three of our companies, makes a point of speaking at almost every GKIC event, by invitation or by sponsorship of a special session. I do for that business what I urge home inspectors to do for theirs: provide visibility, authority and preference.

##### Stop Networking Start Connecting, with
 Connectors

###### In her book The Connectors, Maribeth Kuzmeski says, “Stop networking. Start connecting.”
 This is a powerful idea. Networking is random. It can take up a lot of time and make you feel like you’re working hard and doing a lot, but it may not be very productive. Becoming known to and forming relationships with Connectors is not the same as ordinary networking. It is more focused.
 You have a business to run. The home inspectors we coach are often running “mom ‘n pop” small businesses. They may be owners, operators and still, also, doing inspections themselves. For them, for me, and for you, it’s important to avoid low reward, time-eating activities. There’s no shortage of things you might do to promote your business, so you have to be choosy. You ultimately want leverage, not just random exposure. When you connect with Connectors, you get leverage. Each one may be able to provide four, eight, 12, or 24 clients a year to a home inspector. I don’t think there is any better way to make this happen than by delivering effective presentations to groups of Connectors.

##### How to Get Positive Results with Audiences of
 Connectors

###### Obviously, this book in our hands is rich with advice about creating your presentation or presentations. I’ve learned a lot from Dan and from Dustin. You will too.


-----

###### Here, I’m going to share some of the key pieces of advice I and my team of coaches give to the home inspectors about connecting with audiences. You’ll have to do a bit of translation for your type of business, but a lot of it is easily adapted.

 • Offer useful, benefit-driven presentations, not just a thinly veiled
 sales pitch. To be invited in to do a presentation and to have the agents feel good about it, it must actually add value to the meeting. We teach our home inspectors to assemble information and ideas that can be genuinely useful to the real estate agents. Most agents, like most other sales professionals and business owners, are very busy, poor time managers, and don’t read or process as much information about their businesses as they should. It frankly doesn’t take rocket science for a home inspector to collect and organize some up-to-date information from ordinary news sources and trade journals about trends and strategies that agents can use. The same thing is probably true in your field. Don’t let this feel like some difficult task that is beyond you.

 • Teach the inspectors to offer the sales manager a choice of
 presentations to choose from. This is a simple but effective idea. It switches the manager’s decision from “Yes” or “No” to “Gee, I wonder which one of these would be best?” This sets up the magic question: “Which one of these topics do you think your agents would like to hear about most?” The manager picks; the inspector says, “Great—when would you like to schedule that?”
 Some of the choices we offer are:

 – Nine Marketing Secrets of Top Producing Real Estate Agents – The Top 10 Real Estate Apps and How To Profit from Them – Never Let a Home Inspection Kill a Sale Again – 10 Ways to Get More Referrals Every Month

 • Don’t just get in once—get invited back again and again. It’s
 important to notice that three of these four choices have nothing to do with home inspections. It’s a common mistake to want to go in and


-----

###### deliver a big, fat commercial for your business. Do that, and you won’t be invited back. If you do this as we teach, delivering valuable information, you will be invited to come back and do a different presentation. Imagine the power of doing a presentation every few months to the same group of Connectors! For the home inspectors we coach, we’ve developed over 20 different presentations they can rotate.
 If you can become a regular fixture with a group of Connectors, you will get one, then another, then another referring to you over time.
