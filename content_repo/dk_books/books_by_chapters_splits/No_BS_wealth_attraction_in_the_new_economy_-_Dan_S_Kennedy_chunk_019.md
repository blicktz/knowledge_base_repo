 The Making and Marketing of PLAYBOY Is Not as
 Simple as it Would Seem

 How hard is it to sell sex? A magazine filled with pictures of naked women? Such a simplistic view would have Disney in the amusement park business, Starbucks in the coffee business, Victoria’s Secret in the underwear business, and NetJets in the transportation business.

 From the beginning, the magazine was about much more than bared breasts. It celebrated materialism, living the good life, and being an independent thinker, even a rebel, in rejecting society’s critical judgments and traditional “rules” in favor of your own path. At a point, frustrated by having this overlooked, Hefner began writing

-----

#### about “The Playboy Philosophy,” beginning with a series of essays extending over many months’ issues of the magazine. It was this Philosophy, enunciated, illustrated, and demonstrated that defined the relationship between the majority of the magazine’s readers and Hefner and his magazine. They may have been attracted at first by the buxom babes, but quickly discovered there was more at stake. Playboy is based on a profound “sense of place” where men feel understood, welcome, and encouraged to never quite grow up. To further this, Hefner created a concept for full-page ads in his own magazine addressing his own readers, headlined “What Sort of a Man Reads Playboy ?” in which he presented a profile worthy of aspiration. These ads continue today.

 Playboy is the ultimate example of symbolism. Hef’s robe and pipe are to him what a hat was for Sinatra or drink in hand for Dean Martin; the Mansion, the imagination-stoking representation of the Lifestyle To Aspire To. The bunny trademark, consistently one of the top five most recognized symbols the world over, in company with the Coca-Cola logo and Mickey Mouse. The pipe, incidentally, was deliberately chosen, inspired, Hef admits, by the dashing hero Pat Ryan in the Terry and the Pirates comic strip of his youth, and by Sherlock Holmes.

 Hefner originally called his magazine Stag Party, and had designed a logo of an antlered buck swilling a cocktail—but a cease-and- desist letter from lawyers representing an existent “skin” magazine called Stag ended that. The tuxedoed bunny, a symbol of the constant procreation in the animal kingdom, later adapted by a battery company for similar symbolism, was his second choice. This, too, reveals something casual observers seldom realize about the huge successes around them; that they were not built methodically from the ground up, as if a house from an architect’s blueprint, nor achieved in a straight line; they represent achievement overcoming unanticipated obstacles, the achiever dodging and weaving and bumbling down blind alleys and reversing, falling, and failing and getting up and restarting. (In another Disney similarity, Walt began with Oswald the Rabbit, and

 Playboy has nearly fallen by the wayside as antiquated—even too quaint in a massively sexed media world—at two different times, but proven a brand that cannot die. In its current renaissance, the first of the new Playboy Clubs is open and thriving atop the trendy Palms resort in Las Vegas with two others set to open; the magazine is alive and well, inter-linked with a cable TV network, a film-to- DVD publishing business, catalog and e-commerce businesses, a monster-sized brand licensing business placing the rabbit head, the Playboy bunnies in their famous costume, and even Hef on thousands of different products, and a popular cable-TV reality show with a second in the works.

 HUGH HEFNER, THE PLAYBOY EMPIRE, AND A TRIBUTE TO THE MAGIC OF THINKING BIG!

 “And so one man created two houses and all men would forever want to go to these houses, to be inside.” This is how biographer Bill Zehme described Hugh Hefner’s Playboy Mansions—the original, set up in Chicago in 1959, and the current Los Angeles mansion, seen weekly in the E network’s reality show about Hefner’s life, The Girls Next Door . The existential importance of Hef’s Mansion was shown off in a Playboy magazine cartoon, circa 1970, in which a man has clambered to a mountain peak to beg wisdom from a guru. The wise man at the top of the mountain tells the man: “There’s a man who lives in a mansion full of beautiful women and wears pajamas all the time. Sit at his feet and learn from him, for he has found the secret of true happiness.” The Mansion, the mystery about what goes on there, and Hef himself, are beautifully crafted symbols of a lifestyle and attitude on which a far-flung, flourishing empire has been built, now, maybe ironically, run by a woman, his daughter.

#### It would be a mistake to think of Hefner as a mere playboy, though. Ever. He has lived a life as a workaholic, and one of the main reasons for the establishment of that first Playboy Mansion was to eliminate a commute from home to office to home. To as great an extreme as any highly successful entrepreneur, Hefner so blurred the lines between his work and play, work life and personal life, they are discernible only to him. With clear commonality with mega-entrepreneurs like Walt Disney, Donald Trump, Richard Branson, Vince McMahon (profiled in the last issue of this magazine), Hefner has been a creative and relentless self-promoter, in that way also blurring line between business and personal. As an aside, Disney was developing his outside-the-box empire in the same time frame as was Hefner. One has to assume they watched each other with interest—and borrowed from each other liberally. Walt had Mickey, Minnie, then Donald and Pluto; Hef had his bunnies; each their own version of the happiest place on earth.

 Like all other Renegade Millionaires, Hefner defied work norms. At his peak, when personally doing or supervising just about everything in the magazine, about the magazine, and about the business developing around it, he explained, “I don’t take calls anymore; I only return them at my convenience. I do not go to people; people come to me. I don’t even need to dress; I just put on a robe. I have discovered I don’t have to arrange my life by other people’s hours.” Hef was famous for disappearing from his own parties into his private quarters, to his giant bed used as giant desk, strewn on one side with magazine layouts, articles, photos, and corporate reports, space preserved on the other side for “personal activity.” He tended to sleep a lot during the day then combine work and play all through the evening, night, and into the wee hours—observing that “all the best things happen at night.” While the details may differ slightly, Hefner shared in common with most other Renegade Millionaires the oftcriticized and, to so many, puzzling determination of making the entire world revolve around him. Today, his pace has slowed, his work hours lessened, more responsibilities delegated, yet he is still actively engaged in business every day, and still the chief symbol and promoter of

#### Playboy to its generations of fans and customers—and still apt to mix a dinner with friends, movie in the Mansion’s theater, a poker game with friends, disappearing several times to work, and disappearing a time or two for other activities, all into one marathon evening.

 Hefner began his magazine with nearly zero resources, but for— appropriately in this case—brass balls. As example, his confession: “I had two different letterheads—one for the magazine, the other for my imaginary distributing company called Nationwide News Company. When I wrote a letter on the magazine’s stationery, I was the editor, publisher, or promotion, advertising, or circulation director, as circumstances dictated. When I was writing to news- dealers, I was the general manager or president of Nationwide News Company. I was the entire staff of both. That’s all there was —just me, my typewriter, and a card table.”

 His troubles with getting his magazine printed and distributed disappeared thanks to Marilyn Monroe—and more of Hefner’s chutzpah. Two nude photos of Marilyn were discovered, but Life magazine printed only one—small, and black and white. No other magazines would touch them, and only one was produced in a calendar. Hefner went to the calendar company that owned the photos, walked in “cold,” and negotiated permission to use the other photo for $500.00. The Marilyn cover of Playboy quickly produced 70,000 advance orders and a distribution contract with the #1 magazine distributor. The “big break,” too often called a “lucky break,” is common to the Renegade Millionaire experience, usually occurring more than once, at essential moments. As in Hefner’s case, the big break is typically created through bold action, in many cases attempting something that would, on the surface, seem impossible.

 Some 54 years ago, or so, Hugh Hefner began his epic entrepreneurial journey, turning a simple idea into a sprawling global empire and himself into an icon, all powered by self-belief, self-promotion, and the selling of aspirations. Of course it didn’t hurt that sex was involved. Psychologists claim sex is on the minds

 Follow-Up

#### A lot of people never start. Never do anything. Then, of those who do start, few follow through.
 A lot of business owners, marketers, and sales professionals who start promising and creating valuable relationships with prospects, customers, or clients never follow up to develop them and sustain them. This is not just a matter of disorganization, dysfunction, or sloth. It has deeper meaning.
 My experience with entrepreneurs constantly enjoying a massive and steady flow of customers or clients, opportunities, and wealth streaming to them is that they think in terms of “process” rather than “incident,” and “opportunity” rather than “outcome,” and I teach them to think in these terms .
