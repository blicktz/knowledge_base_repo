## Several years ago we had no customers, no prospects, and no leads. Travis’ wedding was six weeks away. Jim’s was six months away and there was no way either of our fiancées wanted to marry a broke loser.
 We had just left the comfort and security of our high-paying jobs to strike out on our own and try to make it as entrepreneurs. We started our first company with $200.00. We bought a phone and the bank charged us a fee to have the account. We were fast on our way to losing money.
 We knew we had to do something and do it fast with less than $200.00.
 You may be in a similar position now or remember when you were. It’s do-or-die, gun-to-the-head, make-it-or-break-it business success in its purest form. You need to attract customers immediately or fail. There is no in between.
 The Most Frightening Time in Your Life It can be the most frightening time in a business owner’s life. You have to come home in the evening and face your family, then wake up in the morning and face yourself in the mirror . . . knowing that today will be the same as yesterday. No new opportunities, no new prospects, and no money at the end of the week. Sometimes it feels like the entire weight of the world is on your shoulders.
 There Is a Better Approach to Selling You need to forget the things they taught you in college, in business school, in sales training, or in orientation at your new job.
 Instead you can create an intelligent system that positions you as an expert and causes qualified and interested prospects to come to you and ask you to do business with them . . . even in recession or in the emerging New Economy. A system that stops you from having to do all the ordinary sales grunt work like dropping all of those cheesy lines, popping in on people, bothering people, and calling them 25 times just so you can get a return call.

## We’ve Been Exactly Where You Are Right Now We know how you feel. We’ve been there before. Like during our first two months in business, when we relied heavily on the telephone as a marketing tool. When we got a warm lead, we would pounce and make sure the lead didn’t get away. One time we made a total of 27 calls to the same individual. We always had to leave a voicemail or got the dreaded “I’m busy now, call me tomorrow” blow off. In the end, we realized the guy was just stringing us along so he didn’t hurt our feelings.
 Now, years later, this same guy pops up again. This time, he was pulled in and automatically converted to a sale on one of our most expensive products and we never spoke to him on the phone a single time. Everything happened automatically.
 This fellow doesn’t even know that we (people he now perceives as top experts in the field) are the same two pests who harassed him every day for a month practically begging for his business. Clearly, our new method is far superior to the original, conventional method.
 Attract Clients Naturally So what is this new method that allows you to easily and effortlessly attract new leads, positions you as an expert instead of a product pusher, allows you to accelerate your business growth and your success and finally begin to enjoy life and prosper a bit?
 Let us explain. Thankfully, when we began, we already knew a thing or two about effective marketing. In our careers as marketing executives, we had worked together to create campaigns and systems for our clients that made many business owners instant successes. In total, we had invested $96-million of our clients’ money and with that generated more than $12-billion in sales. It wasn’t our money to spend or keep so we didn’t get rich. But we did learn an awful lot in the process about how to attract customers and make them buy.

## Armed with that knowledge, experience, and just less than $200.00, we went to work creating our dream and our fortune. We asked, “How can we duplicate the results we created for our clients and cause people to come to us but without spending a lot of money?”
 So we locked ourselves in our office, which happened to be a 10x10 room in one of our houses. Everyday for months and months we would hole away in that office with the door shut and try to solve this problem.
 We tried different ideas and we tested different techniques and we presented different theories. And then one day it all came to us at once.
 The Eureka Moment This simple, little idea would truly make people quickly, easily, and naturally come to you and identify themselves, almost waving their hands, saying “I want what you have to sell.” Then you could put all of your focus, energy, budget and time marketing directly to those people who have already told you that they want what you have to offer, that they want the benefit that you offer, and they’ve given you permission to tell them about it.
 That sale has almost no friction, a higher closing ratio, and typically is more enjoyable to make. It also provides you a customer with a longer relationship span who has a higher degree of respect for you and your company, which is very important, and a greater level of profitability to your company, which is extremely important.
 This process, which we called Gravitational Marketing, causes potential customers to raise their hands and say, “Market to me because this is something I’m interested in.” That is a powerful thing.
 Don’t Envy Us . . . Join Us Fast forward to the present and you’ll see that we have made it. We’ve turned that first $200.00 into multiple successful companies and millions of dollars in annual revenue which gives us the freedom and flexibility to spend time with our families, live life on our own terms,

## and leave a legacy while living a legacy by helping other business owners, entrepreneurs, and sales and marketing professionals achieve the success they’re after.
 The Power of Gravitational Marketing Gravitational Marketing is based on the principle that all bodies exhibit an inherent force called gravity that naturally attracts other bodies. Following that analogy, every business has a natural tendency, however large or small, to attract customers. Larger companies traditionally have a stronger gravitational force. Smaller companies traditionally have a weaker gravitational force. This force is created by several factors such as a company’s general existence, location, signage, current and past marketing and advertising efforts and word- of-mouth. As the force grows, it builds momentum and allows you to attract exactly the right group of prospects and customers without wasting tons of money.
 Our method levels the playing field and gives businesses and sales professionals that have limited marketing and sales resources an opportunity to increase their gravitational potential. Continuing the analogy, Gravitational Marketing helps companies defy the laws of gravity by attracting more than their fair share of the business.
 Gravitational Marketing is the process of motivating prospects to ask for your marketing messages, forging emotional relationships with them, getting your newly formed friends to buy, motivating existing customers to return, and ultimately motivating all of your customers to tell others, thereby harnessing the power of word-of-mouth advertising, which we all know is the best and cheapest form of marketing.
 How Gravitational Marketing Works The process of Gravitational Marketing is broken down into four primary components: Gravitate, Captivate, Invigorate, and Motivate.
 Gravitate

-----

## The process begins first by either choosing who it is that your existing product or service would be right for or finding the who first and then determining what they want.
 Next you find out what problems they’re having, what difficulties and challenges they face, or what they really want but have to live without. And you offer the solution to that problem, whatever it is.
 For instance, if you are a financial planner, then the people that you’re going to help want security, they want to retire wealthy, and they want to retire early. They don’t know how to accomplish these things. That’s their problem.
 If you’re a real estate agent, the clients you will help want to sell their homes as quickly as possible for as much as possible or own as much home as possible for the lowest payment possible. That’s what they want from you. Nothing else.
 If you’re a car dealer, the people you want to help are afraid of getting taken advantage of when buying a car. They want to make sure that they get the best deal possible.
 The list goes on and on. So you offer a very simple initial solution that only requires a small step, a small type of action with little commitment and zero risk.
 It’s almost like a piece of bait. It’s like saying, “I’ve got the answer to your problem—come to me and I’ll explain.”
 At first glance, this may seem like regular advertising, but indeed, it is very different.
 Captivate The Captivate phase happens once you’ve gotten your prospects’ attention. They’ve asked for more information about the solution that you’re offering and you have a chance to present yourself to them. But you have to present yourself in a way that is unforgettable. You can’t

## just be another “me too” service or a commodity product. You’ve got to be sensational. You’ve got to be memorable. You’ve got to be unique. You must captivate your audience in order to hold their attention, arouse child-like curiosity in them, and cause them to be intrigued and to want to know more.
 Invigorate You Invigorate your prospects by helping them understand how bad the problem actually is that they’re facing now and how wonderful the solution really could be. You must get them to visualize themselves living the dream.
 You need to involve their emotions in the process and help them understand the depth of their problem but also the true availability of the solution and the wonderful things that will come with the solution.
 Motivate Finally, you have to Motivate your prospects to take the action you want them to take. That means you have to know ahead of time what that action should be. You can’t just willy-nilly get to the Motivate phase and not know how to proceed and let the prospect direct the transaction.
 Each step of this process is critical. If you fail to attract prospects (Gravitate) in the first place nothing will happen. But once you’ve attracted the prospect, if you don’t capture their attention (Captivate) you will become invisible and the sale will be lost. Even if you have captured their attention, if you don’t involve their emotions and get them excited (Invigorate) about the possibility and potential of working together, the game is over. Finally, if everything has come together but you don’t cause the prospect to take the final action (Motivate), if you don’t ask them to spend money, all of your efforts will have been wasted.
 What To Do Today to Make Money Tomorrow All this sounds great, but we know that action is what creates business success. As Elvis said, “A little less conversation, a little more action.”

## So we’re going to give you a down and dirty, step-by-step action plan for creating your own Gravitational Marketing campaign.
 Step 1: Be Sensational The first step is to learn to be unforgettable. Be the kind of sales professional people want to get more of. Same is lame. Boring is invisible. Sensational people and businesses attract more than their fair share of the business. They Gravitate prospects and customers naturally with less effort and expense.
 How can you be sensational? Simple.

 • Be interested in other people.
 • Be unique enough to remember.
 • Be fun to be around and do business with.
 • Be willing to take risks and try new things.
 • Be visible to the right people as frequently as you can.
 • Be credible, by doing what you say you’re going to do and get testimonials from past clients that prove your credibility.

 • Be spreadable—that is, be worth talking about and worth recommending. Step 2: Position Yourself as an Expert Let’s face it, people don’t like to be sold. But they love to buy things. And who do people most want to do business with? Experts. It’s the difference between being a specialist and a generalist. People will pay more for a specialist, they’ll feel more comfortable during a transaction with a specialist, and they are more receptive to doing business in the first place with a specialist. In the end, people are more satisfied after working with an expert and more likely to tell others.

# New Economy Success Secret: Careful Spending Doesn’t Necessarily Mean Less
 Spending

## The worry we talked about earlier manifests itself as more careful spending, not necessarily less spending. People who are spending

-----

## more carefully are looking for two things before they spend: confidence and value. Your job as a business owner and marketer is to increase confidence and deliver more value.

 How do you do this? You can increase confidence by positioning yourself as an expert, creating a clearly defined buying preference for your product or service so the decision to choose you is easy, creating expert information to help smooth the buying process, building better relationships with your customers before and after the sale, and differentiating yourself from competition.
 With an increase in confidence comes an increase in value. Value can further be increased by educating your customer in addition to selling your customer, by improving and enhancing your experience, and by engaging in better follow-up.
 Finding new ways to increase confidence and value is a key to success in The New Economy.
 How can you become an expert? Declare yourself an expert today, do some research tonight, and start acting like one tomorrow. Understand that you know more about your business than most other people in the world. That alone makes you an expert. There’s no sense waiting for someone else to come and pin an expert button on your chest or bake you a special cookie. So you may as well do it yourself.
 Step 3: Determine Who You Want to Attract You can’t do business with everyone, so determine who wants what you have to sell most and target them specifically. Your gravitational power is much greater if you narrow your efforts to a specific group of people.
 You’ll be able to hone your message to match your prospects’ wants, needs, and desires. You’ll be able to increase your visibility and credibility with a small group much more quickly than you can a large group.

## Step 4: Know What Sets You Apart Determine what unique emotional appeals and benefits your product or service delivers to your target. Create your marketing message around this uniqueness and stick to it. Don’t get caught up with features or image or pricing. Instead, lock on to your prospects’ emotional desires and craft a message around it.
 Gravitational Marketing in The New Economy All that sounds great, but what about The New Economy? Everything is different and we’ll probably never go back. Radically and swiftly changing economic conditions, evolving customers, and a dramatic power shift from rich companies and powerful media to ordinary consumers. These changes are viewed by many as a cause for panic and fear. But with the right strategies The New Economy can be a tremendous opportunity for wealth and prosperity. Gravitational Marketing is now more important than ever.
