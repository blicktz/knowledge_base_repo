could be a blend—that take place over a short period of time, each one
re-iterating your offer and call-to-action.
 There’s magic in the multi-step structure. I’d like to claim

 credit for its invention, but the truth of the matter is I modeled it nearly fifty years ago. In one year, I managed to

 have two cars repossessed and I went personally and corporately bankrupt. I got it all over in one year.
 During that year, I became intimately familiar with the

 collection industry and I had a lot of time on my hands. I noticed a pattern, which I’ll describe to you. It’s first notice,

 second notice, third notice. They’re typically fifteen days apart, although you don’t have to adhere to that timing. Each one clearly refers to the previous one they sent you. We call

 that linkage. There’s no mystery in that they’re writing to you frequently. They get a little tougher as they go along. And the last one generally has copies of everything else they sent

 previously, rubber-stamped “Final Notice.”
 I said to myself, “If that will get money from people who

 haven’t got any, offering them nothing, I wonder what would happen if we tried it on people who do have some
money and offered them something of value.”

 This has turned out to be one of my most reliable
Magnetic Marketing
structures, which is why
it has become the staple

 ADDING MORE CREDIBILITY WITH CONTENT

 A simple three-step sequence works great for many products and markets. But there are times when you need to extend

 the sales timeline to increase your authority and credibility. In cases like these, you probably want to consider bolstering your positioning by following up on the initial
Lead Generation

 Magnet with additional, related content.
 This strategy is done quite often when launching a brand
 new product or service. The initial L
ead Generation Mag
net might be a video training, which is then followed up by a series of additional videos on that same topic. But you don’t

 have to limit yourself to videos, you can follow up with any number of things, such as emails, reports, online assessments, even books.

 When doing this kind of extended campaign, it’s typical to hold off on asking for the sale up until the very end. Up to

 that point, you continue to provide valuable insights and each new piece of content ends with a “stay tuned for coming attractions” message.

 The final piece of content is where you would make your real call to action—laying out all the critical elements of your

 offer, features, benefits, pricing, guarantee, etc.

 BLOWING THEM AWAY WITH “SHOCK AND AWE”

 A related idea is to bundle a bunch of perceived “high value”

 content items into a single package and then deliver them all at once in what’s been called a “Shock and Awe” package.

-----

###### The name is derived from the 1992 Gulf War, when US forces overwhelmed Saddam Hussein’s military with

 overwhelming force. The objective with your Marketing “Shock and Awe” is likewise to overwhelm the prospect with

 overwhelming
 evidence that you are indeed head-and- shoulders above any other competitor.
 Your Shock and Awe package could include:

 Consumer Report Guide(s): Reports written by you to position you as the expert that you are.

 CD/DVD
’s: Audio and/or video
of interviews, guest

 appearances, podcasts, presentations, case studies, testimonials, etc. (anything showcasing authority and expertise).

 Printed Special Report(s):
Reports that are relevant

 to your message and/or the prospects challenges.

 Newsletters: Back copies of your monthly newsletter.

 Articles or press releases: Anything you have written

 or has been written about you.

 Self-Assessment and Score Analysis Tool

 Testimonials: Anything and everything anyone as ever said about you, showing overwhelming proof

 that you are the only choice they should be going with.

 Lead Generation Book (authored by you)

 And don’t limit your thinking to just serious “information”—

 you can include cookies, candy, toys, t-shirts, and so on. One

###### previous client in the electronics industry, sent as a step in his conversion funnel, a briefcase with a video player built in,

 as well as a fresh King Cake from New Orleans. A cover letter inside recommended that the prospect watch the video (which
 offered the service quite nicely) while enjoying a

 delicious piece of cake.
 Now THAT made an impact. That is how you show up like

 nobody else.
 You’ll definitely want to include at least some item with your
Call To Action
, which could lead to either a direct sale

 or to an in-person meeting.

 SELLING A CONSULTATION VERSUS A DIRECT SALE OFFER

 Most of what we’ve discussed so far in the Conversion System

 is based on the idea of using all these components to lead up to a direct sale for your product or service. The power of building this out into a sequential step-by-step process, with

 the
Lead Generation Magnet at the very beginning leading to one after the other, is that it creates a foundation for the prospect saying “YES” through an ongoing series of micro
 agreements.

 Prospect says YES to the L
ead Generation Magnet.

 Then says YES to opening a follow up email and

 watching an online video.

 Then says YES to taking an assessment sent in the mail.

 Then says YES to reading a book sent to his home.

-----

###### And so on and so on.

 All these YES agreements build on one another, leading the prospect to feel more and more in agreement with what you

 have to say and offer. So when the final call-to-action appears, they have established the habit of saying YES to

 what you put before them. Of course, this doesn’t guarantee the sale, but it absolutely makes it much more likely. People want to believe they behave with consistency. If you can get

 them to consistently say YES, you have started the ball rolling in the right direction.

 However, in many industries, the actual sale can’t be closed without first “selling” the prospect on agreeing to attend some kind of in-person consultation or meeting.

 Typical examples could include financial advisors, insurance agents, realtors, cosmetic dentists, copywriters, IT

 consultants, and so forth.
 In these kinds of scenarios, you’re using components of your Conversion System to lead directly to accepting that

 Consultation Meeting—and this could involve the multistep campaign, shock and awe box, ongoing content, etc.

 The Consultation is where you—one-on-one—work with the prospect through their specific situation and craft the appropriate solution to meet their needs. The Call To Action at

 the end would be to sign the contract, the check, and close the deal.

 If the deal does NOT close, you do NOT give up. Instead, you continue moving forward with whatever components of the Conversion System you deem necessary,

###### which again, can include MORE content, MORE shock and awe, and MORE multistep campaigns of email/direct mail/postcards/etc.

 How long should you keep this up? As the old saying goes, “until they buy or die.”
Now, once

 someone does become a customer, client or patient, we don’t want our magnetic attraction to fade. For this reason, we continue with the Magnetic Retention System.

###### CHAPTER 9
#### YOUR MAGNETIC RETENTION SYSTEM

-----

###### This is the part of the puzzle that no one does.
The part

 that can quickly and easily turn one client into two, thus doubling the value of every new client. And the best part is it’s the easiest system to implement in your business.

 One of the most important keys to maximum customer value is in retention and repeat business. That is not

 something you’re “entitled to” as a result of your excellent products and quality service—although that doesn’t hurt in the least.

 Instead, it’s a result of careful, strategic marketing, which includes continuing to market to them in a systematic way,

 not taking them for granted and communicating again and again in a magnetically attractive manner.

 This requires frequently having and presenting a good answer to the question that is so important to us that it’s become part of our vernacular. It’s how we greet each other. That

 question is,
 “What’s new?”

 I don’t say, “Tell me everything that’s the same as it was the last time I saw you three months ago.” I’m not interested in that. I’m interested in “What’s new.”

 If you don’t have a good answer to “What’s new?” they go looking for it somewhere else. A bored customer goes

 elsewhere. They forget about you. They don’t talk about you. They don’t buy from you and they are easily wooed by some

-----

###### competitor who comes along with something that’s new and

 exciting.
 How do you answer this question that is always on their minds? And how do you do it consistently and repetitively, so

 they are always intrigued by you?
 The answer to this question is by frequently and continually reinventing your business inside your business, by inventing

 new widgets and offering those new widgets through constant communication with your past and present customers.

 At least once a month, if not more often, they are hearing from you and they are getting a new widget offered to them.
 That will keep customers interested and engaged, allowing

 you to sell to them more frequently, and having more customers refer more often.

 Point is, your complete Magnetic Marketing System
should incorporate what, in direct marketing lingo, is called “Front- end and back-end”

 Front-end
refers to outreach to attract and acquire new leads, new potential customers and new

 customers.

 Back-end
means developing and retaining those customers, increasing the frequency of repeat business you do with them, cross selling different

 products and services, putting fresh offers in front of them frequently, staying interesting to them so they

 stay with you and tell others about you.

-----

###### How do you do that? There are two ways to include in every magnetic retention system:

#### 1. CUSTOMER NEWSLETTERS

###### Every business should have some kind of customer newsletter that—at a minimum—hits their doorstep once a

 month. Preferably it would be a real, printed newsletter.
 Why?

 First off, it has a higher perceived value—a physical newsletter looks like it has more value than an email. Secondly, it’s more likely to get consumed. An email—maybe

 it’ll get opened, maybe not. But if you get something in the mail that you have to open up and look at, and it’s at least

 minimally fun and interesting, then it’s far more likely to get read and possibly even retained.
 And that brings up the third reason a real life, honest to

 gosh print newsletter has value—if they keep it around, it lingers as an ongoing reminder of your existence. You’re no

 longer a memory of some service once rendered, a product once acquired. You’re there on the file cabinet letting me know that you cared enough to take the effort to send me

 something new rather than discard all memory of me to the dustbin of history.
 Your monthly client newsletter should include:

 Content that re-affirms your uniqueness (remember that USP?) and authority in your business area of

 expertise. But keep this minimal, as little as absolutely necessary. (For heaven’s sake, do NOT

-----

###### make your entire newsletter about your industry. Nobody wants to hear about “the latest oil filter

 interface to the internet of things” from their local Qwik Lube oil change place.) Instead, you want to continue the conversation that you know they are

 having in their heads—continue to talk about problems you know that they have. For instance, I

 know that business owners who are looking to solve marketing problems are intrigued by time management strategies, ways to outsource

 successfully, and are looking for reassurance that they are not strange and different for their beliefs

 about money and capitalism. All of those have very little to do with marketing solutions, but everything to do with the people that I am talking to.

 Content that’s fun for the sake of being fun—puzzles, brainteasers, jokes, recipes, cartoons, funny “memes,” light hearted fodder that offers some

 entertainment value—you want your customers to look forward to this every month. Puzzles and brainteaser are also what we call enticement

 devices. Meaning that your newsletter will have staying power while they are engaged with it.

 In line with “what’s new?” some kind of call to action

 for your latest widget. You are in business after all and you want to constantly remind customers that

 you offer valuable goods and services that will make their lives better. This is a great place to offer your

-----

###### newest consumer report or special report on a newsworthy topic that is plaguing them.

 And finally, personality. When you create a bond with

 your customers, they are less likely to choose another provider over you, because you have become a friend. Your newsletter allows you to

 continue your relationships. By telling stories and sharing what is happening in your life, you let your

 customers bond with you.

 And one the best reasons for doing all you can to retain customers, clients, or patients is to get them to refer you to

 their friends, family, and colleagues.

#### 2. REFERRALS / WORD OF MOUTH

###### Word-of-mouth marketing is the most powerful and beneficial

 kind of advertising or marketing that you could ever have for a business for the very simple reason of what others say

 about you is ten times more believable than what you say about yourself.
 Way back when Anaheim, California was still a swamp, Walt

 Disney wrote a marketing principle that was taught to everybody involved with Disney and it is a wonderful

 principle. It says:

#### “The way to be very successful in marketing is to do what you do so well

 that people can’t resist telling others
 about you.”

-----

###### So one of the things you have to be continually asking yourself about your own business is:

#### How can we do what it is that we do
 here so well that people can’t resist
 telling others about us?

###### For example, when a patient comes in the door, do you teach

 your staff not to sit behind the desk and kind of look up at them and grunt and hand them paperwork to fill out?

 Instead, your staff should stand up, come out from around the counter, shake the patient’s hand, and say: “Hi, Mr. Patient, welcome to X, Y, Z, clinic,” or “Hi, Mr. Patient, good to

 see you today. How are you feeling?”
 Then walk that patient through a greeting process unlike

 any other doctor’s office he’s ever gone to—in fact, it’s unlike how he’s treated anywhere else he goes to.
 And a lot of those little things added together now result in

 what we call the wow experience. This person leaves your office and thinks to himself:

 “Wow, I’ve got to tell somebody. This is the most interesting, amazing, best thing that’s happened to me all day!”

 (This relates to the “show up like no one else” principle, only it’s embraced throughout your entire business, not just

 during conversion.)
 And when you can create that for your customers, you know when they leave your place of business they’re

 thinking: “Gee, I was feeling kind of down when I came in

-----

###### here, but this is the best thing that’s happened to me all day.

 This is just wonderful.”
 And they run into their next door neighbor when they’re

 now at home and they’re going to tell them about you.
 If you do that, they’re going to spread the word without you even having to ask, and that has immense power.

 When we earn this level of enthusiasm from our customers —by blowing them away with service, quality, the whole

 shebang, way beyond what they ever expected—we do indeed earn the right to ask. And it’s amazing to me how many business people just never, in any way, shape or form,

 ask their customers or clients for referrals.
 I grew up in direct sales, selling in the home, face-to-face

 with moms and dads. I was taught and beat over the head with a very simple mechanism: as soon as you make a sale, you put a card or a form and a pen in front of your customer

 and you said something to the effect of:
 “You know, most of my customers come to me as referrals

 from satisfied customers like you. And I’ll bet you know five or six people probably who live right here in the neighborhood who would love to have whatever it was that I was selling just

 like you got. And I would be eternally grateful if you would let me use your name when I gave them a call to set up an

 appointment. And if you would take time right now to get your Christmas card book out or you know your personal phone book and just give me those five names and

 addresses, I’d really appreciate it.”
 And nine times out of ten, I’d walk out of that house maybe

 not with five, but with three or four good solid names,

-----

###### addresses and telephone numbers and most of them would

 turn into appointments and some of them would turn into sales.

 Now, I learned that discipline when I was a pup and I am always amazed at how many salespeople don’t use it and how many business owners don’t use it. A print shop owner

 should be asking for referrals. A dress shop owner should be asking for referrals. A hair salon/stylist should be asking for

 referrals.
 When do you ask for referrals? Right after you’ve done something praiseworthy for your customer. Like when

 somebody comes in to pick up their job at the print shop and says:
 “Boy, this is great,” or “I really appreciate you bailing me
