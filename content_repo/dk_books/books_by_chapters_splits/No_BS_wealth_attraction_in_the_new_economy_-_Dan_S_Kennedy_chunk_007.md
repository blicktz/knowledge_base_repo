## A Tale of Two Teenagers

#### Imagine being a teenager in a family in severe financial trouble. Money is very scarce. There’s you, two brothers, father and mother. When everybody sits down to dinner and Mom puts the food on the table, you know that’s all the food there is. The bowl of mashed potatoes is all the mashed potatoes there are. You are hungry. You really want a big second helping of mashed potatoes. The bowl is right in front of you, within easy reach. But instead of

-----

#### just reaching out, dragging it over, and scooping out a pile of potatoes, you stop to look around and see who has potatoes on their plate. You look to see if your father’s had plenty of potatoes. You hold back from fulfilling your desire out of concern that others may not yet have had their fair share, may be hungrier than you. You do not want someone else going hungry as a result of your appetite.

 I don’t have to imagine that. I lived it.

 Now imagine being a teenager in a family living an abundant life, with great prosperity. When Mom puts dinner on the table, you know there’s plenty more where it came from. The refrigerator’s full of food. So are the cupboards. There are always leftovers after dinner. You are hungry. You really want a big second helping of mashed potatoes. The bowl is right in front of you, within easy reach. Without a second thought, you reach out, drag the bowl over, and scoop out all the potatoes you want.
 In these examples, of course, you’re acting consciously. In the first case, in the financially troubled family, you consciously hold back, sacrifice, do not take what is right in front of you for the taking.
 Similarly but subconsciously, if you believe, at all, on any level, that wealth is limited, that there’s not plenty to go around, you will hold back, you won’t take everything that’s right in front of you. Your emotions about wealth will be cautious, measured, restricted, suppressed, timid.
 If you can make every last smidgen of belief that wealth is limited go away, your attraction of wealth will suddenly, automatically, go from modulated, limited, and suppressed to full power, and opportunity, money, and wealth will quickly flow to you in greater quantities and at greater speed than you’ve ever before experienced.

 People get ingrained in their heads that money taken from Person A and moved to Person B enriches Person B at the expense of Person A. Certainly, the liberal politicians either believe it or pander to it, one or the other. Some religious doctrines and religious leaders posit this idea. There are lots of ways this belief might be firmly planted in your head; maybe even in elementary school math class. If Johnny has 4 pieces of candy and gives 2 of them to Jim, how many does Johnny have left? The answer needed to ace the quiz is 2. But the “problem” ignores the fact that Johnny can simply open his hand and have as many pieces of candy appear in it as he’d like. After all, there’s no global shortage of candy. When you actually understand

#### wealth, you know that Johnny can have 4 pieces, give Jim 2 pieces, but then have 42 pieces.
 What’s even weirder and tougher for math teachers is that Johnny is much more likely to have 42 if he does give away 2 of the 4 than if he hoards the 4. But that’s another topic for a different place in this book. For now, let’s keep it simple:

#### The opposite of wealth attraction is wealth inhibition.

#### Most people are so wealth-inhibited they never even think in terms of getting wealthy. Their thoughts on this subject are limited to buying a lottery ticket or fantasizing about some unknown, long-lost uncle leaving them a fortune in his will. But there are a lot of people who do, at some point, start seriously trying to figure out how they might convert their knowledge, ability, time, energy, and effort into real wealth. You may be in that group—it may be the reason you were attracted to and purchased this book. So, a warning: the majority of people in this group never get traction, never get going, never get wealthy because they suffer from wealth inhibition.
 If you believe wealth is limited, if you view it as a zero-sum game, you are inhibited. This inhibition affects all sorts of things you do or don’t do, such as what you’ll charge, for example, or who you’ll ask for money.
 I’ve spent a lot of time working with people in sales. Those who identify themselves as salespeople, like folks selling insurance, cars, fire alarms, as well as those who don’t identify themselves as salespeople but are, like dentists and psychologists. Two things are true for all of them that reflect wealth inhibition.

#### One has to do with price. Most fear discussion of price, fearraising prices, are paranoid about pricing higher than their competitors. I have had to work long and hard to get some people to raise their prices or fees far beyond present levels, industry norms, or competitors’ prices, in order to charge what their service and expertise is really worth to their clientele. In numerous cases, I’ve forced fee or price increases of 200% to 2,000% with absolutely no adverse impact—that’s how far underpriced a lot of people are! In these situations, we are not dealing with practical issues. We are dealing with the businessperson’s own inhibitions and fears.

#### B ecause this is such an important subject that can lead to such huge breakthroughs in a business, I developed an entire seminar on the subject of PRICE ELASTICITY, which you can take as an online course. Get details at www.DanKennedy.com .

#### Second is pulling the punch when closing the sale. I sometimes joke about one of my own businesses—freelance advertising copywriting— where I routinely charge fees of $100,000.00 to $150,000.00 or more for a complete project, no less than $25,000.00 for a single ad or sales letter. Plus royalties. I say that the primary requirement for getting such fees has little to do with my prowess as a copywriter and everything to do with my ability to keep a straight face and voice free of stammer when quoting the fee! This may be the reason a lot of art and antique dealers write the price down on a piece of stationery and slide it across the desk to you. There’s truth in the joke. When the dentist quotes his $70,000.00 case to the patient, when the private residence club quotes the $215,000.00 membership fee, when anyone speaks any price or fee, there is the tendency for tremors, the

-----

#### temptation to discount without ever even being asked, out of fear, inhibition, and presumption. In short, to pull the punch.
 Consider the salesman who goes into a person’s home to sell fire alarms. (I have a corporate client in this industry.) The fire alarm salesman with the stuffed Dalmatian under his arm and the burning house DVD marches in and discovers that he is in a place of relative poverty—at least by his standards. The two kids are on a thread-bare carpet in the living room. They probably have a good television, but pretty much everything else in the house is obviously hand-me-down, beat-up, falling apart, springs sticking up out of the couch seat. He can clearly see that these people aren’t doing well. Conversationally, he discovers Papa hasn’t worked in four months and one of the kid’s got some kind of problem that causes big medical bills, and on and on and on. The salesperson becomes increasingly queasy about closing these people on the $2,000.00 fire alarm sale. And, in many cases, he will not close the sale. He will subconsciously pull his punches, accept the first objection easily. Or he’ll consciously, deliberately throw the game at the end, toss that one aside, and get out of there.
 This is an analogy to the way everybody behaves in all sorts of situations, if operating from a belief of limited wealth.
 My friend Glenn Turner tells the story from his earliest selling days of actually being chased by somebody who was mad that he wouldn’t sell him a sewing machine. Glenn thought the person couldn’t afford it, shouldn’t go into debt to buy it, and obviously cut his presentation short and abruptly got up and left—only to be literally chased down the street and caught by the husband, who called him on not trying to make the sale. “How dare you think for me? I’ve got a right to buy that thing for my wife if I want to. ”
 My speaking colleague Zig Ziglar has a similar story from his earliest days selling cookware, about the customer that was saving up the money to put in indoor plumbing. Discovering that they didn’t even have indoor plumbing, Zig backed off and didn’t try to close the sale on the cookware. And the people were annoyed, they really wanted the pots and pans. The husband said: We can put the plumbing in later. Mamma wants those pots now.
 The queasiness about price, about whom somebody is selling to, about their ability to pay, their ability to afford it is all deadly. And the truth is, anytime you start to make those decisions for other people, it really reflects

-----

#### more about what’s going on internally with you than it does with anything else.
 Oh, and by the way, if you were that fire alarm salesman who deliberately threw the sale, how would you feel about not exerting your best efforts if you turned on the TV news the next night and saw that family’s house burned to the ground and they had died in the fire? Oops.
 There’s something else to get clear about the people who are without money, that you perceive to be disadvantaged for one reason or another and you question whether you should sell something regardless of whether you get any of their money or not—they’re going to be without money next week, too.
 The reason they’re without money has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with your existence, what you sell or fail to sell, nor does it have to do with the way money works in the real world. It has to do with them. And whether you take it, somebody else takes it, the liquor store takes it, the church takes it, whoever takes it, I promise you somebody’s getting it. Because if they’re without money now, they’re going to be without money again. And most of them are going to be without money permanently, because they never gain or act on an understanding of how money works.
 I know that sounds harsh. And you may not be a face-to-face salesperson and never need to sit across a desk or table from someone you think “can’t afford it” and sell to them anyway. But the truth about this particular situation is the bigger truth about the entire world of money and wealth. That truth is, whatever amount you get has nothing to do with how much or how little anyone else has. Ever.
 If you want your wealth attraction glowing and functioning at full power, you can’t have any queasiness. You can’t have any reluctance. You can’t have any inhibition. You can’t ever pull a punch. In the bigger sense, you have to understand that whatever financial position anyone you know is in, anyone you do business with is in, anyone, period, is in, has nothing to do with you. In the biggest sense, you have to understand that whatever the state of economic affairs in the world, it has nothing to do with how much wealth you accumulate. Your wealth is addition for you but subtraction for no one.
 Unless and until you buy this premise hook, line, and sinker, you will always suffer from wealth inhibition.

#### One of the many great masters of wealth attraction worthy of your study is Gene Simmons, creator of the rock band, KISS. In recent years, you may have seen Gene in the reality-TV show about his life on A&E, Gene Simmons Family Jewels . We had Gene as a guest speaker at one of the conferences we hold each year for our Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Members got to hear his life story and entrepreneurial strategies firsthand, and I spent a fair amount of private time offstage, kibitizing with him. I routinely recommend his book, Sex, Money, Kiss as a good, candid look into the way a madefrom-scratch, multi-millionaire entrepreneur adept at wealth attraction thinks about money. You may be offended or shocked, but you’ll learn a lot from Gene. (To be invited to our conferences, you need only accept the complimentary membership offered on page 250.)

 “Be clear, be truthful.
 Stand there proudly,
 unapologetically, unabashedly, and say,
 ‘I love cash. It will get me
 everything I want in life.’ ”

## Newman’s Own

#### No one mentioned this when reporting on the death, life, and work of Paul Newman. Much was made of his extraordinary acting career, including, I think, accurate observation that there was much more depth in some of his later roles than in his early, more popular performances. If you never saw The Verdict, rent it. A little

#### bit was said about his auto racing investments and activities including his own somewhat improbable, late in life driving—a clue to his competitiveness. More was said about his liberal politics and protest; he was proud of being on President Nixon’s enemies list. And he was a liberal even we conservatives could admire and respect, because he was knowledgable and informed, principled, consistent, and walked his talk. Most was said about his development of his famous food company, which donates its profits to charity. But no one said anything about this, in Newman’s Own Words:

 “Now that I’m heavily into peddling food, I begin to understand the romance of business, the allure of being the biggest fish in the pond and the juice you get from beating out
 your competitors .”

 He also said that he could not “lay claim to some terribly philanthropic instinct—it was a combination of circumstances.” Had the business stayed small, as the lark it was to start, he says it would never have gone charitable. Of course, it quickly grew big, and hundreds of millions of dollars of the Newman’s Own brand products have been sold, and the charitable support provided will now continue long after his death, a fine legacy. Somewhat accidentally, the business Paul Newman created and lent his celebrity to has become a new model for many for-profit companies with the purpose of funding social causes or supporting charitable activities.

 But my main point here is that behind the legendary blue eyes lived a ferocious competitor . In his acting career, in his racing, in his business, Newman derived immense pleasure from beating out his competitors. A truth not often included in highly successful entrepreneurs’ press kits and autobiographies, but that is revealed in interviews and others’ profiles of them, is that they are not nice . They are tough. In specific competitive situations, they are even ruthless. They play to win and are not usually “good losers.” I listen to people and watch people closely, to try and determine the extent and depth and constancy of their competitive drive—or lack

#### thereof. Personally, every single day that I choose to work, I compete. I compete with the clock; I compete against the odds, to develop successful marketing campaigns; I compete in the cluttered, crowded marketplace for attention. When I was a speaker at events with a number of other speakers who also sold from the platform, I always wanted to hit my targets but also beat all others’ dollars per head, and connived to get that information so I could tell whether I won or lost. It’s my observation that winners have an emotional need to win, find a way to score themselves in everything they do, and rarely shrug off losing, however that may be defined. If you intently, thoroughly study any famously successful entrepreneur present or past about whom a wealth of information is available, you’ll make that same observation.

## Wealth Magnet 2

 Unequivocal Belief In Abundance

#### W ater, water everywhere but not a drop to drink. Our world is no desert island. There’s money, money everywhere. Drink all you want.
 If you do not hang out with people who own private planes or shares in private jets, or at least fly first class everywhere they go ... if you do not hang out with people who have their shirts and suits custom tailored ... if you do not hang out with people who own racehorses or boats or vacation homes ... if you do not hang out with people who are extremely prosperous and adept at wealth attraction, you might be fooled into thinking that money is “tight” or in limited supply or hard to come by. And based on those thoughts, you might inhibit your own wealth attraction. Or you might think such people are rare, in small number. They are not .
 While it is true that the recession, stock market collapse, real estate value reversals, and related economic trauma of past, recent years did take its toll on the super-rich, the merely rich, and the mass-affluent or nearly rich, it’s also true that it left plenty of people in these populations, with plenty more
