###### over 70 percent were caught with broken or dead links. “Not mine!” you protest. But how do you know? Only by checking them. Much more sophisticated and complex Marketing Automation has a lot of bolts that might be loose. My advice is: Trust none of it. Inspect all of it. Every day.
 Yes, you are supposed to be able to trust the software you invest in, the automation put in place for you, the vendors and their technicians. That’s what you’re paying for. You have every right to simply expect it, and to be outraged whenever there is failure. But that correctness of expectations and umbrage with malfunction won’t get you much. You’ll be right—but so what? An old mentor had a sign in his office that read: Would you rather be right or rich?
 I have a 50+ year habit of inspecting what I expect, often to others’ annoyance. Moons ago, when I had an office and receptionists, and went to lunch, sometime during my lunch I went to the pay phone and called my own office just to check that the phone was being answered. First thing every morning, 7 days a week, from home, I faxed the office’s fax machine and sometimes caught malfunction, then calling a staff-person at their home and telling them to haul ass to the office. Money came in through that machine. All of that is elementary compared to everything needing to be inspected with Marketing Automation. It’s still valid regarding people, though, and is addressed in my book NO B.S. RUTHLESS MANAGEMENT OF PEOPLE AND PROFITS, 2ND EDITION.
 All your automation MUST work 24/7/365. Customers or potential customers frustrated by it not working go elsewhere. Judge you as inept and untrustworthy. Money lost is unknowable, but ask people what they do when they bump up against automation that frustrates them. They’ll tell you. Often with very colorful language. I sat once watching a friend try to order a whiz-bang, high-tech, very expensive office chair for me at its manufacturer’s website, on Christmas Day, as her gift to me. Everything was fine until it came to checking out. She fought it for almost 30 minutes before saying, “The hell with them.” Then, worse, she told the story, naming the company, in newsletters and speeches for a few years—as did I. No point naming the company now. They went bankrupt.

###### Just as no human employee is free of the price of supervision, no automation is either.

#### What Could Go Wrong? A Cautionary Tale.

###### From Christopher Steiner’s great book AUTOMATE THIS: How Algorithms Came to Rule the World comes this tale of woe, slightly paraphrased and abbreviated…
 In early April 2001, Michael Eisen, an evolutionary biologist, logged onto Amazon to buy a book, The Making of a Fly by Peter Lawrence, about the development from a single-celled egg to a fly, for his lab. The 1992 book, out of print, remains popular with academics and grad students. He expected to pay $35 or $40 for a used copy, as he had in the past. But on this day there were only two Amazon sellers offering new, unused copies— for $1,730,045 and $2,198,177. $1.7 million. $2.1 million. He assumed errors and checked back the next day to find that the prices had gone up! The price escalation continued day by day for two weeks, peaking on April 18, at $23 million. Plus $3.50 for shipping and handling. Finally, the next day, the price fell to $106. What had happened was that the unsupervised algorithms that priced books for the sellers got into a price war. One had been programmed to price the book just slightly higher than the competitor’s price. The second “robot” automatically increased its price to be closer to that of the highest seller, prompting the first one to respond with another price hike. And so it went until the books were as expensive as Manhattan penthouses. Were there no adults in the room? No. Things didn’t return to normal for 2 weeks until a human finally noticed, stepped in, and manually overrode the system.
 If this were but one funny story, who cares? But back on May 6, 2010, the Dow dropped 998.5 points in hours, the largest fall in history. Nearly $1 trillion of wealth disappeared. You can research the rest of the story if you like. It has a happy ending, sort of. There have been many more similar “incidents” since, with more to come, because unsupervised algorithms, left to their own devices, can do very

###### strange things. They normally behave as they’re designed, until they don’t, or until some latent design flaw is suddenly exposed. Today’s algorithms intersect with AI, actually increasing the possibilities for mistakes, from small to epic. There are also risks of outsiders’ hacking and platforms’ manipulations. The suppressed Hunter Biden Laptop Story could just as easily be your e-commerce site or your blog. You might think it’s there, but where did all the traffic go? Pro-digital marketers know full well that Google, YouTube, Facebook, and the others can’t be trusted. I’ll argue that NOTHING having to do with tech or online spaces can be trusted.
 In the must-read book Get Rich or LIE Trying: Ambition and Deceit in the New Influencer Economy, Symeon Brown puts it this way:

_“YouTubers, Instagrammers, and TikTok creators are all at the whim of the rules, payment_
_models and algorithms of platforms they do not own, cannot control and upon which they_
_are utterly reliant. They do not get a vote on how enagement should be counted or how_
_easy (or difficult) it is to find their pages, and how often they find themselves_
_disadvantaged by arbitrary adjustments. Creators on YouTube have seen their income_
_change every time the algorithm does.”_

###### There’s more. A lot more. To be aware of, understand, and strive to safeguard your business from. Whatever you automate can’t be thought of as “done.”
 I feel fortunate at this stage of my life that I don’t have to use any of it personally, and I don’t. Not a bit of it. I haven’t even seen Amazon or Facebook. But all but a couple of my clients use a Pandora’s box of it and need Marketing Automation, so for and with them, I must deal with it. It has been very beneficial to be too old to have grown up with it glued to my paw while still in the crib, and to distrust it as totally and fiercely as I do. I’ve been wary and vigilant when, left to their own devices, clients wouldn’t be. Parthiv is, of course, much, much, much more conversant with it all than I am. To the extent that I am a modern Luddite by choice, he is the opposite, immersed in tech. Before writing this final chapter for this book, I asked him: If you could only tell people one thing about tech and automation and its brave new world, what would it be? Without hesitation, he provided the old management axiom from the 1930s: Do not expect what you fail to inspect.

###### In 1954, the year of my birth, scientists at General Electric predicted that, by 1964, your television would be so thin it would hang on your wall like a picture and be able to change channels by voice command. We got there, late. It’s new in these and other ways. Yet it’s NOT new as a business. Content must still be created, most of it in familiar formats. Viewers must still be wooed. Advertising must still be delivered—as the streaming services that started out advertising free have discovered. Hit programs like America’s Got Talent and American Idol are re-imaginings of talent competition shows from the dawn of TV itself. The hit streaming series Yellowstone has nothing new in it. Every plot twist, every character comes re-birthed from popular Westerns of the ’60s forward. And so on. Everything old is new again. Everything new is old repackaged.
 So, as this book has presented, technology has brought you an incredible array of Marketing Automation tools and opportunities. But what is required to capitalize on them is not new at all. Attractive and persuasive advertising messages and content must still be created. Marketing must still be implemented. Customers still wooed, romanced, married in ongoing relationships. Data gathered and used. Everything in Claude Hopkins’ revered, classic book Scientific Advertising, written more than 80 years ago, still applies, even as tech allows it to be more scientific, and automation allows better capitalization. This is what keeps this gaining dinosaur—me— relevant!
 You will succeed by bridging “old” with “new”—not abandoning the old for the new.
