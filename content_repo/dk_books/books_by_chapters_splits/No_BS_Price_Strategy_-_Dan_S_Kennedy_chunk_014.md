**Strategically, for your business, you need to use everything provided here to its maximum**
**advantage in your situation or a better situation you choose and craft for yourself. Very**
candidly, you may be in a segment of a business so threatened by these trends that you should exit
and apply your talents, skills, energy, and resources elsewhere. Whatever field of enterprise you are
in, seeking out buyers willing to pay for value rather than those seeking value far in excess of
payment or, worse, feeling entitled to value far in excess of payment, or worst, willing to steal to
avoid any payment, is critical. Being able to position yourself in a category of one for certain
desirable customers, critical. Creating immunity to downward price pressure, critical.

**Immune systems are always multi-faceted, and often combat adverse trends. Think of your**
physical immune system. It is strengthened or weakened by many things aside from luckof-the-draw
genetics: where you choose to live, diet, source of foods, nutrition, obtaining needed quantities of
certain directly relevant vitamins and minerals, exercise, quantity and quality of sleep, personal
relationships, mental attitude, faith, occupation, stress as well as many external factors, such as
proximity to or exposure to toxic chemicals. Most trends are disadvantageous, and make it more
difficult for you and me to maintain a strong immune system than it was for our grandparents. Our
diet consists largely of processed, chemical-laden foods rather than natural foods; our physical
environments more congested and polluted; our lives infinitely more complicated, hectic, and
stressful. Most of us are not willing to become Amish in order to bolster our immune systems, but
we can deliberately influence most of the factors I cited, and we can behave with awareness of how
steep the climb, how difficult the task.

I won’t belabor the point, but you could engage in the same analysis of the challenges to a healthy
emotional immune system.

The same can be said about a business immune system resistant to downward pressures. You need
to proactively strengthen it. Doing so involves work on more than one or two things.

## CHAPTER 5

 How to Compete with Free

 Jason Marrs

**Yes, you can compete head-on with free. I do.**

When I first met my wife she was getting her Master’s Degree in Speech Language Pathology.
She was commuting from New York City to Las Cruces, New Mexico as part of a “summers only”
program. Basically that meant that she was in school for four months and working for eight. I was
an undergrad in marketing who was spending all of my time promoting nightclubs.

She was my first experience with free health care. It was also my first experience helping children
with special needs realize their potential. This was something that was at the core of who she was.
She had started working with these children as a Special Education Teacher’s Aide when she was
only 15. From that time, she knew she wanted to work with children and help them communicate.
She never believed that she would make money doing this. She felt she would be lucky to just “get
by.” She became a part of the field because it was her calling. She would do it even if she did not
get paid.

She never dreamed that she would become one of the highest paid pediatric Speech Language
Pathologists in the country.

That came about a while after we moved back to New York. I had become disgusted and
disillusioned working at an advertising agency in New York City so I went to work pushing paper
and coordinating therapists for the government contracted agency she was working for. I quickly
found myself in a mixture of case management and policy. Dealing with the policy makers, seeing
the waste and corruption quickly made me see the dark side of these programs. I saw firsthand that
mandates mattered far more than quality. That meant that any therapist with a pulse and a license
could get a job. It also meant that children who needed services could not get them because an
administrator was kicking the therapist under the table to make sure she didn’t recommend “too
much.” You might call that rationing of care. Get ready.

I saw how favoritism, laziness, vindictiveness, and flat-out corruption was pushing the system
further and further into the red, denying patients who legitimately needed care, and driving truly
qualified professionals to despair. As you can imagine I was growing progressively more
disillusioned with the idea of free.

I told my wife that we had to move into private pay. I saw the risk of staying dependent on the
free government system as being too great. While everyone else was saying that these programs
were mandated by law I said all it takes is the swipe of a pen and everything changes. Freedom and
dependence are mutually exclusive. I knew we had to go. I knew we had to dare to compete with
free.

I believed strongly that there was a need for quality services and that people would pay for them.
So we set about making that happen. I used my marketing background and she used her pure
unadulterated talent. That first year was terrible, really terrible. Money did not come easy. We were
hungry. We struggled to make ends meet.

We had not realized that we were up against a system that was entrenched into every nook and
cranny of child development. From the time a child is born until they leave home, the professionals
they come into contact with are trained to look for the signs that the child may be a candidate for the
so-called free programs. There is not a person who works with children in this county, not a
preschool, pediatrician, or teacher who does not know about these programs. On top of that the laws
are written to favor them and to punish private pay entities like ours. But that was only part of the
problem. The other problem was that getting people to pay for something that they thought they
could get for free was an enormous challenge.

-----

It took a lot of trial and error to get where we are today. We now have therapists working in our
thriving practice commanding fees from $180.00 per hour up to $250.00 per hour. Even when you
look at our growing competition in the private pay category most of them fall in the $135.00 to
$150.00 range. However, many are down at least as low as $75.00 per hour.

Most business owners are stunned when they learn about my healthcare business and what it is up
against. They are also stunned to know that we have been successfully raising our prices during the
“great recession.” My wife’s base services went from $150.00 to $200.00 in 2007, from $200.00 to
$220.00 in 2008, and to $250.00 in early 2010. Our other therapists followed a similar path from
$160.00 to $200.00 per hour. We’ve also increased prices on other services while rapidly increasing
demand.

As you can imagine this is something I get asked about a lot and I am happy to say that I have
answers. I do know a thing or two about getting premium prices even when faced with the threat of
free. As a result I have helped a very diverse range of businesses deal with this problem.

## So What Should You Do?

Obviously before you just jump into competing with free you need to make sure that is the right
thing to do. You want to make sure you are not fighting a hopeless battle. You want to focus your
resources on wars you can win, not on those that only serve to drain resources. But assuming that
you have done that and have concluded that you should in fact compete with free I’m going to give
you strategies for succeeding. While different situations call for different strategies, there are some
core strategies that work in any business. I don’t care if you are in health care, lawn care, infomarketing, photography, luxury travel, or Egyptian monkey wrestling, these strategies work for
everyone.

**The first thing you need to understand is that FREE is not without cost. Just because there**
**is not a monetary fee does not mean the customers are not paying something.**

## NO B.S. Price Strategy Warning #2

If you fail to help your prospective customers or clients see the “hidden price” of free or

cheap, you will always be in a disadvantageous competitive position, because there will

almost certainly be others willing to sell or work for far less, or even for free.

Let’s take a look at my health care business for an example. If you take the free therapy through
the government, you are going to pay by wasting precious time wading through the rivers of red
tape to get a therapist of your choosing. If you pay for therapy privately, you can choose the
therapist that is best for your child and get started as fast as you want. If you take the free therapy
from the government, some bureaucrat, with absolutely no qualifications to do so, will tell you how
much therapy you can get. Only when you pay privately are you and your therapist able to do what
is in the best interest of your child. When you take the free therapy from the government, your
child’s history becomes part of his permanent record. When you pay privately, you are in full
control of what becomes a part of your child’s permanent record. By taking free therapy you pay
with wasted time, lost control, uncertain quality, and loss of privacy. Those are not small costs for
many people.

You could find similar hidden costs in any product or service being provided for free.

Not long after my son was born we discovered that he had Torticollis—the technical term for a
crooked neck. If not corrected through physical therapy it can cause a child to develop incorrectly. It
can make them permanently lopsided. Having spent so long in the therapeutic field, my wife knew
what it was before she ever sought help.

When she did seek help, the first thing she did was call her contacts to find out who the best
person was to work with newborns that have Torticollis. She got the name and moved forward. The
physical therapist promptly informed my wife that our son would qualify for free government
services. Of course my wife and I already knew that. We also knew that was something we would
avoid at all costs. We are fortunate enough to know the value of paying $125.00 per hour for private
therapy over taking free therapy from the government. We were also fortunate to have the contacts
to find the best therapist for our child.

That brings me to the next point. It is a myth that any sale is better than no sale. I know you
think you want the broadest market possible. As long as you have that mindset, it will hold you
back. It makes your job too hard. You have to get through your head that you are not for everyone. It
doesn’t matter how many prefer free and won’t pay, or even how big the majority want free and
won’t pay. It only matters there are enough who won’t want free—with its costs—and will pay, to
support you as you want to be supported. The number of non-buyers and won’t-buyers doesn’t
matter.

There are over six billion people on this planet. There are over three hundred million in the
United States. Even in the small little town I grew up in there were 25,000 people. They all have

-----

different needs and desires. They all value different things. You cannot attract or serve them all. The
vast majority of people will always have zero interest in whatever it is you sell. Your offering may
be the center of the universe to you, but it is irrelevant to most people. You must get that through
your head. Even if you were offering everything free, the majority would be disinterested. Even if
they did all want what you sell, what would you do if they all tried to buy? You would be seriously
screwed. You would not be able to handle it.

So you must determine who really wants what you offer and is willing to pay for it. Who within
the population of potential buyers is the most likely to buy what you offer? Who shares your values?
Those are your people. Align with them. Give them the things they can’t get with the free option.
Make no mistake those things do exist. You have to find them and let it be known that you provide
them. Once you do that you can attract plenty of buyers who will happily pay a premium for the
privilege of doing business with you. If you become very adept at this, as I am in marketing our
practice, the law of supply and demand still works to your advantage, even though the
overwhelming majority of people are not good prospects for you. But among those who are, who
are repelled by the costs of free, and prefer paying for excellence, great demand for you will
develop. The more demand you create the more scarce your offering will become in relation to
demand and the higher your prices can go as a result. We have been able to raise fees again and
again, against the recession, and against both free and low-fee competition, because the demand for
us and no one else exceeds our capacity. The best price strategy of all is creating visibly excess
demand—in our case, a very busy, thriving practice, often with a waiting list.

**The million dollar secret here, summarized, is that every “free” has concealed costs, and when**
those costs are revealed to a market, there are many customers unwilling to incur the costs of free
and profoundly prefer paying for the goods or services they want.

Let’s assume you are taking your wife out for dinner at Morton’s to celebrate your wedding
anniversary, and you are greeted at the door by a frantic manager who explains his busboys have all
quit in protest over something, and if you’ll put on aprons and bus tables, you can have dinners free
at the end of the night. Will you get to work? Probably not. What if he ups the offer to add a free
bottle of fine wine to your dinners? Adds a second evening of free dinners and fine wine? At some
point I suppose you might be seduced by the free despite its onerous costs, and sacrifice your
anniversary celebration. But you ought to consider all the costs. Not just the night as busboy, but
however many nights of sleeping on the couch. The kind of customer who frequents Morton’s is
unlikely to accept these free dinners. Transfer the entire scenario to an Applebee’s or a Chili’s, and
the odds of a customer taking the free go way up. But still, a lot more would decline and go in or go
elsewhere and pay money for their celebratory dinner. This is the game played out at airports often,
when flights are over-booked. Free roundtrip tickets are offered to anybody who will stay put and
wait hours to get on a later flight. If there are 300 on the flight, you never see a stampede of 300
fighting over the free tickets. Sometimes only 2 or 3. Often the airline’s announcer has to sweeten
the offer, after no takers go to the podium. If it was impossible to combat free, and everybody
wanted it, there’d be a mad rush. Why isn’t there? Because the majority prefer the cash price
they’ve paid to get where they want to go when they planned on getting there than a free trip now
plus another free trip later, with its costs including not getting where they wanted to go when they
wanted to get there, waiting around the airport for five boring hours, and uncertainty about really
getting out on the next flight. For 295 of 300, the price of free is too high.

Let me summarize the million dollar secret again. Every “free” has concealed costs, and when
those costs are revealed to a market, there are many customers who are unwilling to incur the costs
of free and who profoundly prefer paying for the goods or services they want.

 When FREE Is a Business, Not Just a Price Strategy

 Darin Spindler

**In many ways, I share Dan and Jason’s deep-seated concerns about the destructive power of Free. I**
believe it needs to be handled as if petting a porcupine! Yet I am very much in the business of Free,
[and here to provide a different perspective. One of my businesses, KidsBowlFree.com, has nearly](http://kidsbowlfree.com/)
two-million families registered, who participate in its online activities, and are delivered on a silver
platter to bowling centers all over North America as potential customers for conversion after their
free experience. Yes, I said two-million! With more joining every week. All of which, incidentally,
making a number of income streams viable, from advertising and promotion fees paid by brandname national advertisers as well as local businesses, to the fees paid by the bowling centers. We are
now replicating this business model for diverse small businesses, using
