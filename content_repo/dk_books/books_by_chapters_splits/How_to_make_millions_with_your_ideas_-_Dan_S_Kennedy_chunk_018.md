   White business, eic., and this is extremely powerful because con-
   sumers relate and bond better with individuals than with cor-
   porate entities. But vertical businesses can be built under product
   brand names, business names, or other identities.
       How You Can Get in the Game—and Win!
      First, you may have a product or collection of products and
   other assets to bring forward that a major infomercial company
    will want so badly, and be unable to easily duplicate, that they’ ll
    take you on much like a publishing company takes on an author:
   They’ll pay you an advance against royalties (sometimes) and a
   royalty on all sales; they’ll pay all the costs of producing, testing,
   and airing a show; and they’ll either develop a negotiated joint
    venture with you on the ‘‘back-end’’ business, the continuing,
   long-term relationship built with the infomercial-generated cus- ©
   tomers, or manage that business in its entirety, too, and pay you
   another royalty.
     The benefits of this can be tremendous. Being adopted by
   such a parent brings expert analysis, strategic planning, script-
   writing and creative talent, ample capital, usually a major celeb-
    rity host, already-in-place 800-number order-taking, credit card
   processing, fulfillment, accounting, management, legal counsel,
   media buyers and media time, and even noninfomercial product
          _ distribution—such as to catalogs, other mail-order venues, home
   shopping channels, and retail stores—all together without a
   dime’s worth of risk on your part. When Guthy-Renker takes on
    a project, for example, there are typically two to three product
   development specialists, one of several top producers and his
    team, an additional scriptwriter, and one or two direct-marketing
   consultants all put to work on its behalf.
     There are negatives. First, just like an author who signs on
    with a publisher, you usually give up all control over the project
    as well as certain exclusive rights to your product. Second, you’ll
   probably receive royalties in a range of 2 to 6 percent of gross;

 from everything else that can be done with the customer acquired
 through the infomercial.
   These no-money-out-of-pocket deals are increasingly diffi-
 cult to get done. Five years ago, infomercial companies were
 begging for products. Now the deal flow going to them is simply
 amazing. And some of the things and people they turn down are
 equally amazing. However, if you have a truly hot product or
 other idea that seems to lend itself to an infomercial, and you
 own or exclusively control it, you may want to try and place it
 with a big infomercial entity on a royalty basis. In 1995 so far,
 I’ve negotiated two such deals for clients, and have three more
 pending. It can be done.
   The second big opportunity is to fund, produce, own, and
 control your own infomercial and the business it can build. There
 are a number of reasons to go the independent route. If you want
 to generate leads rather than directly selling a product on the
 infomercial, if you’ve been rejected by the big guys but believe
 they’re wrong (and they often are), or if the idea of making three
 to four times as much profit is extremely attractive, you may
 want to go independent.
   And, yes, there’s still plenty of room in the marketplace for
 the independent. One of my clients, U.S. Gold (see chapter 6),
 has been airing its independently produced show for five years
 straight and building its business. Another independent I assisted
 made over $60 million in two and a half years. Another info-
 mercial I scripted and helped develop for a major was dropped
 by that company, bought by the inventor of the product sold in
 it, aired independently, and has since done tens of millions of
 dollars in sales and launched extensive mail-order and retail dis-
 tribution of the product. By my best estimates, that show made
 its owner a millionaire in six months.
   Roughly half of all my work in the industry is with inde-
 pendents. As of this writing, I’m handling one project for a large
 international travel conglomerate, another for a start-up entre-
 preneur who has pieced together his capital and, in the grand
 tradition of our free enterprise system, is ‘‘rolling the dice.’’ Jn

    tant to remember that the lion’s share of opportunity and profit
    is in the back-end business. I am constantly counseling clients
    to do an infomercial only if they have a strategy, a product line,
   and an ability to build a continuing business on their customers.
     A third, huge area of opportunity is in getting involved as a
   vendor to the infomercial industry. This industry is a billion-
    dollar consumer of video production and other creative services,
    printing, publishing, packaging, audio and video duplication, pri-
    vate label manufacturing of every imaginable product, in-bound
   and out-bound telemarketing services, premiums, computers and
    software, and on and on. And because so much happens so fast,
    a vendor who is exceptionally service-oriented, can meet tough
    deadlines, and is reliable can capture substantial chunks of busi-
    ness in this industry.
     A fourth area of opportunity is in joint ventures, piggyback
   arrangements, parasite arrangements, and distribution. Every suc-
    cessful ‘‘As Seen on TV’’ product works exceptionally well in
    mail-order catalogs, in inserts in credit card statements and news-
    letters, even in stores. And every successful ‘‘As Seen on TV”’
    generates a database of customers that will be mailed to fre-
    quently, for which additional products are needed.
      In parasite marketing you, the product marketer, capitalize
    on (‘feed on’’) some other successful company’s customer da-
    tabase and resources. This is often done with an endorsed mail-
    ing: The owner of the list sends out a complete direct-mail
   package to his customers that includes a letter of endorsement
    of your product. Piggyback marketing is also parasitical, but a
    costly separate mailing is not done. Instead, literature for your
    product may be added to (piggybacked) with the host company’s
   monthly statements, other mailings, or packages.
     The financial terms of these deals vary and are negotiable.
    In a pure parasite marketing situation, you put up no money. The
    host company not only provides the database but also pays all
    the marketing costs. Joint ventures are more common. In a typ-
    ical joint venture, the host company might provide the database
    and the labor to physically do the mailing, while you would pay

  ness, store, or other type of distribution that should be selling
 some successful ‘As Seen on TV’’ products. Or maybe you have
  a product that won’t work as a lead item in an infomercial, but
 can be sold to all the customers created by a particular infomer-
  cial.
   Incidentally, it’s important not to prejudge the infomercial .
 customer. While most people might guess it’s folks of very mod-
  est means—WNational Enquirer readers and Kmart shoppers—the
  Statistics tell a very different story. Half of the buyers of the
 Personal Power products, for example, come from the top 20
 percent income segment of the population. And industry surveys
 show that infomercial buyers are aware of the sales content of
  the shows, enjoy them, feel better informed by them than by
  other types of advertising, and, of those who buy from them, the
 majority are satisfied and predisposed to buy from another
 infomercial.
    MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #9: BEING ALERT!
   Bill Guthy learned of the opportunity that would make him
  a multimillionaire by being very alert to what was going on in
  his customers’ businesses. 'm always amazed when I talk with
  a manufacturer, printer, or other vendor who can’t describe their
 customers’ businesses. ‘“That company that buys 25,000 books
  a month from you,”’ I asked a printer, ‘‘what do they do?”’
    ‘‘T don’t know,”’ he said. ‘“‘They’re in something having to
 do with mail order.’’ Well, if I were that printer, able to buy
 paper at truckload wholesale prices and print stuff for myself in
 off-hours and slack times at bare-bones cost, and I was supplying
 somebody moving 25,000 books a month, I’d have my curious
 nose stuck right into their business. Wouldn’t you? I hope so.
   Right now, I own half of a business running full-page ads in
  a handful of magazines every month, doing very well, that may
 put as much as an extra $100,000 in my bank account this year
 with almost no effort, all because I paid very close attention to

    conflict of interest.

     | MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #12: ‘‘PLUS-ING,”’
     When they produced the ‘“‘Think and Grow Rich’’ infomer-
    cial, Greg and Bill took what was working repetitively in the
    infomercial business at the time and found a way to use that as
    a foundation, but also to take it up a notch and go it one better.
    People who were closely associated with Walt Disney are the
    first people I heard using the term Plus-ing to describe this, and
    they tell me that Walt emphasized this over and over again: How
    can we take a ‘“‘known,’’ something that works, and then make
    it or do it a notch or two better? He taught that plus-ing defied
   mathematics—it produced multiplied results. And that’s actually
    what he did with Disneyland; he took something that already
    worked and was popular, an amusement park with rides and
    snack vendors, and plus-ed it.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #44:
         DISCOVERING AND USING “FORMULAS.”
      The objective of every savvy marketer and entrepreneur
    ought to be to find a reliable formula for success that can be
    repeated over and over again.
     When Greg and Bill plus-ed the infomercial, they did it with
    three main ingredients: a recognizable, respected celebrity host;
    testimonials from famous people as well as happy customers and
    users of the product; and improved production values, compa-
    rable to ‘‘real’’ television. From the success of ‘‘Think and Grow
    Rich,’’ they were astute enough to recognize that this was a
    formula for success with value beyond the one application. As
    a result, you can see that very same formula applied in the ‘‘Per-

     the Perfect Business with Its Own Infomercial
   In 1989 Peter Herrold bought the small company making The
 Perfect Swing Trainer after practicing with the product took
 twenty strokes off his golf game. The product is a big, bulky
 circle within a circle, constructed of PVC pipe, on a sturdy stand,
 with adjustable rings. It ‘‘forces’’ the person into a perfect swing
 over and over again, so that ‘‘muscle memory”’ is created in the
 “*golf-specific muscle.’’ Find that hard to believe? So did an
 awful lot of golfers, so the company struggled until taking a big
 gamble on television in 1992.
   Peter had reached the conclusion that the product had to be
 demonstrated and dramatized before people would believe in it
 enough to plunk down $400 or $500, so he decided to switch
 his entire advertising budget from magazines and the ad cam-
 paign that was keeping the company in a survival mode into the
 vast unknown of the infomercial world. To keep costs to a bare
 minimum, the company relied on its own understanding of how
  - to sell the Trainer, hired local videotape crews, and produced its
 own infomercial. Peter also hired his own in-house telemarketers
 to handle the optimistically anticipated responses from the info-
 mercial.
   His gamble paid off. The response to the infomercial was
 immediate and dramatic, more than doubling sales from the pre-
 vious year, and providing over 100,000 customers predisposed
 to buy other Perfect Swing products. As I’m completing this
 book, the company is completing production of its new, much-
 improved infomercial and just may double sales all over again,
 thanks to the power of television.

      If You Think Infomercials Are Amazing,
       Wait Until You Hear the Story of the
        Home Shopping Channels!
     Just about everybody knows what a Tupperware party is.
   Picture it: a dozen women gathered in a living room for the
   express purpose of watching various kitchen gadgets and storage
   containers demonstrated so that they can find something to buy.
   Now imagine that same Tupperware party with a captive audi-
   ence of 10 million women in the living room, and you have an
   idea of what a home shopping channel is all about.
     Unlike the infomercial viewer, sitting there with remote con-
    trol in hand, ready to click out the second she’s bored, the home
   shopping channel viewer has set aside her remote control, placed
   the phone in her lap, has her credit card at the ready, and is
   waiting for something to be offered that she can buy. Selling to
    an audience like that is a unique situation.
     Getting your product sold on a channel like QVC or HSN
   can make you a millionaire in a matter of days, weeks, or
   months. These companies have a large amount of their available
   time committed to already proven products being periodically,
   repeatedly presented. They also get many products that flip over
   from successful infomercials. These companies reject 90 percent
   of all products presented to them, and choose from thousands of
   new submissions every week, so breaking through is difficult.
   Most new products are placed with QVC or HSN through a small
   number of professional brokers and brokerage organizations, like
   my own or those listed in chapter 13. But there are other ways
    to break through. For example, early in 1995 QVC conducted a
   highly promoted, open, new-product search tour to a dozen U.S.
    cities, and it was so successful they’re almost certain to do it
    again. Many people got their products sold on QVC by going to
   those advertised events. If you exhibit at trade shows, the home
   shopping channels send buyers to virtually every merchandise
   show held, You can even assemble a package of information

 approach. -
   You enhance your chances of successfully getting your prod-
  uct sold on QVC, HSN, or one of the less-known shopping chan-
 nels if your product is highly demonstratable or visual—after
  all, we are using television here! It should also solve a problem
  or match a need or desire that is universal, because home shop-
 ping channels are mass marketers, who sell to the general public.
 Celebrity spokespersons or endorsers are helpful but not essen-
  tial. Proven success in other direct-response environments, such
  as print ads, catalogs, direct-mail, or TV commercials is also
 helpful but not essential.
    How a Visionary Entrepreneur Built an Entire
     Business Around a Celebrity: The Story Behind
           Joan Rivers Products
   One of the best examples of a home shopping channel-
 created millionaire is my client Mark Kress, founder and presi-
 dent of Joan Rivers Products. You’ve probably seen Joan Rivers
 on the home shopping channel QVC, presenting her jewelry or
 hosting her TV show Can We Shop. And you probably thought
  little about it. But behind those scenes, there’s a fascinating busi-
 ness success story.
   In 1989 a young man by the name of Mark Kress was fired
 from his position as vice president of entertainment marketing
 at a major broadcast network. His firing occurred just one week
 before he was to receive a six-figure commission for new busi-
 ness he had secured. At that moment, he made the decision never
 to work for anyone else again. ‘‘If something was going to get
 my attention sixteen hours a day and keep me up nights wor-
 rying, I was determined to profit from it in a big way,’’ Mark
 says. ‘‘Hey, nobody says your vision has to be poetic!”’
   So, fueled by the new determination to succeed as an entre-
 preneur and accustomed to earning an excellent income that had
 to be replaced, Mark stepped up to the plate in a big, bold way.

    big risks based on those guesses.
    keting in his television. Specifically, he saw home shopping via
    television as the growth industry of the nineties—and, in retro-
    spect, that was a pretty good guess.
     Mark also knew from his experience in the entertainment
    business that the difference between mediocre and extraordinary
    success for a new product or a new business was often a celebrity
    endorsement. Finally, he conceived of a new strategy that would
    have four parts: the right celebrity, that celebrity’s full involve-
    ment and commitment to the business, the right products, and
    marketing via television.
          This Business Was Built Backward!
     Mark then did something very unusual. Instead of first cre-
    ating or assembling products, getting a business going, choos-
    ing marketing methods, and, finally, maybe adding a celebrity
    spokesperson, he chose to get the celebrity first, then create a
    business to fit. Compared to the way most businesses evolve,
    this was a backward approach.
     With this unusual plan in mind, Mark faced his next obsta-
    cles: He didn’t know any celebrities, he did not want to go
    through the usual. bureaucratic dealings with Hollywood agents,
    managers, and lawyers, and he didn’t want the usual insincere,
    for-the-money-only endorsement arrangement. He also didn’t
    have enough capital to launch a business even if he had the right
    celebrity in his pocket. Many might call that combination of
    obstacles insurmountable, but, if there is one theme I’m trying
    very hard to demonstrate in this book, it is that no combination
    of obstacles is insurmountable. If your idea really has merit, and
    you have sufficient determination, you can get past the most
    incredible obstacles.
     Anyway, Mark racked his brain, rummaged through his cor-
    respondence files, talked to his friends, and, finally, he thought
    of a contact—a Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon who had intimate
    relationships with a number of celebrities and their altered ana-
