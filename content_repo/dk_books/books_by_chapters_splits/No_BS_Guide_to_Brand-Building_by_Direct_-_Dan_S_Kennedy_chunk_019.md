###### 3. A quarterly educational upsell sales letter using the classic buyers of
 “x” who don’t buy “y” concept. Examples include dental health, puppy food buyers not purchasing chew toys, dog buyers not buying flea and tick medications, etc.

 • The puppy product upsell letter generated a 6.19% response, an
 average transaction size lift of 35.79%, and an ROI of 56 %.
 • An upsell letter on fleas and ticks was a tremendous success with
 23.02% response, 23.41% transaction lift, and an ROI of 683%.

 4. Annual anniversary thank-you letter with a 20% Off Shopping Spree
 check attached. This program average is 34.36% response, transaction size lift of 39.74%, and ROI of 285% net of the discount and all fulfillment costs. 5. Three annual holiday cards to top 500 “B” segment clients with a
 10%-off offer to move them up to “A” segment clients. This is a new tactic that was recently mailed and the returns are not known as this point. 6. Annual pet birthday postcard program. This is a program
 administered by the franchiser. We have no marketing math on this strategy. We are in the process of pulling that back to our company where it will be measured.

###### As I write this, we are only in the early stages of building out a much more comprehensive program that will multiply the number and combination of offers going to existing clients throughout each year.


**DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: My friend and speaking colleague, a great success**
philosopher, the late Jim Rohn said, “If you follow a highly successful person in any field


-----

around for a week, there will be no mystery about why he is doing so well. You’ll say to
yourself, ‘Well, look at EVERYTHING he does.’” Because Steve is in my highest level
mastermind/coaching group at GKIC, the Titanium Group, I get the opportunity to see what he
implements and achieves in between our three-times-a-year meetings. I can assure you, if you
followed Steve as I do, you’d have the reaction Jim Rohn described five times over. Steve has
just described, and is going to continue to describe, A LOT OF things he’s doing to drive new
customers into his stores and, importantly, his system, and to then keep them interested and
engaged, and to sell more to them by consolidating all their pet-related purchasing under his
roof. Having such a complete system is, bluntly, more valuable and more important than
having a cool or clever or even famous brand. It is also, admittedly, more work than relying on
brand. Having such a system empowers you to derive the greatest value from a brand. If
everything he’s describing seems overwhelming, take note of the fact that he built it over time,
not overnight, that he is in continuous development and improvement, that he has organized a
small but mighty support team around him (on staff and outside experts), and that he is all
about putting marketing in place that has ongoing or evergreen use (not one-time promotions).
This is the difference between “building” versus just “doing.”


##### Reactivating Lost Clients

###### I often share a metaphor with our store teams. Growing each store is like trying to fill a water bucket with a hole in the bottom.
 If the bucket already has water in it, this is analogous to existing sales. Through acquisition efforts such as sales letters, FSIs, and alliance marketing programs, we turn the hose on and fill the bucket.
 Through retention marketing efforts that increase share of wallet and frequency, we also increase the water line in the bucket. The problem is our bucket has a hole in the bottom that lowers the water line or sales. That is called “customer churn” in retailing.
 Our strategy to remedy this problem is twofold. First, the experience in the store cannot act to make the hole bigger. We have a specific set of strategies to guarantee that each of our clients has a great experience.
 The second part of plugging the hole in the bottom is to have a systematic program for reactivating lost clients. Our system is a three-step series of humorous postcards developed by Dean Killingbeck’s New Customers Now team in Howell, Michigan. Go to www.PassionateEntrepreneur.com/brand to view this hilarious, yet effective, series of postcards to bring lost clients back into our stores.
 The performance of this program has been outstanding. I will share an actual three-step campaign from February–April 2013. The first month


-----

###### (February) we sent postcard No. 1, and 1,514 clients reactivated for a 43.47% response. They spent $56,690.00. The next month (March) we sent postcard No. 2, and that generated another 215 clients who did not respond to the first postcard. That was another 14.14% with a total of $5,632.00 spent. The third month (April) we sent the third postcard to those who did not respond to the first two. We reactivated another 109 clients from that original February list for another 13.71% in response and $3,421.00 in total spend.
 So, for the entire campaign we reactivated 1,838 clients who spent $60,743.00. When we subtracted out the mailing and coupon costs, our net profit on the sum of the return transactions was $2,273.00. However, assuming only half of our typical first-year profit after product costs of $175.00, given their propensity to churn, the program delivered $161,744.00 of first-year profit against $21,193.00 of total costs for a 763% ROI.
 An additional reactivation strategy we use is scripted calls. Each month, each store manager is supplied a report of his or her “A” and “B” segment clients who have churned. Their job, using a script, is to call as many as they can each month (minimum requirement is all “A” segment clients) and say sorry and find out how they can recover them. It is an educational process for them, and it heightens their awareness of this critical issue.
 After an intense 18 months, we have a system that works every aspect of the water bucket. Our marketing system generates new clients, increases frequency and client spend, and reactivates lost clients month after month.

##### Changing Your Economics

###### One of the principles Dan teaches is to monetize your client list, which then becomes a back-end revenue source to your primary business revenue model. Successfully building a back end then changes the economics of your business and enables you to pay more to acquire and retain clients.
 Those businesses that can delay profit the longest when acquiring clients or which can spend the most to retain their best clients are in the greatest position to win in the crowded marketplace. It’s the way Main


-----

###### Street businesses can win against the category killers, Walmarts and other behemoth corporations.
 At our company, we have a large database of buyers. We have detailed transactional history on them as well as multiple demographic and psychographic characteristics appended by client in the system.
 We have a large opportunity to build a back-end revenue business model on top of our core Main Street brick-and-mortar business. Additionally, building the back end reinforces our positioning as a trusted authority.
 Our back end consists of four revenue funnels: 1) paid membership, 2) how-to audio and video products with starter kits, 3) a box-of-the-month club for dogs, and 4) auto-ship of orders.
 The membership program provides valuable content in the form of expert interviews, an expanded content printed newsletter, annual nutrition exams, and other benefits. A certain percentage of our clients want more education to be better pet parents. This program provides that education.
 The how-to products are videos of our staff experts demonstrating how to do things such as brush a dog’s teeth as well as assess and treat common ear, eye, skin, and coat problems. We also teach how to trim nails. Another program teaches the basics of animal nutrition. All the programs are bundled with product to then implement what the client has learned.
 Our box-of-the-month club is essentially like book-of-the-month clubs except the contents are a surprise. Our www.dawgbox.com is a website that gives the dog owner the opportunity to select a small-, medium-, or large- dog box and whether it’s for their dog or a gift for another. Then it simply ships each month. We have set it up as a “pay to play” program where vendors contribute to the box to bring value to the client. Again, it’s another opportunity to market to our list and extend our reach into our markets and gain new clients.
 Finally, our auto-ship program is meant to defend against Amazon, increase frequency of low-frequent category clients, and offer a new option to those who haven’t responded to reactivation attempts. We also will prospect in areas outside our typical trade areas to gain incremental revenue and cross-sell our stores and other back-end products. This program is under development and expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2013.

##### Create Your Destiny

###### Since arriving on Planet Dan, I’ve learned that I CAN change what is possible in my business.
 When we’ve finished implementing our back-end revenue model, our business will literally be a fortress in the marketplace.
 Our stores have a continual flow of new clients, we are increasing the value of our existing retail clients through retention marketing, and each month we are consistently recapturing lost clients.
 Now with a powerful back end monetizing our house list and providing another avenue to acquire new clients, our economics are changing for the better. No longer am I worried about every competitor who enters my trade area nor do I fret about Amazon and every other internet retailer. No longer am I trapped in commodity hell, focused on the next item and price promotion. My business is a powerful marketing system that cannot be easily copied or defeated.
 At this point, I should say that our systems and how we develop our people and our culture all are critical pieces to our success. Without them our marketing would not work in the long run. However, our marketing is the “killer app,” if you will, that was the game-changer in our growth the past two years.
 What were our overall results? In just 30 months, we grew from 10 stores to 21. Our total revenue grew 85% and employee base from 150 to more than 400. Same-store sales growth in retail is good if you achieve 5%. In 2012 our same-store sales growth for the company as a whole was 14% and through the first half of 2013 remains at 12% to 19%, depending on the month.
 If you own a retail store, your job is to go to work on your reason for being. Why should people choose to shop with you? My advice is to learn how you can become the expert in your space. Then hire the right people, build a culture, and create systems that ensure your client’s experience is consistent with each visit. Finally, go build a marketing system and back end that consistently markets your expertise and the unique experience you provide. Then invest in executing on the plan month after month.

STEVE ADAMS operates exceptionally successful retail stores across the country, under the
auspices of a national brand, but fueled by direct-response marketing. His retail business can be seen
[at www.AskPSP.com. He is also involved in e-commerce, information publishing and marketing, and](http://www.askpsp.com/)
consulting. His book, _The Passionate Entrepreneur, presents essential, experience-based building_
[blocks for entrepreneurial success. www.PassionateEntrepreneur.com.](http://www.passionateentrepreneur.com/)


**DAN KENNEDY’S COMMENT: On the following pages, a few samples of Steve’s**
great direct-response advertising and marketing. First, you see a two-sided, oversized postcard
(Figure 12.1 on page 119) with the $21.00 Gift Card Offer, plus the free nutrition consultation,
and free report. You can see the PET SUPPLIES PLUS branding throughout the piece, but the
emphasis is on direct-response advertising elements: specific reasons why this brand-name
store is best, a Unique Selling Proposition (“no other pet store has . . .”), customer
testimonials, guarantee, and, of course, the offer. If you compare this to other chains who place
their emphasis on their brand, you’ll find most of these elements missing or minimized, and
instead almost all the “real estate” on their direct-mail pieces is given to brand identity and
logo, manufacturers’ brand names, and a coupon. And if you ran a pure split-test of their
brand/image postcard vs. Steve’s direct-response postcard, his wins by wide margin. Next
you’ll see a slightly different version of this postcard, personalized to the recipient in the
headlines on both sides of the postcard.

The “Is Your Dog Suffering In Silence?” newspaper ad (Figure 12.2 on page 120)—also useful
as a direct-mail piece noted as a reprint from the publication—has almost no branding.
Obviously it is set up as an article, called “an advertorial,” not a graphic or pictorial ad. Big
companies usually can’t bear to “bury the brand” with this kind of advertising despite its
effectiveness, so the small-business operator can find competitive advantage here. The
warning is: Don’t muck it up by plastering brand identity, logo, slogan onto it—top, side,
middle, bottom, anywhere.

Finally, there’s a postcard sent only to new puppy owners (Figure 12.3, page 121.) It carries
the brand name front and back, but the emphasis is on the message and the offer.

Steve is actually a Unique Selling Proposition marketer more than a Brand Marketer, which is
a strategic decision to be made, considering a number of factors, including the established
strength of a brand. In Chapter 13, you’ll hear from Bill Gough about the use of the very wellestablished brand Allstate.

#### CHAPTER 13


## Life as a Direct-Response
 Marketer Under the Umbrella of a Big Brand

###### by Bill Gough


###### have spent most of my business life with the advantage so many entrepreneurs and business owners aspire to and envy: a big, almost universally recognized national brand. My local business operates

# I

###### under its national umbrella of brand, brand advertising on TV, radio, and print, and in online media, with name, logo, and slogan presented to the public every hour of every day. In fact, you probably know Allstate’s slogan, even though you certainly made no attempt to memorize it. It’s not like there’s a test. All I have to say is “You’re in Good Hands with” and you’ll probably get an A, and correctly name Allstate.


-----

###### I have been an employee, independent contractor, and an insurance agency owner with this Fortune 100 company since 1984. They are the largest publicly held property and casualty insurer, with the most recognized brand and most famous slogan in the industry.
 I’m happy to have had this life under their big-brand umbrella. But it is not my most important asset.
 The biggest advantage you have as a business owner and entrepreneur is the relationships you have with your customers, prospects, and centers of influence (COIs). It took me many years into my business career for me to learn this most valuable lesson.
 How I learned this lesson, and how I’ve made it the cornerstone of my business, is, I hope you wind up agreeing with, a story worth telling.
 One of the big reasons I decided to go to work as an employee insurance agent selling auto, home, and life insurance for Allstate at the tender age of 23 was because of this famous brand. I mean, even I had heard of Allstate, and almost everyone needs or must buy auto and homeowners insurance, right? This should be a piece of cake. I was to be paid nicely plus given an incredible employee benefit package for taking orders for this huge well-known corporation and their famous brand.
 I immediately bought into the home office advertising; after all, they were paying for half of it with their generous co-op advertising program for all different media, newspaper, radio, and TV. The local advertising reps were having a field day with all of us working as Allstate agents at the booth at the Sears department store. We were told by the local media reps we needed to “get our name out there,” and we followed their “expert” advice until our co-op funds were depleted. As I learned later, these local advertising and media reps are good at one thing, selling their products. I can count on one hand the number I have met in my business career that understand direct-response marketing and true measurement of return of investment (ROI).
 Even though I had no way of knowing my results of this traditional image advertising, all sickness is not death. I had one huge advantage as a new agent in Florence, Alabama. I had a real asset in having a REAL business mentor and coach with my Allstate sales manager, Kathy Honaker. She had me working hard in the trenches on some real good things that other top agents in her market were doing with success and holding me
