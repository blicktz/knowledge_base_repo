        Introduction
   SO YOU’VE GOT A “MILLION-
  DOLLAR IDEA”—NOW WHAT?
  beets This is the place and now is the time to turn your
    ideas into millions of dollars. In this book you’re going to
  meet more than fifty different people who’ve started with little
  more than an idea and made millions, many in very short order.
  Many of these people are my clients and friends, and I know
  them well. Others are people I’ve painstakingly researched for
  this book.
    Some of these people or their products or their businesses
  are famous; most are not. But each person [ll introduce you to
  demonstrates a different Millionaire-Maker Strategy. One of
  these strategies or a combination of them is bound to be right
  for you, too.
    It’s important for you to immediately understand what this
  book is not. It is not another dry, stuffy textbook about how to
  start, finance, and grow a business, according to Hoyle. If you
  want to know how to write a business plan, for example, there
  are plenty of books on library and bookstore shelves that can
  teach you how to do that. I can’t mean a good reason to write
  or to publish another one.

     Formulas for Success Don’t Work, So You
         Won’t Find a Formula Here!
     This is not a masterfully outlined and organized, step-by-
   step, 1-2-3 kind of book. Frankly, I don’t think people actually
   get rich that way. Most of the very methodical people I meet are
   working for wages as somebody else’s bean counter.
    Success seems to be a more chaotic (and more exciting) pro-
   cess of grabbing this idea from here, that piece of information
   from over there, goofing this up, seeing that work, and fitting puz-
   zle pieces together until you have just the right combination for
   your unique situation. Hopefully, this book shortcuts all that for
   you, but within its pages, you’re still going to be grabbing a piece
   here and a piece there and piecing them together in the way best
   suited to your purposes. If there was one formula for success,
   there’d be only one book about it. Formulas for success don’t work
   any more than diets do—if a diet worked, there’d only be one diet!
      I Wish the Fellows with the Cute Little
      Patches on the Elbows of Their Corduroy
     Sports Jackets Would Stay Off the Business
         Battlefield—Don’t You?
    Although this is a book about turning ideas into money, it is
   not a book of ideas. I have long despised business books written
   by fuzzy-headed academics, professors in cushy jobs on cam-
   puses, accountants, lawyers, and hotshot consultants from big,
   fat consulting firms, all spouting theories. I speak a lot, often on
   programs with many other speakers, and I always warn my au-
   diences about the many speakers who ‘‘run businesses only in
   their nightmares and sell only in their memories.’’ Listen, I live
   and work every day where you do—in the real world, where
   they eat their young. So, here’s a little promise: Every single

  personally for my businesses or my clients’ businesses, and that
  has been repetitively validated.
    Should This. Book Have a $10,000 Price Tag?
   Most of the information in this book has grown out of my
  own experience and my consulting activities, and is from my
  Millionaire-Maker Seminars. It might interest you that people
  have traveled literally from just about every nook and cranny of
  the United States and Canada, as well as from a handful of other
  countries, and paid no less than $295 to as much as $3,495 per
  person to attend these seminars.
    At our $3,495 per-person Millionaire-Maker Direct Market-
  ing Super Conferences, attendees can come back, at an alumni
  rate of $1,000—and over 90 percent of all attendees have done
  that at least once, many several times. I don’t tell you that to
  brag. A long time ago, a mentor advised me: Don’t worry about |
  impressing people, just get busy inspiring them. So that’s what
  I’m trying to do. I just want you to understand and appreciate
  the value of what you now hold in your hands. It’s much more
  than the dinky cover price on the book. It’s at least the equivalent
  of a few seminars—$10,000 or so. It represents millions of dol-
  lars of mistakes, tens of millions of dollars of notable successes,
  hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of goods and services sold
  in sixty-three different business categories.
   I hope you’ll consider all that, because I know that what you
  get out of this book will have a relationship to the value that
  you place on it.
    P.S.: Throughout this book, you will find a total of forty-five
  numbered Millionaire-Maker Strategies. They do not appear in
  numerical order in the book, as different people’s stories illus-
  trate different strategies. At the end of chapter 12, I’ve reassem-
  bled them for you in a logical order, as you might try to apply
  them to your own idea, product, service, or business. That order
  is not one of relative importance but one of relationship; it shows

  THE EIGHT BEST WAYS TO
   (STILL) MAKE A FORTUNE
  FROM SCRATCH IN AMERICA
    here must be tens of thousands of different categories and
   types of businesses, methods, and means of marketing and
  distributing products and promoting services. Maybe more. With
  new ones, or, at least, new hybrids being found or figured out
  every day. We are a very inventive society, especially when it
  comes to ways to make money.
   However, you do not need to be an innovator or pioneer if
  you carefully evaluate your chief objectives for bringing a prod-
  uct to market or building a business. Money made by pioneering
  is no more valuable than money made from reliable, predictable
  means. A dollar is a dollar. A million is a million.
   From all of my own entrepreneurial experience—failures as
  well as successes—and that of my clients, I’ve identified the
  eight highest probability areas of opportunity, where millions can
  still be made from scratch. These days, I try to concentrate my
  own efforts and business interests in these areas, and to direct
  my Clients into these areas. Why? The key words: ‘‘highest prob-
  ability.’’ Launching a new idea, product, service, or business is
  risky and problematic enough without doing it in a low proba-
  bility of success environment. Climbing a huge, forbidding, dan-
  gerous mountain is tough enough; why try doing it during the
  worst snow, rain, ice, and wind storm of the season? So, this
  chapter serves two purposes. First, it’s an overview of the entire
  book. Second, it sets up these eight categories of high probability

```

-----

```
   egories together as possible.
     In chapter 12, I revisit these eight ways with brief, concise
   lists of the key how-tos for each, revealed mostly by example
   throughout this book.
     High Probability, A rea of Opportunity #1:
       Surprise! It’s ‘‘Ordinary’’ Businesses!
     As you drive down the street tomorrow, on your way to
   work, or as you run errands and go shopping on Saturday, you’ ll
   encounter doughnut shops, restaurants, dry cleaners, bookstores,
   video rental stores, gift shops, and dozens of other ‘‘ordinary’’
   businesses. We give most of these businesses very little thought.
   These shopkeepers seem to have, in most cases, just created jobs
   for themselves. In some years they may make as little as
   $25,000, in their best years no more than three times that, work-
   ing longer hours and harder than in a comparable job. Nothing
   very remarkable about any of that, is there?
     Yet, here’s what’s very interesting. Somewhere in America,
   in every one of those business categories, you can find someone
   who has found ways to turn an ordinary business into an extraor-
   dinary profit machine. I profile several in chapter 2. And, maybe
   even more interesting, is that more of America’s self-made mil-
   lionaires own and have accumulated their wealth through these
   ordinary businesses than through any other means.
     That local dry cleaner might surprise you. As you drop off
   your cleaning, you notice that the owner is always there working.
   What you don’t know is that he owns the piece of land or the
   shopping center where his shop is located, that he has a corporate
   pension fund that has sheltered a chunk of his earnings from
   taxes each year for the past ten, and that the dry cleaning busi-
   ness has a collection of extra-profit centers: It refers customers
   to a carpet cleaning company and receives commissions; ag-
   gressively markets fur, suede, and leather cleaning services; sells

```

-----

```
  livery dry cleaning routes. All things considered, he’s doing
  about double the normal, one-store average in the dry cleaning
  industry. And that, over ten years, has quietly made the owner
  rich.
   The exciting truth is that you can take just about any ordinary
  business, do its core business and serve and satisfy customers
  just a little bit better than the norm, add clever, extra profit cen-
  ters to the core business, and manage the money very intelli-
  gently—and that business will make you rich.
     High Probability Area of Opportunity #2:
      The Best Equity Is Exclusivity
    If you’re just starting to consider any and all business op-
  portunities, you will be confronted, through advertising, business
  opportunity and trade shows, and other sources, with a myriad
  of chances to distribute or market other people’s products and
  services—distributorships, dealerships, franchises, and so on.
  You can make money this way. But it’s very, very difficult to
  get rich this way.
   Wealth is most often linked to exclusive ownership or control
  of a particular concept, product, or service. In chapter 3, I’ll
  introduce you to people who have followed this path to riches.
  Rather than be a cog in someone else’s wheel, they made certain
  to own the whole wheel outright.
    If someone else has control over your destiny, if someone
  else can change the economics of your business, alter your mar-
  keting rights, impede your creativity, sell the parent company,
  or otherwise unexpectedly interfere in your business, you don’t
  really have your own business. One of the insider secrets to
 making millions is doing everything possible to minimize cir-
 cumstances beyond your control.

```
     High Probability Area of Opportunity #3:
           Serve, Serve, Serve
     In 1994 almost all the new jobs created in the United States
   were in the service category. Why? Because those are the busi-
   nesses expanding most consistently and rapidly. People at all
   levels of society are unbelievably pressed for time, so they need
   ‘‘servers’’ to do for them what they do not have time to do for
   themselves. In chapter 5, I'll show you how to capitalize on this
   trend by incorporating service elements in any business or
   product.
     I'll tell you one illustrative story here, quickly. A client of
   mine, International Correspondence Schools, has been in the
   business of selling in-home career training since 1890. These
   days, one of their most popular home study courses is ‘‘Learn
   to Use a Personal Computer.’’’ The product they sell is this
   home-study course: the books, manuals, videotapes, audiotapes,
   and computer software. But the service element they’ve added
   is ICS ON-LINE, their ‘‘electronic campus.’’ Right through the
   computer, modem, and telephone line, their students can tap into
   group discussions and classes, leave and receive messages from
   helpful instructors twenty-four hours a day, share software, and
   much more. Learn from.this example of putting a service element
   into a product and you’ll possess one of the most topical insider
   secrets for making millions.
     High Probability Area of Opportunity #4:
        Go Ye Forth and Multiply
    One of the great benefits of turning an ordinary business into
   an extraordinary profit machine and of owning or controlling
   exclusive products is the ability to get rich through duplication
   and multiplication. This is a great, big, hungry country of con-
   sumers. When you have a business that works in one place, there

```

-----

```
  was one McDonald’s—the brothers’ original restaurant. One
  Subway shop. One drive-through car wash. One athletic-shoe
  store. One fast-photo-processing shop. One of something. One
  of everything.
    In chapter 6, I’ll introduce you to some of the ‘‘masters’’ of
  duplication. You’ll see that even simple ideas, products, and
  services, if properly ‘‘packaged,’’ can make you rich through
  duplication or multiplication.
     High Probability Area of Opportunity #5:
          Go Direct!
    Direct Marketing is one of the fastest-growing categories of _
  business. Bypassing all the traditional complexity and costs of
  manufacturers’ representatives or salesforces; wholesalers, job-
  bers, and other middlemen; retail stores; and brand-identity,
  image-building advertising, more and more companies are either
  going directly to the consumers themselves or moving their prod-
  ucts and services through established direct marketers.
   How do you go direct? With ads or direct-mail campaigns
  or TV or radio commercials that bring the end user directly in
  contact with the manufacturer or publisher, with you, usually via
  an 800 number or the mail. Products that were never sold this
  way in past years are finding new success in direct marketing—
  furniture, security systems, computers, food, even automobiles.
  Services are now sold this way too, such as long-distance tele-
  phone and flower delivery. Today, if you want to send someone
  flowers, you don’t schlepp down to the florist shop, you just pick
  up the phone and call a toll-free number. If you want fresh Maine
  lobsters for a big cookout this weekend at your home in Ne-
  braska, you don’t go to a supermarket or specialty foods store;
  you call a toll-free number and have the lobsters delivered right
  to your door. What’s next? Maybe your fortune.
    In chapters 7 and 8, I take you on an eye-opening, oppor-

```

```
     High Probability Area of Opportunity #6:
         Profit from the Information Age
     The most traded, most consumed, most sought-after, and
   most valued commodity of our time is not precious stones, oil,
   or real estate. It is ‘‘specialized information.’’ All around you,
   in every imaginable form, people are profiting by selling what
   they know or know how to do. Do you know how to plan a fail-
   safe wedding? Brew beer in a basement? Make famous recipes
   at home? Lose weight fast? Make money with a computer? Get
   air travel discounts? Build birdhouses? The list of types of in-
   formation being turned into profits would itself fill a book bigger
   than this one.
    A quick example: A friend of mine has figured out a way
   dentists can give complete dental exams in half the usual time.
   That is his only piece of information. With that piece of infor-
   mation alone, he has developed his own how-to course for den-
    tists, another for dental assistants and dental hygienists, and two
   video products, and has created a $100,000 per year home-based,
   part-time business. And, after going through chapter 9, you’ll
   quickly see how he can turn that simple foundation into a
   million-dollar empire.
             - High Probability Area of Opportunity #7:
       Fame and Fortune Do Go Together
    A friend of mine, Paul Hartunian, has made as much as
   $400,000 in one day. He has been written about in Forbes mag-
   azine and countless newspapers, been on The Phil Donahue
   Show, many other talk shows, and built two different businesses,
   all through publicity. By making himself famous—once as an
   expert in collecting, investing in, trading, and selling celebrity
   autographs, and once as an expert in meeting and creating rela-
   tionships with beautiful women—Paul has made a fortune with-

  here today, gone tomorrow, or one ad in one magazine that will
  be gone in a month. For the same $1,000, I can fax 7,000 news
  releases to 7,000 different media contacts and make the equiv-
  alent of hundreds of those ads happen.’’
    There does seem to be an inexhaustible demand for famous
  people. There are more TV talk shows on the air than ever be-
  fore. Talk radio is booming. Magazines like People are huge hits.
  It seems that people are interested in interesting people. In chap-
  ter 10, you’ll meet people using this interest to their advantage
  in fascinating, imitatable ways.
    High Probability Area of Opportunity #8:
       Creative, Clever Combinations
    It’s hard to find an example of just one of these ways of
  turning ideas into millions. And that fact, in and of itself, points
  you to one of the greatest millionaire-maker secrets of all.
     Three Additional Ways to Look at Businesses
          and Business Opportunities
   As you look at all the examples in this book, you'll see that
  they fit one of these three categories: product-driven businesses,
  market-driven businesses, or media-driven businesses. .
    In a product-driven business, the product itself is so appeal-
  ing, unique, and promotable that it gets sold through a variety
  of media and methods, to or through a variety of markets. The
  Nancy Kwan Pearl Cream product mentioned in this book is such
  a unique cosmetic product that it has the power to drive an entire
  business. It is sold through direct-response TV commercials and
  infomercials, print ads in magazines and tabloids, direct-mail,
  catalogs, health food stores, and drugstores. It has attracted
  loyal, responsive customers of all ages—teens to senior Citi-

   fitness videos, and other items. The product built the business.
     It is relatively rare to find or invent such a powerful product,
   but when you do, the world is your oyster.
     In a market-driven business, a particular niche market dic-
   tates the development of a product or products or a service or
   services. The need in the chiropractic and dental professions for
   advertising and marketing assistance fueled the development of
   my own SuccessTrak seminar and publishing business, leading
   to the development of dozens of products and millions of dollars
   of revenue. A manufacturer I consulted with developed, pro-
   duced, and sold truck tarping systems exclusively for munici-
   palities’ gravel, sand, and refuse trucks, and that market’s need
   was driven by governmental mandates. These are businesses cre-
   ated to serve very specific markets. This is a relatively common
   although little-noticed, little-understood type of business. And
   businesses in this category have very high probabilities of
   success.
     In a media-driven business, a variety of products and ser-
   vices, even apparently unrelated products, or multiple businesses,
   are all sold through one primary medium. The Guthy-Renker
   Corporation mentioned in this book sells Victoria Principal cos-
   metics and has built a cosmetics business with a product line of
   over 100 products exclusively through infomercials and home
   shopping channels. But they also sell a motor oil additive, ex-
   ercise and fitness videos, self-improvement courses, and golf
   products, and have a number of businesses within their business.
   The only commonality is the media that drives all the sales.
   Media-driven businesses are modern, high-tech distribution busi-
   nesses. The entrepreneur is not a specialist in any particular
   product or service; instead, he is a specialist in a particular
   method of distribution. To me, these are the most interesting and
   exciting businesses. And businesses in this category are often the
   ones that go from zero to millions at the fastest pace.
    By understanding these categories, and the high probability
   types, you will look at all businesses differently and mold your

   HOW YOU CAN TURN AN
  “ORDINARY” BUSINESS INTO
    AN EXTRAORDINARY
   MONEYMAKING MACHINE
 As I said in the first chapter, one of the most accessible, prac-
    tical ways to make a fortune is with an “‘ordinary’’ business.
  It’s very difficult (although not impossible) to create an as-yet-
  unseen, revolutionary product or service. But you can take what
  you already have, even though there may be lots of competition,
  and transform it into a revolutionary leader.
   What are the secrets to getting rich in a very ordinary busi-
  ness like plumbing or housepainting? You can find a whole tool-
  box full of them in Larry Harmon’s story. Larry Harmon built
  such a phenomenal plumbing, heating, and air-conditioning ser-
  vice business that he made Jnc. magazine’s list of the 500 fastest-
  growing businesses in the United States in 1993. And his little,
  ordinary company in the town of Clovis, California, population
  barely forty thousand, topped $3.3 million in sales.
    It isn’t every plumbing and air-conditioning service business
  that conducts employee training and motivation meetings three
  times a week, puts the workers—called Service Advisors—
  through the Dale Carnegie Course, and pays them commissions
  and bonuses so that some are making $50,000 to $60,000 a year.
  That’s just one of many amazing things about Larry Harmon’s
 De-Mar Plumbing Company.

```

```
   needed plumbing, heating, or air-conditioning repairs. Today,
   De-Mar is, by name, the first choice of a whopping 84 percent
   of the people surveyed! Since 1989 the company has grown 300
   percent to more than $3 million in sales. And all of this despite
   being the most expensive service provider in the Clovis area.
   ‘‘Price objections are value problems,’’ says Larry Harmon. ‘*To
   win with premium prices, we must clobber competitors with
   service.’’ And that they do. Here are the ‘‘service advantages’’
   Larry used to set his company apart:
    1. Guaranteed same-day service. Larry found that the public’s
    number-one complaint about service people was that they
     never show up! So, De-Mar operates under the pressure of
     absolutely guaranteed same-day service. ‘‘In our surveys, we
            ' heard the same thing over and over again,’’ Larry says. ‘“Cus-
     tomers hated calling a company and being told we can get
     out to you in ‘about three days.’ They also hated the plumber
     not showing up at the time that was specified.”’
   2. Twenty-four-hour, seven-day service without surcharges.
     “‘Paying people overtime is expensive,’’ Larry acknowledges,
     ““but we make up for those costs by building our customer
     loyalty.”
   3. Price guarantee. Everybody’s number-two complaint about
     repair services was being shocked by the prices when the
    work was done. In response to this, Larry did something very
     radical; he switched from the industry norm of pricing labor
    by the hour, plus cost of materials with markup and travel
     time, with a new kind of flat-rate pricing. ‘“‘We borrowed this
     idea from the auto service business,’’ Larry says. ‘‘We’ve
    developed a price book that covers 98 percent of all the jobs
    we face. Our Service Advisors are actually tested every Mon-
    day morning on their knowledge of the price book. Then we
    quote the job to the customer before we begin, and that’s that.
     If we goof and underprice a job, we live with it.’’
     Larry also monitors the quality of the service his people pro-

```

```
  and calls versus complaint letters and calls, and point totals are
  posted for all to see in the company’s classroom. An individual
  can receive up to a 50 percent increase in his income, based on
  these points.
   Every Service Advisor is actually a salesperson. When a job
  is completed for a new customer, the Service Advisor gives that
 customer a set of brochures and a plastic discount card, and
  explains the available option of enrolling in the company’s All
  Season Protection Plan. And, yes, Service Advisors are paid
 commissions, a controversial practice that competitors claim en-
 courages ‘‘overprescribing,’’ but one that Larry defends passion-
  ately. When Larry switched from hourly wages to paying
 commissions, he paid out 21 percent more in total compensation
  than the prior year, but revenues jumped by 45 percent.
   Not everyone can make the cut as a De-Mar Service Advisor.
  In a given year, nearly half of all new hires resign or are fired.
 There’s a strict dress and personal appearance code, lots of train-
  ing, long hours, and considerable peer pressure from successful
 SAs not to damage the company’s reputation.
   Larry Harmon has won recognition from excellence-guru
 Tom Peters, USA Today, and Inc. magazine. In 1993 De-Mar
 was Central California’s Small Business of the Year. Larry says,
  ‘In 1985 we were going nowhere fast. When we shifted our
 focus to quality and service, rather than worrying about price,
 we became the most successful company of our kind in our
 area.’ In a six-year period, the company went from a mere
 $210,000 in annual sales to $3.3 million.

 an extraordinary money machine at a rapid pace, and could be
 used as a blueprint for transforming just about any business with
 a significant service component into an equally impressive

   2 percent of gross earnings is reinvested in employee training,
   including continual additions to a company library of books, au-
   diotapes, and videotapes, the Dale Carnegie Courses, and other

     To Get Rich with an ‘‘Ordinary’’ Business,
     Try Extraordinary Marketing and Promotion
     The blunt truth about most small business owners is that they
   are incredibly lazy, ignorant, negligent marketers. At best, the
   typical small business owner will have one, two, or three means
   of attracting customers that he relies on. At worst, he just sits
   there with his shingle hung out and door open, hoping for the
   best.
    Some years ago, I did some consulting work with a spectac-
   ularly famous chiropractor who single-handedly developed not
   one but several million-dollar-per-year practices, one right after
   the other. He was nationally known for his remarkable success
    at attracting large numbers of new patients to his office every
   month—more in some months than the average doctor would
   gain in a year. Naturally, he was constantly asked: How do you
   get x number of new patients a month? How do you get thirty?
   Fifty? A hundred?
     His answer has stuck with me ever since I first heard it. He
   said, “‘I cannot answer your question the way you want it an-
   swered, because I do not know of one way to obtain 100 new
   patients. But I do know of 100 ways to get one new patient, so
   I use every one of them.”’

    ‘How a New Jersey Bookstore Owner Uses
    ‘Strategic Alliances’’ Instead of Money to
        Diversify His Marketing
   Roger Williams operates The Wit and Wisdom Bookstore in
 New Jersey, and emphasizes ‘‘strategic marketing alliances’
  rather than paid advertising to promote his store. He puts a cat-
  alog of current business books in the backseats of all the cars of
  a local limousine service. At a pizza joint down the street from
  the bookstore, copies of Roger’s newsletter The Reader are
  stacked up and distributed free. The same newsletter is mailed
  to past and present customers and area merchants. When there’s
  a movie playing at the theater in town that has a book tie-in,
 Roger builds a window display in his store featuring the book
 and promoting the movie and puts a display of the books in the
 movie theater lobby. (For example, if the film The Pelican Brief
  is playing, all of author John Grisham’s books are displayed.)
   How does he get all this cooperation? He asks for it! He
 buys tickets from the theater to use in promotions several times
  a year, and gives them window space at his store. The pizza
 shop owner uses Roger’s photocopy machine free—and so on.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #2:
      DIVERSITY IS THE OPPOSITE OF LAZINESS.
    How You Can Revolutionize Any Business
       with ‘‘The Irresistible Offer’’
   I first met and interviewed Bob Stupak in 1987. He had al-
 ready been ‘‘examined’’ by Harry Reasoner on 60 Minutes. He
 had already beat a computer at poker, for a $500,000 bet, in
 front of 25 million people. His casino had already been visited
 by the rich and famous, including Frank Sinatra. And he had
 already irked and puzzled the powers-that-be in Las Vegas by

   percent debt free, paid for as he added each floor and each square
    foot, and running at 80 to 100 percent occupancy virtually every
    night. How could this be?
     Since then Bob Stupak hasn’t stopped. He’s added a 1,000-
    seat showroom and another tower with 500 more rooms, and
   publications from the Wall Street Journal to Newsweek reported
    on his newest addition to Vegas World: a 1,012-foot-high
    ‘*Stratosphere Tower’’ that, when completed, will be the tallest
   building in the United States and the ninth tallest building in the
   world. And he still keeps all 1,000 rooms filled just about every
   day. How does he do it?
     The ‘‘secret’’ behind Bob Stupak’s successfully slugging it
    out on The Strip with giant corporate competitors watching in
   bewilderment is: the irresistible offer.
     You’ve probably seen Bob’s full-page advertisements in USA
   Today, Playboy, or the Sunday newspaper supplement, Parade
   magazine. In these ads, and in hundreds of thousands of direct-
   mail packages sent out each year, Bob offers two nights’ lodging
    in a deluxe room, unlimited free cocktails whether you’re play-
   ing or not, champagne, free show tickets, restaurant discounts,
   and $1,000 of his money to gamble with—all for $396 per cou-
    ple. Yes, you read that right: You pay $396, and he starts you
    out gambling with $1,000. (It is ‘‘match play,’’ which means
    that on an even money bet, if you play a $5 chip of the start-up
   money and win, that chip is kept by the house, but you get the
   winnings of $5 in ‘‘real’’ chips. If you took all $1,000 directly
    to the roulette wheel, put $500 on red and $500 on black, and
   double zero didn’t come up, you’d walk away with $500 in cash,
   instantly converting the $396 to $500. The reality is that Stupak
    starts out $104 in the hole against you, in cash. On a given day,
    if all 1,000 rooms are filled with these packages, he starts out
   $104,000 in the hole against the guests.) Most of the time, Bob
   even adds on to this offer with free bonuses, such as cameras,
    faux diamond jewelry, or Hawaiian vacation certificates.
      It is an irresistible offer.
     Actually, his only marketing challenge is making people be-

 he did say that he runs ahead of capacity by some multiple. In
 other words, he sells more than the 15,000 per month he could
 accommodate if everybody redeemed them immediately. This
 means he exchanges envelopes of literature for the $396 pay-
 ments months, in some cases years, before the purchasers actu-
 ally make reservations and show up for redemption. It is the
 equivalent of having a revolving credit line of hundreds of .
 thousands of dollars, interest free. And it is simply brilliant.
    How I Personally Use the Irresistible Offer
   I was so impressed by Bob’s example that I am always
 searching for ways to incorporate the irresistible offer in other
 businesses and marketing situations. Frankly it’s quite hard to
 match the appeal of his, but you can often get close. The ele-
 ments you’ll usually work with are: (1) creating perceived value
 substantially in excess of price, (2) desirable premiums, and
 (3) strong guarantees. The idea is to make people think, “‘I’d
 have to be dumb not to say yes to this.”’
   In my own speaking business, I earn the lion’s share of my
 income not from fees, but from the purchase of my how-to books
 and cassettes by audience members. It’s not at all uncommon for
 me to sell $25,000 to $50,000 in materials in a six-minute ‘‘com-
 mercial’’ at the end of an hour-and-a-half speech. My most-used
 “‘commercial’’ is truly a million-dollar sales presentation; in
 1994, it sold over a million dollars’ worth of materials.
   In that presentation, I employ all three elements to build an
 irresistible offer: The documented value of the materials that I
 offer, combined as a package, exceeds $500, but the at-seminar
 price is just $268; I include a collection of bonuses, including a
 Critique Certificate entitling the customer to submit his advertis-
 ing materials to me for a personal critique; and I offer a very
 liberal full-year guarantee. Given that the person hearing me is
 interested in the subject matter and benefits of what I’m offering,
 he has to wrestle with the thought, ‘‘I’d have to be dumb not to

   other speakers by 200 to 300 percent.
     There is one caveat I should mention quickly: Your irresis-
    tible offer must be true and [legitimate. ] [There’s ] [no ] [point ] [in ] [con- ]
   ning people. Even if you escape [the ] [legal ] [penalties ] [associated ]
   with such behavior, and even if you’re able to sleep at night,
   you’ll only make one-time sales; you’ll never build long-term,
   valuable customer relationships, income stability, and financial
   security.
      Who Says There’s No Such Thing
             as a Free Lunch?
     In chapter 5 of this book, I tell you how my client Rory Fatt
   turned his struggling gourmet foods home-delivery business into
    a huge winner with the irresistible offer. I got the idea I gave to
   Rory from a friend and a brilliant direct-marketing consultant,
   Murray Raphel, who’d used the identical strategy to create in-
    stantly a solid customer base for a new delicatessan.
     Rather than build up the deli’s customers slowly with costly
   advertising, Murray reasoned that he could take the same money
   and spend it all at once, up front, giving free lunches to all the
   potential customers who worked near the deli. Then, if the deli
   really delivered a great meal, the customers would return, and
    the business would be built almost overnight. And he wagered
    right.
     His mailing to all the potential customers offering them a
    free lunch, no strings attached, no gimmicks, really, completely
    free, brought a flood of takers. Why wouldn’t it? And the deli
   delivered. So the customers kept coming back and telling their
    friends, and the business boomed virtually from day one.
     This idea is not limited to small businesses dealing with con-
   sumers, either; like all my techniques, it is adaptable to business-
   to-business and industrial situations, too.
     I grew up in Akron, Ohio, and one of our local barons of

 up into multimillion-dollar-a-year enterprises, and sold them to
 or merged them with major corporations. Two of these were the
 largest manufacturers of specialty and ‘‘pressure-sensitive’’ pa-
 pers in America—Fasson and Morgan Adhesives. The label
 stock known as *“‘MACTAC’’ is Burt’s best-known product.
 ‘‘We have a number of products which are habit-forming,’’ Burt
 told me in a meeting years ago, “‘and we refer to these as our
 ‘opium.’ We discovered that the best way to sell them was to
 use the sales techniques used by drug peddlers: Give away lots
 of free samples until the customer is hooked.”’
   Of course, this kind of marketing takes some guts. But it is
 a way to turn an ordinary business into an extraordinary success, -
 in some cases, almost instantly.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #3:
        GUTSY (NOT WIMPY) MARKETING.
    How Small Can Your Beginnings Be,
          Anyway?
   Okay, so you’re not going to build a hotel or open a restau-
 rant. In fact, you want to get started in business with a peanuts
 budget and somehow still make it big. How small can your start
 be?
   Pretty small.
   How about a business so small you can put the whole thing
 in a cart the size of two wheelbarrows? The hottest trend in the
 shopping mall industry these days is welcoming ‘‘temporary ten-
 ants,’’ such as pushcart merchants. The typical pushcart mer-
 chant rents space by the month, with no long-term lease, takes
 up only about 100 square feet of space, sells impulse items or
 food items, and can get started for as little as $5,000.
   Can such a dinky business make any real money? Consider
 The Pride of Milwaukee, started with a single pushcart by

```
   with Milwaukee slogans, and similar merchandise carrying the
   Harley-Davidson logo. In the pushcart’s first year, sales topped
   $225,000, the next year, $308,000, with a net profit of about
   $80,000. The business is in its fifth year and expansion has taken
   the form of additional pushcarts during the holiday shopping
   season.
     Then there’s The Nutty Bavarian.
     How a Nutty Idea Turned a Mild-Mannered
     Bean Counter into a Millionaire Entrepreneur
              _ John Mautner was a successful accountant, earning a top sal-
    ary, living in a beautiful home on the beach, financially com-
    fortable. But he was tired of putting in twelve, even sixteen,
   hours a day whenever necessary with nothing extra to show for
    it, weary of the pressure, and restless as someone else’s em-
   ployee. So he threw away the security of his ten-year tenure with
    the accounting firm and walked away.
     On more than one occasion, John had listened to his father
   bragging about the fresh, roasted nuts available from street ven-
   dors all over Europe. He’d done a little investigating, and con-
   cluded that—given the right locations and a hot product—
   pushcart vendors could make a lot of money with virtually no
    fixed overhead or worrisome investments in long-term store
    leases, store fixtures, employees, and other overhead.
     Although he had no training in food preparation, John began
   fooling around with different nuts and condiments on his kitchen
    stove, with the intent of inventing a new kind of nut snack. He
    settled on a recipe for roasted almonds flavored with sugar, cin-
   namon, and several other ingredients he won’t name—The Nutty
   Bavarian’s secret sauce.
     He started his business with one pushcart, at one location.
   No employees. Just John, his nuts, bags, a pushcart, and a hope-
    ful smile. It goes without saying that, throughout this process,

```

```
 instant success. People love his product. So much so that after
 just three years, John’s company, The Sports Nut, has over fifty
 pushcart locations operating, many at top locations like Veterans
 Stadium in Philadelphia, Candlestick Park in San Francisco, the
 Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Universal Studios Theme Park,
 Kings Island, and Six Flags. In 1993 his company-owned push-
  carts sold $1.4 million worth of flavored almonds, and his li-
 censed dealers sold $1.5 million, his total sales falling just shy
 of $3 million.
   There’s also a small, but growing, mail-order business, as
 people discover the nuts at one of the locations, then call the
 company to order more. John told me they’ve shipped pounds
  of nuts to thousands of customers so far, without making any
  effort at all to develop this side of the business. But it’s easy to
  see a million-dollar-plus mail-order business evolving in the near
  future.
   How the Presidential Seal of Approval Has Helped
     with The Nutty Bavarian’s Explosive Growth
   Thanks to a chance encounter at an amusement park industry
  trade show, one of President Clinton’s assistants got the boss’s
 approval of The Nutty Bavarian’s cinnamon almonds as the of-
  ficial snack of the inauguration dinners. Of course, ‘‘chance
 encounter’’ is a huge misstatement: John was doing smart, pro-
 active things like exhibiting, distributing samples, meeting and
 greeting people, making things happen. The consumption of a
 half-ton of his snack at inauguration dinners prompted a video
 news release aired by local TV news programs nationwide, plus
 appearances on Today and Good Morning America, reaching an
 estimated 51 million viewers. There were also articles in mag-
 azines from Time to tabloids like The National Enquirer.
   John is amazed at the number of stadium, theme park, and
 other facility operators who heard about him through this pub-
  licity. Some sought him out as a result. Others were eager to

    over 100 yet this year, 500 within three more years. He’s already
        ~ employing about 100 people and will probably double that with
   company-owned locations this year, as well as expanding by li-
   censing to independent operators.
     “I’m thirty-one years old and having a ball,’’ John told me.
    “‘We’re opening up in Hawaii next month, so Ill be spending
   some time there. I travel. I meet fascinating people. I got to
   go to the inauguration. Do you think I can build this into a
   $50 million company in ten years? I wouldn’t mind having
    a $50 million corporation at age forty-one.”’
     I don’t see any reason why he can’t. And John’s story in-
    cludes a number of Millionaire-Maker Strategies that I’ll reveal
    as we proceed through the rest of the book. After discovering
    all of the strategies, you may want to come back and reread this
    story to see how many you can find at work.
     And one thing is certain: Even from little almonds, great
   empires can grow!

         3
  HOW TO INVENT, FIND, OR
 GAIN CONTROL OF ENORMOUSLY
   PROFITABLE PRODUCTS
 Fe many businesspeople, this is one of the most important
   “*secrets’’ to success I think I can pass along: You must have
 ownership of at least some of the products you market, so that
 you have the full markup from manufactured cost to retail to
 work with. This is especially important for any kind of direct-
 marketing or mail-order business, but it applies to every busi-
 ness.
   Why Is Control of a Product So Important?
   When you buy and resell products obtained through normal
 distribution bureaucracies, you are going to have preset, very
 limited profit parameters. If you own a retail store, for example,
 you probably will buy just about everything from the same sup-
 pliers all the stores of your type buy from, at 40 to 50 percent
 off suggested retail. You’ll rarely be able to sell at full retail, so
 you will probably have a 30 percent profit number to work with.
   In the mail-order business, most vendors’ normal terms will
 be 50 percent off in relatively small quantities, to no more than
 65 percent off in huge quantities. This allows less than a one-
 time or 100 percent markup; however, you need a seven- to nine-
 times, or 700 to 900 percent, markup on your primary products
 to make it in direct marketing.

```

-----

```
    control them. If you have primary products with big profit mark-
   ups and margins, you can have a ‘‘supporting cast’’ of other
   products with lesser markups, and still have an exceptionally
   profitable business.
     Let’s take a relatively mundane example: a chain of several
   swimming pool supply stores. These stores sold chlorine and
    other chemicals, supplies, filters and tools, some patio furniture,
    beach balls, toys, beverage coolers, and so on. The owner’s
    stores were barely making money. Following a strategy of get-
    ting control of certain primary products with much higher mar-
    gins, these stores went from ‘‘dogs’’ to big profit producers over
    a three-year period of time. Here’s what the owner did:
    1. He got his own line of ‘‘private label’’ chemicals (I'll discuss
     the private label industry later in this chapter), so instead of
     buying the bottled products at 50 percent off for a 100 percent
    markup (selling a bottle of chemicals that cost him $4.00 for
     $7.99), he got that same bottle for a cost of $1.00 and sold
     it for $6.99. This gave his business a competitive advantage
     in pricing, a brand-name image, and higher profits.
    2. He formed a little “‘garage business’’ with teenagers ‘‘man-
     ufacturing’’ patio furniture out of PVC pipe, so he could ad-
     _vertise and sell his own patio furniture at very attractive
     prices. Buying normally, he might make $50 selling a set of
     patio furniture for $199. Now he’d sell a set for $129 and
    make $100.
    3. He got exclusive territory rights to an automated pool clean-
     ing gizmo imported from Korea, on which he had a 400 per-
     cent markup.
    4. He pui a custom T-shirt shop in each store, which is a very
     high-profit business if there is sufficient traffic without direct
     advertising cost.
     Now, he still sold everything he used to sell. He stocked
    several brands of chemicals other than his own, in case a cus-
   tomer was married to a nationally known brand. He sold the

```
 supply store. But all those items became ppauatat or support
 products.
   In the direct-marketing or mail-order business, the economics
 are even tougher. Almost without exception, you cannot afford
 to invest in advertising or direct mail to sell products with less
 than an 800 percent markup. As a result, just about every mail-
 order business, mine included, has primary products it controls,
 with such markups, then secondary products it also sells, but
 only to its ‘‘house lists’’ of established customers.
       How Do You Gain Control of
        Super-Profitable Products?
  There are four main ways to gain ownership or exclusive con-
 trol of a product:
    1. Create
   2. Publish
   3. Secure certain exclusive rights
   4. Have it private-labeled for you
      Create Your Million-Dollar Product
           from Scratch
   Behind every famous—and not-so-famous—product there’s
 somebody who had an idea and the gumption to do something |
 with it. Who knows how many people have played charades?
 Rob Angel added a playing board and cards and came up with
 Pictionary. Burt Reynolds and the late Bert Convy also created
 a game based on drawing out charades and moved it from the

   keted by my client, the Guthy-Renker Corporation, was invented
   by a dentist.
     But for every one of these inventors who has the thrill of
   seeing their product become a big star, there.are thousands more
   who toil in relative anonymity, but can still quietly make for-
    tunes. Wilson Call is in that category.
     In 1987 Wilson Call, an architect by training, first got the
    idea for a small fused adapter to go on a TV set plug, to prevent
    fires in case of shorts. It so happens that this was and still is a
   huge problem; in fact, many experts insist that the number-one
   cause of home fires is the TV set’s cord. Convinced of the need
    for such a device, Wilson worked on it and ultimately perfected
   and patented the Fireplug TV Cord Protector.
      ‘‘T thought, like a lot of other potential inventors, that all I
   had to do was get my patent,’’ Wilson recalls, “‘then when the
    patent was issued I would contact various firms through the mail,
   show them my product, they would purchase the patent from me
    for cash and royalties, and I would sit back a rich man, to dream
   up some other device and repeat the process.
      **Little did I realize how amateurish that idea was. In no time
    at all I found out that this was not the case. To have an idea and
   bring that idea to a point where a patent can be filed is a complex
    matter. If you really carry the idea through in a manner that if
   you were to manufacture and market the device on your own,
   would it succeed? In most cases, that is what you are going to
   have to do.”’
     Wilson’s rude awakening does parallel that of most inven-
    tors. He had to take the product to the marketplace himself,
   working through a maze of manufacturers, assemblers, packag-
    ers, legal requirements, and distribution problems, eventually in-
    vesting nearly $200,000 before getting the first Fireplug onto the
    first retail store shelf.
      I'll be the first to tell you that I admire inventors like Wilson.
   But I’ve never had any desire to be one. The fastest way to lose
    a million dollars is to be an inventor.
     This is a very tough road. That’s why it’s quite easy to use

 and all the money they could beg or borrow into, but can’t sell,
 and have no earthly idea how to sell. If you are going to create
 from scratch, my very best advice is to create to fit a known,
 identified, affordably reachable target market or to supply an
 established distribution pipeline. In other words, create it only if
 you know how you will market it and that you can market it.
 And, for safest results, work backward: Have the market and
 marketing in place first, then invent.
   If we break down the ideal market, known means that the
 market exists, can be described, and that you either know a lot
 about it from personal experience or a lot of information about
 it is available through reference materials, periodicals, shows, or
 other sources. /dentified means that others have already done the
 work of profiling this market and proving certain theories about
  it. For example, “‘fishing enthusiasts’’ is an identified market;
 from magazine subscriber databases and specialty catalog com-
 panies’ databases, we can easily get a feel for the size of the
 .market and its makeup in terms of men, women, ages, income
 levels, and purchasing behaviors, all from research sources avail-
 able at the public library.
   Affordably reachable is very important. This means that your
 prospective customers all read one or several magazines, are all
 available on mailing lists you can rent, all go to a big event
 where you can exhibit, all watch a particular TV program, etc.
 In contrast, if you define your market only as American women,
 it will cost millions to reach them, because you must use a lot
 of costly mass media; you'll have to advertise on daytime and
 nighttime television, in dozens of magazines and newspapers,
 and you’ll be fighting for their attention with giant advertisers
 like Revlon, Procter & Gamble, and General Mills. Women who
 own or fly private aircraft is an affordably reachable market.
 There will be one or two magazines they all subscribe to and
 read. They will attend air shows. A mailing list will be available.
   You can best justify inventing, creating, or finding products
 and organizing a business around them when you match up with
 this type of market.

   owners, who ‘‘live the RV lifestyle,’’ are just getting into the
   business of assembling their own catalog of products of interest
    to RV owners. Although they will mostly assemble, catalog, and
    sell existent products, they certainly can afford to invest in in-
   venting and developing some of their own, new, exclusive prod-
    ucts, based on input from their members, because they are
    virtually certain of being able to market those products suc-
    cessfully. The risks of inventing are dramatically reduced; the
   problems of finding distribution nonexistent. Obviously, these
    situations exist for established companies, not for start-up en-
   trepreneurs,
     If you are determined to be a from-scratch inventor, I'd en-
   courage you to get a copy of Wilson Call’s how-to manual, The
   Anatomy of an Invention (see chapter 13).
        An Inside Look at the Tough Challenge
       of Inventing from Scratch and Turning That
             into a Profitable Business
      If you are thinking of going the invent-from-scratch route,
    an honest appraisal of the obstacles ahead of you is important,
   which brings us to Tom Doyle, a consulting client of mine with
    a big problem. Tom invented a product so different from its
   competitors. that it requires educating consumers to sell it, but
    it’s so low in price that there’s no way to cover the costs of a
    lot of educational-type advertising like infomercials or direct-
    mail campaigns.
     Frustrated with how quickly his hand and arm fatigued while
   playing tennis, Tom Doyle became obsessed with grips. Yes,
    grips. And grip designs haven’t changed much in 1,000 years.
   So Tom went to medical school libraries, visited with experts in
    the anatomy, anthropology, and physiology departments of five
    universities, analyzed pro athletes’ gripping problems, molded
    clay in his kitchen, and, over a five-year period, filled his garage
   with different prototypes. In 1988 his ultimate, revolutionary En-

 his company, Gripping Solutions, was born.
   At the urging of a friend, he first applied his design to cre-
 ating new handlebar grips for mountain bikes, and the product
 is acknowledged by championship mountain bikers, mountain-
 bike product retailers, and doctors as far superior to anything
 else on the market. Yet, sales are so slow that Tom and his wife
 still run the company single-handedly, go to gatherings of
 mountain-bike riders to demo and sell them personally, take or-
 ders, pack and ship boxes, and still can’t seem to set aside any
 money for advertising or developing additional products.
   Through Tom’s almost annoying insistence at telling any-
 body and everybody about his grip technology, he wound up
 convincing a buyer for the Smith & Hawken gardening tools
 catalog, who happened to buy a mountain-bike grip, to order
 grips made for several of Smith & Hawken’s most popular tools.
 So, Gripping Solutions will be in a Smith & Hawken catalog
 soon, and although it has been a financial hardship for Tom to
 do the redesign work to apply his design to those specific tools,
 this could be a big breakthrough.
   There’s no doubt in Tom’s mind that he can develop golf
 club grips that will improve anybody’s game, tennis racket grips
 that will improve anybody’s game, industrial product grips that
 will improve safety and reduce repetitive-motion injuries, and,
 well, the applications are endless. But the funds aren’t.
   In 1994, Gripping Solutions, Inc., stacked up only $164,000
 in sales and lost about $20,000 doing it. In spite of ringing en-
 dorsements from just about every bicycling magazine, the En-
 durance products do not race off store racks—they are priced
 higher than other grips by necessity, and, so far, nobody’s found
 a way to get the package or in-store displays to tell enough of
 Tom’s story to sell the item. Until recently, the product was
 judged as too inexpensive and too price-competitive to permit
 marketing direct to the consumer, but, at my urging, a price
 increase and packaging of two pairs together as a set is being
 done, so that a reasonable attempt can be made at marketing .
 direct to bicyclists by direct-mail and direct-response print ads.

   50-50 shot.
     Tom is now aggressively seeking venture capital through ex-
    clusive licensing and joint ventures—for [example, ] [trying ] [to ] [find ]
    a golf products company that might invest in his company or
    give him R&D money in exchange for exclusive use of the tech-
   nology for grips for their golf clubs. And he is wrestling with
    the possibilities of going to friends, relatives, neighbors, maybe
    even customers and dealers to sell stock in the company, but he
    is fearful of giving up equity and control. But the time Tom can
   devote to this mission is limited—he also has to sell enough
    grips to keep the doors open and the lights on. And even spend-
    ing the money to get on an airplane and go to a candidate com-
   pany’s offices for a meeting or to a trade show is a seriously
    debated, agonizing decision.
     Tom’s struggle is the story of the inventor. Reading this,
   ‘Wilson Call will empathize instantly. And if you are going to
    go down this path, be prepared for this sort of struggle. It’s not
    for the weak of heart.
     However, should Tom tough it out and solve his marketing
   problem in the bicycling industry, that alone might yield million-
    dollar profits over two or three years. A deal to supply a major
   manufacturer or marketer of golf clubs might be worth hundreds
    of thousands of dollars a year, maybe even more. Success in the
   Smith & Hawken catalog could lead to distribution of various
        _ kinds of grips through hundreds of other catalogs, and provide
    a million dollars or more a year in profits. All that can happen
   —if Tom can tough it out.

      In retrospect, Tom Doyle feels—correctly, in my opinion—
    he would have been much better off perfecting, manufacturing,

    poles before mountain bikes, based on the size and responsive-

    An Invention Story with a Very Happy Ending
        Full of Millionaire-Maker Strategies
   On a warm, sunny autumn day in 1985 in the small town of
 Sharon, Pennsylvania, James Winner walked out the door of his
 office building, eager to get into his prized Cadillac—equipped,
 incidentally, with a factory-installed security system—and enjoy
 the ride home after a tough day at work. Unfortunately, there
 was an empty parking space where his Cadillac had been. Right
 in front of his own business, a thief had bypassed the Cadillac’s
 alarm system and stolen it!
   That’s how Jim Winner got the idea for a now-famous prod-
 uct, THE CLUB. He brought THE CLUB to the market in 1986
 and only eight years later, THE CLUB has become a $100-
 million-a-year company. The now-famous CLUB, brilliant in its
 simplicity, clamps to any car’s steering wheel and makes it im-
 possible to pilot the car. Getting it off requires more time and
 effort than most car thieves are willing to invest, so they pass a
 car with the bright-colored CLUB fastened to its steering wheel
 and move on to an easier target. Jim’s company guarantees up
 to $500 against the car owner’s insurance deductible if a vehicle
 is stolen while protected by THE CLUB and, in 1992, received
 theft claims for less than one-sixteenth of 1 percent of the 3.1
 million CLUBs that had been sold up until that time.
   Recently, Jim’s been busy marketing additional security
 products, notably including THE DOOR CLUB, for homes,
 which received the 1993 Retailer’s Choice Award from Do-It-
 Yourself Retailing Magazine.

   perience with the very frustrating crime of auto theft sent him
    in a very profitable direction. People everywhere are increasingly
    frustrated with auto theft and home burglary, worried about their
   personal and family safety, and angry at the criminal element in
    their communities. With auto theft on the rise, Jim Winner
   stepped forward with an easily understood, easily used, afford-
    able, and credible solution.
     Incidentally, the entire anti-crime industry is booming, so Jim
   Winner is riding a wave. Sales of Mace, the leading self-defense
    spray, jumped 36% from 1991 to 1993. Quorum, a newcomer to
    security products, using an Amway-like multilevel marketing
   system with independent distributors, has gone from 10 million
    in sales in 1991 to well over 100 million in 1993. All this puzzles
   some business analysts, because, overall, crime is not, statisti-
    cally, getting worse. However, the public feels unsafe, and is
    trying to buy a safe environment.
     MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #4: KEEP IT SIMPLE.
     In an increasingly high-tech, complicated world, there’s tre-
   mendous opportunity in going against the grain with a low-tech,
   simple solution to important needs or desires. There’s certainly
   nothing high-tech about Jim Winner’s CLUB, but it works.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #7:
          PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER WITH AN
           EXCEPTIONAL GUARANTEE.
     ‘Satisfaction guaranteed’? may be an overused phrase, and
   some marketing experts will argue that point, but I believe the
   American consumer so frequently has the experience of spending
   money on products and services that fail to live up to their prom-
    ises, that he is more responsive than ever to a particularly bold,
    clear, and specific guarantee. For years, in my seminars on mar-
    keting, I pointed to the original Domino’s guarantee as an ex-
   ample of how an entire business can be built on one bold,

 less).
          - With THE CLUB, you are guaranteed payment of up to $500
 of your insurance deductible if your car is stolen while protected
 by the device. As a marketer, I’m going to tell you a couple of
 the “‘tricks’’ of that guarantee. First of all, a lot of people who
 buy THE CLUB or get it as a gift never use it. How many, still
 in their unwrapped packages, are sitting in car trunks or corners
 of garages? There’s no way to know, but my bet is it’s in the
 tens of thousands or more. Second, some people are going to
 forget about that guarantee as time passes between their purchase
 of the device and a theft incident a year or years later. These
 and similar facts of human behavior diminish this company’s
 apparent financial risk attached to this guarantee left and right.
 So this strong guarantee, like most strong guarantees, is not
 nearly as risky or costly as it might seem on the surface.
   Then, as a business manager, I’d speculate that this cost is
 factored into the selling price and ‘‘reserved’’ to pay these
 claims. At the very beginning, Jim Winner had to guess, had to
 have great faith in his product, and had to stick his neck out
 making this guarantee. But soon, as a consistent, and in this case
 very small, percentage of claims became known, the company
 need only add the cost of claims to the product and reserve that
 portion of sales to be perfectly safe. (if THE CLUB is a $50:
 item on average, 100 of them represents $5,000 at retail, ap-
 proximately $2,500 in wholesale revenue to the company. Sup-
 pose the claims are one-sixteenth of 1 percent. One-sixteenth of
 1 percent of $5,000 is $3, divided by 100 units, which is a whop-
 ping 3 cents per unit!)
   For the price of three cents per unit, Jim Winner gets a super-
 strength guarantee he can brag about in all his advertising, on
 his product packaging, and in retail displays. And, think about
 this: The person who does have a car stolen and obtains that
 $500 from THE CLUB tells everybody he knows what a fantas-
 tic company this is and how they honor their guarantee.
   This is good business—good for the customer, very good for
 the company. |

    How to Print All the Money You Want, Legally!
     Here’s my personal favorite: paper-and-ink, audio and video
    ‘‘information products.’’ With these types of products, you can
    create or license or get exclusive [rights ] [or ] [private ] [label, ] [you ] [can ]
    manufacture as needed (publish on demand), and you can enjoy
   huge profit markups. I’ve devoted all of chapter 9 to this lucra-
    tive area of opportunity.
      Securing Certain Exclusive Rights Is Almost
      as Good as Inventing—Heck, Maybe Better
     Why would a manufacturer give you exclusive rights to a
    product, especially without requiring you to put up any money?
     To many people’s surprise, this happens all the time, and is
    perfectly logical. Let’s assume you are a manufacturer of cos-
    tume jewelry wristwatches. Your company makes all kinds of
    different watches: men’s, women’s, kids’, watches with sports-
    related faces, watches that are look-alikes of very expensive
    watches, and so on, and you supply discount-store and drugstore
    chains like Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, Gold Circle, and Walgreen
    with these watches. That’s your business.
     Along comes a guy who says he understands the freestanding
    kiosk business, is starting a company to put people in shopping
    centers with freestanding vendor carts or kiosks, wants to use
    your watches as one of the inventory packages and product lines,
    and needs exclusive rights to this type of distribution. And he
    presents himself in a professional and businesslike manner. He
    asks for a one-year exclusive limited to that type of distribution,
    renewable annually for five years only as long as he buys at least
    100,000 watches the first year and at least 200,000 watches each
    year thereafter. He’s not asking for credit, or for you to do any-
    thing special. He’ll pay cash with orders, and you’ll drop-ship
    watches in assortments of 500, reorders no less than 50, to his

```

-----

```
 900,000 watches, more or less, over the next five years, in a way
 you have never sold watches before. If he fails, you’re still going
 to sell some number of watches less than 100,000 but in the
 thousands the first year, in a way you’ve never sold watches
 before. And you had and have no intention of selling watches
 that way on your own. So, although the exclusive has plenty of
 value to that guy, it has no value to you. You’re giving up some-
 thing that costs you nothing and has no value to you, with the
 possibility of getting a whole new distribution network in return.
 You have the proverbial nothing-to-lose-everything-to-gain sit-
 uation. Marketers using this very argument carve out exclusives
 for themselves with tens of thousands of manufacturers every
 year. This is sometimes called the “‘Cossman Method,’’ after
 E. Joseph Cossman.
   Joe Cossman is one of the few early pioneers of the mail-
 order business who specialized in securing exclusive mail-order
 rights to products already being sold via other means, then
 exploiting them through direct marketing and publicity. I met
 Joe when I arranged an infomercial deal for him, and I helped
 him create an updated version of one aspect of his ae home
 study course for sale on television.
   Let me tell you a little bit about one of Joe’s twenty suc-
 cesses: Fly Cake. One Sunday, Joe was reading the classifieds
 in the newspaper—one of many techniques he’s used to find
 interesting products—and he spotted a little ad that read:
           Send in $1.00 and
           we’ll send you Fly Cake.
              It kills flies.
 So he sent in a dollar and got the product. It was a doughnut-
 shaped, solid cake of chemicals that seemed to attract flies, and
 killed them on contact. When Joe contacted the inventor, he
 learned that during World War II the inventor had been in the
 army and had been given an assignment to find an effective
 insecticide for the South Pacific. The sprays being used didn’t

```
    for twenty years, made Fly Cake and sold it only through clas-
    sified advertisements in newspapers and magazines. In total, he’d
    sold about 300,000 Fly Cakes.
     Joe said, ‘‘Give me the exclusive rights for this product and
    I’ll sell a million a year, or I’ll give you back everything I’ve
   done with it and it won’t cost you a cent.’’ Joe and the inventor
    reached an agreement, exempting classified advertising, but oth-
    erwise giving Joe exclusive marketing rights for Fly Cake. ‘‘At
    that moment,’’ Joe told me with enthusiasm, ‘‘it was as if I had
    invented the product and owned the factory!”’
     Joe sold Fly Cake in an incredible variety of ways. Within
    three years, he’d sold over 8 million Fly Cakes. He subsequently —
    sold the business and his rights. Fly Cake alone made Joe more
    than a millionaire.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #26:
            IF YOU DON’T ASK, YOU CAN’T GET.
     Don’t assume you can’t secure exclusive rights to a desired
    product or that manufacturers won’t work with you because
    you’re too small or any other limiting belief. There are enough ac-
    tual obstacles to overcome without manufacturing more of them in
    your own imagination. The only way to know for sure how any in-
    dividual or group of people will respond is to make your best pos-
    sible argument, under the best possible circumstances.
        How to Make Your Fortune with
           **Private Label’’ Products
     The private label industry is, to me, one of the most inter-
    esting and appealing places to go for products on earth.
      For some years, I had an interest in a small network mar-
    keting company, and at peak we had nearly 100 products under
    our label. By all appearances and perceptions, they were ‘‘our
    products,’’ yet they were standard or stock formulas being made

 companies’ was our product names and labels and our identity.
   For example, we found the manufacturer of a truly superb
 aerosol weed killer. This stuff got to the roots and killed just
 about any weed on contact. You could spray a weed in a side-
 walk crack, come back ten minutes later, sweep away a little
 brown residue, and that was that. This company produced tens
 of thousands of cans of this product, labeled one way for a na-
 tional chemical company that sold exclusively to restaurants and
 hotels, labeled another way for a national hardware chain that
 sold it off the shelf. When we first added the product to our line,
 we piggybacked on those runs and bought plain white cans, just
 144 at a time, and labeled them with our own printed paper
 labels. When our purchase size increased tenfold, we switched
 to having the manufacturer silk-screen imprint our label on the
 cans for us. The product bore our proprietary name (‘‘Kills
 Weeds Dead’’), our label, our company name.
   This same manufacturer provided us with a terrific insecti-
 cide spray that smelled like pink bubble gum, a foam leather
 cleaner, and a waterless car polish. We also dealt with private
 label manufacturers of cosmetics and skin-care products, vita-
 mins, herbal formulas, weight-loss drink mixes, even CS-gas
 keyring spray containers used to ward off attackers, competitive
 with the Mace units you now see sold in stores.
   While working on this project, I got a real education in the
 private label business. The truth is that you can get just about
 any product made or sold anywhere manufactured and private-
 labeled for you, in surprisingly small quantities. Every industry
 has private label manufacturers, and they are easy to find because
 they tend to aggressively advertise in their industry’s trade mag-
 azines and exhibit at their industry’s trade shows. In the begin-
 ning, if you are starting out with small quantities and stock,
 standard formulations, there will be little or no negotiation—the
 manufacturer will have a price list. There are virtually no pitfalls.
 Most private label manufacturers even provide blanket product
 liability insurance that extends protection to your company. As
 you move into volume purchasing, you can negotiate prices, ex-
                       a

```
    manufacturer’s cost.
     The bottom-line is that it is remarkably easy, pleasant, and
    profitable to deal with most private label manufacturers. If you
    have a clever marketing or promotion plan, a means of distri-
    bution, a chain of stores, maybe even one store, a catalog, or a
    celebrity who’ll work with you to promote a particular type of
    product, you can probably have your own product or product
    line without research and development costs, without starting
    from scratch, and without having to invest in huge quantities by
    dealing with private label manufacturers.
     Where Do You Go to Find Products, Product
       Sources, and Product and Business Ideas?
     Product and business ideas really are everywhere. All around
    you. But there are some specific sources that can be of help to you:

    You Can Also Advertise for Products and
    Product Ideas and Let Them Come to You
   Some years ago, a friend of mine in the business of brokering
 products to the mail-order industry ran this ad in a major city
 newspaper:
       Millionaire consultant seeks inventors,
       manufacturers, importers, authors,
       etc., with unique products suitable for
     promotion to homeowners, do-it-yourselfers,
    gardeners, and hobbyists. Send your information
             in confidence to:
 He ran this ad one time, on a Sunday, in the Business Section,
 in a two-inch box. How many replies do you think he got?
   280.
   If you ran a comparable ad in a handful of magazines or
 newspapers or in USA Today, you’d probably be deluged.
      How Do You Pick a Winner?
   For most people, the most efficient approach is to first lock
 in on a market and a product category. This allows you to focus
 your energies and resources.
  The best way to pick your product category is to consider
 your own educational and vocational experience; your own in-
 terests; the subjects and activities you know a lot about already;
 the size, responsiveness, and reachability of different markets;
 and societal and economic trends. You’ll need to use a combi-
 nation of these to do the best job possible.
  You should also keep in mind that most highly promotable
 products, services, or businesses have at least one of these three

      conditioner is a great example of this type of product, and
      since its invention and early marketing, home and car air
      conditioners have moved from the luxury to the (perceived)
      necessity category. When the microwave oven was first man-
     ufactured it was assumed it would have only a limited market
      in the restaurant industry. But societal changes that made time
      such a precious commodity, and made fixing the evening
     meal fast a perceived necessity, provided the right environ-
     ment for the microwave to become a universally accepted and
      desired household appliance.
    2. They provide a much better way to perform a common task or
     do acommon, necessary job. Just about every kitchen gadget is
      sold with this theme. The ballpoint pen, the calculator, and the
      fax machine all fall into this category. Positioning an in-home
      fitness device against the costly, cumbersome task of going to
      the gym incorporates this idea into a marketing message. The
      self-sealing strip added onto plastic sandwich bags is this type
     of invention.
    3. They have some enormous emotional or impulse appeal that
      transcends logic and basic needs. ‘‘Snob appeal’’ products,
           ‘ the fanciest restaurant in town, and cosmetic products all fit
      into this category.
     Having a Mental, Emotional, and Experiential
      Link with Your Market Can Make You Rich
     A guy at one of my seminars said, ‘‘I just saw that ‘Flying
    Lure’ infomercial on TV, I read about how much money they’re
    making, and I’m going to find a fishing gizmo and do the same
    thing.’’
      “‘Do you fish?’’ I asked. This guy didn’t fish; in fact, he had

 to sell golf products to previous buyers of golf products, they
 hire and staff the phones with telemarketers who play golf on
 their days off. When they’re making calls to solicit donations
 for a particular charity, they use telemarketers who are very sym--

 a golfer knows another golfer when he hears one. Nothing you
 can do in a sales script can match the power of shared passion.
  Picking a market you are suited to exploit first and then going

     HOW TO “REINVENT”
    YOUR WAY TO A FORTUNE
     ow would you like to have been the guy who invented the
     microwave oven? Or came up with Kleenex? Or 7UP? Or
    Dixie Cups? Or the Timex watch? Hey, you’d be in Fat City
    now, wouldn’t you!
     Maybe. Maybe not.
      In their first incarnations, every one of these products was a
    dead-bang loser. In his book, Getting It Right the Second Time
    Around, Michael Gershman tells the stories of these and other
    famous products that failed when first introduced to the market-
    place. In one way or another, they were ‘‘reinvented’’ before
    becoming successful. And there are fortunes to be had by clever
    entrepreneurs who creatively reinvent products, services, even
    entire businesses that are almost right.
       There Are as Many Ways to Reinvent
        as the Imagination Can Conceive—
           Plus One or Two More
     Our homes, closets, refrigerators, garages, and offices are full
    of products that had to be reinvented to succeed:

  were put on sale in—horror of horrors—pharmacies.
  Dixie Cups were originally just a component part of a cum-
  bersome water fountain no one would buy. |
  For the first six years of its existence, Kimberly-Clark did ev-
  erything that could be thought of to sell Kleenex as a superior
  makeup removal product. When they finally got around to
  checking up on the few customers that were buying the prod-
  uct, they discovered people were using it to blow their noses,
  not to take off makeup. The advertising was changed accord-
  ingly and sales boomed.
  7UP, originally called Bib-Label Lemon Lime Soda, was mar-
  keted as a means of settling infants’ upset stomachs. Later, as
  7UP, it was positioned as an adult hangover remedy. This
  product struggled for survival all the way into the 1960s, when
  the ‘“‘UNCOLA”’ ad campaigns caught on.
   If you are sitting with a product you passionately believe in
 but have been unable to market, you have to start by giving
 yourself an attitude checkup. You start by getting past blaming
 the stupid, unresponsive public, so you can make changes to the
 product that the public will respond to. The individual who
 brings an idea to the marketplace and gets hammered naturally
 prefers speculating about the idiocy of the public rather than
 looking in the mirror, shoving his bloodied nose aside, and
 squinting through his blackened eyes to look at the guy who
 missed the mark.
   ‘‘Everybody needs this product. How can they not see that?’’
 I’ve listened to countless thoroughly frustrated clients and
 would-be clients stuck on this thought. Then he’ll be off on a
 long celebration of how great his product is and what a genius
 he is, followed by a tirade about how dumb the customers are.
 I’ve heard it at least 1,000 times. I confess, I’ve muttered it
 myself a few times. But if you can set disappointment, frustra-
 tion, and ego aside and, with fresh eyes, find ways to reinvent,
 you can turn losers into winners. That’s the ThighMaster story.

```

```
  Last year, when I spoke as a member of a panel at the international convention of the Direct Marketing Association
(DMA), I got the inside story of this product’s failure from one
of my fellow panelists, Michael Clark, vice president of Ovations, Inc., the company that reinvented ThighMaster and produced its first successful TV commercials. Originally a Swedish
import invented by medical people, ThighMaster was given a
dull, technical-sounding name, and, after the inventors’ own attempts at TV advertising, was a failure. Here are the three
changes that turned ThighMaster from a loser into an enormous —
winner:

```
```
       So You Thought ThighMaster Was an
        Overnight Success? Think Again.
      Just how famous is ThighMaster? Murphy Brown got one at
    her baby shower. President Bush once joked that Marvin Fitz-
    water had busted his. Jay Leno jokes about it. Phil Donahue
    came out on stage wearing one on his head. The thing shows up
    in the darndest places. And millions of them have been sold.
      But this product was initially a turkey.
      In case you’ve been living in a cave, ThighMaster is a doo-
    hickey for women to put between their legs and exercise with to
    firm up their thighs. It has two blue foam-covered loops con-
    nected by a spring hidden inside a red plastic ball. It is pitched
    on television, in print ads, and on its box by Suzanne Somers,
    best remembered as the ditzy blonde on the sitcom Three’s Com-
    pany, a forty-five-year-old with the fantastic legs of a dancer half
    her age—the living, walking, prancing proof that ThighMaster
    works wonders.
      Last year, when I spoke as a member of a panel at the in-
    ternational convention of the Direct Marketing Association
    (DMA), I got the inside story of this product’s failure from one
    of my fellow panelists, Michael Clark, vice president of Ova-
    tions, Inc., the company that reinvented ThighMaster and pro-
    duced its first successful TV commercials. Originally a Swedish
    import invented by medical people, ThighMaster was given a
    dull, technical-sounding name, and, after the inventors’ own at-
    tempts at TV advertising, was a failure. Here are the three
    changes that turned ThighMaster from a loser into an enormous —
    winner:
     1. Product appearance. The original version was, well, ugly.
     The spring in the middle that creates the tension was visible,
      and looked like something you’d see under the hood of your
      car. And there was no mystique—it was just two loops
     hooked to a spring. Big deal.
                    foam

  engine red plastic ball, now called ‘‘the hidden tension coil.’’
  The whole thing looks sort of space-agey.
 2. Positioning. The original version was designed and presented
   as a multipurpose exercise device. And, in the first commer-
   cials, women were shown in exercise leotards, in a workout
  environment, exercising with the thing. At my DMA panel,
  Michael Clark said, ‘“We decided that the person watching
  the TV commercial, sitting on the couch, might not be all that
  excited about leaving the couch and really working at this.’’
    Their new approach showed the device being used by —
  Suzanne Somers and others while sitting in a chair watching
   television, lying on a chaise lounge next to a swimming pool,
  and sitting in a comfortable chair, talking on the phone. The
  message: This isn’t exercise at all! And, to keep the message
  from being confused, they zeroed in on just one purpose—
  firming up the thighs—and changed the name to match.
 3. Celebrity. A celebrity spokesperson was sought out who
  would really use and benefit from the product, get involved ©
   in the business, and, as Michael put it, ‘‘go the distance’’—
  not only appear in advertising, but put her image on the pack-
  age, go to in-store appearances, create publicity, do inter-
  views, and in every way marry the product.
    The person who signed on was Suzanne Somers, who tells
  anybody who’ll listen that she uses her ThighMaster two or
  three times a day, carries one in her purse, takes it with her
  when she travels, and recommends it to friends. In an ap-
  pearance on The Maury Povich Show, she gave one to every
  member of the audience and they all sat there and Thigh-
  Mastered together while she answered questions.
    ‘*There’s no doubt that Suzanne put this product over the
   top,’’ Michael told me, ‘‘but even she couldn’t have made |
  the original version a hit without the other changes made to
  the product.’’

   thanks to this clever reinvention.
     This success may—and probably should—pique your inter-
    est in obtaining a celebrity spokesperson for your product, ser-
    vice, or business. On a national level, many celebrities are found
   and obtained for entrepreneurs by professional celebrity brokers
    listed in chapter 13. You can also contact the celebrities or their
    agents directly, as a result of your own research with the Acad-
   emy of Motion Picture Arts Directories (see chapter 13). For
    local businesses, locally popular athletes or TV or radio person-
    alities can be just as effective as a much costlier national celeb-
    rity, and in most cases, you can contact these people directly.
     The costs for celebrities vary widely, depending on your
    product, whether you’re going to use the celebrity in print ad-
    vertising, direct-mail, or broadcast media nationally or region-
    ally, whether they are spokespersons or actually personally
   endorsing the product, and other factors. It’s not as expensive as
   most people think, though. Significant national celebrities can be
   obtained for national campaigns for as little as $10,000 to
   $25,000 a year, often plus a royalty tied to resulting sales.

    Do You Remember That Goofy Cat-Face Clock
      with the Eyes and Tail That Move Together?
     Woody Young, a friend of mine, has spoken at my seminars,
   and may be one of the most unusual entrepreneurs I know.
   Woody, who lectures on both business and Christian life topics,
    has owned and operated a successful plant nursery and written
    children’s books. Somehow, along the way, he stumbled into and
   bought the California Clock Company, makers of the famous
    Kit-Kat Clock.
     Famous? Yes, famous. In the fifties and early sixties, you’d

 yours. It’s fifteen inches from ear to tail tip, black and white,
 with big bulging eyes, a big smile, bow tie, clock in its stomach,
 and a long tail. The eyes and tail move together, tick, tock, tick,
 tock. Classic kitsch.
   Woody saw the Kat as something more. ‘“‘It really is a unique
 item. Very few novelty products stay in perpetual manufacture
 and distribution for fifty years. There’s something special about
  it. It makes even the worst sourpuss smile. Even the toughest
 customer’ll look at it and say ‘Look at that dumb clock,’ but
  that’s the worst reaction it gets.’ So, he bought a small clock
 company and diversified its business in incredible ways.
   For starters, he created the Kit-Cat Fan Club, and began en-
 rolling members with inserts inside each clock package. He cre-
 ated the Kit-Cat Creed: ‘‘Put a smile on everyone’s face, love
 in everyone’s heart, energy in everyone’s body and be a positive
 force in everyone’s life.’’ There’s a monthly Club newsletter,
 puzzles, games, stories of the magic the Cat and the Creed have
 worked in people’s lives. There are tens of thousands of mem-
 bers. And, of course, there are Kit-Cat posters, T-shirts, bumper
  stickers, coffee mugs, cookie jars, aprons, and the Kit-Cat Wrist-
 watch. He has even licensed the Kit-Cat character, just like Dis-
 ney licenses Mickey Mouse. If you visit the famous Ron-Jon
 Surf Shop in Daytona Beach, Florida, you’ll find the Kit-Cat on
 their surfer apparel, even on a surfboard.
   Next, he turned the Kit-Cat into a personality for how-to
 books. There’s Clockwise Quotes on Life, a motivation book;
 Babysitting Wise, in which Kit-Cat gives practical instructions
 for baby-sitters and parents; Clockwise, which teaches children
 how to tell time; and Song Wise, which illustrates patriotic songs.
   Woody still goes personally to gift industry trade shows,
 dressed in a Kit-Cat-like tuxedo and bow tie, with a Kit-Cat-like
 smile, to show and sell his smile-inducing products. But he also
 has a national salesforce calling on all kinds of stores and dis-
 tribution through many mail-order catalogs, including Wireless,
 the catalog of esoteric merchandise put out by Minnesota Public
 Radio.

    about the untapped value of Kit-Cat, and went on to reinvent the
    entire business.
          If You Ain’t the Lead Dog,
           the View Never Changes
     One of the principles espoused by advertising gurus Al Ries
    and Jack Trout, authors of Positioning: The Battle for Your
   Mind, is: If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category
    that you can be first in.
      In the early 1980s, the chiropractic profession was deluged
    with ‘‘practice management firms,’’ each offering high-priced
    services via multiyear contracts, and all promoting their services
    with free, introductory seminars. I did some speaking for several
    of these companies, studied their businesses, and saw that while
    the profession was clearly crying out for help with marketing
    their practices, many doctors couldn’t or wouldn’t invest $20,000
    to $50,000 in a services contract, so they came to the introduc-
    tory seminars but went home empty-handed and unsatisfied. A
    collection of elements came together through a process I won’t
    bore you with that led to my developing the same kind of how-
    to information, but packaging it for sale at a very modest price
    (under $1,000) to the doctors in books, manuals, audiocassettes,
   and do-it-yourself kits. So a business was born.
     But I didn’t want it to be just another business in a cluttered
    field. Somehow, I wanted it to be the ‘‘lead dog’’ from the very
    beginning. After some thought, my. partner at the time and I
   made these decisions:
    1. Because we delivered all of our advice in the form of mate- -
      rials rather than through services, we could call ourselves
     publishers.
    2. Because we were using introductory seminars, we could also
     call ourselves a seminar company.

```

```
  specific. After a little testing and experimentation, we found
  that mixing chiropractors and dentists in the same seminars
  worked best. We were the only company to do this.
  Combining these three elements, our company instantly be-
 came ‘‘the largest integrated seminar and publishing organization
 exclusively serving the chiropractic and dental professions,’’ be-
 cause we were the only company doing that. We invented a new
 category.
  By the way, none of the three people in this company was a
 doctor. We were all outsiders, marketing and businesspeople
 translating success principles to these professions.
  Our business grew like wildfire and, in a period of just sev-
 eral years, did millions of dollars in business in a very small
 niche market, reaching out to fewer than 60,000 potential cus-
 tomers. Within chiropractic, the more responsive of the two mar-
 kets, we achieved a 30 percent market share. I am convinced our
 creation of a new category, where we could advertise ourselves
 as the biggest and the best from the very beginning, played a
 major role in the professions’ acceptance of us as valid experts.
    How Domino’s Became the ‘‘Lead Dog’’
  The Domino’s Pizza story has been told so many times, you
 may think there’s nothing more to be said. But I think Tom
 Monaghan’s reinvention of the pizza shop deserves mention
 here. I interviewed Tom Monaghan for a magazine article, and
 he emphasized that early in the development of Domino’s, he
 recognized the critical need to position his business in the minds
 of consumers as different from other pizza places. ‘‘We tried to
 find something about the pizza business no one else was doing
 well,’’. Tom said. That was delivery.
   If you keep reinvention in mind, you can see that Domino’s
 actually set up a whole new category within the pizza business:
 delivery only. And Domino’s became such a success, the lead

             TWEAK, TWEAK, TWEAK.
      Often, success is just one or two minor adjustments away.
   Many people give up just one ‘‘tweak’’ away from turning ex-
    perimentation and struggle into victory. But how do you draw
    the line between persistence and stupid stubbornness? In most
    direct-marketing situations, if a marketing test returns less than
    sixty cents in gross sales per dollar of marketing expense, we
    walk away. If it’s sixty-one cents or better, it can often be
    tweaked to profitability. In each situation, you have to somehow
    decide whether or not you are close enough to keep investing in
    tweaking.

         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #37:
       TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SUCCESS
            OR FAILURE OF YOUR IDEAS.
     Blaming the marketplace, the customers, those in charge of
    distribution for not seeing how great and wonderful and needed
    your product is cannot possibly lead to success. It may be com-
    forting, but it’s self-defeating. It’s even childish, like saying ‘‘if
    you won’t play my way, I'll take my ball and go home.”’ If the
    inventors and advocates behind ThighMaster had gotten mad at
    their market and gone home, it’d be just one more failed inven-
    tion among thousands of fitness devices that also failed. Instead,
    they kept seeking different and better ways to present their prod-
    uct in a way that the public would respond to.

 and turned his imagination loose on it—how can we build on
 this success?
  The process of getting to success with a product can be long,
 agonizing, and costly. Once you get there, though, you should
 take fast, massive, and comprehensive action to capitalize on that
 success in every way imaginable.
   As soon as my client the Guthy-Renker Corporation had a
 hit with Vanna White on television selling the PerfectSmile
 tooth-whitening products, the race was on to create Perfect-
 Smile toothbrushes and mouthwash, PerfectTan, PerfectSkin, and
 PerfectWhatever, to build on the foundation of success.
       STAKE OUT A LEADERSHIP POSITION.
   There’s great value in being perceived by your marketplace
 as the biggest and/or the best, as the leader of your field. You
 can get to that point the hard way: starting at the bottom and
 crawling, fighting, clawing your way up the ladder, over a period
 of years, slowly building a reputation. Or you can, as Robert
 Ringer put it in his great book Winning Through Intimidation,
 ‘‘leapfrog’’ to the top. You can leapfrog by reinventing your
 entire business or the entire industry your business is a part of,
 or by inventing a whole new category within that industry.
   How Do You Take on Nabisco, Del Monte,
     Kellogg, and Other Big Brand Names
            and Win?
   There are two battles to be fought in the foods business: one
 for supermarket shelf space, the other for the attention of the
 fickle consumer. David A. Nichols came to Loblaws, a Canadian
 supermarket chain that was losing money, and concocted a rad-
 ical idea about getting rich. He proposed taking Loblaws’s lack-
 luster group of private label foods, improving their quality, and

```

-----

```
    wanted to fight for shelf space and sales with the big names.
    And he wanted to export to the United States to boot!
             _ David Nichols saw three opportunities. First, he found that
    most private label lines of food were of inferior quality or at
    least perceived to be of inferior quality to the name brands, so
    only the most budget-conscious consumers reluctantly bought
    them. He believed he could change that. The quality of private
    label items could be dramatically enhanced and still sell for less
    than the big names because they carried no “‘brand tax.’’ In other
    words, their prices did not need to include the tens of millions
    of dollars that the big names spend each year on advertising.
      Second, he noticed that most supermarket chains’ private la-
    bel products were packaged almost in plain brown wrappers.
    They looked uninviting and cheap. Nichols determined that in
    volume, snazzy packaging was no costlier than dull packaging.
    So he put his ‘‘President’s Choice’’ products in packages with
    copy that sells, like their ‘‘Ancient Grains’’ cereal, boldly la-
    beled across its top: ‘“Too Good To Be True!’’ And in the news-
    paper inserts he develops and provides for promoting his
    products, you’ll see things like an elephant standing in a stew-
    pot and the instruction “‘Cut elephant into bite size pieces. This
    should take approximately 2 months’’ to advertise President’s
    Choice deep-dish meat pies. He gave personality to products that
    historically have been put forward with none.
      Third, he had his own testing lab in Loblaws stores. If he
    could quickly prove the salability of these products, he would
    be exporting more than just another product line to U.S. super-
    markets, he’d be offering a proven sales system, a franchise of
     sorts. In a sense, he completely reinvented the private label foods
    business and created something of much greater value to offer
     to retailers throughout North America.

 Jewel in the Midwest, and D’ Agostinos in New York. According
 to the New York Times, while overall North American super-
 market products’ sales volume rose by 37 percent in 1993, Pres-
 ident’s Choice sales jumped 127 percent. When Nichols came to
 Loblaws, its private label food sales were $500 million. After
 three years, they’ ve topped $9 billion! And some individual Pres-
 ident’s Choice products, such as the ‘‘Decadent Chocolate Chip
 Cookies’’ outsell major brands like Chips Ahoy. Loblaws also
 private-labels its products for Wal-Mart.
  Competitors have been awakened by David Nichols’s
 achievements. Major chains like Safeway and A&P have re-
 vamped their own private label lines, now Safeway Select and
 A&P Masters’ Choice. David Nichols says that ‘‘retailer-created
 and -controlled brands’’ may account for as much as 40 percent
 of the supermarket industry’s food products sales in the near
 future.
   Nichols has already tired of this game that he created, has
 left Loblaws, and has begun a consulting business; he is talking
 about building a new wine distribution business around his small
 family winery. Aspects of his strategy are well worth considering
 for a variety of businesses.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #25:
    UNCOVER HIDDEN ASSETS AND OPPORTUNITIES.
  For example, the small businessperson who is trying to-find a
 way to get really, really rich might learn from Nichols’s exploits.
 Let’s say you own a small chain of restaurants or hair styling sa-
 lons or carpet cleaning trucks. If you develop your own private la-
 bel line of ancillary products and a terrific system for selling them,
 you can then roll that out to others in your business all over the
 country and create an instant, nationwide sales and distribution
 organization for your products. Nichols turned a neglected, un-
 dervalued product line into a new, very duplicatable system not
 unlike a franchise, although not called or sold as a franchise.
   In concert with this idea, we might summarize Nichols’s at-

```

-----

```
   By riding on others’ established distribution networks, stores,
   store traffic, and advertising, he was free to concentrate on in-
   novation with product and product packaging. Or, for example,
    it’s worth noting that David Nichols saw great opportunity in an
   asset that was ‘‘lying around’’ at Loblaws, undervalued, ne-
   glected, and taken for granted by those who had controlled it for
   years. That very same situation—what I call the ‘‘hidden op-
   portunity’’ in an established business—exists just about every-
   where. Or, for example, take note that David Nichols ignored
   conventional industry wisdom, norms, rules, and traditions when
   he chose to build on private label products, rather than offering
   them as an ‘‘oh, by the way’’ accommodation to ‘‘cheap’’ cus-
   tomers. There are lots of lessons to be learned from the story of
   President’s Choice.
      Dan Kennedy’s Creativity Checklist for
       Inventing or Reinventing Products,

   new product or on re-invention:
   OPPOSITES The Burger King Whopper is a big sand-
             wich; the White Castle Burger is a very
            small burger, often sold in six-packs and
             dozens. Is there something that is success-
              ful and big that could be successful and
             small or vice versa? Today’s common indi-
              rect lighting was invented as the opposite
             of the traditional, standard direct lighting.
            As I mentioned elsewhere in this book,

  EXAGGERA- Years ago, Volkswagen demonstrated the
  TION ‘‘roominess’’ of its car by having basket-
             ball star Wilt Chamberlain get in it and sit
           comfortably. Even though no one really
            believed that Wilt would regularly drive a
           Bug, the point was made: If he can sit in
             it, it’s certainly big enough for me. Varia-
            tions of that idea have been used in dozens
           of car and minivan commercials. My friend
           and client Frank Robinson has driven the
            sales of millions of jars of Nancy Kwan’s
            Pearl Cream by having her deliver this
           guarantee in TV commercials: ‘‘If your
            friends don’t actually accuse you of having
           had a face-lift, return the unused portion
            for a full refund.’’ This is nothing more
            (or less) than a satisfaction guarantee, but
             it has much more impact by being said

              they'll be accused of having had a face-lift

   ADDITION/ Lite and fat-free foods are products sold
   SUBTRACTION based on what has been subtracted from
             them. At one time, there were two kinds of
            doughnuts: cake and glazed, both round,
             with a hole in the middle. Eliminating the
             hole and filling them changed the doughnut
             business forever. The next time you visit a
            Dunkin’ Donuts take a look at how many
              varieties are ‘‘filled’’—creme-filled, jelly-
               filled, lemon meringue-filled, maple syrup—
             filled, chocolate-filled. That’s addition.
   COMBINING One odd type of business that has cropped
                                 ’ up in recent years is the combined Laun-
            dromat-Tavern: Singles do their laundry,
            enjoy a beer, watch a game, and make
             friends all at the same time. But a much
            more common example is the combined
            supermarket—gas station—the convenience
              store. How about the clock-radio? The hit
            TV series Miami Vice was a creative com-
             bination of cop shows and music videos.

             cookies shaped like circus animals visible
              inside the cage. For years, Pez candy was
                                 | popular because of the dispenser package.

 TERMINOLOGY ‘“Schweppervescence’’ for Schweppes

           suing them.

   HOW PROVIDING A SERVICE
  CAN MAKE YOU A MILLIONAIRE
     hen most people think of ‘‘service businesses,’’ they auto-
     matically think small. The solo operator who comes around
   and cleans your carpets. The guy who cuts your grass. But the
   service industry is booming, with many giant businesses as
   members.
     How an Unemployed Autoworker Invented
         a Revolutionary Approach to
         Advertising in His Garage
    A young, unemployed autoworker, Terry Loebel, was look-
   ing for a way to make some money when he stumbled onto an
   idea that would ultimately change the entire advertising industry.
   With nothing but time on his hands, Terry was hanging out,
   talking to some of the shopkeepers in town, and the complaint
  ‘he heard repeated over and over again had to do with the diffi-
   culties and high costs of advertising to attract new customers.
   Terry figured out that he could reduce each merchant’s costs if
   they all mailed their brochures and coupons together, sharing one
   envelope. He convinced several merchants to try his idea, bor-
   rowed $500 from his mother to finance the printing costs, and
   stuffed the envelopes himself, in his garage.
       1993 business he created celebrated twenty-fifth

 envelopes filled with different advertisers’ coupons to more than
 50 million homes throughout the United States and Canada.
 These days, dry cleaners, carpet cleaners, restaurants, stores, chi-
 ropractors, dentists, attorneys, and countless other types of local
 businesses as well as national advertisers rank Val-Pak as their
 best method of advertising. The company has over 250 dealers
 and an army of more than 1,000 salespeople, bringing in adver-
 tising from more than 80,000 businesses, resulting in nearly 6
  billion coupons delivered to consumers.
   Val-Pak is the largest and fastest-growing company in the
 industry invented by Terry Loebel. Others now nipping at its
 heels include MoneyMailer and Advo. By providing a simple,
 cost-saving service to small] businesses, the company Terry cre-
 ated in his garage with $500 has become a $70 million-a-year
 business.
    I Can’t Wait to Tell You About Rory Fatt
   Inspired by Domino’s Pizza and trends he read about in Faith
 Popcorn’s book The Popcorn Report, a young entrepreneur in
 Vancouver, Canada, started Simple Salmon, home delivery of
 fresh-frozen seafood and gourmet dinners. His is a pure service
 business, competing against ‘‘calling Domino’s and settling for
 a pizza,’’ going out to eat, or going to the supermarket and as-
 sembling a dinner. Rory’s product is convenience without com-
 promise of quality.
   He started his business in his apartment, with a small corner
 of borrowed freezer space at a vendor’s facility, and one 8'2 x
 11" flyer. When he came to my seminar, he was struggling just
 to stay in business, and he said to me, ‘‘Once I get somebody _
 to try my meals, they ail reorder, stock their fridge, and keep
 calling me for more. If I can just get somebody to try it, I keep
 them as a customer.”’
   I said, ‘‘If you’re telling me the truth, I have the solution to
 your marketing problem. If you’re lying, my advice will put you

```

```
   the concept of a free dinner. My advice was: Give it away
   and get ’em hooked. And he did. Using the theme ‘‘Who said
   there’s no such thing as a free dinner?’’ he launched ads in
   the Yellow Pages, weekly newspapers, and on radio, and
   gave away free dinners by the carload. Since then, he’s used a
   variety of innovative advertisements but, in every case, he sticks
   with the free dinner offer as the means of acquiring new cus-
   tomers.
     In every sense, we have conquered Rory’s marketing chal-
   lenge. He can acquire new customers at a very low percus-
   tomer advertising and promotion cost, and his retention and
   referral rates are outstanding. Because he started with zero cap-
    ital in the first place and still can’t convince any bank to make
   a sizable business loan to such a strange enterprise, he is, as
   I'm writing this book, wrestling with other business prob-
   lems: raising capital so he can maintain adequate inventories,
   employ people, open pick-up outlets, and expand before some-
   one bigger and better financed takes his idea and preempts him
   in the marketplace. If he gets over this hump, I believe Rory
   has an eminently franchiseable business and you may very well
   see his ads in your city soon. His dramatic success to date is
   based on many things I believe in devoutly, including selling
   quality, not price; competing with service above all else; and
   using direct-response, creative advertising featuring an irresisti-
   ble offer.
     The trends that fuel his business can fuel many, by the way.
   The most precious commodity of the 1990s is not money, gold,
    silver, or diamonds—it’s time. That’s what we have the least of;
   that’s what we’ll cheerfully pay to preserve. With both husband
   and wife working outside the home; kids to raise; homes to keep
   up; a new interest in health and fitness motivating use of gyms,
   walking, jogging; an endless variety of leisure activities; anda
   remarkably large percentage of people between the ages of
   twenty-five and fifty involved with spare-time, home-based busi-
   nesses, there’s just not a minute to spare. So people will spend
   money for convenience. If you can give people time, you can

   How to Build a Multimillion-Dollar Business
      Without Spending Even a Penny
           on Advertising
   For years, requests by viewers of TV programs for transcripts
 of the shows were a damned nuisance until James Smith rec-
 ognized the opportunity hidden in all that aggravation. Smith was
 an MIT dropout, operating a small typesetting business in Man-
 hattan when he ordered a transcript of a MacNeil-Lehrer Report
 show and waited three weeks for it to arrive. To demonstrate
 that even his dinky company could do a better job, he taped a
 MacNeil-Lehrer show, stayed up all night transcribing and type-
 setting it, and hand-delivered the product to the show’s producers
 the next morning. He secured an exclusive contract to produce
 the show transcripts and fulfill the requests.
   For TV producers, his oddball business, called Journal
 Graphics, offered a service that relieved them of problems. Smith
 said to the producers: You can flash the Journal Graphics address
 and phone number on the air, we’ll handle the requests, and if
 a particular transcript sells enough copies, we'll even pay you a
 royalty. He quickly captured the transcript rights to most major
 talk shows and about one-third of all of CNN’s programming.
   Of course, most shows do not generate enough transcript
 requests to amount to much money. But, then, keep in mind that
 the costs of preparing a typical transcript for copying are less
 than $100, and copying costs are about two cents a page, about
 a buck for the average complete transcript copy. Journal Graph-
 ics lays a 300 percent or better markup on that, selling each
 transcript for $3 to $5. And the occasional blockbuster bestsellers
 make it all worthwhile. Phil Donahue’s April 8, 1993, show,
 featuring the ‘‘Recipe Detective’s’’ do-it-at-home versions of
 Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and other
 famous food products sold 100,000 transcripts! Bill Moyers’s
 PBS interviews with Joseph Campbell about myths sold a re-
 spectable 20,000 transcripts.

    dition to the individual consumers interested in the Recipe De-
    tective or the interviews with transvestite hookers who want to
   adopt children, Sally Jessy Raphael, law firms, newspapers, radio
    talk show producers, and even government agencies want tran-
    scripts of all the Nightline programs, and they’ll pay extra for
    fast delivery via satellite, computer, or fax. For $1,000 a year,
   Smith will deliver transcripts from 100 different TV shows
   whenever they deal with your chosen subject, so if you are, say,
    a lobbyist for the travel industry, you can get the comments
   about the travel industry as they occur on these shows. Jn these
    cases, Smith is really in a double-service business: serving the
   broadcasters and producers of the shows and serving the user of
    the information.
     To use high-tech terms, you might think of Mr. Smith’s mes
    nal Graphics as a toll booth on the information highway. But it
    is solidly based on the simple foundation of all successful service
   businesses: the ability to do and deliver a desired and needed
    service for less money than the individual customers can do it
   themselves, faster and more conveniently than they can do it for
   themselves.

   How an Idea for Decorating a Living Room
   Wall Turned into a Unique Service Business
   In 1964 Micheline Massé, a University of Montreal com-
 merce graduate, began collecting old stock certificates with the
 intent of papering a wall in her living room with the colorful,
 often beautifully engraved documents. All of the certificates she
 found, bought for pennies, or got from friends were presumably
 worthless, but before gluing them all up, she decided to research
 a few of them and make sure they were worthless. And darn the
 luck, one of the old certificates had a value of $5,000. That
 screwed up her decorating plan, but it also launched Micheline
 in a new business as a stock sleuth.
        On the Trail of Lost Fortunes!
   According to Micheline, about 2,500 companies change their
 names every year, mergers and reorganizations confuse stock-
 holders, bankruptcies often disburse funds years later, dormant
 companies’ stockholders give up, and people die, leaving stock
 certificates in trunks in the attic or shoeboxes in the closet that
 go unnoticed for years and when found are presumed worthless.
 All this adds up. In fact, she estimates the amount of available,
 ‘‘lost’’ wealth to be in the billions of dollars, and that one-third
 of all households have some seemingly worthless stock certifi-
 cates lying around.
   Just as an example, consider North European Oil Corpora-
 tion, a ‘‘penny stock’’ from the 1930s. The company shut down
 in 1937. But twenty years later, oil was discovered on its prop-

```

-----

```
   stock from 1930, there’s $130,000 waiting today. And there are
   nearly a million of those shares still floating around out there,
   presumed worthless by whoever has them.
     Florence Richards, a retiree in St. Petersburg, Florida, bought
   300 shares of North European at twenty-five cents a share in
   1930 to cheer up a despondent, failing stockbroker she was dat-
   ing at the time. Florence read about Micheline; Micheline got
   her $54,500 in back dividends and capital growth for those 300
   shares!
    Remember the famous capers of Bernie Cornfeld and Robert
   Vesco ‘from the 1960s? If you do, you may remember their
   ‘Fund of Funds,’’ which ended with.a much-publicized scandal,
   Vesco’s disappearance, Cornfeld’s prosecution, and the fund’s
   bankruptcy. Well, it took thirteen years to settle the bankruptcy,
   and now hundreds of millions of dollars await fundholders and
   shareholders who file claims.
      30 Percent of Millions Recovered—Micheline’s
      Hobby-Turned-Service Becomes Big Business
     The company Micheline founded, StockSearch International,
    Inc., has an extensive database in its computers, a network of
   research associates all around the world, and a crew of investi-
   gative specialists, all tracking down the true value of old and
   obscure companies’ stock certificates. The company charges a
   small, flat fee for each investigation (under $100 as of this writ-
   ing), plus 30 percent of the recovered funds if the stock proves
   valuable. '
     And even if the stock is really worthless, the certificates may
    still be salable in the collectibles market. Micheline’s original
   hobby lives on, as she remains active as a dealer in collectible
   stock certificates. Over the years, she has recovered millions of
   dollars for her clients. And she finally found enough truly worth-
    less certificates to get that wall decorated!

    Where Might Your Interests Lead You?
  My friend Carl Galetti is passionately interested in direct-
 response advertising and copywriting, and comes to many of the
 direct-marketing and advertising conferences where marketing
 gurus speak. He listens as one speaker after another, at confer-
 ence after conference, recommends certain books to the audi-
 ences by the old masters of advertising, many of which are out
 of print. Classic books like The Robert Collier Letter Book, orig-
 inally published in 1931, and Scientific Advertising by advertis-
 ing pioneer Claude Hopkins are incredibly valuable to anybody
 interested in creating highly productive ad copy, but these books
 are almost impossible to find.
   Carl correctly saw this as a terrific opportunity. He dug up
 many of these old books, traced them to their copyright owners,
 negotiated new publishing deals, and published new editions. In
 some cases, he found inventories lying in dusty warehouses and
 tied up the rights to sell them. In other cases, he arranged drop-
 shipping agreements with little-known publishers. One way or
 another, Carl built up a catalog of nearly a hundred of these
 hard-to-find but recommended books. Now, just about every
 direct-marketing and advertising speaker refers their audiences
 and clients to Carl. There are at least fifty speakers I know who
 tell people about Carl. By providing an important service to peo-
 ple interested in learning marketing from the old masters and
 providing a service to today’s marketing teachers, Carl has built
 a profitable mail-order business with zero advertising.
   But why stop there? Remember, Carl loves going to all sorts
 of marketing conferences and hanging out with the speakers,
 consultants, experts, and entrepreneurs who gather there. So, us-
 ing his books as the foundation, Carl assembled a speech and a
 home-study correspondence course of his own on the old mas-
 ters’ copywriting techniques. Now Carl goes to the conferences
 as an invited speaker, a recognized expert, and with catalogs to
 distribute and courses to sell, so instead of spending thousands
 traveling to each conference, he makes thousands at each one.

```

-----

```
      EVEN IF YOURS ISN’T A TRUE SERVICE BUSINESS,
       ADD AND EMPHASIZE A SERVICE COMPONENT.
     Carl’s book business is a mail-order business, but by posi-
   tioning himself as the provider of the service of tracking down
   and providing these difficult-to-find, rare, or out-of-print books,
   he built his mail-order business without a cent of advertising.
     Earl Nightingale once observed, “‘If, instead of working on
   making more money, the average businessperson would spend
   an hour each and every day in quiet contemplation of how to be
   of greater and more creative service to his clientele, he and they
   would be the richer for it.’’

     I started in speaking, as many do, giving talks and seminars

   moved further away from those common, universal topics and,
   instead, focused on speaking about marketing and _ direct-
   marketing strategies and systems, where my greatest talent is,
   and where my greatest interest is. For me, devising the right
   marketing strategies for different products, services, or busi-
   nesses, and teaching people how to select and use the best strat-
   egies for their purposes, is not only easy, it’s fun. I’d rather do
    this than play golf, to the constant consternation of my wife. The
   line between work and play is blurred.

       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #21:
       TURN YOUR PASSIONS INTO PROFITS.
   The entrepreneurial path is, at best, a very rocky one, with
 landmarks like long hours, frustration, fear, financial worries and
 woes, and, quite literally, one obstacle placed in front of you
 after another. If you are going to have the persistence necessary
 to travel very far on this path, it'll help to be involved in an
 activity that genuinely interests you and stirs your passion. It is
 much easier to make a million dollars doing something you enjoy
 and are excited about for its own sake than to make a million
 purely to make a million.
   FOUNDATIONS FOR A SUCCESSFUL SERVICE BUSINESS
    1. Need-driven (examples: oil change shop, computer
     repair)
   2. Want-driven (examples: interior decorating, portrait
    photography)
   3. Time savings—driven (examples: mobile oil change,
    lawn and garden service)
   4. Money savings—driven (example: furniture re-cover-
     ing and reupholstering)
   5. Unique or incorporating a strong competitive advan-
     tage (example: 1-Hour-by-appointment appliance re-
     pair: We set a definite appointment and guarantee to
     arrive within one hour of the appointment time or
    your repair is free.)

  HOW THE AMAZING POWER OF
   DUPLICATION TURNS EVEN
  SIMPLE IDEAS INTO IMPRESSIVE
       FORTUNES
  dBi premise is simple: Create a means of making money,
     building and operating a business, or something similar that
   has unique features and can be taught to and duplicated by oth-
    ers, and then charge others for the privilege of using your
    “*system.”’
     Yes, I’ve just described McDonald’s and virtually the entire
   franchise industry. But there are a number of other, less com-
    plicated, costly, regulated ways of getting paid for others’ use
   of your proven system. So, after just a few words about fran-
   chising, we’ll move on to more interesting opportunities.
      Franchising Just Ain’t What It Used to Be,
          but It Still Might Be Your
         Million-Dollar Opportunity
      In its earlier years, franchising was a way for the little guy
    to get into business for relatively little investment and minimal
    risk, thanks to the proven system, training, and continuing sup-
    port of the parent company, the franchisor. Over the years, fran-

 business owners at all; they are sold to established, successful
  franchisees in another franchise network. McDonald’s franchis-
  ees own Domino’s franchises, Dunkin’ Donuts franchises, Al-
 phagraphics franchises, etc., and the entire industry has become
 somewhat incestuous.
   Of course, if you do have a business right and ripe for fran-
  chising, you may still find your fast fortune as a franchisor. As
  a starting point, you might obtain some information from the
  International Franchise Association in Washington, D.C. How-
  ever, just the cost of getting ready to sell your first franchise,
  notably including legal fees and complex, costly federal and state
  registrations, can be prohibitive. In response to the increasing
  costs and complexity of becoming a franchisor, and the related
  high costs and barriers to entry for ordinary folks as franchisees,
  new, different, innovative, and simpler formats for putting peo-
  ple in business have come to the forefront, and it is these that I
 want to focus on in this chapter.
       Could You Get Rich Selling a
          Business in a Box?
   Consider my clients and friends, Len and Sandy Shykind,
  their company, U.S. Gold Chain Manufacturing, and its main
  business, ‘‘Gold By The Inch.’’ An inveterate entrepreneur, Len
 Shykind had been in over twenty different businesses, some
 modestly successful, some gut-wrenching disappointments, when
 he got the idea for Gold By The Inch. The idea is a simple one:
 Display gold chain in different patterns on spools, uncut; let the
 customer choose the pattern; cut the chain to the exact length
  for her wrist, neck, or ankle; and then add the hoop ring and
 clasp, providing made-to-order jewelry instantly, on the spot.
 The first Gold By The Inch display was a clunky, homemade
  unit, which Len and Sandy, kids in tow, schlepped out to swap
 meets and to a location in front of a buddy’s gift shop to test

   Inch. And, incidentally, the markup in this product category is
   enormous. Comparable chains in jewelry, department, and even
   discount stores typically carry markups of fifteen to twenty
   times, so Gold By The Inch Dealers mark their products up eight
    to ten times (800 to 1,000 percent) and still offer customers
   bargains! With $40,000 in sales and nearly $30,000 in profits in
    six months from a part-time business, Len and Sandy realized
   they had a duplicatable, marketable business opportunity that
   other people would be thrilled to have access to.
        From a Tabletop in a Swap Meet to a
           Growing, Global Business
     Eleven years later, Len’s company, U.S. Gold, has started
   nearly 10,000 Gold By The Inch distributors in business through-
   out the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, England,
   Africa, Arabia, Greece, and Japan. Most have part-time or spare-
   time businesses. Many take their portable business to swap
   meets, fairs, and bazaars, some sublet space from host stores in
   malls and shopping centers, and a few operate kiosks or carts.
    All together, U.S. Gold distributors sold over $25 million at re-
    tail in 1994,
     The product line has expanded to include a wide variety of
   rings manufactured in U.S. Gold’s own factory, even imported
    pearls, but still the entire ‘‘jewelry store’’ requires only a table-
   top of space and relies on the shiny, beckoning spools of gold
   chain to attract customers. People can get started in the business
    for as little as $399, although the average new Dealer starts with
   about $1,000 worth of inventory at cost. It’s not uncommon for
    a Dealer to turn that entire inventory over in just a couple of
   weekends, and be back for more.

   The fortune that Len has made in just ten years is largely
 thanks to the appealing simplicity of this business. Len says that
 the key to the success of his business could be copied by many
 others. “People understand the product, its appeal, and how the
 business works instantly. It’s easy to do and the product just
 about sells itself, so just about anybody can see themselves doing
 it successfully. And the high markup means that only a few sales
 a day can still put a couple hundred dollars—maybe $30 or $40
 an hour—into the Dealer’s pocket.’’ Len created a successful
 business-in-a-box anybody can do, anywhere, anytime.
    How Television Created Quantum-Leap Growth
              for U.S. Gold
   For years, U.S. Gold recruited almost all of its new distrib-
 utors from advertisements in national magazines like Money-
 making Opportunities, Income Opportunities, and Entrepreneur,
 but the company’s big breakthrough came with its first TV in-
 fomercial. With a simply and inexpensively made half-hour TV
 program describing Gold By The Inch, with interviews with Len,
 Sandy, successful Dealers, and industry experts, the number of
 people requesting information about getting into the Gold By
 The Inch business skyrocketed, and the advertising costs of at-
 tracting those people actually dropped. The infomercial I pro-
 duced for U.S. Gold has now set a record as the longest
 continuously airing lead generation infomercial for a business
 opportunity. It has aired almost every week on national cable
 networks like Discovery and The Family Channel and hundreds
 of local stations in cities and towns throughout the United States
 for over five years.
   At the time that we put together and started airing this in-
 fomercial, there were no other lead generation infomercials of
 its kind. We pioneered a new approach, since copied successfully
 by others. The infomercial has been directly responsible for mil-

```

-----

```
    for the company and its jewelry. The infomercial was even spot-
    ted by an executive at the huge MGM Grand Hotel and Theme
   Park in Las Vegas, which has led to the first Gold By The Inch
   permanent location store, The Gold Mine, in the MGM Grand
   Theme Park. The store is managed by Len and Sandy’s son, who
   worked his way through college selling Gold By The Inch at
   swap meets. His store should easily sell more than $500,000 of
   Gold By The Inch in its first year.
     The Booming Business of Business Start-up
            Boot Camps
     As the prices of franchises climbed out of many people’s
    reach, a number of entrepreneurs came forward to fill that gap
   with business start-up seminars, often marketed as ‘‘boot camps.”’
    Essentially, the participant receives the same training and edu-
    cation he would get if buying a franchise, usually in a five- to
   seven-day crash course, but then he is turned loose to start his
   own independent business based on what he has learned. He’s
   provided with a system of doing business, but no continuing
   parent-company relationship.
     One of the pioneers and leaders in this field is Laurence J.
    Pino, an attorney by training, an entrepreneur by experience, and,
    in recent years, a teacher by preference. Over a twenty-year pe-
    riod, Larry started and operated thirty-five different businesses,
    created and marketed The Desktop Lawyer software program,
   and has spoken to over 300,000 people in seminars in 125 dif-
    ferent cities. Along the way, he founded The Open University,
   based in Orlando, Florida, a stone’s throw from one of the ul-
    timate monuments to entrepreneurial guts and glory: Disney
   World and Epcot.
     The Open University currently sponsors start-up boot camps
    for two different types of white-collar businesses: the mortgage
    aftermarket business, discounting, buying, and brokering real es-
    tate mortgages, and the commercial

```

-----

```
 specialized lenders and investors who buy or lend against re-
 ceivables. ;
   Each boot camp lasts a full week, and costs about $7,000 per
 person—a fat price for a seminar, but a cheap price for being
 put into a business. The camps are all conducted in Orlando by
 a team of Open University instructors, outside speakers who are
 successful in the businesses being taught, Larry Pino himself,
 and supplemented with reference manuals, audiocassettes, and
 videotapes.
   Most students learn about the two business opportunities by
 attending free or low-cost preview seminars put on in fifty to
 seventy cities a year by a traveling team of Open University
 instructors and enrollment representatives. In Orlando, there’s a
 team of “‘student counselors’? who talk with potential but un-
 convinced students by phone, answer their questions, help them
 with financing, and, overall, are responsible for two-thirds of the
 enrollment activity.
    “‘T decided to use my experience and contacts to find and
 select only the most exciting, unusual, little-known, and excep-
 tionally profitable home-based businesses,’ Larry explains,
 “and then assemble formal, standardized, quality training in
 every detail of starting and operating that business, on par with
 a mini-MBA and with a franchise. American colleges and uni-
 versities provide very good information, but it’s not always prac-
 tical or clear how to use it in a practical way in the real world.
 When I thought about forming a comparable institution of higher
 education, I wanted to make sure it would teach people how to
 become successful in their lives, and be accessible to just about
 anybody. That’s what we’ve done.”’
   Essentially, The Open University has two different, proven
 A-to-Z businesses that it has made easily learnable and dupli-
 catable by most people, and that is the asset they leverage, to
 the tune of millions of dollars a year. Larry Pino is certainly not
 alone in this approach. A quick flip through all the advertising
 in a current issue of Entrepreneur magazine, for example, will
 reveal over fifty different companies using this same nonfran-

     Network Marketing Is Another Way to Profit
        from the Power of Duplication
     The granddaddy of this often misunderstood, sometimes
   mocked, but nonetheless giant industry is the Amway Corpora-
    tion. Started in 1959 by two boyhood friends, Rich DeVos and
    Jay Van Andel, with a single product, an all-purpose cleaning
    liquid, the Amway Corporation has grown into a billion-dollar-
    a-year empire distributing hundreds of its own products; a sec-
    ondary catalog of brand-name merchandise, including clothing
    and appliances; MCI discount long-distance; and other services
    through a network of independent, mostly spare-time distributors
    radiating from the small-town home base of Ada, Michigan, to
    literally every nook and cranny of the world. In the process, it
    has endured a lengthy battle with the Federal Trade Commission
    over representations of its compensation plan and earnings prom-
    ises made to would-be distributors, and ultimately become the
    standard of stability and integrity for a very volatile industry. It
    has also made its founders, along with many distributors, very,
    very rich. A few years ago, at the beginning of his retirement
    from Amway, Rich DeVos cheerfully plunked down the price to
    buy the NBA team the Orlando Magic without blinking an eye.
    But it’s instructive to look underneath all this to the very foun-
    dation of Amway’s success through duplication.
     The Amway empire is based on a few profoundly basic
    premises. First, simple products anybody can understand, use
    personally, tell friends about, and easily demonstrate and that,
    in many cases, everybody uses, so the distributor need not
    ask a customer to buy something new, revolutionary, or unnec-
    essary, only to switch sources for products already regularly pur-
    chased and consumed. This made the retail side of the business

 of sales aptitude.
   Second, the adherence, almost exclusively, to word-of-mouth
 marketing, so that the monies customarily spent by household
 products, cosmetics, food, and service corporations on expensive
 mass media advertising could be redirected and used to gener-
 ously compensate the independent distributors.
   Third, the idea that each distributor would earn some money
 from selling products to consumers at retail, but make the big
 money through duplication, by showing another person how to
 get into the business, sell products, and duplicate all over again.
 Amway calls this process ‘‘sponsoring,’’ because it has many
 similarities to sponsoring someone in a 12-step recovery pro-
 gram, fraternal club, or association. A relatively complex struc-
 ture of ‘‘overrides,’’ tracked by a massive computer system,
 provides each distributor with compensation based on the activ-
 ity of each person he personally sponsors, and each person those
people sponsor, virtually ad infinitum. The idea is that each dis-
 tributor learns a set of simple skills, then duplicates those skills
 in each person he sponsors. When such a structure is subverted
 in one way or another, most commonly with a practice called
 ‘‘inventory loading,’’ it crosses the legal line from legitimate
 network marketing to an illegal pyramid scheme. There are sub-
 tle but important differences.
    How Gary Haiser Married Multilevel
     Marketing to an Offbeat Collection of
          Business Ideas
  There are always new, young, ambitious network-marketing
 companies starting up, but most fail for a variety of reasons. As
 of this writing, of 1,800 known network-marketing companies in
 America, fewer than 20 have survived for five years or longer.
 One of those is led by Gary Haiser, who considers himself a new
 breed of network marketing entrepreneur.

```

-----

```
    pany. His company, Personal Wealth Systems, Inc., is following
    a relatively conservative growth plan, marketing goods, services,
   and monthly dues-driven memberships, all with the stated mis-
    sion of helping ambitious Americans live debt-free. Last year,
    its ninth year in business, PWS’s sales doubled from the previous
    year’s, topping $5 million.
     Gary Haiser’s first career was in the music business, as a
    studio musician in Detroit’s Motown community, playing backup
   drums for some of the biggest names in the music world. While
   working as a studio drummer and playing club gigs, he started
    a home-remodeling business, failed miserably, and wrestled with
    a guilt-inspired drinking problem. As he describes it, ‘‘One
    night, I realized that hanging out in clubs and drinking all night
    long was going to kill me.’’ He sold his drums for $800, and he
    and his wife got out of town.
     Gary sort of stumbled into sales, connecting with Culligan
   Water Softeners, and, on the side, experimenting as an Amway
    distributor. Through those activities, he discovered goal-setting,
   self-improvement, and positive thinking, subjects he speaks
    about enthusiastically to his rapidly growing, nationwide orga-
    nization of PWS distributors.
     Discovering that they had a knack for MLM, Gary and his
    wife joined a fast-growing, new MLM, gave it their all, and in
    a very short time built a very large, profitable business—only to
   have the company go bankrupt. Gary determined that he would
    never again build a business that would always be at risk to
   someone else’s management mistakes. He analyzed everything
    he’d learned from his MLM experiences, and designed his own
    marketing and compensation plan, for the new company, Per-
    sonal Wealth Systems.
     Gary’s main twist was and is annpigis on marketing a col-
    lection of consumer services, discounts, and benefits all linked
    to a monthly magazine, as a subscription, not unlike an auto club
    or travel club membership, but more like a Price Club member-
    ship in that PWS’s members have access to over 200,000 prod-
    ucts. By focusing on the membership concept rather than

```

-----

```
 tomers/members and PWS distributors authorize the company to
 charge their credit cards or debit their checking accounts for a
 fixed amount of dues each and every month, unless they take
 action to drop out. This technique dramatically reduces turnover
 in the ranks, which is the bane of MLM.
   He has also creatively combined direct-marketing media and
 methods with the multilevel business, so that PWS and its dis-
 tributors (sales consultants) recruit additional subscribers and
 consultants with lead generation advertising, direct-mail cam-
 paigns, recorded messages, and audio and video brochures, rather
 than totally relying on face-to-face, person-to-person selling.
 This is the trend in the industry, and Gary is in sync with the
 trend most months, ahead of it now and again.
   I’ve known Gary for a number of years, and watched with
 great interest as he has worked very hard to create a solid, stable
 business in a very fragile, volatile, highly regulated industry.
 What can be learned from Gary’s example?
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #11:
      CREATIVE COMBINING CAN CREATE HUGE
         BUSINESS BREAKTHROUGHS.
   There’s abundant evidence that you do not need:something
 entirely new and revolutionary to make a fortune. In fact, having
 such a thing may be more of a liability than an asset! But there
 is great opportunity in combining the “‘old’’ in new ways.
   Gary Haiser has combined the traditional, highly consumable
 MLM products, such as cleaning compounds, cosmetics, and nu-
 trition, with the types of services customarily associated with
 union, association, or club memberships, such as a credit union
 and low-interest loans, health and dental insurance, long-distance
 telephone savings, and travel discounts, and put it all under one
 umbrella: the Personal Wealth Systems Savings Network. Then
 he has combined a very common, proven direct-marketing in-
 dustry strategy, the continuity program, with the membership, as
 a means of reducing turnover and creating predictable incomes

    forbid programs,”’ are used in direct marketing for book clubs,
    record clubs, movie clubs, recipe clubs, etc., where the customer
    enrolls for an automatic monthly shipment of goods and an au-
   tomatic monthly charge.) Then he combined direct-marketing,
   mail-order, and even high-tech advertising methods with
   person-to-person selling. And he combined high-quality self-
   improvement, sales training, and even financial-planning training
   and services with his business opportunity to support the theme
   of his pitch to distributors: Use PWS as a vehicle to get out of
    debt and stay out of debt while still living well.
     And all that’s a lot of combining!
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #18:
        CONSIDER PRIORITIES OTHER THAN THE
           FASTEST-POSSIBLE GROWTH.
     Some years ago, I watched several friends destroy their very
   young, explosively growing MLM company from the inside out.
   Their growth was so massive and uncontrolled that they couldn’t
    fill orders, so products were constantly on back order; they
   couldn’t get all the incoming data into the computers, so bonus
   checks were late; and they couldn’t properly communicate with
   and enforce policies in the field, so overzealous and, in some
    cases, unscrupulous distributors were lying, cheating, and abort-
   ing the business’s system at will.
     This is only one of many times that I’ve seen growth tum
    negative. Gary Haiser’s seen the same things, and has very de-
    liberately insisted on conservative growth for PWS. Over the
   nine years that PWS has been in business, he has kept a grip on
    the reins of geographic expansion, product-line expansion and
    diversification, and corporate debt, and has stubbornly enforced
    policies, often at the expense of losing talented, productive peo-
    ple. My bet is that the long-term survival and stability of his
   company will prove his approach right.
    When a business sacrifices product or service quality, financial
    controls, or integrity in favor of growth, it mortgages its future for

```

```
   Gary Haiser certainly sees PWS as ‘‘another Amway’’ and
 more, as a multibillion-dollar business, not just a multimillion-
 dollar business. In fact, he’ll tell anybody who’ll listen that he’s
 becoming ‘‘the Sam Walton of network marketing.’’ You might
 be tempted to laugh at the idea of this funny little company beating
 Wal-Mart’s $40 billion+ annual revenues. But don’t laugh too
 loud. The ranks of the millionaire entrepreneurs are full of people
 who’ ve been loudly and widely ridiculed for their big ideas, when
 they had nothing but big ideas. There seems to be a certain extra
 power or energy that comes from having very big goals.
     Instead of Starting a Network-Marketing
        Company, Supply One!
   Another way to reap profits generated by the unique dupli-
 cation and multiplication of network marketing is as a supplier
 to one or more of these companies. In any given month, one-
 fourth to one-half of all new MCI residential customers come
 through Amway, so you can bet that MCI is very, very happy
 to be supplying Amway.
   On a smaller scale, my client Eagle International Institute is
 a publisher of time-management courses, diaries, and systems.
 The Eagle Day Planner generates huge revenues as a supplier to
 several network-marketing companies. In its ‘‘regular life,’’ Ea-
 gle competes head-on with products and companies like Day-
 Timers and Franklin, and conducts seminars for and supplies
 major corporations with time-management assistance for their
 employees. And that, itself, has grown into a phenomenally suc-
 cessful business. But in its ‘‘other life,’’ Eagle private-labels and
 customizes its time-management materials and Day Planners for
 several different network-marketing companies, which, in turn,
 sell them to and. through their proliferating distributor networks.
   ‘‘The multiplication effect is staggering,’’ Mark Colosi, the
 founder of Eagle International, told me, “‘because, in a multilevel

```

-----

```
    every distributor seen carrying around and using the Day Planner
    automatically influences other distributors to get and use the
    Planners. There’s a snowball effect. The more who show up at
    a meeting with their Planners, the less comfortable those without
    Planners become. Soon, everybody’s just got to have one.”’
       How Will the Market for Business
       ‘Opportunities Stand Up in the Future?
      If you have some kind of a business or moneymaking system
    you duplicate, or you supply someone who does, you can count
    on a continuing boom, with no end in sight. There are forces at
    work, many irreversible, literally flooding the market with people
   who must choose from self-employment options: buy a going
    business, start from scratch, buy a franchise, buy a distributor-
    ship, join a network marketing company, or enroll in a boot
   camp or similar training program.
     Think about mid-level executives, for example. American
    corporations are in a downsizing mode, squeezing layers of mid-
    dle management out, streamlining their bureaucracies, and, in the
    process, eliminating awesome numbers of jobs. So we have a
    fellow forty, forty-five, maybe fifty years of age, with twenty
    years or so into a management career, accustomed to éarning
    $50,000 a year, probably considerably more, and his position is
    eliminated. And most companies that might provide him with a
    job are eliminating the same kinds of positions, too. He’s too
    old to go back to school and too young to retire, but the jobs he
   may get offered will be inferior in status and offer considerably
    less income. He is firmly pointed toward self-employment.
     Add the downsizing of the government in general, specifi-
    cally the military, early retirements from government and private
    sectors, women reentering the workplace in droves, technical
    jobs replaced by evermore sophisticated automation, and you
    have a growing hunk of the population firmly directed toward

 part-time, home-based businesses for another cluster of reasons.
 All these trends virtually guarantee that people marketing valid,
 duplicatable opportunities will do very well in the coming years.
       Duplication of Another Kind,
           as a Private Labeler
   Duplication can take many forms. By private-labeling his
 time-management systems for other companies, with their name
 and identity on them instead of his own company’s, Mark Colosi
 takes an asset and duplicates it over and over again, with each
 one potentially as valuable as the original.
      How an Oklahoma Beautician Became a
       Millionaire by Supplying the Multilevel
        and Direct-Marketing Industries
         with Her Home-Grown Aloe
   At age seventy-four, my friend Edna Hennessee runs her
 sprawling cosmetics-manufacturing plant, aloe farm with sixty
 commercial-size greenhouses, and team of chemists, inventors,
 graphic artists, and account executives with an iron hand, a
 mother’s love, and the energy of a teenager. Her multimillion-
 dollar enterprise has had much of its growth fueled by too many
 multilevel companies to remember, some gone, some still
 around, some growing explosively.

 fering home-grown, all-natural aloe from its own farms with
 complete formulation and packaging services all under one roof.

   Oklahoma. After six years of selling Merle Norman cosmetics
    and running a beauty salon, Edna decided she could produce
    better products than she was getting from her suppliers. Edna
    studied everything she could find at the library about chemistry
    and about cosmetics. In 1956 she formulated her first product, a
    face cleanser, in her kitchen, making eight or nine jars’ worth at
    a time in a pan with a handheld blender. Two years later, her
    first line of products—‘‘Youth in a Jar’’ lotions, creams, and
   treatments—was being sold in her own store, by mail, and by a
   few sales agents scattered around the country. Her business’s
    explosive growth started when she switched from using water
   and oil as bases (common in the skin-care business) to using
    aloe as a base, not just a top-off ingredient, Consumers were
    thrilled with the effects of aloe-based products, and it wasn’t
    long before other companies’ executives were finding their way
    to Edna, eager to find out what she knew.
     Edna kept her formulas to herself, and acted quickly to tie
    up as much aloe-plant production as she could. The only way to
    get this self-taught chemist’s formulas, savvy advice, and top-
    quality aloe was to have her produce and package products for
    you. And hundreds of companies, including names you’d know,
    do just that.

         PRIVATE LABELING IS A FANTASTIC WAY
          TO GET MASSIVE DISTRIBUTION FAST,

     Imagine what it must cost to create consumer awareness and

   need famous models and actresses, $25,000-to-$50,000-per-page

    fancy packaging. Could you invest a million before selling your

 private-label it for companies that already have consumer con-
 fidence, advertising, and, most importantly, extensive distribu-
 tion.
 __ Let’s assume you have an incredible new kind of car polish.
 You might package it one way for Wal-Mart, with their name,
 logo, and identity all over it, as ‘‘Sam’s Favorite Polish.’’ But
 you might also package it in a different size and shape container,
 labeled entirely differently for sale through The Sharper Image’s
 catalog as ‘‘Sharper Image Auto Polish.’’ And repackage it for
 a multilevel company.
  Even a writer can use a version of private labeling, combined
 with recycling, to make money. Here’s an example: Some years
 back, I thoroughly researched the subject of raising capital and
 borrowing money for business purposes from public, govern-
 ment, private, conventional, and unconventional sources, and I
 put together an audiocassette course on this subject (The Money
 System); my company has sold thousands of these cassettes, and
 continues to sell them today. I took that same course, altered its
 packaging slightly, and private-labeled it for Hume Publishing,
 for their use as a premium. I took chunks of that course and built
 a smaller audio product that was used by another direct marketer.
 Over about five years, I’ve recycled some or all of that same
 information into six different products, four of them private-
 labeled for other companies.

 of top-quality aloe vera in the country. Edna has the largest aloe
 farms in a ten-state area. But to get to that aloe, you have to go

 tary, exclusive, highly effective product formulations as well as
 expert know-how about how each item should be positioned,
 described, and demonstrated. To get that knowledge and exper-
 tise, you gotta go through Edna!

  HOW TO MAKE YOUR MILLIONS
    IN THE EXCITING WORLD
    OF DIRECT MARKETING
  pes may be nothing more joyous than getting the day’s mail,
     opening envelope after envelope after envelope and taking
   out—no, not bills!—orders with checks and money orders. And
   arriving at your office to find the tray of your fax machine filled
   with orders. And to walk through your office and hear your em-
   ployees on the phone, taking orders. What used to be called
    ‘‘mail-order,’’ the direct-marketing business today is almost
    irresistibly attractive. This is the world I live in the majority of
    the time. I have my own publishing/direct-marketing company,
   I’m a partner in another, and about half my consulting clients
    are in this business.
     In this chapter, I cannot and will not even attempt to teach
   you direct marketing from A to Z, for two reasons. First, such
    a task is herculean; if you choose this as your main path to
    millions, you’ll have to become a dedicated, determined student,
    read dozens of books, go to seminars, join several associations,
    and otherwise immerse yourself in self-education. The second
    reason is that there are aspects of the business I know little about
    and try to stay away from myself, such‘ as the complexities of
    inventory and fulfillment management. Instead, I will zero in on
   only a few, hopefully eye-opening, opportunity-revealing ways
    that fast fortunes are made in direct marketing.

     The One-Page Typewritten Letter That
      Brought in 7 Million Orders and
          Built an Empire
   The company is now twenty years old; it sold to over
 500,000 customers in 1993 and projects almost doubling that for
 1994; it sells its products in thirteen countries—and it all began
 with a single, one-page typed letter that became one of the most-
 mailed sales letters in history.
   In 1970 a young fellow struggling to succeed in mail-order
 after a series of abysmal failures was sitting in a dark house
 (the utilities went unpaid in favor of postage for sales letters).
 With an understandably unhappy wife looking over his shoulder,
 he decided to do the sales letter for his newest idea—a ‘‘family
 crest research report’’—as if his life depended on it. The result
 was a very unprofessional-looking, typed, almost ugly letter, sent
 in a plain, typewriter-addressed envelope with a stamp on it, all
 to give the appearance of a personal letter from someone you
 know.
   To date, an estimated 100 million copies of that letter have
 been mailed, all first class, pulling over 7'/2 million cash orders.
   This letter made Gary Halbert both a millionaire and a living
 legend in the direct-marketing business. And, although he sold
 his interest in the enterprise early in the game, his letter built a
 continuing business that has become the world’s largest marketer
 of family research publications and family crest-related mer-
 chandise: plaques, glassware, sweaters, shirts, and gift items.
 That company, Numa Limited, boasts a combined mailing list
 database of over 200 million people worldwide, organized not
 just by zip code (as all lists are), but uniquely by family surname.
 It’s the only database of its kind.
   Gary’s original partner, Dennis Haslinger, has done a phe-
 nomenal job of expanding the company’s products and services,
 creating strong customer loyalty, and applying very sophisticated
 marketing techniques to sustain this business. Can you hope to

     How Joe Sugarman Discovered a Powerful
       Secret to Success in Direct Marketing
     You probably know Joe Sugarman as the bearded guy on
    television selling Blu-Blockers sunglasses. But Blu-Blockers,
    built from a simple TV infomercial to a multimillion-dollar-a-
    year business, is only the most recent in a decades-long string
    of Joe’s direct-marketing adventures and successes. In 1971 Joe
   Sugarman was the first person ever to attempt selling the then-
    very-new calculator by mail.
     These days, we can buy an electronic calculator at Walgreens
    or Kmart for a few bucks. But maybe you remember when they
    were introduced, bigger, bulkier, and $200 or more. A product
    no one was sure the public would even buy. After all, did people
    really want portable calculators? Would they schlepp them
    around?
      Joe fell in love with this device and believed he could sell it
   by direct mail. He raised $12,000 from a group of friends, or-
    dered some calculators from the Craig Corporation, rented 5,000
    names on ten different lists, wrote his sales letter, prepared an
   accompanying brochure, and launched his direct-mail enterprise.
   The first $240 order arriving in the mail was an exciting event.
    But the rest of the response was not so exciting. When the dust
    settled, Joe had lost half the capital. But then, getting ready to
    deliver the bad news to his investors, Joe Sugarman did some-
    thing that has since become a cornerstone of his success philos-
    ophy: He insisted on learning something from the apparent
    failure. .
     One of the best benefits of direct-response advertising and
    direct mail is that you gain a considerable amount of information
    every time you advertise or mail. Your marketing is your market
    research and vice versa. It is relatively easy and inexpensive to
    test variables: one headline against another, one price against
    another, one media or list against another, and so on. In this
    business, if you have a little staying power and will listen care-
    fully to your market, it will tell you how to succeed. It can be

 marketing is testing.
   Joe went back and looked at the responses from each separate
 list. He discovered that eight of the ten lists had been horrible
 failures, but that two of the eight had worked well. If he had.
 only used those two lists, instead of losing money, he would
 have made a 100 percent profit. In this case, the unsuccessful
 lists were, to Joe, the most logical, likely winners: engineers and
 accountants. The successful lists were made up of corporate pres-
 idents and high-level executives.
   ‘“*When the list broker urged me to test those lists, I thought
 corporate presidents did not have the time to read long sales
 letters and advertising literature. And that the mail would be
 screened by their secretaries. And that they wouldn’t want a cal-
 culator anyway. Certainly an engineer was a better prospect.
 But,’’ Joe admits, “‘I was wrong.”’
   Joe now ‘‘owned’’ a very valuable ‘‘asset’’: He knew what
 type of people would buy calculators by mail.
  Armed with this discovery, and eager to move quickly before
 calculators became commonplace and cheaper as he believed
 they would, Joe marshaled more capital from his investors and
 a new partner, who owned a mailing service, secured lists of
 only the newly defined ideal prospects, and mailed 400,000
 pieces, risking a staggering $100,000. ‘“There were a few anx-
 ious days, as the response started to trickle in,’’ Joe remembers,
 ‘‘but then it started to gush in. More than we could have imag-
 ined. Our home was no longer our home, it was a factory pro-
 cessing calculator orders. We were selling more calculators every
 day than Sears was nationwide.”’
   Joe subsequently made a specialty out of marketing new and
 unusual electronic gadgets, using direct-mail and copy-intensive
 full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal and the airline maga-
 zines. In his JS&A ads he introduced the first liquid crystal
 digital watch, a pocket-sized CB radio—his biggest success, sell-
 ing 250,000 units at $39.95—and the first mass-marketed, easily
 installed home security system in 1977, and employed the very
 first nationwide toll-free 800 number for placing orders in 1973.

```

```
    seeing one or more of the JS&A ads packed with copy.
     Unfortunately, Joe lost his entire business in an expensive,
   much-publicized battle with the Federal Trade Commission. (His
   company failed to ship on a timely basis, thanks to an enormous
   snowstorm that shut down his plant and wiped out his computer
    system.) But, he started over with a new direct-marketing busi-
    ness out of his garage, and began creating winning promotions
    all over again. His fascination with new sunglasses that blocked
    out certain types of ultraviolet rays led to Blu-Blockers, a prod-
    uct that has made Joe a multimillionaire for a second time. Even
    if you wanted to chalk up the JS&A success story to luck, Joe’s
   achievements since then have proved that he employs success
    principles that are timeless and reliable.
     I should add that Joe never finished college, never took a
    course in advertising or creative writing, and, generally speaking,
    had no qualifications for his phenomenal success. This happens
    to be another very appealing aspect of direct marketing: It is an
    industry filled with unqualified successes. You can learn it on
    the run. I never went to college, never took a course in adver-
    tising, and entered the direct marketing field with zero qualifi-
    cations. My client, Greg Renker, now head of a $200 million
    direct-marketing corporation, was doing marketing for a hotel
    and resort, and brought no special qualifications with him to
    direct marketing. Gary Halbert was a door-to-door encyclopedia
    salesman. You can succeed here, too.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #39:
          PROPERLY VALUE INFORMATION,
       ESPECIALLY WHEN GAINED THROUGH FAILURE.
      Failure has a bad rap. While many people are terrorized and
    paralyzed by it, most direct-marketing pros live with it as part
    and parcel of their daily existence; just about everybody in this
    field has more losers than winners to their credit. I can show
    you, for example, eight full-page direct-response ads I developed
    in the course of 1992 and 1993; six are dead-bang, irredeemable

```
 times out of eight, or nearly 80 percent of the time.
  The winners more than make up for the losers economically,
 but of at least equal importance is that each of the six losers has
 immense value to me. I learned from each one. And the infor-
 mation gained from each failure, more often than not, has value
 to future applications far in excess of its cost. You have to view
 your unsuccessful products, ads, sales letters, and promotions as
 investments, not losses, and then take the time and exert the
 energy to extract useful information, so that you get a good re-
 turn on your investment.
    If Joe Sugarman’s $100,000 Gamble Turns
    Your Stomach Sour, There’s a Less Risky
     Way to Get into Direct Marketing
  When I was working on an infomercial about the direct-
 marketing business, featuring Joe Cossman (see chapter 3), I met
 and interviewed many people who had started different direct-
 marketing businesses and mail-order enterprises, many of them
 novices, like Carol Nieman. Carol secured the mail-order rights
 to a product called ‘‘The Calypso Beverage Holder,’’ made by
 a foreign manufacturer—a little doohickey that sticks to a car’s
 dashboard, has a floating disk inside, and keeps your cup level
 regardless of the bumpiness of the road or the quick turns you
 make while driving. Instead of marketing her product direct to
 consumers at her expense and risk, Carol solicited established
 catalog companies to get them to sell the product for her. She
 succeeded in placing the product in just one catalog, and her
 profits for the first three months exceeded $10,400.
  Carol took no risk, paid for no advertising, didn’t even fill
 orders, but she made $10,000 in the direct-marketing business!
 Her story illustrates one of the most tried-and-true, least risky
 paths to profits in this business: providing a winning product to
 established catalog companies.

    in the United States alone. Over 110 million Americans made a
   purchase by mail or phone from a catalog. There are over 10,000
   companies doing all or some of their marketing by publishing
   and mailing catalogs. That group includes everything from 500
    top, well-known catalogs, such as The Sharper Image, Spiegel,
    Lillian Vernon, Herringtons, and Hammacher Schlemmer, to
   thousands of smaller, specialized catalogs serving niche markets,
    such as Bass Pros Shops catalogs or Smith & Hawken gardening
    products catalogs. There is a catalog for just about every busi-
    ness, hobby, recreational activity, or interest. And the two things
    all these catalog companies have in common could make you
    rich.
      How the Catalog Industry Could Make
          Your Million for You
      First, most catalog companies make the majority of their prof-
    its from repeat sales to a core group of loyal, exceptionally re-
    sponsive customers. This is a very important fact for you to
    understand. It creates the need you can fill that could make you
    rich. ,
     Because of this fact, the second thing every catalog company
    has in common is a need to keep coming up with new, interest-
    ing, and different products to rotate in and out of their catalogs
    to keep their customers interested and buying. That means the
    catalog industry’s doors are wide open to you as long as you
    meet relatively simple criteria. In fact, their buyers are eagerly —
    waiting for you to show up!
     When you place your product with catalog companies, their
    established, successful direct-marketing machine goes to work
    for you: Their smart, experienced advertising people rework your
    sales copy; their photographers and graphic artists work on a
    presentation for your product; their capital advertises ‘your prod-
    uct in tens or hundreds of thousands of catalogs; you get en-

```

```
 suppliers are required to put up some money against costs, es-
 pecially if they’re trying out an untested and unproven product.
 But in many cases, the catalog company simply buys products
 from you at a discount, resells them, and bears all the risk and
 expense of doing the selling. That discount will range from 50
 percent to as high as 70 percent. That may sound like a lot until
 you consider that when you market directly to consumers via
 space ads, direct-mail, television, or other means, your costs of
 sale may very well exceed 50 percent and go as high as 70
 percent.
   I have had my books, cassette courses, and other products
 sold for me in a number of top business product catalogs, in-
 cluding Day-Timers, Caddylak Systems, Nightingale-Conant,
 Sybervision, and the Miles Kimball Business Book, as well as
 lesser-known, specialty catalogs, like National Response Cor-
 poration’s Insider Report. Although this has been a very small
 part of my business, I’d guess that, over the years, I’ve sold at
 least $500,000 worth of my products this way, maybe more.
 Many of my clients extract huge incomes from the catalog in-
 dustry’s sale of their products. The Guthy-Renker Corporation,
 for example, had over $5 million worth of its products, like
 PerfectSmile, sold through catalogs last year.
   So, how do you get your products into catalogs? Obviously,
 you need to be the prime source (the manufacturer, publisher, or
 importer) or have exclusive rights and be able to afford the ec-
 onomics of this type of marketing. You also need to do your
 homework and select the most likely catalogs for your particular
 product. Then you need to prepare a convincing presentation:
 sales copy, examples of ads that have worked, proof that the
 product will sell, articles that have appeared about the product,
 and anything else that might help command the attention of a
 catalog buyer. You can approach catalog companies directly, in
 person, by mail, by phone follow-up, and by exhibiting at trade
 shows, or you can use the services of any of a number of man-
 ufacturers’ agents or brokers specializing in representing prod-
 ucts to catalogers.

```
    through other companies’ credit card statement mailings. There
    are over 60 million credit card holders that can be reached this
    way. Companies that accept this type of advertising include Tex-
    aco, Mobil, and most other oil companies, American Express,
    Diners Club, Discover, most MasterCard and VISA programs,
    and a number of national department and clothing store com-
    panies. Tests are usually done in 50,000 ‘‘chunks.’’ Often, just
    like with catalogs, you can get your product purchased from you
    at wholesale and advertised and resold by this method at no risk
    or cost to you.
      Recently, for example, a StairClimber fitness device has been
    sold with inserts in Marathon Oil credit card statements; Michele
    Easter’s video about saving money on groceries is sold by
    Amoco; how-to-dance videos are sold by Amoco; the Microcrisp
    product seen in TV infomercials is advertised in Montgomery
    Ward statement stuffers; and the ThighMaster has been sold in
    many companies’ statement mailings. The directories and con-
    tacts you need to get your products sold by catalogs, stores, and
    other established distribution channels are listed in chapter 13.
        MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #28: :
        GET OTHERS TO DO YOUR SELLING FOR YOU.
      There’s no law that says you have to risk or invest your own
    money in order to make money. When you own or control a
    promotable product and have publicity for that product, success
    with that product in one medium, and other proof that it is a
    salable product, you have assets just as valuable as money. Oth-
    ers whose main assets are in the distribution category—customer
    databases and relationships, catalogs, and other media—need
    you and your products as much as or more than you need them.

   If You Want to Advertise Your Product Direct
    to the Public, Here’s a Secret That Kills a Lot
        of Novice Direct Marketers
   Take a look at these circulation figures and just imagine what
 could happen if you had a hit with an ad for your product in one
 of these magazines:
    PAOdeTH: MGIUTIEN oo cinco a Rho Cale a 22 million+
   DVR ILOO Tee ae pin a ho Nae ae oy 15 million+
    Better Homes & Gardens............. 8 million+
   PODUIOl SUICNCE Ea Sue Ae es ay 2 million

   MOLOTROMER als EF Mie Re iene 140,000+
     . or how about USA Today?
 nes if just one-tenth of 1 percent of those readers Ongar
 I'll be rich, rich, rich!
   That particular dream has destroyed more fledgling mail-
 order entrepreneurs than I can count in this lifetime. Here’s why:
 How you buy your space and what you pay for your space is at
 least as important as your product, offer, and ad, maybe even
 more important. The dirty little secret here is that the successful,
 repetitive, direct-response advertisers are not paying anywhere
 near list price or retail (‘‘rate card’’) for their advertising space.
 If you do, you'll go broke.
   If you naively call the typical magazine and try to negotiate
 your own advertising placements, you’]] usually, be quoted their
 rate card prices, less discounts ranging from 15 percent for acting
 as your own agency, 2 percent for cash, maybe another 10 per-
 cent if you commit to multiple insertions or a flat ‘‘mail-order

```

-----

```
    But you’re not even close to where you need to be.
      Direct-response advertisers need to get space at 50 percent
    to 70 percent off rate card in order to make money. Many
    publications never make those kind of discounts available
    directly to individual advertisers. Instead, there are quantity
    buyers who negotiate exclusive arrangements with these publica-
    tions, buy all their remnant and standby space and guarantee the
    publication a certain amount of revenue, and, in return, obtain
    discounts as high as 80 percent off rate card. These bulk-
    buying groups are, frankly, the closely guarded secret of direct-
    marketing professionals like myself. We help our clients work
    with these bulk buyers.
     However, you can negotiate your own huge discounts with
    many nonmajor publications, such as trade magazines, special-
    interest magazines, weekly or community newspapers, and as-
    sociation publications. For example, I have one friend (who has
    asked not to be named) with a successful full-page magazine ad
    who targets thirty magazines, sends the ad to all of them along
    with a check for 20 percent of their rate card price for a full
    page, with a letter that basically says:
       Keep this ad and check and if you have unsold space in
       any of your next three issues, run my ad and cash the
       check. If you do not have space available on this basis
       within the next three months or you do not wish to hold
        this ad on a standby basis, please return the uncashed
       check ‘in the enclosed, preaddressed envelope.
      In a typical month he’ll get five or six takers out of the thirty.
    A few more will call him, counteroffer, and negotiate.
      Negotiating media gets easier as you go along, too. If you
    have an ad repeatedly appearing in a magazine, other competitive
    magazines’ representatives or, with small publications, the own-
    ers will seek you out. In such situations, you can often negotiate
    a very good “‘test rate’? on your own. We have magazines, card
    decks, and other media agreeing to test rates 50 percent to 60

 repeatedly in competitive media.
      MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #40:
      SELLING BRILLIANTLY WON’T MAKE YOU
     A MILLION IF YOU’RE NOT BUYING SMART!
  There’s no telling how many people have stepped up and
 tried ads in one media or another, lost money, and given up on
 their ideas when, in truth, their ideas, products, and advertise-
 ments were good enough to generate profits and build a business
 if they weren’t grossly overpaying for their advertising!
  One of the top negotiating experts in the country, Chester
 Karrass, uses this line in his ads: ‘‘In life, you don’t get what
 you deserve—you get what you negotiate.’’ Unfortunately, the
 media business is not unlike the car business, with a multiplicity
 of prices, discount schedules, and confusing terminology all con-
 cealing the bottom-line, rock-bottom, minimum “‘real’’ price. As
 a direct-response advertiser, though, you have an enormous ad-
 vantage in negotiating ad costs: Unlike most of a media’s tra-
 ditional advertisers, you actually know how well your ad works
 in each place. You have precise results. You know what your
 cost of advertising per sale is in Media A vs. Media B. And the
 media people know you know. So you can use this data to say:
 ‘‘This is all we can afford to pay for space in your magazine,
 in order to get the same cost per sale we get with these other
 two magazines.”’
    The Basic Decisions You Need to Make
         If Building a Business
    Through Direct-Response Advertising
  There are several basic, foundational decisions to make if
you’re going to sell products and build a business through direct-
response advertising. First, will you use one-step or multistep
advertising? One-step advertising is the simplest method; Joe

```

-----

```
    step advertising, an ad is placed that usually offers something
    for free. such as a book, report, brochure, video, or catalog; it’s
    usually called a ‘‘lead generation advertisement.’’ Then the sale
    and profit are made by one or more follow-up mailings, plus,
    possibly, outbound telemarketing. This is the approach used by
    NordicTrack, one of the largest direct-response advertisers today.
    Each approach has its own pros and cons, and you should care-
    fully investigate the appropriateness of each to your particular
    product, media, and market. Generally speaking, you’ll have
    more success with lead generation advertising and multistep
    follow-up than one-step advertising, although one-step is obvi-
    ously simpler and, thus, an easier business system to operate.
     A hybrid approach I’ve had considerable good fortune with
    is what I call ‘‘self-liquidating’’ or “‘zero-cost lead generation.’’
   With this method, a very-low-cost item is offered for sale in the
    initial advertising, which is intended only to screen out the
    lowest-quality leads that are always collected with free offers
    and to cover most or all of the ad costs.
     Let me give you a great example of self-liquidating lead gen-
    eration. One company I own an interest in sells a relatively ex-
    pensive home-study course ($600), but it never advertises that
    product. Instead, all the advertising is for a low-priced introduc-
    tory book ($19), which includes both useful information and
    lengthy sales presentation for the product. The book costs about
   $2 to print .and deliver; the $17 ‘‘profit’’ serves only to offset
    all the advertising costs. The company’s real profit is made on
    the sale of the course. —
     Next, you must decide whether you will be front-end or
    back-end oriented—and that has nothing to do with anatomy! It
    is increasingly difficult to make your money on the front end,
    the first sale to the customer. Most people who do make millions
    in direct marketing do so by building long-term relationships
    with customers who buy a number of products from them over
    time. The profits come from what I call TCV, Total Customer
    Value. If you are going to build a business rather than try getting
    rich from one-shot sales, you have to give thought to how you

 you need to strategize beyond the first product and the first sale.
      A Classic Example of a Business Built
      Through Direct-Response Advertising
   I believe that Gerardo Joffee is one of the smartest mail-order
 entrepreneurs ever to openly and generously share his methods
 in a book, How You Too Can Make at Least One Million Dollars
 in the Mail-Order Business, and I urge everybody to buy it. The
 first business Joffee built was Haverhills, which was a household
 name in the 1970s. Haverhills did most of its marketing through
 its own catalogs of kitchen, household, travel, and electronic
 gadgets and unusual products, handpicked by Joffee, and de-
 scribed in clever, interesting copy. Joffee obtained the bulk of
 his customers using the self-liquidating approach to advertising
 I described above. The main product he used was a multipurpose
 knife he named MACK THE KNIFE, offered for just $1 in mag-
 azines such as The New Yorker. His most frequently used ad was
 a tall, thin, one-column ad, with a full-size picture of the knife
 standing up, and this copy run alongside:
         SUPERSTITIOUS?
   In our most compulsive desire to make
   new friends, we had decided to GIVE AWAY a
  whole truckload of MACK THE KNIFE ...a
  masterpiece of Vulcan’s art. At home, in kitchen,
   glove compartment or on a camping trip
   self-appointed experts have nominated
   versatile MACK ‘Knife Of The Year.’ But alas, our
  generous impulse was thwarted by one
   of our superstitious supernumeraries who
   officiously insisted that giving away a knife is
   very bad luck and in order not to kill an
   incipient friendship (and to ward off the evil eye)

```

```
      (although he lists for $4.95 in our catalog) AND—
      that isn’t all. For that same $1 we’ll also send you
      our Color-Full Catalog and a $2 Gift Certificate
      (good for your first purchase). If you think this is
      an unusual offer, you’re right. Better take
     advantage of it before our accountant returns from
      vacation and reads us the Riot Act.
      In the large quantities he purchased, Joffee got these knives
    for thirty-five cents each, and all the costs of handling and ful-
    fillment added another twenty-five cents, giving them a forty-
    cent-per-unit contribution to ad cost. At the time, it was routine
    for that contribution to pay back almost all or all of the costs of
    the advertising, providing them with thousands of new customers
    from each ad with zero acquisition cost. This strategy attracted
    enough customers to build Haverhills in just five years from a
    standing start into a company that Joffee sold to Time, Inc., for
    $1 million (see chapter 11). Of course, the days of the one-dollar
    self-liquidator are dead and gone. We are working with costs
    increased over twenty years since Joffee’s successes. But the
    strategy still works in an endless number of applications.
                           a
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #29:
        ACQUIRE CUSTOMERS FOR FREE ANY TIME,
             ANY WAY, EVERY TIME, |
        [ AND EVERY WAY THAT YOU CAN.
      If you are doing your job right, each customer has a certain
    value beyond the initial sale, so you can afford to invest up to
    the profit of the first sale in order to’acquire the customer. I have
    one client who acquires about one-fourth of his customers with
    a $99 sale. His costs are $55 in advertising and direct-mail
    follow-up to make the sale, $35 for the product, $3 for credit
    card processing, and $1 contribution to overhead, for a total of
    $94. He is only keeping a measly $5. But he’d cheerfully give
    even that up if he had to, because he knows that nearly 50 per-

six months. With that as a known fact, his number-one job is
pouring as many new $99 customers into his funnel as he pos-
sibly can, from any and every source he can find, even if he does
so by giving away the entire $99.
    Is Having Your Own Catalog the Ultimate
    Goal of a Direct-Marketing Business?
  Probably. Most companies begin with the entrepreneur some-
how advertising and promoting just one or two products, then,
as the customers accumulate, he expands the product line, offers
them other, related products, and soon decides to assemble all
of his products into a catalog.
  Richard Thalheimer started The Sharper Image selling only
jogger’s wristwatches and stopwatches. Lillian Vernon started
out advertising monogrammed handbags and totebags in maga-
zines. Ted Nicholas started Enterprise Publishing with his book
How to Form Your Own Corporation Without a Lawyer. And I
could continue this list.
  The lure of having and mailing a catalog is the economy of
scale, compared to mailings on behalf of single products and
offers, and the streamlined simplicity of the business. I put out
my own catalog.each year for exactly these reasons. However, I
want to warn you that they are ‘‘lazy’’ reasons. With his per-
mission, I’m going to quote Gary Halbert, who tells about his
experiences with his first catalogs.
   Many years ago, after Dennis Haslinger and I got our
   family coat-of-arms business cranked up, we decided to
   produce a catalog. It seemed like a good idea. It appeared
   to be a natural. You see, our front end product was an
   8% x 11" piece of parchmentlike paper upon which was
   printed a line drawing of the earliest family crest ever re-
   corded with a particular family name. This ‘‘family name

       coat-of-arms in full, authentic, heraldic colors in a variety
       of products, such as wall plaques, china plates and cups,
       drinking glasses, napkins, stationery, and so forth.
        So off I went into the woods of southern Ohio. All by
       myself. To camp out and create a catalog. I worked and
       worked and it really turned out neat. It featured cute pic-
        tures of my three small sons, billed as product testers,
       and approximately seventy items, most of which could be
       customized with your family crest. The catalog measured
      5% x 11" and was printed on glossy stock in full color.
          After it was finished, I had a bunch of them printed
       up and mailed out and I sat back to wait for the results.
       They sucked. We didn’t even break even. I said to my-
        self, I wonder what would happen if I eliminated all the
       loser products and then mailed a smaller catalog or sim-
       ple brochure? I did analysis [and] found that only three
       of those seventy products were carrying all the weight.
       Everything else was dead meat. Those three products, by
        the way, were all wall plaques. So I designed a simple
       color brochure that featured only those plaques.
        What happened? Actually, it wasn’t very exciting. All
       we did, after mailing those brochures to our customer list,
       was break even. But I was moving in the right direction,
       wasn’t I? So then I took the top-selling wall plaque, had
        a color photo taken of it, and I sent a replica of that
       photo along with a personal style sales letter to our
       customers.
        And we dragged in millions of dollars.
        What all this can teach us about what most catalog
       mailers do wrong is [that] they mail too many catalogs
       and not enough simple letters! When I told Ed Mayer
        [the ‘‘dean’’ of direct mail] about my catalog experience,
       he said that if everybody who now mails catalogs would
       instead build an individual direct-mail promotion around

```

```
   alog should stop. Not at all. What I do think, however, is
    that most catalog mailers should look at their catalogs as
   information-gathering devices.
      Let’s say we’ve got a big catalog mailer who is going
    to push out 3 million catalogs next year. In my opinion,
    this mailer should send, instead, only about 300,000 cata-
    logs. Next, he should analyze his response and then cre-
    ate a sales letter and simple brochure describing each of
    the top sellers from the catalog. Then these should be
   mailed as individual direct-mail promotions at about
   three-week intervals.
  Even though I do not do that in my own business out of lazi-
 ness and a willingness to knowingly trade off a certain amount of
 profits for convenience, my own experience tells me that Gary is
 right. And, although the company he left behind uses catalogs, and
 has made these catalogs perform profitably, it also relies on a solo-
 mailings strategy similar to what Gary just described.
  This means that the catalog is neither the panacea nor the ul-
 timate goal. Instead, it should be viewed as one weapon in a mul-
 tiweapon arsenal, to be used for certain purposes at certain times,
 but not relied on entirely if maximum profit is your objective.
   However, If Anybody Says You Can’t Start a
   New Mail-Order/Catalog Business from the
     Kitchen Table and Succeed Anymore,
      Tell "Em That’s ‘‘for the Birds’’
   In 1990, in the midst of the recession, Peter Deutsch and
 Carol Curtis started Creative Bird Accessories, a catalog com-
 pany serving pet bird enthusiasts. She was a school nurse, and
 he owned a furniture business tied up in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
 But their research had revealed that there were 52 million pet
 birds in the United States, 175,000 subscribers to Bird Talk mag-

```
     to catch bird droppings. In the fall of 1990 they advertised the
    perch for the first time in Bird Talk. The perches sold faster than
    he could make them.
      In 1991 Carol quit her job to work on getting out their first
    catalog: a six-page ‘‘mini’’ mailed to 5,000 names, most of them
    purchasers of the perch. Soon the catalog grew to twenty pages,
    the mailing list to nearly 20,000. In 1994 they hit sales of
    $200,000 a year, still operating out of their home, with very
    restrictive resources. Direct marketing still offers plenty of op-
    portunity for gutsy entrepreneurs to start new businesses from
    scratch and quickly experience substantial success.
      Here Are the Exact Ingredients for a Direct-
       Mail Moneymaking System of Your Own
             Ingredient #1: The Lists
       First, you need a list of prospective customers for your prod-
    uct or offer. In a hierarchy of quality, the very best list is that
    of present and past customers who know you, have purchased
    from you, and have been satisfied, to whom you are now making
     a new offer; next best are people who have taken the initiative
     to demonstrate current interest in what you have to offer by
    responding to your advertising; next best are commercially avail-
     able, rented lists of purchasers of related products; bringing up
     the rear are rented lists of compiled prospects, such as people of
     a certain age, occupation, or financial demographic.
      Even people like me, who make a living writing copy and
    creating direct-marketing materials, will admit that at least half
     the success or failure of a campaign depends on the quality of
     the list—not on our brilliance. I’ll even go further and tell you
     that a poorly written sales letter can get good results if it is
    matched to just the right list. But the greatest sales letter ever
    written could fail if mailed to a very poorly qualified list.

| getting my clients to mail more offers more frequently to their
_ past and present customers.
          Ingredient #2: The Offer
   In direct marketing, the offer usually includes an appealing
 product or products (or service/services), a discount, a premium
 or bonus, a strong guarantee, and an added reason to respond
_ promptly. This is all spelled out as ‘‘you get this . . . and this
 ... and this.’’ To state the obvious: The more attractive the offer
 is, the better.
         Ingredient #3: The Mailing
  Mailings can range from simple postcards and flyers to com-
 plex, costly catalogs. More often than not, I rely on a sales letter
 to present my offer. And beginners to direct-mail selling will do
 well to master the use of the letter before using more complicated
 or expensive materials.
   I’ve written an entire book that reveals and demonstrates my
 twenty-eight-step system for creating an effective sales letter—
 The Ultimate Sales Letter—and I believe that just about anybody
 can follow that system and do well. Without referring to that
 book, though, let me tell you a few of the most important things
 you need to know about sales letters.
  Long letters tremendously outperform brief letters, contrary
 to what most people assume. I often use letters eight to thirty-
 two pages in length. Your letter should be as long as is necessary
 to thoroughly, persuasively tell your story, not written to fit a
 certain predetermined length. The only way a long letter loses is
 if it’s boring. For that reason, your letter should replicate you,
 your personality, your enthusiasm for your product, much the
 way you would personally, conversationally tell a friend about
 it. And there are some simple, reliable formulas taken from

```

```
   Problem, Emotionalize the Problem, Solve the Problem.
     If you’re a rank beginner in creating sales letters, you can
    start your education by studying the sales letters you get. There
    are a number of good books about selling as well as about sales
    letters at your library and local bookstores. And you can hire
   professional copywriters to do your first projects for you, while
   you learn.
     Along with the letter, you may have enclosures. There may
   be a flyer or brochure, a page of user testimonials, a reprint of
    a favorable article about the product, and an order form. Whether
   the order form is separate or incorporated in the letter, it is very
   important. Your order form needs to clearly tell the customer
   what you want him to do and how he is to respond. It should
    also summarize the offer.
     Can You Dial Your Way to a Million Dollars?
     Sophisticated direct marketers are increasingly combining
   outbound telemarketing follow-up with direct mail to dramati-
   cally increase overall response and actually improve the rela-
   tionship with the customer. Although a mailing program itself
   may produce a response of | to 3 percent to as high as 7 to 10
   percent if directed at established customers, it is not unusual for
    a combination mail—telephone call campaign to increase a re-
   sponse of 2 percent to 15 or 18 percent, and a response of 7 to
    10 percent with established customers to 30 to 35 percent.
     I often work with and recommend InfoCision, one of the top
   outbound-telemarketing firms in the country specializing in the
    ‘‘relationship call.’’ This means two things: First, they will not
   do cold outbound telemarketing for any client. There must be
   some relationship already established—at the very least, the per-
    son being called must have responded to some type of ad and
   requested information. Second, they will not use high-pressure
    tactics or otherwise endanger the relationship between the person
   being called and the company they are placing calls for. This is

      How Smart Outbound Telemarketing
        Made a Fast $2!4 Million
       for a Fitness Device Manufacturer
    Maybe you’ ve seen the Easy Glider commercials, infomercial,
   or other advertising. Easy Glider is an inexpensively made aerobic
   ski machine, selling most of the time for just $59.95. The same
   manufacturer makes a much more elaborate, sturdier, enhanced
   version of the same product, called Fit One, that sells for $400.
   The manufacturer realized that their 600,000 Easy Glider purchas-
   ers, because they were fitness buyers, would be prime candidates
   for Fit One.
    With the assistance of the people at InfoCision, a strategy
   was developed to mail literature to the Easy Glider buyers that
   extolled all the virtues of Fit One, and then call them and offer
   them the full $59.95 they paid for the Easy Glider as a trade-in
   discount toward the Fit One. In a very short period of time, this
   strategy generated about $2.5 million in Fit One sales that would
   probably not have been realized any other way.
    How a Carefully Constructed Telemarketing
        Plan Put Sports Sciences in the
          Swing of Things
    Here’s another example of telemarketing intelligently applied,
   courtesy of Steve Pittendrigh and Lisa Mueller at Info-Cision:
   Sports Sciences manufactures and markets The Pro-Swing Sys-
   tem, a computerized golf swing analyzer that uses a light beam
   and sensors to generate corrective feedback. It’s sort of a Dr.
  Spock approach to golf. This doohickey sells for a fat $300,
   and runs off a software program called AccessLinks. A list
   of AccessLink software owners was obtained and a package
   of literature about Pro-Swing was mailed to them. InfoCision

```
   marketers with a genuine interest in the product being offered.
   In this case, they used only those employees who played golf
   and were familiar with computers for this project team. These
   telemarketers could talk the same language as the customers.
     Because most AccessLink owners had purchased the software
    as much for its fun uses as for skill improvement, the tele-
   marketers’ basic script emphasized Pro-Swing’s uses as an inno-
    vative, entertaining, and supersophisticated computer game, not
   just its original purpose as a tool for correcting the golfer’s swing.
     Employing this carefully constructed, telemarketing-driven
   marketing plan, Sports Sciences converted over 5 percent of the
   AccessLink owners to their customers, yielding over $500,000.
   This also gave Sports Sciences an instant database of its own
   customers, which they could communicate with by mail, phone,
    or both, to offer additional products and services.
     New Frontiers in Electronic Direct Marketing
     Some of today’s most interesting and exciting direct-
   marketing opportunities are in TV home shopping, TV infomer-
    cials, radio infomercials, and other ‘‘information superhighway’’
    frontiers. All of these are discussed in the next chapter.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #1:
       DIVERSIFY IN MARKETING, TO FULLY EXPLOIT
            TOTAL CUSTOMER VALUE.
     In the 1990s, largely thanks to the alarmingly high costs of
   acquiring new customers, few direct marketers can lazily rely on
   just one or two methods of selling to and communicating with
    their established customers and their prospective customers. In-
    stead, a diversified approach is necessary, carefully choosing
   from a cafeteria of methods, testing them, and ultimately assem-
   bling them in just the right order for a particular line of products,
   company, and clientele.

  SUPERHIGHWAY TO MILLIONS:
  THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF
 ELECTRONIC DIRECT MARKETING
  ’m in a hotel room in Chicago, after having presented a three-
  hour evening seminar. I doze off and wake up at 1:15 A.M.,
 and channel surf with the remote to see what’s on television. On
  five of the eleven channels available on my TV set, there are
 infomercials. Three of the five are ‘‘mine’’—one I produced for
  a client, and two are owned by a consulting client. I’m getting
 royalties on two of the three. For the last fifteen minutes, I’ve’
 been making money while sleeping.
     The Incredible Power of Television
   Somehow, in the wee hours of the mornings, enough bleary-
 eyed folks set aside their remote controls, pick up the phone,
 and call in and order Victoria Principal’s skin-care products, En-
 trepreneur magazine’s Be Your Own Boss System, which I coau-
 thored, Vanna’s tooth whitener, The Big Green Clean Machine,
 exercise doohickeys, car wax, diet foods, self-improvement
 courses, spray paint for bald heads, and Oriental woks—enough
 to make millionaires of a surprisingly large and growing number
 of entrepreneurs.
  My longtime client the Guthy-Renker Corporation is an in-
 teresting case study for three reasons: (1) its business is driven
 by TV infomercials; (2) it has a sophisticated development of

   make them interesting.
     In 1978 Bill Guthy started an audiocassette product-
   manufacturing company, which initially focused on recording
   conventions and conferences, and products for professional
   speakers. He started out of his apartment, with a combination of
   new and used, bought, borrowed, and begged equipment; a vague
   belief that there would be major growth in spoken-word audio
   products; and a goal of developing the largest company of its
   kind in the audio industry. Today, Cassette Productions Un-
   limited (CPU) has both a West Coast and an East Coast plant
   with state-of-the-art technology; it is the largest company of its
   kind, and the major audio product manufacturer for the entire
   infomercial industry. CPU also owns Audio Renaissance, an au-
   dio publisher of books on tape, poised for growth tied to the
   current expansion of books-on-tape departments in bookstores
   and books-on-tape stores.
     By Paying Close Attention to How His Customers
     Were Selling Their Products, Bill Guthy Spotted a
             New Opportunity
     In the early 1980s, as CPU produced millions of cassettes
   for the earliest infomercials, Bill became interested in the high-
   margin retail end of that pipeline instead of the low-margin man-
   ufacturing end. A cassette he might make twenty cents on by
   manufacturing it for a customer might be sold by that customer
   for $9 to $15, against his cost of less than $1.
     In 1986 Bill acquired the audio rights to Napoleon Hill’s
   classic Think and Grow Rich and his other works. Along the
   way, he met Greg Renker, who was then marketing director for
   the Indian Wells, California, Racquet Club, and discovered that
   Greg shared his fascination with infomercials and his commit-
   ment to Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich! philosophies, and
   had good marketing instincts, useful contacts, and capital to
   bring to the table. Together, they produced the first ‘‘Think and
   Grow Rich’’ infomercial and

```

-----

```
  bringing in over $10 million, which at that time was a big num-
  ber for the infomercial business.
    Neither Bill nor Greg had the slightest experience with TV
  show production or TV advertising, but they had a number of
  other successful infomercials to study and from which to extract
  principles of success, as well as their own ideas about improving
  the appeal and credibility of the infomercial. From the very be-
  ginning, they elevated the image and sophistication of infomer-
  cials. ‘“Think and Grow Rich’’ was the first to use a significant
  celebrity as a host (Fran Tarkenton) and the first to use well-
  known, credible individuals as testimonials, such as Tom Mon-
  aghan, head of Domino’s Pizza; Mary Kay Ash of Mary Kay
  Cosmetics; Wally ‘‘Famous’’ Amos; and Senator Jennings Ran-
  dolph.
    Like most things I do, I got involved in the infomercial busi-
  ness by dumb, happy accident. I met Bill and Greg when I sold
  a company to Cassette Productions Unlimited. Bill then invited —
  me to find a way to rework ‘‘Think and Grow Rich II’’ to bring
  its sales performance up, which I did, and I have been consulting
  with them ever since. (In the case of ‘‘Think and Grow Rich,’’
  I restructured the offer, added premiums costing about $2, and
  raised the selling price by $50. We went on to sell tens of
  thousands of units. I'd guess my tinkering plunked an extra
  $500,000 in Guthy-Renker’s coffers just from the premium cost-
  to-price increase differential. They were hooked on me, and I
  was hooked on television.) Guthy-Renker skyrocketed from a
  $10 million company to a $100 million company in just a few
  years, and is doubling again as I put this book to bed.
   To show you the several different ways you might make
  millions through TV infomercials, I’m going to give you the
  background and current state of the union of the industry, reveal
  more of the Guthy-Renker secrets for success, and take you in-
  side my extensive work in this industry. ©

       and Ronald Reagan Accidentally Combined to
                                  _ Launch the Infomercial Business
      In 1984 President Reagan’s penchant for deregulation
   prompted the Federal Communications Commission to drop its
    limits on the length of commercials, giving networks, broadcast
    stations, and cable stations freedom to sell time in virtually any
    size blocks they chose. In that same year, Ray Lindstrom, a
   Phoenix-based promoter of ‘‘get rich in real estate’’ seminars
    featuring a guru named Paul Simon, was watching seminar at-
    tendance decline while the costs of filling the seminars rose, and
    was looking everywhere for a solution.
         A Million Dollars Made in Two Days
     On a whim, Ray brought a video crew in and taped one of
    the seminars, bought a number of one-hour blocks on two cable
    networks, and literally threw it on the air to see if people would
    watch at home and then call an 800 number to order Simon’s
    cassette course on real estate investing. By today’s standards, the
    infomercial was downright primitive: The speaker at the front of
    the room gave his regular talk, using hand-drawn slides on an
   overhead projector before a small audience in a poorly lit hotel
    room. The first weekend this ugly little production aired, from
    less than $80,000 in media, they sold nearly $1 million worth of
    courses.
     In 1985 Ray and a partner, Nancy Langston, bought nearly
   3,000 hours of cable TV time for a total of about $8 million
    dollars, and produced over $21 million in sales of the Simon
    courses. In its coverage of this phenomenon, The Hollywood Re-
   porter snidely noted that ‘‘the population of real estate million-
    aires didn’t noticeably increase, but Lindstrom and Langston
   became the leading marketers of home study courses. Their suc-
    cess quickly brought imitators.’’ In fact, imitators proliferated

       Populated by Snake Oil Salesmen and
    Assorted Oddballs to a Very Sophisticated Media
       That’s Almost Certainly Here to Stay
   In its early years, the infomercial industry was populated by
 get-rich-quick promoters knocking off Paul Simon and promot-
  ers of very questionable (and often FDA-attacked) health devices
 and potions and cheesy gadgets, mostly hawked by their inven-
  tors and authors, no-name hosts and hostesses, or an occasional
 long-in-the-tooth celebrity, and it all worked almost in spite of
  itself. Media was incredibly cheap; the stations and networks
  _ were slow in recognizing the enormous profits being made by
 these ‘‘weird’’ advertisers, and happy to be paid for time in the
 dead of night rather than paying for programming, usually reruns
 of ten-year-old TV shows nobody wanted to watch anyway. In-
 somniac audiences were fascinated and, according to some in-
 dustry critics, fooled by these new kind of shows. Mostly thanks
 to the cheap media, many people put infomercials on the air,
 made millions of dollars almost overnight from the initial sale
 alone, and treated the entire business like an electronic version
 of the gypsy’s wagon with the snake oil pitchperson.
   Three major forces contributed to substantial, relatively rapid
 change. Beginning about 1989, academic critics, regulatory
 agencies like the FDA and the FTC, and some congressmen be-
 gan holding the infomercial up to scrutiny, and didn’t like what
 they saw. Second, a few sizable companies led by people with
 the vision to see past the fast buck, notably Guthy-Renker, were
 succeeding with higher-quality shows offering higher-quality,
 honestly advertised, and honestly guaranteed products. Third, the
  first big jumps in cost of media time started.
   In 1990 Greg Renker led a group of infomercial CEOs and
 producers in forming and funding The National Infomercial Mar-
 keting Association (NIMA) to both self-regulate the industry and
 to lobby Washington and the media on the infomercial industry’s
 behalf. NIMA has been effective in both jobs.

     Today’s Infomercial Business: An Enormous
      Area of Opportunity, If You’re Careful
     Today, the average infomercial costs no less than $80,000 to
   $250,000 or more to produce and another $15,000 to $30,000 to
    test. Then it is ready to ‘‘roll out’’ and air frequently on a mix
   of national cable, superstations, and area broadcast stations for
   months or even years. I have worked on a number of infomer-
    cials that have generated over $50 million each during their life-
   times. However, both risk and media cost are skyrocketing, and
   media availability is increasingly competitive. Overall, only one
    in sixteen infomercials make money; fifteen die in testing and
    are buried in Tax-Loss Cemetery only a few days to a week after
   completion. The viewing and buying public is harsh in its rejec-
    tion of these “‘losers.”’
     Of course, certain product/topic categories work better than
    others. For example, weight loss, skin care and beauty, kitchen
   gadgets, and moneymaking opportunities have been proven very
    reliable. Products that are preventive in nature, such as crime
   prevention, or those that feature long-term, distant benefits, such
    as information about paying off your mortgage faster or invest-
   ing for retirement, have been tried many times and failed mis-
   erably more often than not. Beyond product selection, those of
    us who do a lot of work creating products, offers, and info-
   mercials have our own lists of factors that try to predict a show’s
   probability of success. Given the right combination of factors, -
   with experts creating the show and smart media buyers, the risk
    falls from 16 to 1 to about 4 to 1.
     More importantly, the way money is made from infomercials
   has changed. Instead of getting rich quickly from the initial sale,
   many infomercials often air at break-even or slightly better than
   break-even as a means of acquiring huge numbers of customers
   rapidly, without acquisition cost, so that profits can be made via
   repeat and subsequent sales, direct mail, outbound telemarketing,
   and other means. The infomercial has shifted from a get-rich
   mechanism to a very attractive means of building a business that

 Grow Rich’’ Guthy-Renker had a megasuccess with the first of
 a series of “‘Personal Power’’ infomercials showcasing motiva-
 tional speaker Tony Robbins, with hosts like Fran Tarkenton and
 actor Martin Sheen. The database of the Personal Power cus-
 tomers became a business in and of itself: Other Tony Robbins
  titles, a continuity or subscription program to ‘‘Power Talk,’’ a
 monthly cassette series, seminars, and more are sold to these
 customers. This taught Guthy-Renker a model for developing a
 vertical business within their company that is the game plan be-
 hind over half of the infomercials they produce today.
   Their Principal Secret skin-care infomercials with actress
 Victoria Principal have provided the biggest and most promising
 of such businesses. Through these infomercials and Victoria’s
 related appearances on the home shopping channel QVC, over
 $75 million in skin-care products have been sold. But the bigger,
 much more profitable business is in perpetuating a relationship
 with those customers. Only six products are sold on television;
 there are over forty products in the entire line, with new ones
 constantly in development. There is a Beauty Club, automatic
 bimonthly shipments of products and product kits, seasonal pro-
 motions, and a catalog.
    It’s important to understand that most mail-order/catalog
 companies have to lose money on acquiring new customers
 through advertising; in essence, they are ‘‘buying’’ their custom-
 ers, so the ability of the infomercial to rapidly plug 100,000,
 200,000, or even 500,000 new customers into a direct-marketing
 business at zero acquisition cost is very appealing. That’s why
 Fingerhut, the largest direct-mail marketer of consumer products
 in America, jumped into the infomercial business in a big way
 in 1992.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #32:
        DEVELOP VERTICAL BUSINESSES
          WITHIN YOUR BUSINESS.
   Guthy-Renker has built their vertical businesses linked to dif-

```

```
   White business, eic., and this is extremely powerful because con-
   sumers relate and bond better with individuals than with cor-
   porate entities. But vertical businesses can be built under product
   brand names, business names, or other identities.
       How You Can Get in the Game—and Win!
      First, you may have a product or collection of products and
   other assets to bring forward that a major infomercial company
    will want so badly, and be unable to easily duplicate, that they’ ll
    take you on much like a publishing company takes on an author:
   They’ll pay you an advance against royalties (sometimes) and a
   royalty on all sales; they’ll pay all the costs of producing, testing,
   and airing a show; and they’ll either develop a negotiated joint
    venture with you on the ‘‘back-end’’ business, the continuing,
   long-term relationship built with the infomercial-generated cus- ©
   tomers, or manage that business in its entirety, too, and pay you
   another royalty.
     The benefits of this can be tremendous. Being adopted by
   such a parent brings expert analysis, strategic planning, script-
   writing and creative talent, ample capital, usually a major celeb-
    rity host, already-in-place 800-number order-taking, credit card
   processing, fulfillment, accounting, management, legal counsel,
   media buyers and media time, and even noninfomercial product
          _ distribution—such as to catalogs, other mail-order venues, home
   shopping channels, and retail stores—all together without a
   dime’s worth of risk on your part. When Guthy-Renker takes on
    a project, for example, there are typically two to three product
   development specialists, one of several top producers and his
    team, an additional scriptwriter, and one or two direct-marketing
   consultants all put to work on its behalf.
     There are negatives. First, just like an author who signs on
    with a publisher, you usually give up all control over the project
    as well as certain exclusive rights to your product. Second, you’ll
   probably receive royalties in a range of 2 to 6 percent of gross;

 from everything else that can be done with the customer acquired
 through the infomercial.
   These no-money-out-of-pocket deals are increasingly diffi-
 cult to get done. Five years ago, infomercial companies were
 begging for products. Now the deal flow going to them is simply
 amazing. And some of the things and people they turn down are
 equally amazing. However, if you have a truly hot product or
 other idea that seems to lend itself to an infomercial, and you
 own or exclusively control it, you may want to try and place it
 with a big infomercial entity on a royalty basis. In 1995 so far,
 I’ve negotiated two such deals for clients, and have three more
 pending. It can be done.
   The second big opportunity is to fund, produce, own, and
 control your own infomercial and the business it can build. There
 are a number of reasons to go the independent route. If you want
 to generate leads rather than directly selling a product on the
 infomercial, if you’ve been rejected by the big guys but believe
 they’re wrong (and they often are), or if the idea of making three
 to four times as much profit is extremely attractive, you may
 want to go independent.
   And, yes, there’s still plenty of room in the marketplace for
 the independent. One of my clients, U.S. Gold (see chapter 6),
 has been airing its independently produced show for five years
 straight and building its business. Another independent I assisted
 made over $60 million in two and a half years. Another info-
 mercial I scripted and helped develop for a major was dropped
 by that company, bought by the inventor of the product sold in
 it, aired independently, and has since done tens of millions of
 dollars in sales and launched extensive mail-order and retail dis-
 tribution of the product. By my best estimates, that show made
 its owner a millionaire in six months.
   Roughly half of all my work in the industry is with inde-
 pendents. As of this writing, I’m handling one project for a large
 international travel conglomerate, another for a start-up entre-
 preneur who has pieced together his capital and, in the grand
 tradition of our free enterprise system, is ‘‘rolling the dice.’’ Jn

    tant to remember that the lion’s share of opportunity and profit
    is in the back-end business. I am constantly counseling clients
    to do an infomercial only if they have a strategy, a product line,
   and an ability to build a continuing business on their customers.
     A third, huge area of opportunity is in getting involved as a
   vendor to the infomercial industry. This industry is a billion-
    dollar consumer of video production and other creative services,
    printing, publishing, packaging, audio and video duplication, pri-
    vate label manufacturing of every imaginable product, in-bound
   and out-bound telemarketing services, premiums, computers and
    software, and on and on. And because so much happens so fast,
    a vendor who is exceptionally service-oriented, can meet tough
    deadlines, and is reliable can capture substantial chunks of busi-
    ness in this industry.
     A fourth area of opportunity is in joint ventures, piggyback
   arrangements, parasite arrangements, and distribution. Every suc-
    cessful ‘‘As Seen on TV’’ product works exceptionally well in
    mail-order catalogs, in inserts in credit card statements and news-
    letters, even in stores. And every successful ‘‘As Seen on TV”’
    generates a database of customers that will be mailed to fre-
    quently, for which additional products are needed.
      In parasite marketing you, the product marketer, capitalize
    on (‘feed on’’) some other successful company’s customer da-
    tabase and resources. This is often done with an endorsed mail-
    ing: The owner of the list sends out a complete direct-mail
   package to his customers that includes a letter of endorsement
    of your product. Piggyback marketing is also parasitical, but a
    costly separate mailing is not done. Instead, literature for your
    product may be added to (piggybacked) with the host company’s
   monthly statements, other mailings, or packages.
     The financial terms of these deals vary and are negotiable.
    In a pure parasite marketing situation, you put up no money. The
    host company not only provides the database but also pays all
    the marketing costs. Joint ventures are more common. In a typ-
    ical joint venture, the host company might provide the database
    and the labor to physically do the mailing, while you would pay

  ness, store, or other type of distribution that should be selling
 some successful ‘As Seen on TV’’ products. Or maybe you have
  a product that won’t work as a lead item in an infomercial, but
 can be sold to all the customers created by a particular infomer-
  cial.
   Incidentally, it’s important not to prejudge the infomercial .
 customer. While most people might guess it’s folks of very mod-
  est means—WNational Enquirer readers and Kmart shoppers—the
  Statistics tell a very different story. Half of the buyers of the
 Personal Power products, for example, come from the top 20
 percent income segment of the population. And industry surveys
 show that infomercial buyers are aware of the sales content of
  the shows, enjoy them, feel better informed by them than by
  other types of advertising, and, of those who buy from them, the
 majority are satisfied and predisposed to buy from another
 infomercial.
    MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #9: BEING ALERT!
   Bill Guthy learned of the opportunity that would make him
  a multimillionaire by being very alert to what was going on in
  his customers’ businesses. 'm always amazed when I talk with
  a manufacturer, printer, or other vendor who can’t describe their
 customers’ businesses. ‘“That company that buys 25,000 books
  a month from you,”’ I asked a printer, ‘‘what do they do?”’
    ‘‘T don’t know,”’ he said. ‘“‘They’re in something having to
 do with mail order.’’ Well, if I were that printer, able to buy
 paper at truckload wholesale prices and print stuff for myself in
 off-hours and slack times at bare-bones cost, and I was supplying
 somebody moving 25,000 books a month, I’d have my curious
 nose stuck right into their business. Wouldn’t you? I hope so.
   Right now, I own half of a business running full-page ads in
  a handful of magazines every month, doing very well, that may
 put as much as an extra $100,000 in my bank account this year
 with almost no effort, all because I paid very close attention to

     | MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #12: ‘‘PLUS-ING,”’
     When they produced the ‘“‘Think and Grow Rich’’ infomer-
    cial, Greg and Bill took what was working repetitively in the
    infomercial business at the time and found a way to use that as
    a foundation, but also to take it up a notch and go it one better.
    People who were closely associated with Walt Disney are the
    first people I heard using the term Plus-ing to describe this, and
    they tell me that Walt emphasized this over and over again: How
    can we take a ‘“‘known,’’ something that works, and then make
    it or do it a notch or two better? He taught that plus-ing defied
   mathematics—it produced multiplied results. And that’s actually
    what he did with Disneyland; he took something that already
    worked and was popular, an amusement park with rides and
    snack vendors, and plus-ed it.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #44:
         DISCOVERING AND USING “FORMULAS.”
      The objective of every savvy marketer and entrepreneur
    ought to be to find a reliable formula for success that can be
    repeated over and over again.
     When Greg and Bill plus-ed the infomercial, they did it with
    three main ingredients: a recognizable, respected celebrity host;
    testimonials from famous people as well as happy customers and
    users of the product; and improved production values, compa-
    rable to ‘‘real’’ television. From the success of ‘‘Think and Grow
    Rich,’’ they were astute enough to recognize that this was a
    formula for success with value beyond the one application. As
    a result, you can see that very same formula applied in the ‘‘Per-

     the Perfect Business with Its Own Infomercial
   In 1989 Peter Herrold bought the small company making The
 Perfect Swing Trainer after practicing with the product took
 twenty strokes off his golf game. The product is a big, bulky
 circle within a circle, constructed of PVC pipe, on a sturdy stand,
 with adjustable rings. It ‘‘forces’’ the person into a perfect swing
 over and over again, so that ‘‘muscle memory”’ is created in the
 “*golf-specific muscle.’’ Find that hard to believe? So did an
 awful lot of golfers, so the company struggled until taking a big
 gamble on television in 1992.
   Peter had reached the conclusion that the product had to be
 demonstrated and dramatized before people would believe in it
 enough to plunk down $400 or $500, so he decided to switch
 his entire advertising budget from magazines and the ad cam-
 paign that was keeping the company in a survival mode into the
 vast unknown of the infomercial world. To keep costs to a bare
 minimum, the company relied on its own understanding of how
  - to sell the Trainer, hired local videotape crews, and produced its
 own infomercial. Peter also hired his own in-house telemarketers
 to handle the optimistically anticipated responses from the info-
 mercial.
   His gamble paid off. The response to the infomercial was
 immediate and dramatic, more than doubling sales from the pre-
 vious year, and providing over 100,000 customers predisposed
 to buy other Perfect Swing products. As I’m completing this
 book, the company is completing production of its new, much-
 improved infomercial and just may double sales all over again,
 thanks to the power of television.

      If You Think Infomercials Are Amazing,
       Wait Until You Hear the Story of the
        Home Shopping Channels!
     Just about everybody knows what a Tupperware party is.
   Picture it: a dozen women gathered in a living room for the
   express purpose of watching various kitchen gadgets and storage
   containers demonstrated so that they can find something to buy.
   Now imagine that same Tupperware party with a captive audi-
   ence of 10 million women in the living room, and you have an
   idea of what a home shopping channel is all about.
     Unlike the infomercial viewer, sitting there with remote con-
    trol in hand, ready to click out the second she’s bored, the home
   shopping channel viewer has set aside her remote control, placed
   the phone in her lap, has her credit card at the ready, and is
   waiting for something to be offered that she can buy. Selling to
    an audience like that is a unique situation.
     Getting your product sold on a channel like QVC or HSN
   can make you a millionaire in a matter of days, weeks, or
   months. These companies have a large amount of their available
   time committed to already proven products being periodically,
   repeatedly presented. They also get many products that flip over
   from successful infomercials. These companies reject 90 percent
   of all products presented to them, and choose from thousands of
   new submissions every week, so breaking through is difficult.
   Most new products are placed with QVC or HSN through a small
   number of professional brokers and brokerage organizations, like
   my own or those listed in chapter 13. But there are other ways
    to break through. For example, early in 1995 QVC conducted a
   highly promoted, open, new-product search tour to a dozen U.S.
    cities, and it was so successful they’re almost certain to do it
    again. Many people got their products sold on QVC by going to
   those advertised events. If you exhibit at trade shows, the home
   shopping channels send buyers to virtually every merchandise
   show held, You can even assemble a package of information

 approach. -
   You enhance your chances of successfully getting your prod-
  uct sold on QVC, HSN, or one of the less-known shopping chan-
 nels if your product is highly demonstratable or visual—after
  all, we are using television here! It should also solve a problem
  or match a need or desire that is universal, because home shop-
 ping channels are mass marketers, who sell to the general public.
 Celebrity spokespersons or endorsers are helpful but not essen-
  tial. Proven success in other direct-response environments, such
  as print ads, catalogs, direct-mail, or TV commercials is also
 helpful but not essential.
    How a Visionary Entrepreneur Built an Entire
     Business Around a Celebrity: The Story Behind
           Joan Rivers Products
   One of the best examples of a home shopping channel-
 created millionaire is my client Mark Kress, founder and presi-
 dent of Joan Rivers Products. You’ve probably seen Joan Rivers
 on the home shopping channel QVC, presenting her jewelry or
 hosting her TV show Can We Shop. And you probably thought
  little about it. But behind those scenes, there’s a fascinating busi-
 ness success story.
   In 1989 a young man by the name of Mark Kress was fired
 from his position as vice president of entertainment marketing
 at a major broadcast network. His firing occurred just one week
 before he was to receive a six-figure commission for new busi-
 ness he had secured. At that moment, he made the decision never
 to work for anyone else again. ‘‘If something was going to get
 my attention sixteen hours a day and keep me up nights wor-
 rying, I was determined to profit from it in a big way,’’ Mark
 says. ‘‘Hey, nobody says your vision has to be poetic!”’
   So, fueled by the new determination to succeed as an entre-
 preneur and accustomed to earning an excellent income that had
 to be replaced, Mark stepped up to the plate in a big, bold way.

    big risks based on those guesses.
    keting in his television. Specifically, he saw home shopping via
    television as the growth industry of the nineties—and, in retro-
    spect, that was a pretty good guess.
     Mark also knew from his experience in the entertainment
    business that the difference between mediocre and extraordinary
    success for a new product or a new business was often a celebrity
    endorsement. Finally, he conceived of a new strategy that would
    have four parts: the right celebrity, that celebrity’s full involve-
    ment and commitment to the business, the right products, and
    marketing via television.
          This Business Was Built Backward!
     Mark then did something very unusual. Instead of first cre-
    ating or assembling products, getting a business going, choos-
    ing marketing methods, and, finally, maybe adding a celebrity
    spokesperson, he chose to get the celebrity first, then create a
    business to fit. Compared to the way most businesses evolve,
    this was a backward approach.
     With this unusual plan in mind, Mark faced his next obsta-
    cles: He didn’t know any celebrities, he did not want to go
    through the usual. bureaucratic dealings with Hollywood agents,
    managers, and lawyers, and he didn’t want the usual insincere,
    for-the-money-only endorsement arrangement. He also didn’t
    have enough capital to launch a business even if he had the right
    celebrity in his pocket. Many might call that combination of
    obstacles insurmountable, but, if there is one theme I’m trying
    very hard to demonstrate in this book, it is that no combination
    of obstacles is insurmountable. If your idea really has merit, and
    you have sufficient determination, you can get past the most
    incredible obstacles.
     Anyway, Mark racked his brain, rummaged through his cor-
    respondence files, talked to his friends, and, finally, he thought
    of a contact—a Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon who had intimate
    relationships with a number of celebrities and their altered ana-

 on the door of this possible opportunity,’’ Mark recalls, ‘‘even
 though it was a long shot. Many people stop short of exhausting
 every possible opportunity. I didn’t. So I called this doctor, con-
 vinced him to meet with me, went and told my story, and got
 him excited about my plan.’’ The doctor arranged meetings for
 Mark with celebrities and the doctor became an investor, pro-
 viding much-needed financial backing. Of the celebrities Mark
 met with, Joan Rivers was the one that stood out as right. And
 Joan bought into the new idea of building an entire marketing
 business around a celebrity.
   Joan Rivers is known for comedy, and for bouncing back
 from very difficult career and tragic personal life circumstances,
 but she is also known for style. She frequently makes media
 “Best Dressed’’ lists, and has an almost obsessive interest in
 fashion. Mark’s research revealed that jewelry was a top-selling
 product category in the home shopping medium. All of that came
 together in the decision to provide home shopping viewers with
 classic, quality jewelry at affordable prices with Joan as the
 line’s on-camera, sincerely enthusiastic spokesperson.
   It’s important to note that, exactly as Mark intended, Joan
 has been much more than just a celebrity spokesperson. I’m for-
 tunate to have Joan Rivers Products, Inc., as one of my clients,
 and I have seen firsthand how thoroughly involved Joan is with
 product selection, jewelry design, and decisions in every aspect
 of the business. The huge success of this enterprise has a great
 deal to do with their working together this way, so she can hon-
 estly talk about her products.
   Joan Rivers Products began in the spare bedroom of Mark’s
 house in Los Angeles. Mark and his wife had to learn the jewelry
 business from the ground up. And they had to risk: Joan invested
 only her persona and her time. So Mark and his wife tapped
 their savings and mortgaged their home to provide their share of
 the capital. They personally guaranteed credit lines. And, in Sep-
 tember 1990, Joan Rivers went on the air, on QVC, for the very
 first time, with thirty jewelry designs to present. No one had any
 idea what would happen.

```

```
   Mark says, ‘‘but more than enough reason to break out the cham-
    pagne that night. QVC had never successfully sold costume jew-
    elry before. There can be only a few things in life sweeter than
    the moment when a nerve-shattering risk like this one pays off
    in such a big way.”’
     Mark and Joan have since sold as much as $6 million worth
    of jewelry in one eight-hour period and, in total, well over
   $100 million worth of jewelry. New products, new catalogs, and
    a new series of self-improvement seminars, books, cassettes,
    and an infomercial are all on the horizon. I’ve been privi-
    leged to work with Joan and Mark on the development of these
    ‘*You Deserve to Be Happy!’” seminars and self-help materials.
    (‘‘You Deserve to Be Happy!’’ is based on Joan’s own experi-
    ences in recovering from grief and adversity, creating career,
    business, and personal breakthroughs, and achieving happiness
    and peace of mind.)
     As I worked with Joan on this new product, it was interesting
    to see that many of the principles for happiness and success that
    she believes in and uses parallel those Mark has used to create
    this business in the first place. For example, Joan tells people to
    ‘*break the rules’’ in order to achieve great things—Mark broke
    a whole book full of rules about how you start a new business.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #36:
        YOU MUST FIND WAYS TO USE THE POWER
           OF TELEVISION. IT IS THE MOST
        POWERFUL FORCE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY.
      It is arguable that no other media have greater influence,
    impact, and power than television. A single appearance on a talk
   show puts an author’s book on the bestseller list. A politician’s
    career is made or destroyed. You cannot ignore the growing
    power of television, so isn’t it incumbent on you to find a way
    to use it to your advantage?

   Now, What About the Really High-Tech
   Opportunities? Information Superhighway or
         Super Hype-Way?
   Publishers and marketers are in a mad scramble to find ways
 to profit from the much-publicized explosion of the so-called
 information superhighway. A considerable amount of advertising
 and direct marketing is being attempted, with varying levels of
 success, via the on-line services, CompuServe, Prodigy, and
 America OnLine. Of even greater interest to the entrepreneurs I
 deal with most is the vast network of independent computer bul-
 letin boards and the enormous linked network of people on the
 Internet. One consultant described this to me as an opportunity
 to do the equivalent of printing and mailing and delivering a
 million sales letters at the push of a button at no cost.
   Quite frankly, it ain’t that simple.
   For example, readers who use computer bulletin boards will
 immediately be familiar with what these folks call “‘flaming.”’
 When someone inappropriately delivers unwanted advertising,
 everybody blasts them back with negative messages, and broad-
 casts their displeasure to other users of that bulletin board or
 service. This is sort of like having a few thousand people you’ ve
 sent sales letters out to all show up on your doorstep as an
 angry mob.
   I confess that I am computer-inept. I grudgingly use one as
 a word processor, and travel with a laptop I use in the same way.
 But I do not have a phone modem, I don’t use any of the on-
 line services, my eyes glaze over at computerspeak, and I have
 to force myself to learn about new opportunities where the com-
 puter stands between me and access. The truth is that I dislike
 computers so much that if we had a gun at home we’d be getting
 new computers at least once a week.
   Fortunately, I have a consulting colleague who is my oppo-
 site in this regard, and who has been making a very detailed
 study of all this for some time. Ken McCarthy spent several

    also a savvy, successful direct marketer, so I trust his opinions.
    I asked him to provide a brief contribution to this book about
    what we are calling ‘‘on-line marketing,’’ and here it is:
       With all the hype surrounding this entire area of opportu-
        nity, getting straight answers isn’t easy, and most of the
       practically accessible marketing opportunities are only
        visible on the horizon, not yet here. But you’ll need time
        to prepare yourself to take advantage of them, so I'll
       make some suggestions about that.
         Everything that is currently available in hard form—
        print, audio, video, and interactive disk—will be available
       on demand through the personal computer. For example,
      _a prospect will be able to dial in and see your demonstra-
        tion video with the same ease they now call an 800 num-
       ber to hear your recorded message. That’s where we’re
      headed.
        There will be instant on-line delivery of advertising,
      much of it on request, of actual purchased information,
       and extensive on-line ordering. I would emphasize that
       those who are going to profit the most from these new
       Opportunities are going to be the people who’ve mastered
       good, old-fashioned selling skills and can translate them
        into any media.
        To prepare and stay in step, there are five things you
       can do right now:
        1. If you don’t already have one, get a personal computer
        and a modem.
       2. Join one or more of the major computer on-line
        services—Prodigy, CompuServe, or America OnLine
       —and begin to familiarize yourself with the on-line
        environment.
        3. Learn how to use E-mail, and start including your
        E-mail address in your ads and business communica-

```

-----

```
     phone, the fax, and ‘‘snail mail’’. for routine messages.
    4. Subscribe to Boardwatch Magazine and seriously con-
      sider attending one BBSCON, the annual gathering of
     computer bulletin board operators. You can learn more
     about the reality of the information highway and make
     more useful contacts by attending this one conference
     than from a year of reading and study.
    5. Above all else, start making friends with the technol-
     ogy and the people who understand it. It’s not neces-
      sary to become a computer expert to profit from new
     technology any more than it is necessary to know how
      to make your own ink to be a successful copywriter,
      but you do have to have reliable people you can work
     with and who will steer you in the right direction.
     What’s the payoff for all this effort?
     Every time a new media has emerged, the marketers
    who figured out how to make it work first enjoyed tre-
    mendous, once-in-a-lifetime, windfall profits. It happened
    with radio. With broadcast television. With cable, info-
    mercials, and TV home shopping. It will happen with
    computer bulletin boards, too.
      It’s already beginning in a few niche markets.
     Take Paolo Pignatelli, for example. He’s the proprie-
    tor of The Corner Store, a company based in Connecticut
    that specializes in selling software. In 1993 he had sales
    of over $1 million without spending a nickel on advertis-
    ing. His method of promotion is simple: He makes him-
   self available to answer software questions on
    CompuServe. He ran his last traditional print ad in 1992
    and has never looked back.

         clever on-line marketing. Using Prodigy as base,
        their ‘‘order it online’’ florist service became the tenth
       largest retailer in the 25,000 FTD system in its first five
       months in business. They now do well over $100,000
       worth of business per week, and have started a second
        business, PC Balloons.
        One of the ways they keep in touch with their cus-
       tomers, by the way, is with a newsletter that offers
       flower-care tips and arrangement suggestions. It’s
       delivered every month electronically—no printing or
       postage costs!
        These pioneer-examples will suggest obvious opportu-
        nities and applications to many people who read this
       chapter. And, by the very nature of a rapidly emerging
       technological environment, we’ll all be behind by the
       time this is published. Entrepreneurs, small business own-
        ers, and big companies will all find many ways to profit
        in these ways. It is here, and it is coming, that’s not open
        to question. The only question is how soon you’ll be
       involved.
      Three of the Best High-Tech Marketing Tools That
              I Do Understand!
      Okay, so I’m behind the times with computers. Ken and
    some of my other friends are dragging me, kicking and scream-
    ing, onto this superhighway thing, so don’t worry about me. In
    the meantime, there are three readily available, semi-high-tech
    marketing tools that I do understand that you should know about:
     1. The simple but incredibly powerful ‘‘free recorded message.”’
     Here’s a marketing insider’s secret: The offer of a free re-
     corded message in an ad or sales letter, either as the means
      of response or an optional means of response, can increase
      response by as much as 500 percent. The theory I have to
      explain this has to do with nonthreatening first contact. Many

   end is going to ‘‘sell ’em.’’ But if that person knows he’s
   calling and getting more information from a recorded mes-
   sage, he’s safe. The free recorded message also allows you,
   in some cases, to run smaller ads—you wait to deliver much
   of your message in the recording, only to those interested
  enough to call and get it, rather than paying money to deliver
   it to everybody.
    There are other advantages, too. Such a message lets you
   deliver your message in a warm, friendly, reassuring voice,
   with enthusiasm and inflection. If you like, the message can
   be recorded in more than one voice, include testimonials, and
   even utilize sound effects. If you use a celebrity in your mar-
   keting, the message could be done in the celebrity’s voice.
   The listener can’t skim; he either listens or he doesn’t. Most
   services handling these calls for you can track and tell you
  how many calls you get, how many hang-ups at one minute,
   at one and a half minutes, at two minutes, etc., so you can
  make adjustments to the length and content of your message.
  The services will take calls to hear your message twenty-four
   hours a day, seven days a week, and they have multiple-line
   capability, so callers do not get busy signals. Most can do
  name and address data capture for you. And it’s all relatively
   inexpensive.
    At the conclusion of such a message, you can refer the
   listener back to calling your regular office number, or you
   can use voice prompts to let him leave his name, address,
  phone, even credit card numbers to order or request literature
   electronically, or you can give the caller the option of in-
   stantly switching from the recording to a live person by push-
   ing a button.
   . Fax-on-demand. Let’s say you have twenty different products,
  each requiring a four-page sales letter. You can create twenty |
  fax-on-demand numbered ‘‘boxes,’’ and put those twenty
   sales letters on file in them. Then anybody with a fax machine
   can call your number, enter the code number for the product
   that interests them, enter their fax number, and instantly re-

     using this as a means of making a variety of technical support
     information available to their customers, conveniently, on de-
     mand. But I believe there will be more and more marketers
      finding ways to use fax-on-demand.
         . Broadcast fax. With broadcast fax, you can OORT have the
     same fax sent and simultaneously delivered to 10 or 10,000
      different fax machines anywhere in the country. However, my
      limited experience warns against using broadcast fax on an
      unsolicited basis. Junk fax is such an annoyance to recipients
      that they often fight back by faxing you 100 blank pages, for
     example, or complaining to regulatory agencies. But if people
     give you their permission, then broadcast fax is fast and ef-
      ficient, and has the impact of delivering by Federal Express
      but costs pennies instead of dollars. For example, a group of
     VIP subscribers to my newsletter have furnished their fax
     numbers and asked to receive special bulletins and offers by
      fax. If I’m putting on a seminar, I can fax the invitational
     brochure to those people.
       Last year, one of my clients had a new product to intro-
     duce to their customers, and they needed some fast cash flow
     with nominal investment. We devised this strategy: A cheap
     one-page sales letter was sent to all the customers, briefly
     describing the benefits of the new product, and offering them
     advance notice and a discount offer by fax, but they had to
      call and ask for it. The response to the mailing was about 3
     percent; the order rate from those then faxed an eight-page
      sales letter was 90 percent!
      I experiment with and use technology, but am careful to
    avoid being seduced by it. The smartest marketers and entrepre-
    neurs wili devote a carefully determined amount of time, energy,
    and money to learning about and testing each new technology-
    driven media and opportunity as it comes along.

 HOW TO PRINT AS MUCH MONEY
   AS YOU WANT, LEGALLY:
  THE INCREDIBLE WEALTH-
   PRODUCING SECRET OF
  INFORMATION PRODUCTS
  here is one type of product that is the perfect product for
  direct marketing and for mail-order. Fortunately, it is a prod-
 uct anybody can learn to create, inexpensively develop, manu-
 facture, control, and exploit.
     I Print My Own Money Every Day
  As you hopefully know, making your own money on the
 copy machine in your office or the printing press at your buddy’s
 quick-print shop is illegal. The U.S. government is pretty firm
 on the idea that they should be the only ones allowed to print
 up more money any time they need some.
  You can, however, do the next best thing, legally: Turn or-
 dinary paper into information products people will pay for. What
 is an information product? It can be a book, like this one, or a
 manual in a three-ring notebook, or a spiral-bound book, or a
 simple report, copied on a photocopier and stapled in the corner.
 Or audiocassettes, videocassettes, software disks, or any com-

```
      All you need to be in this business is information people will
    pay for and access to something as simple as a photocopier.
    These days, personal computers with desktop publishing capa-
    bilities have made the preparation of printed information prod-
    ucts easier than ever, but there’s still a lot of money being made
    with simple products prepared on an ordinary typewriter.
      This is the business I work in the most with my own com-
    panies and with clients. In this chapter, I'll tell you more about
    the types of information products that make fortunes, the mar-
    keting of information products, and introduce you to some re-
    markable successes.
     The diversity of successful information products is amazing.
   Many of these products have to do with hobbies and recreational
    interests. Several years ago, Patti Carlson sold millions of dollars’
    worth of her How to Play Piano Overnight kit via direct-response
    television. Today, Robert Laughlin sells a home-study course,
   How to Play Your Favorite Songs on the Piano in Just 3
   Hours—Without Reading Music or Taking Piano Lessons. 1/00
    Delicious Hawaiian Recipes You Can Easily Make at Home is
    a simple booklet advertised and sold through classified ads in
    tabloids and women’s magazines.
     Many information products are business- and occupation-
    oriented. Joe Sabah has sold thousands of his 104-page booklet
   How to Get the Job You Want and Get Employers to Call You
   by being a guest on radio talk shows (see chapter 10). There are
    three different entrepreneurs I know who successfully sell book-
    lets, plans, and kits on the topic Making Money at Home as a
   PVC Furniture Manufacturer. The least expensive booklet sells
    for $10; the most expensive kit for $150. Hume Publishing Com-
    pany built a huge business selling its Successful Investing course
    as a subscription, using direct mail. Many information products
    focus on health and fitness, privacy protection, travel, beauty and
    fashion, and games and gambling.
     As you can see, the only thing these products have in com-
    mon is that they are information. They deal with very different
    topics and interests, they have different price points, they are
    comprised

   The Incredible Financial Leverage Secret of
        Publishing on Demand’
   I first started to print my own money in earnest in 1978.
 Shortly after I became a professional speaker and joined the Na-
 tional Speakers Association, I discovered that, with my back-
 ground in advertising, marketing, and sales, I knew more about
 how to get bookings and clients than many people who had been
 involved in the speaking business for -years. I created an ugly,
 cheap, homemade four-page catalog of Special Reports on dif-
 ferent topics appealing to my speaking colleagues, with titles
 like:
   How to Find Hidden Markets for Your Speaking Services
   What to Write in a Simple Letter to Get Meeting Plan-
      ners Eagerly Calling You (Never Make a Cold Call
      Again)
   How to (At Least) Double Your Fee Every Time You
     Speak With After-the-Fact, Follow-up Product Sales
    17 Most Common Mistakes Made by Speakers with Their
     Brochures and Demo Tapes—and How to Avoid
     Them
   I can’t even find this old catalog or any of these reports now,
 but as I recall there were about twenty different titles priced from
 $3 to $15 each. Each one was four to no more than twenty
 typewritten pages. And I used what we now call publishing on
 demand; I never printed up any inventory. I had the typewritten
 originals in plastic page protectors and, when an order came in
 for a particular report, I took those originals off the shelf, stuck
 them in the photocopier at the Kwik-Kopy down the street, made

```

```
    with my simple, dirt-cheap catalogs sent out to only about 2,000
    speakers, brought in over $11,000 in about a month. Some or-
    dered one report, most ordered two, three, or four, a few ordered
    ten or even all of them. A report I sold for $3 cost about 40
    cents to photocopy and 20 cents to mail. A big chunk of that
    $11,000 was profit.
      I learned three valuable lessons Fornt that simple, primitive
    experience very early in my career: (1) The value of targeting a
    particular specialized market and creating information products
    of great interest exclusively to those people; (2) that what you
    can charge for information products has virtually no relationship
    to what they cost to make, only to the value of the content to
    the buyer, which means you can build incredibly high markups
    into these products; and (3) that you could make them as needed,
    avoiding tying up even a penny in inventory, so all your avail-
    able financial resources could go into marketing (where, in my
    opinion, they belong).
     Now, I have a confession: today, eighteen years later, my
    (part-time) million-dollar-a-year collection of information prod-
    ucts publishing businesses isn’t a whole lot more sophisticated
    or complicated than my first primitive reports project. In one of
    my businesses, I have twenty different information products,
    ranging from a simple spiral-bound manual (that sells for $69)
    to kits including six to twelve audiocassettes, videotapes, 200 to
    300 pages of written instructions and examples in a three-ring
    notebook, divided into. sections, and separate reports (the kits
     sell for $399). In another business, I publish a monthly business
    newsletter, a monthly travel newsletter in another. And, in a third
    business, I develop information products for sale by other pub-
    lishers. Of all of these products, only a few are manufactured in
    substantial quantities in advance of their sales and warehoused.
    Most are published on demand.
      Consider one of the kits on a very specific topic. Depending
   on what I’m doing and how I’m advertising, in any given month
    we may sell 20 or 30 copies of this particular product; in other
    months we may only sell two or three. I have no interest in tying

```

```
 come in. The masters of the audiocassettes are taken off the shelf
 and, in a tabletop high-speed duplicator, three copies are made,
 then labeled. The originals for all the written materials are put
 through the photocopier and three copies are made. Universal
 notebooks with clear plastic sleeves on the cover, which we can
 use for many of my products, are taken out of inventory and this
 product’s cover is slipped into the sleeve. The parts are then
 assembled and the product is ready to ship. The cost of publish-
 ing on demand this way versus producing hundreds of copies in
 advance and holding them in inventory is only about 15 percent
 higher. This particular product costs me about $20. I could save
 15 percent of that, $3.50, if I produced, say, 300 of these things
 in advance, and tied up $6,000 in inventory for six months to a
 year at a time. To do that with twenty similar products, I'd have
 $120,000, more or less, permanently sunk into inventory, turning
 over sluggishly and slowly. By publishing on demand, I’m able
 to use all that money for marketing, and turn it over every month
 or so.
  This is less important to me today than it was eighteen years
 ago, but for someone starting out, or someone who wants to offer
 a large number of titles to a specialized market, this can make
 all the difference in the world. Too many people make the mis-
 take of investing months, even years, of effort in writing their
 information product, tie up all their money in a garage full of
 beautifully published books or audiocassette programs, and only
 then start wondering: Who will buy them? How will I reach these
 people? Where will the resources come from to do the mar-
 keting?

    foot facility with a refrigerator in the corner, and an office in
   my home, with both a shower and refrigerator just down the hall;
    with nothing more than a phone, answering machine, fax, and
    typewriter; with manufacturing facilities, with a retail storefront,
    with salesforces. Out of all that, I have arrived at several con-
    clusions, for me. They may not all be just right for you, too, but
    they have proved important to me, so here they are:
    1. Many people build businesses that are the antithesis of their
     desired lifestyles, and wind up trapped rather than liberated,
     frustrated rather than joyful, bored rather than creative, and
     often asset rich but cash poor. I have made this very mistake,
     and have spent years extricating myself from the results. I’m
     frequently tempted to make it all over again and have to fight
     the temptation.
    2. Many people feel that they are not really ‘‘in business’’ unless
     and until they surround themselves with the physical trap-
     pings commonly and customarily associated with being in
     business, so they pile up overhead and fixed expenses to the
      detriment, not the facilitation, of achieving their most impor-
      tant goals via the shortest and most direct path.
    3. The more your available financial resources, time resources,
     and energy resources are consumed by managing and taking
     care of and paying for things and employees, the fewer re-
     sources you have to devote to efforts that clearly and directly
      create sales, revenue, profits, and customers, and, secondarily,
      the less money you can extract from your business for your-
      self and your family. Generally, the more of your resources
     you liberate from things and employees and invest in pro-
     ductive advertising, marketing, promotion, and sales, the
     more money you’ll make and the faster you’ll make it.
    4. The development and marketing of information products is a
     business endeavor that lends itself perfectly to avoid items 1
     and 2 above, and to do item 3.

    Can a Big Business Be Built with Simple
   Information Products and Direct Marketing?
      Meet the $200 Million Man!
  My good friend Ted Nicholas started in the publishing busi-
 ness with a simple inspiration. Ted was a hyperactive entrepre-
 neur who started a number of corporations; each time he
 incorporated, he was annoyed by giving the lawyers hundreds of
 dollars just to get a few forms filled in, usually by the lawyer’s
 secretary. It occurred to him that this probably irritated a lot of
 other entrepreneurs, and for some people starting on really tight
 budgets who wanted to protect themselves through incorporation,
 it might even be too costly and stop them in their tracks.
  A little research revealed to Ted that incorporation was ac-
 tually very simple for most small business purposes, and any-
 body could fill out and file the forms. There was no requirement
 that a lawyer do it. Further, he found that there were significant
 tax, privacy, and other advantages from incorporating in Dela-
 ware, regardless of where a person lived and operated his.
 business.
  Ted wrote all this information down and turned it into a very
 simple, straightforward how-to book. He added all the forms
 needed to incorporate in Delaware, one blank set to use and one
 sample set completed as a model. Finally, he added the phone
 numbers and addresses of the incorporation offices and other
 contacts useful for incorporating in Delaware and every other
 state. He turned it into an 82 x 11" 100-page book that cost
 him about a dollar to produce in quantity—although this same
 information could have been put in a number of different for-
 mats. (Today, form-your-own-corporation kits are commonplace,
 sold on computer diskettes, as books or manuals, or just the
 forms in an envelope. But at the time, Ted was plowing new
 ground.)
  Ted titled his book How to Form Your Own Corporation
 Without a Lawyer for Under $50.00, and started promoting it

```

-----

```
    erating out of his living room, Ted went on to sell over 1 million
    copies of this book. In total, he sold over $200 million worth of
    thirteen different business books, manuals in three-ring note-
    books, and reports he wrote, plus a number of other authors’
    products, before selling his company, Enterprise Publishing, to
   Dearborn Press, a New York book publisher, in 1992. You prob-
    ably saw Ted’s full-page ads for How to Form Your Own Cor-
   poration in airline and business magazines.
     Ted has become something of a legend in direct-marketing
    industry circles. He is very much in demand as a lecturer at
    publishing and marketing conferences (including mine), and
    picks and chooses a consulting project now and again, but he
    spends most of his time at his retirement home in Switzerland,
    skiing, enjoying fine wines, traveling a little, writing a little, and
    relaxing a lot. The $200 million man is a very relaxed fellow.
       If You Think Ted Nicholas’s Success Is a
        Fluke You Could Never Duplicate,
            Think Again
     Chase Revel started the business that ultimately became En-
    trepreneur magazine with classified ads, selling ‘‘Insider Re-
    ports’’ revealing the profits made in different types of businesses.
     My client John Mortz earns a high five-figure annual income
    selling his reports, manuals, and courses about making money at
   home with your computer through classified and small display
    ads in a handful of magazines. John doesn’t even have a single
    helper! His customers either mail in their orders or leave their
    orders with credit card information on John’s voice mail. He
    publishes most of his products on demand, and ships from a Mail
    Boxes Etc. In my opinion, John could multiply his business ten
    times almost overnight if he devoted his full attention to it, but
    he enjoys doing consulting work in the computer programming
    field, so his information products business is still spare time.

 single-family homes and apartment complexes during the last
 huge real estate boom in California and Arizona. Then, a dra-
 matic change in interest rates and tax benefits tied to real estate .
yanked the rug right out from under his empire. One month, he
 was riding around in limousines, flying his own plane from city
 to city to buy properties, enjoying a millionaire’s income and
 lifestyle; the next month, his properties were all in foreclosure
 and Ted was fighting to pay the rent on a cheap one-bedroom
 apartment. As a result of his crash, Ted learned a great deal about
 the hidden profits in foreclosures. Ted fought his way back to
 personal wealth by buying, trading, and reselling foreclosure
 properties. Gradually, he arrived at a system for making money
 that he believed anybody could learn and follow, which he wrote
 about in his first self-published book, which he began promoting
 with small ads and by speaking at real estate investment semi-
 nars. To avoid risking his own money, Ted developed unique
 joint-venture promotions with big names in real estate and in-
 vestment training, like Howard Ruff and Robert Allen.
   With virtually no investment of his own money, Ted quickly
 sold tens of thousands of his first book at the stiff price of $89
 each. He expanded his information product line with several
 other books, audiotapes, and a home-study course all on fore-
 closure investing, another set of information products on nego-
 tiation, and, recently, yet another set of information products
 dealing with the how-tos of joint-venture marketing. His lowest
 priced item is $19.95, his highest priced $1,700!
   The impressive success Ted has had with his own informa-
 tion products led him to contacts and working relationships with
 many other experts in this field, myself included, and in 1994
 Ted hosted a three-day information marketers’ conference in Las
 Vegas, with over twenty different speakers—including Ted
 Nicholas and me—over 500 people in attendance at an average
 of $200 each—$100,000 in registration fees—and, yes, he filled
 this conference through joint-venture marketing, without spend-
 ing a cent of his own money.

    without notes, and recalling phone numbers and addresses, facts,
    figures, statistics, even chemical formulas. He created his rep-
    utation through old-fashioned work: going out and giving
    speeches and seminars, at first for small businesses and sales
    groups and then gradually working his way up to large audiences
    and major corporations. Bob developed a number of audiocas-
         . sette information products, including memory-training programs,
    vocabulary-improvement programs, and a course for salespeople,
    How to Create Endless Referrals. As a speaker, Bob sells over
    $500,000 a year of his information products personally. And his
    success with that method of marketing enabled me to obtain a
    contract for him with the Guthy-Renker Corporation, for his own
    TV infomercial.
     From my own client base alone, I could give you dozens
    more examples, and I know of hundreds. But here’s how to
    prove to yourself that you can do it, too: Pick up just about any
    magazine, and take note of everything from the classified ads to
    the large, full-page ads either directly selling an information
    product or offering free literature. Check issues of those same
    magazines at the library that are six months, a year, even years
    old—and you’ll be able to find many of those same ads. Pick
    out'a few dozen and answer them, and study the sales letters,
    literature, and information products you receive. You will soon
    see patterns that you or anybody could follow to achieve success
    in this field. Basically, if you know something that will be of
    interest to a certain group of people, and those people can be
     efficiently reached, you have the basis for this kind of business.
      For Every Success I Tell You About, I Can
        Also Tell You About 100 Failures
      Quite frankly, making a million selling information isn’t as
    easy as I’ve probably made it sound so far. Oh, everything I’ve

 titles, well, the variables that have to be sorted out, tried, tested,
 and fit together to market each different information product prof-
 itably are almost endless.
  Ted Nicholas figures that only six out of fifteen of his ad-
 vertising campaigns for his information products have worked;
 nine out of every fifteen have failed. Gary Halbert says, ‘‘There’s
 probably no human alive who knows more about making mag-
 azine advertisements pay off than Ted Nicholas.’’ And I would
 agree. Yet, he fails nine out of fifteen times. What does that tell
 you?
  Sometimes you hit the home run at your very first at bat.
 Recently, a partner and I created a brand-new information prod-
 uct, a new, untested full-page ad, ran the ad in several magazines,
 and had an instant, huge success—pulling almost three times ad
 cost with the product being sold in the ad, plus about 20 percent
 of those customers turned right around and bought our much-
 higher-priced, even-more-profitable information product. The
 numbers are still holding up, and this little business is on track
 to produce about $500,000 this year. Several months before this,
 for a client with a new, unusual information product, I had cre-
 ated a full-page ad that hit right out of the gate and now runs in
 about twenty different magazines a month to the tune of over
 $100,000 a month in advertising investment.
   But, like Ted, I’ll confess that more of my product ideas flop
 than succeed, more of my ads die than live, more of my info-
 mercials bomb than score, and I’m wrong much more often than
 I’m right. And just about the time I start believing in my own
 genius, I confidently and optimistically give birth to a real
 clinker. Still, I have enough winners to more than make up for
 the losers, and that’s why stepping up to the plate with some
 patience, persistence, and staying power is important in this busi-
 ness. It really is true, in this business, that just one good idea
 can make you rich.

      From $100,000 in Credit Card Debt to a
      $200,000-a-Month Home-Based Business:
     How a Desperate but Determined Young Man
       Turned Failure into Success Virtually
             Overnight
     One of the all-time best success stories in this category that
    I know of is that of Jeff Paul. There’s always a student who
    surpasses the master, and I want to tell you about one of mine
    in detail, because his story includes an ideal model for anybody
    starting out in the information products business.
      Jeff had been very successful as a certified financial planner
    at attracting new clients, but, for a collection of reasons I won’t
    bore you with, he left the business and had no desire to return.
    But he knew he possessed valuable, important how-to infor-
    mation other financial planners would kill for. And Jeff was
    obsessed with the idea of creating a home-based mail-order busi-
    ness that would give him privacy, freedom, and a high income
    with minimal hassle. So he put the two together, wrote a mar-
    keting manual for financial planners, and attempted to sell it with
    ads in the trade journals read by financial advisers.
      Unfortunately, he failed miserably.
     Running ads, testing different ideas, fighting to get it right,
    Jeff managed to run up over $100,000 in debt on his credit cards.
    He moved his family in with his wife’s sister and lived in her
    basement. When he and his wife, Peggy, first came to my sem-
    inar, they viewed it as a last-ditch attempt at finding out what
    they were doing wrong before declaring bankruptcy. They
    couldn’t afford to join the other attendees in the restaurant; they
    snuck off to their room and ate peanut butter and crackers.
     Most people, of course, would have given up. You can feel
    free to argue in your own mind whether Jeff is incredibly stub-
    born and persistent or incredibly stupid. The one tiny glimmer
    of hope that had brought them to the seminar was that they were
    doing some business. That month, they had sold $1,090 worth

 (and weren’t) doing, it was obvious to me what needed to be
 done to turn his fledgling business into a winner. Now, I quickly
 want to disclaim genius, brilliance, or wizardry; it was just that
 I had already failed a whole lot more than Jeff had, and had lots
 of unsuccessful ‘experience and a little bit of successful experi-
 ence directly relevant to what he was attempting. So I gave them
 fifteen minutes of advice and sent them home. I’m going to let
 Jeff tell you the rest of the story in his own words:
   I’m writing this little contribution to Dan’s book sitting at
   my kitchen table in my boxer shorts and T-shirt, where I
   have made an average of over $4,000 a day for the last
   two years. That’s right: $4,000 a day. I have achieved the
    fantasy of making a ton of money from a home-based,
    easy, pleasant, information products business.
     Dan has told you that when I was trying to launch my
    business, I literally worked my family right smack into
    the proverbial poorhouse—actually living on a couch in a
    corner of my sister-in-law’s basement. Now here’s the
    unbelievable punch line: In just two years, I leaped from
    that basement to buying a $385,000 house with half
   down, no other debt whatsoever, money in the bank, a
    terrific daily income streaming in, and Peggy and I al-
    most single-handedly run this business.
     After we went home from Dan’s seminar and raced to
   implement the changes he suggested, our income ex-
   ploded like a fireworks display. Here are the numbers, ab-
    solutely verifiable by my bank deposits: in the next
   month, October, we took in $13,400, in November,
    $26,200, in December, [$49,800. ] [In ] [1992 ] [I ][took ] [in ] [over ]
   $1 million and I kept half as pure profit, after all my ex-
    penses. 1993 and 1994 have been even better.
     Let me briefly tell you what we were doing right, and
   what we fixed. First of all, having an information product
    solidly based on my credibility and track record, exclu-
    sively and specifically targeted to an enormous need and

       was trying io sell it in one step, with ads too small to get
        the job done, instead of using a multistep selling system
        that fit with my very limited resources and the nature of
       my product and market.
         I quickly developed a series of marketing steps, be-
       ginning with ads that did nothing more than prompt a
       phone call to a recorded message. I also took my single
       product, a manual, and took it apart, reconfigured it into
        an entire collection of products—manuals, reports, cas-
        settes, and forms. I started over again with an ad that cost
       just $138 and, by the third month, I took in over $50,000
       from just $2,200 of advertising. I’ve since mastered such
        strategies as the ‘‘triple hoop advertising method,’’ and
        ‘‘auto-pilot marketing,’’ and learned how to get two-
        thirds of my profits from continuing relationships and
       additional sales to satisfied customers.
         I became convinced that other people could learn and
        use my model to successfully sell just about any kind of
       information product, so I put it all down in a book titled
      How You Can Make $4,000 a Day, Sitting at Your
       Kitchen Table, in Your Underwear. Peggy hates the title.
       She says it’s bad enough that I do sit around the house in
       my underwear, why tell everybody about it? But I find
        that revealing these things about myself helps people be-
        lieve that they can do what I do. So we’re now selling
       thousands of these books at $29.95 each as a second
       business.
      If you read Jeff's story carefully, you were able to isolate a
    number of elements of a reliable, duplicatable formula for cre-
    ating and selling information products successfully. Let me point
    out a few of the most important ones:
     1. Having a sound basis for your information products. It is
      rarely a good idea to choose a subject area for products just
     because you think it is hot or timely. It is usually a good idea

```

```
    . about, can consid-
  ered an expert in.
  . Having a properly selected target market. Selection of the
  target market is at least half the battle. It needs to be a market
  you can reach easily, efficiently, and affordably; for example,
  if everybody in the target group reads one or two particular
  magazines. It needs to be a ‘‘starving crowd,’’ a market that
  has demonstrated interest in and desire for the kind of infor-
  mation you intend to provide. It needs to be a market that
  has demonstrated responsiveness to direct-response advertis-
  ing. All this requires research, and I’ve suggested methods
  and sources in chapter 13.
   . Having a high enough price point to support necessary ad-
  vertising and marketing efforts. It is very difficult to make a
  profit by direct marketing a $19, $29, $39, or even $49 item
  these days. Personally, I would not undertake a campaign for
  anything priced below $99, and I’d prefer something priced
  higher. Jeff had to dissect his low-priced product, break it up
  into a number of separate products, and then reassemble those
  products into a new offer that had a much higher perceived
  value and commanded a much higher price (without a pro-
  portionately higher manufactured cost).
   . Having a multistep marketing strategy. Jeff has developed
  what he calls ‘‘triple hoop advertising’’: His prospects have
  to take three steps to prove their interest before he aggres-
  sively pursues them—they have to read his ads, call and listen
  to a lengthy recorded message, and record and leave their
  name and address. This describes the front end of his mar-
  keting system. The back end is made up of a timed sequence
  of sales letters and other mailings. While this is obviously
  more complicated than just running a one-step ad that asks
  for the order and makes the sale, this multistep approach is
  also much safer and reliable.
  . Having an auto-pilot orientation. By ‘‘auto-pilot marketing,”’
  Jeff means marketing processes that function by themselves
  without continuing physical labor. For example, collecting
  name and address information from prospects responding to

```

```
      If most of your business is auto-piloted, you have more free-
            - dom and less overhead to worry about. Jeff has really mas-
     ‘tered this business, and there is much to be learned by
     studying every little nuance of his operation. If you would
      like a copy of Jeff’s book, refer to chapter 13.
    6. Having or quickly developing a back-end business. The ma-
      jority of big profits will come from the second, third, fourth,
      fourteenth, and fortieth sale to the same customer (back-end
      business), not from selling one product to one new customer
      after another (front-end business). The big profits are only in
      the back end.
          Exploring New Frontiers in
            Information Products
      As you work. at developing back-end products, you'll be
    pushed into considering every possible media for packaging and
    delivering information. Three that tend to fascinate people the
    most are the much-ballyhooed 900 numbers, software, and
    newsletters.
               900 Nurshers
     You have undoubtedly become aware of 900 numbers, the
    pay-per-call industry. Callers to advertised 900 numbers are
    charged by the minute or the call, at a flat rate, to listen to the
    message or, in some cases, converse live with a person. The
    information product is that recording; there’s nothing to print,
    publish, manufacture, or fulfill. The long-distance carrier (AT&T,
    Sprint, MCI, etc.) and the service bureau that delivers your mes-
    sage for you through its equipment systems (capable of taking
    thousands of simultaneous incoming calls) each take a piece
    of the charges, but the biggest chunk of the charge revenue re-
    verts to you, usually paid to you by the telephone company. The

```

-----

```
AT&T is appealing, isn’t it?
  Unfortunately, the truth is that the overwhelming majority of
successful, profitable uses of 900 numbers is limited to a very small
number of businesses or products you might not want to be in-
volved with, notably featuring hard-core sexual conversation
(phone sex), soft-core conversation (confessions, chat lines, date
lines), gambling tips, and psychic counseling. Once you go beyond
those products, and uses by big nonprofit organizations as a means
of collecting donations, the pickings get pretty slim for legitimate
success stories.
  There are also problems with message and advertising approv-
als from the long-distance carrier, and an even bigger problem with
chargebacks: customers who do not want to pay their bill need only
notify the phone company and they are let off the hook. They are al-
ways right, you are always wrong, and that’s that. And this is a
highly scrutinized, highly regulated business with frequently
changing rules and regulations. Certain demographic groups, no-
tably fifty years of age and older, are very reluctant to call a 900
number. Many companies, hotels, and other places have their
phones blocked so that a call cannot be made to a 900 number. And
all government offices have such phone blocks, the result of Pen-
tagon employees running up huge phone bills calling 1-900-WHIP-
MEE and similar lines. Some media refuse all advertisements
including.a 900 number. So there are a great many obstacles to deal
with. ;
  With all that said, however, there are successes. And enterpris-
ing, creative marketers are continually finding new and different
ways to use 900 numbers profitably, either as a business or as a
means of offsetting advertising costs in acquiring leads or custom-
ers. Infotext magazine (see chapter 13) regularly reports on these
businesses. If you’re interested in what works and what doesn’t,
you should subscribe to Infotext, and review a couple of years of
back issues.
  Personally, I have experimented with 900 numbers for several
different purposes, mostly with unsuccessful results, and, in the
few cases where I experienced success, it was not significant

```

```
    subsidized media. Since advertising is virtually your only ex-
    pense, cutting that to the bone can make 900-number profits even
    from unsatisfactory response. If you are putting out a newsletter
    or magazine, distributing other information products, shipping
    packages, or mailing catalogs in sufficient quantity, add a 900-
    number advertisement with no added cost, or joint venture with
    someone who can provide that media, so that you get to promote
    the line with zero expense, and every call represents profit. Many
    newspapers and magazines at least experiment with, and some
    run ads with, 900 numbers for this reason.
      Another way to profit from 900 numbers (or 800 numbers) is
    by providing tele-services to your established customers. By serv-
    ing established customers only, you minimize the nonpayment
    problems and the costs of advertising and marketing the service.
    You might have a frequently or regularly updated hotline of
    timely information your customers can call. You might hold tele-
    seminars or conference calls/discussions that customers pay to
    dial into and participate in. These can be done through a 900 num-
    ber, at a set charge per minute or per call, billed on their regular
    phone bills, or via an 800 number, where they pay by credit card.
        Information Products for the Computer Age
      Software is an increasingly popular addition to information
    products. Entrepreneur magazine now sells computer diskettes
    with many of its business start-up manuals. Products like legal
    forms kits, business letter collections, and time management sys-
    tems are sold with diskettes or the diskettes are sold alone. My
    client Larry Pino advertises and sells a product called The Desk-
    top Lawyer, which is an entire collection of fill-in-the-blank con-
    tracts, agreements, forms, and form letters, all on diskettes.
      Jeff Paul sells diskettes with the ads, direct-mail letters, and
    other literature he teaches his financial planner—customers to use,
    so they can pull those marketing documents up on their com-
    puters, make minor changes, and create their own literature in-

```
longs on diskette, and will be welcomed in that format by your
customers.
  Diskettes offer markups as good as or better than any other
information product media, by the way. A diskette costing thirty
cents to no more than a dollar to reproduce will sell for $19.95
to $200 or $300, depending on the content, use, and market.
  Most recently, CD-ROM discs are becoming hot information
products. There is a starving market; people with CD-ROM play-
ers are really hungry for more product, and seem to be buying
discs on just about anything and everything. (A CD-ROM disc
all about taking African safaris sold over 30,000 copies!) The
reason there is such a shortage of product in this category is the
barrier to entry. It has cost $100,000 to $200,000 to produce
the master for duplicating these discs. Several entrepreneurs I
know claim to have come up with do-it-yourself production tech-
nology that dramatically reduces that cost and is likely to spur
an explosion of individuals self-publishing in the CD-ROM busi-
ness in the next few years. I’ve included their information in
chapter 13.
    The Information Product That Provides
         Financial Security
  Newsletters are, in my mind, increasingly attractive infor-
mation products. Desktop publishing programs for personal com-
puters and high-speed copying has made the production of
newsletters easy and inexpensive. Including all costs, even post-
age, with a contribution to overhead, you can usually service a
subscriber for $1 to no more than $2 per month; $12 to $24 per
year. Even a low-priced newsletter, say $49 a year, offers as
much as a 400 percent markup. And specialized-topic business
newsletters can command $100 to $200 a year.
  Publishing a newsletter keeps you in constant contact with
your customers, at their expense instead of yours. Newsletters
provide a great venue for self-promotion, advertising other prod-

```

```
    tive, and that’s good discipline. Finally, the newsletter business
    allows you to stack up predictable renewal income, ultimately a
    significant measure of financial security.
     The bad news, and the secret to the newsletter business, is
    that it is very hard to directly sell a newsletter subscription as
    your first transaction with a new customer. Newsletters are best
    sold to established customers who are already satisfied with other
    information you’ve provided to them and are set up to want a
    continuing relationship.
     You might also consider an audio newsletter. The Guthy-
    Renker Corporation has been phenomenally successful selling
    subscriptions to Power Talk, a monthly audio series, to buyers
    of Tony Robbins’s Personal Power Program from their TV in-
    fomercials. Power Talk subscriptions have been sold by direct-
    mail and by outbound telemarketing. Executive Book Summaries
    is a widely advertised, monthly audio series providing condensed
    versions of current bestselling business books for executives who
    don’t have time to read.
     Whether you ‘‘package’’ your information for sale on paper,
    on audiotape, on video, on a diskette, in a newsletter, or even as
    a 900-number recorded message, remember that the fundamen-
    tals of marketing remain the same.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #30:
     CHOOSE DIFFERENT INFORMATION PRODUCT FORMATS
        AND PRICES TO FIT THE TARGET MARKETS,
         THEIR PRICE SENSITIVITIES, THE VALUE
        THEY’LL DERIVE FROM THE INFORMATION,
              AND OTHER FACTORS.
         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #31:
        SELL THE SAME INFORMATION IN A NUMBER
             OF DIFFERENT FORMATS,
          AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PRICES.
     The same basic marketing principles and strategies that I
    teach repetitively are now sold in several books in the $10 to
    $20 price range, in audiocassettes for $99, in complete multi-

  from $295 to $3,495 per person, and expanded on and updated
  in a newsletter at $199. Versions customized to different, very
  specific types of businesses are also sold. The variety in my
  product line welcomes the very casual person, the very serious
  student, the person who wants bare-bones, no-frills information,
  the person who wants to immerse himself in detail, the person
  who needs motivation and encouragement mixed with how-to
  nuts and bolts, the individual entrepreneur, or the corporate CEO.
    Some products that are 90 percent the same are priced quite
  differently, based on their target markets. We sell a marketing
  kit targeted at a high-end, high-income profession for $200 more
  than a very similar generic kit that can be used by any small
  business owner. There is not a $200 difference in the product
   itself. There is a $200 difference in the value the user can easily
  perceive, accept, believe in, and get.
        MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #22:
    REMEMBER THAT WHAT YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED,
      BECAUSE IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE TO YOU,
            IS A REVELATION, A SECRET OF
         IMMENSE VALUE TO SOMEONE
      WHO DOES NOT KNOW OR UNDERSTAND IT.
       DO NOT UNDERVALUE WHAT YOU KNOW.
    I had a client some years ago, an ex-thief, who was a bona
  fide expert in all of the ways that employees in grocery and
  convenience stores steal merchandise and money from their em-
  ployers. His information could easily save a single store owner
  $25,000 in ninety days to a year. When I met him, he was selling
  it all in a little booklet and four audiotapes for $50. When I gave
  him a makeover, that same information yielded two manuals,
  each priced at $29; two six-cassette audio programs with refer-
  ence booklets, $199 each; a video series for employee training,
  $995; and a master course with all that plus interviewing, hiring
  information, materials, and honesty tests for $1,250. In the first
  year, his sales jumped from about $30,000 to $500,000. He was
  grossly undervaluing and poorly packaging his information. Sim-
  ple corrections made a $470,000 difference.

  HOW PUBLICITY AND PROMOTION
  CAN PRODUCE MILLION-DOLLAR
    BUSINESS BREAKTHROUGHS
      ossibly the biggest challenge and most daunting expense for
     most entrepreneurs starting a business is acquiring customers.
     Is it possible to build a business with virtually no investment in
    advertising? Yes, and here’s proof:
      How Hellfire & Damnation Sauce Created
            Heavenly Profits
      ‘If you can’t stand the heat, get out of this catalog!’ That’s
    the warning given by Tim Eidson to his customers. He also
    quotes Mark Twain: ‘‘Part of the secret of success in life is to
     eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside.”’
      In 1989 Tim and Wendy Eidson decided to get into the mail-
    order food business. After discovering that foods known to Tim
    from his Midwest upbringing, like sugar-cured hams and goose-
    berry pies, were already widely sold by mail, their attention
    turned to spices, then to hot things, and that’s where they landed.
    Tim is a hot-foods fanatic and decided to go with his own pas-
    sionate interest in business. The result: the Mo Hotta—Mo Betta
    catalog of foods that ‘‘put sweat on your brow, a tear in your
     eye, and a smile on your face.’’
      With a $15,000 loan from a friend, and Tim’s own ferreting
    out of products, Tim and Wendy got their first catalog produced

  contacts. Incredibly, they pulled a 25 percent response rate. And,
  since its launch, the business has grown at a rate of 300 percent
  a year. Today, the catalog has an annual circulation of 200,000
  and generates nearly $3 million a year in sales.
        But Advertising Failed to Heat Up
         Mo Hotta—Mo Betta’s Sales!
   Tim and Wendy experimented with ads in magazines ranging
  from Cooks to Spy, and with direct-mail to rented lists, but were
  unable to get satisfactory results. Tim told Direct magazine:
  ‘‘We didn’t really start to take off until people started writing
  about us.”’
    Publicity became their one and only method of adding new
  customers. They targeted the food editors of every major news-
  paper in the United States, and began sending them samples of
  items like their Wasabi Chips, a Japanese snack heavy with a
  horseradish-like substance that sets your scalp on fire and drains
  your sinuses. Within a month, articles about the company, the
  catalog, and their products started appearing in newspapers.
  Thanks to clever product names like Hell in a Bottle, Hellfire &
  Damnation Sauce, and Satan’s Revenge, Tim’s offbeat catalog
  copy, and persistent contact with the media, Mo Hotta—Mo Betta
  has continued to generate lots of publicity.
        ‘‘T Love You, You Love Me...”’
    Yes, it’s that beloved-by-kids, occasionally annoying to par-
  ents, and even somewhat controversial giant purple and green
  plush dinosaur singing his trademark song and making millions
  for his creator.
    Sheryl Leach was a typically underpaid schoolteacher on ma-
  ternity leave when she got the idea to create educational videos
  for preschool children that would feature a child’s ‘‘snuggly’’

    ited a traveling dinosaur exhibit and she took note of his unusual
   enthusiasm for the creatures. The result, Barney the Dinosaur, is
    a friendly, happy modification of traditionally terrifying creatures
   made to look like a cuddly stuffed animal infused with life. He
    is a teddy bear in a dinosaur costume.
     The first video, Barney and the Backyard Gang, was pro-
   duced with a limited budget, and Sheryl ignored traditional toy
   manufacturers, trade shows, jobbers, and manufacturers’ reps in
   favor of a unique grass-roots salesforce of mothers of young
    children, dubbed ‘‘Mom Blitzers,’’ to descend on stores with
   enthusiasm, and convince the store owners to stock and display
   the videos.
     The big breakthrough occurred when a Public Television ex-
   ecutive bought one of the tapes for his four-year-old daughter.
   He was astounded by her enthusiasm for the jolly purple crea-
    ture, and put Barney on the air, on PBS, in April 1992, and he
   was an instant hit. Public Television is a unique kind of public-
    ity, by the way. PBS specials have made Covert Bailey into a
   household name in diet and fitness, and supercharged his career
    as a bestselling author. PBS specials made motivational speaker
   Les Brown famous. |
     Barney and Friends quickly became the most watched chil-
    dren’s program on PBS, reaching'a weekly audience of over 14
    million viewers, two-thirds young children, one-third parents.
   Not only was and is all this exposure free, it is actually a busi-
    ness in itself, creating, producing, and providing the weekly pro-
   gramming. And what has it created? A dino-sized fad!
     There are more than 700,000 members in the Barney Fan
   Club. More than 4 million Barney videos, 2 million plush toys,
   and 1 million books have been sold, with no end in sight. Bar-
   ney’s first record album went double platinum. As I was com-
    pleting this book, Barney was appearing ‘‘live’’ in a series of
   twelve sold-out concerts at Radio City Music Hall in New York
    City, NBC-TV was finishing work on a one-hour, prime-time
   Barney special, and Sheryl and her partners were negotiating
   Barney’s first movie deal. A continuing blitz of news releases to
    the media has helped sustain Barney as a hot commodity. One

  news releases. There is value in persistence.
   According to Forbes magazine, Barney ranks in the top forty
  entertainment industry money earners, with an estimated 84 mil-
  lion in the last two years. And even though Barney’s marketplace
 power seems to be finally waning, he has delivered a dino-sized
  fortune to his creator, Sheryl Leach, and her production com-
  pany, The Lyons Group. Sheryl is a millionaire several times
  over.
   The happy creature has even sparked his share of contro-
  versy. Conservative Christian groups accuse Barney of sneaking
  up on kids with ‘‘New Age’’ and liberal political messages. The
  subject has even been debated on the Rush Limbaugh radio
  show! Shery] insists there’s nothing more to Barney than a ‘‘spe-
  cial friend’’ for children, invigorated by their own innocent
  imaginations, sharing universally acceptable ideas like good
  health habits, friendship, self-esteem, and respect for others. And
  none of this controversy hurts Barney in the least. Maybe it
  helps, as his fans rally to his defense. One thing is certain: Bar-
  ney is a moneymaking force to be reckoned with!
   MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #14; BREAK THE RULES.
   To this day, Sheryl is convinced that Barney might have
  gotten lost in the shuffle and been ignored if she had taken the
 conventional approach of trying to place Barney with publishers
  or existent video producers, or sought distribution through es-
  tablished rep organizations. In an interview with the National
 Enquirer, she suggested: ‘‘If it’s a new idea and you have
  limited resources, try an untraditional path. Go through the back
 door instead of the front door. And just never take no for an
 answer.’
      The Power of the Publicity Event
   My friend Gary Halbert, consulting with Tova Borgnine in
 the very early days of her skin-care, cosmetics, and fragrance

           ‘‘unveiling,’’ the invited, at
    a major Los Angeles hotel, advertised with the denial of a secret
    sexual stimulant included in the fragrance’s formula.
         ‘‘Tova Borgnine Swears Under Oath
            That Her New Perfume
              Does Not Contain
           an Illegal Sexual Stimulant!”’
           . screamed the newspaper advertisement’s headline. Thou-
   sands caused a traffic jam and filled the hotel’s ballroom to sam-
   ple the new perfume and hear Tova deny the rumor of the aphro-
   disiac ingredient.
     Another friend and colleague of mine, publicist Raleigh Pin-
    skey, author of the book The Zen of Hype, used the event strategy
    to gain a ton of publicity for the Marilyn Monroe doll. When
   Raleigh was called to discuss the campaign, the toy company
   was only interested in coverage in the toy trade media—a basic
   who-what-where-when-why campaign on the project conception,
   development, and distribution coverage to boost orders at the
   upcoming toy fair. Ms. Pinskey showed them that instead of
   applying their efforts to the trade, they should approach the trade
   from the consumer angle. A back-door approach to the theory
    of supply and demand suggested that by creating a properly or-
    chestrated rush for the doll on the consumer side they not only
   would generate orders from every possible avenue, but also
   might have a textbook legend on their hands.
     Following Raleigh’s advice, the manufacturer held back re-
    lease of the doll, and led with a limited-edition, porcelain version
    outfitted with a real, although midget-sized, fur coat designed
   by a famous furrier, diamond earrings by a famous jeweler, and
    hair and makeup by a famous cosmetic artist to the stars. This
    limited-edition doll was priced at a whopping $5,000.
     The porcelain Marilyn was kept under wraps until a much-
   publicized public unveiling: ‘‘She’’ arrived at New York’s fa-
   mous FAO Schwarz toy store in a Brinks armored car, and was

  look-alikes.
   When the truck arrived, the media was waiting, and they had
  attracted a crowd of curious onlookers. The event made all the
 TV news programs, the cover of the New York Daily News, a
  story in Time magazine, and, of course, all the trade publications
  of the toy, gift, and collectibles industries. The limited edition
  of $5,000 dolls sold out in a week. The regular doll had a suc-
  cessful tenure in toy stores nationwide. And the doll maker made
  a fortune.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #13:
            IT DOESN’T HURT TO BE A
          “CAPTAIN OUTRAGEOUS.”’
   Media mogul Ted Turner was dubbed ‘‘Captain Outrageous’
 by the press some years ago, and he has generated a huge amount
  of publicity by being outrageous. But the all-time queen in this
  category is Madonna. Arguably of little talent other than creating
  publicity by being outrageous, she’s become a multimillionaire.
 Gary Halbert went down this path to promote Tova’s perfume,
  and you can, too.
   How I Deliberately Play at Being a ‘‘Captain
             Outrageous’’
   I applied the outrageousness strategy myself, incorporating a
  ‘‘No B.S.”’ theme into two books and my personal promotion,
 beginning in 1993, with the publication of The Ultimate No B.S.,
 No Holds Barred, Kick Butt, Take No Prisoners, and Make Tons
 of Money Business Success Book. The outrageous length and
 content of the title accomplished several important things. First,
  it got the book displayed face out, cover out (rather than spine
 out) in a number of bookstores, including a national chain. A
 relatively small publisher, like the publisher of my ‘‘No B.S.”’
 books (Self-Counsel Press), has to fight to get its titles stocked

```
    ple were drawn to that title, grabbed the book, and told friends
    about it. Third, it generated considerable publicity, notably in-
    cluding being featured not once but four times in Success mag-
    azine and in Inc. magazine, countless newspapers, trade journals,
    and radio interviews.
     One radio talk show host told me he hadn’t read the book,
    but could ask me five good questions just based on the title. And
    he did: What do you mean by ‘‘No B.S.’’? . . . What do you
    mean by ‘‘no holds barred’? . . . What do you mean by “‘kick
    butt’’? .. . and so on. We had a lively fifteen-minute interview
    and I responded to a number of callers.
     At the American Booksellers Association convention, the
    publisher’s staff wore and gave away buttons reading: ‘‘’'m A
   NO BS Entrepreneur’ or ‘‘I’m A NO BS Manager,’’ and we
    sent those buttons as well as desk placards to media contacts.
     The success of the book prompted quick release of a second
    printing, packaged with two audiocassettes, sold off racks and
    counter displays, mostly in office supply stores and warehouses
    or club stores by the thousands. And, in 1994, the second book:
    The Ultimate No B.S. Sales Success Book. For this one’s cover,
    I was photographed in a three-piece, pin-striped business suit,
    shirt and tie, sitting on an 1,800-pound, white Brahma bull
    (‘‘Tiny’’), out in the middle of the desert, at sunset. As you
    might imagine, I get a lot of comments about that book cover!
   And I use the same photo in a lot of my other promotion as a
    speaker and business consultant.
      Yes, there have been critics and criticisms. But my theory is
    if you don’t seriously offend at least one person a day, you’re
    not saying or doing much.
      How to Make a Million Just by Being
        Interviewed on Radio Talk Shows

 shows, almost all from home over the phone, and have sold
 well over 21,000 copies of two of their self-published books
 just by giving out their 800 number, with zero advertising
 expense.
   Joe and Judy self-published their first book, How to Get the
 Job You Really Want and Get Employers to Call You, as a result
 of Joe’s experience helping his son create a direct-mail campaign
 to prospective employers that worked like gangbusters. Joe
 started out by calling radio talk show producers and booking
 himself, and then he devised more sophisticated, less arduous
 methods. He did all the interviews from home by phone, and
 simply, enthusiastically told the story of how he helped his son
 quickly and easily land a great job, then offered his book for
 $15 and gave out his toll-free 800 number. In the first year alone,
 Joe sold over 3,000 books. —
   Joe and Judy have been at this now since 1986, making book
 after book after book a profitable success just through radio talk
 shows. But their strategy will work for other types of products
 and businesses, too. In fact, they’ve helped people with a wide
 variety of products use radio talk shows as a primary marketing
 method. |
   There are over 700 general interest radio talk shows in Joe’s
 database, and talk radio has enjoyed explosive growth in the past
 several years, with no end in sight. And every show’s hosts and
 producers are in constant, sometimes frantic, search for good,
 articulate, interesting, entertaining, or controversial guests who
 can hold listeners’ attention and, on call-in shows, make the
 switchboard light up.
  My friend Al Parinello has been the host of his own nation-
 ally syndicated radio talk show and has interviewed over 3,000
 people. He has owned and operated radio stations, worked on
 the development of both Nickelodeon and The Movie Channel,
 appeared as a guest on many talk shows, and has pioneered the
 use of radio infomercials. TV Guide called him ‘‘one of a new
 breed of space-age super salesmen.’’ Al gave me this great ex-
 ample of the power of radio talk shows:

```

```
       the topic of retirement planning. This is not an especially
       scintillating topic and I was worried that things would get
       a little boring. But, happily, the guest surprised me. He
       revealed that the Social Security Agency is making seri-
       ous mistakes in more than 10 percent of all accounts, and
       he gave out his 800 number for listeners to call, and he
      would give them, free of charge, the form they needed to
       get an analysis of their account from the government.
                     | The radio station’s phones rang off the hook and we
       had a lively and interesting program.
        The insurance agent got more than 1,800 calls to his
      number, gaining 1,800 potential clients’ names, addresses,
      telephone numbers, and interest. Needless to say, this led
       to selling a lot of insurance.
     And this was just in New York, on a local radio station.
     This same strategy could be used nationally, with interviews
    on hundreds of stations, to sell books, newsletters, or other prod-
    ucts related to seniors’ finances and retirement activities.
     Getting on radio talk shows is mostly a matter of persistence
   and grunt work. Here are the steps:
    1. From one of a number of sources, including those listed in
     chapter 13, you need to compile your own target list of sta-
     tions, program managers, and talk show hosts. You may have
      a geographic preference and only want to go after stations in
     certain states or cities. Maybe you want to start with small
     stations or maybe you only want to target the 100 biggest
     stations in the country. Using criteria that match your partic-
     ular objectives, you create your target list. For my most recent
      effort, for certain reasons, I went after only those stations of
     a certain size that carried the Rush Limbaugh syndicated
     program.
    2. You begin communicating with a basic news release, simple
      letter, flyer, or even a postcard. Joe Sabah uses an oversize
     postcard printed on a garish, eye-catching colored stock. I
     prefer the more traditional approach of a brief cover letter

```

-----

```
   creasingly common to send the news releases by fax, too.
    The cover letter should identify who you are, the name
   of your company or organization, the book or product or idea
   you are publicizing, and why you and it will be of great in-
   terest to the station’s listeners. The news release, like a news
   article, needs to be real news. It should have an attention-
   getting headline. The host or producer will be looking for the
   news angle, for what is provocative, predictive, or timely.
    Some people also include other support materials, such as
   suggested questions for the interview, reprints of articles
   about them from major media, book covers or actual copies
   of books, or reference letters from other radio station hosts
   to document that they are good guests, give good interviews,
   and attract lots of callers.
     Instead of sending all this material at one time, an effec-
   tive alternative strategy is to dole it out in a series of several
   mailings a few days apart.
    . Many hosts and program producers are diligent about exam-
   ining all of this material, and if they believe your topic will
   interest their listeners. and light up the switchboard, they will
   book you. However, the door never slams shut all the way,
   so if you fail to stimulate their interest with the first contact,
   you can keep trying. Here’s where the grunt work comes in:
  Nothing beats getting on the phone, calling, talking briefly
   with these people personally and then, if you get them inter-
   ested, immediately faxing or FedExing your materials to them
   again. This takes a lot of time, patience, and persistence.
   You’ll play a lot of phone tag. You’ll call at bad times, find
   out when you can reach a person, and have to call back. But
   it can pay off. After one recent mailing campaign to 130
   stations, we called them all, persevered in getting through to
   the right individuals, and found that fewer than twenty re-
  membered receiving and looking at the mailing: But, with the
  phone contact and sending the material again and following
  up by phone again, we’ve gotten very good results.
   . If at first you don’t succeed, try again, with a new angle. Let’s

     time this with the Academy Awards, so you could be inter-
     viewed about Hollywood celebrities’ pets. In November, you
     might go with a ‘‘Warning to Parents About Buying Dogs as
     Gifts for Your Children.’’ Different hosts and producers will
     respond differently to different presentations at different
     times.
      An Entire Business Built on Talk Radio Interviews
     Now, here’s the most inventive strategy I’ve ever heard: A
    client of mine, who has asked not to be named, and requested
    that I ‘‘disguise’’ the nature of his product and business revealed
    this to me. I give it to you here as a “‘disguised’’ but nonetheless
    valid example.
     Bob M. is a former pro athlete who develops, manufactures,
   and markets a couple of unique health-related products. He picks
    a market, and gets just one health food store or sporting goods
    store in a well-known mall to take an inventory of his product
    on consignment for just one week. He puts the inventory in en-
    tirely at his expense and splits the sales with the store fifty-fifty.
   Then he does a blitz of every local radio and TV talk show he
    can get on, talking about his career, ideas, and products, and tells
   everybody when he’ll be at that store to meet them in person.
   Each day, he does interviews during the day, spends the evening
    at the store, and finishes the week by being at the store on
    Saturday.
      In most cities, he’ll do at least $20,000 in business during
    the week. He’s done as much as $50,000 in a single week. After
    the split with the store, travel costs, mailings to the media, and
    his cost of product, Bob keeps about 20 percent of his gross;
   $2,000 on $10,000. He usually works two weeks out of every
   month and takes two weeks off. Last year, he grossed over
   $700,000, and kept about $130,000 net. Now, he’s busy cloning
   himself with four spokespersons who will have territories, buy

       Can You Profit by Getting on
        National TV Programs?
   Why not you? My one-time client, now good friend, Lee
 Milteer, a motivational speaker and author, persistently sent her
 press kits, literature, books, and tapes to the hosts and producers
 of all the major TV talk shows in the United States and Canada,
 and advertised repeatedly in The Radio & TV Interview Report,
 a trade publication read by producers.
   She was invited to appear on The Dini Petty Show, the Ca-
 nadian counterpart to The Oprah Winfrey Show, to talk about
 goal-setting, visualization, and stress relief. From that single
 interview, she instantly sold over $40,000 of her audiocassette
 products via an 800 number and captured thousands of customers
 for later follow-up. And she was so well received she was ulti-
 mately hired by the show to make regular guest appearances. In
 total, her appearances on The Dini Petty Show alone have prob-
 ably been worth over $250,000 to her in direct business, not to
 mention the indirect benefits.
   Two appearances on The Phil Donahue Show by Gloria
 Pitzer, known as the Recipe Detective, literally made her busi-
 ness. Gloria Pitzer publishes a homemade, simple newsletter of
 recipes, featuring do-it-yourself versions of famous food prod-
 ucts like Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald’s special sauce and .
 French’s mustard. On Donahue, she demonstrated how you
 could duplicate these products with simple ingredients, very
 cheaply, right in your own kitchen. She gained thousands of paid
 subscribers to her newsletter with zero advertising expense. And
 keep in mind this was not somebody with television experience,
 influential contacts, the help of a costly publicist, or any other
 advantage you lack.

      Every Smart Entrepreneur Uses Publicity at
           Least Occasionally
     Most of the entrepreneurs I use as examples throughout this
    book include deliberately sought and created publicity in their
    mix of marketing tools and methods. Bob Stupak of Vegas
   World (see chapter 2) has played blackjack against a computer
    for a $500,000 wager on television (and won), made the largest
    recorded single bet on a pro fight in Las Vegas ($1 million), run
    for mayor, risked going on 60 Minutes, invented weird casino
   games like Crapless Craps, and is now building the nation’s larg-
    est tower—all with publicity clearly in mind.
     Guthy-Renker (see chapter 8) employs a public relations firm
    to make sure Bill or Greg gets quoted by just about any media
    reporting on infomercials. The result? Coverage in everything
    from TV Guide to Fortune. Harv Eker (see chapter 11) aggres-
    sively sought publicity for his fitness product stores, with the
    goal of attracting the attention of larger, acquisition-minded
    corporations.
     Tom Doyle at Gripping Solutions (see chapter 3) gives away
    free sets of his mountain bike grips to competitive racing teams
    and editors, writers, and columnists. of bicycle magazines. The
    result has been positive articles in most magazines and powerful
    quotes from those articles that he is able to use over and over
    again in his advertising. Joseph Cossman (see chapter 3) was an
    absolute master at using publicity and publicity events to pro-
    mote his products throughout his career. A publicity stunt he
    staged for his Spud Gun toy, in conjunction with the toy show

      MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #35: |
   EVERYBODY CAN FIND A WAY TO USE PUBLICITY.
       DO NOT UNDERVALUE PUBLICITY
        BECAUSE YOU DON’T BUY IT.
       DON’T IGNORE IT JUST BECAUSE IT
     TAKES EFFORT TO GET. IT IS VALUABLE.
   At the very least, every smart entrepreneur includes publicity
 in his arsenal of promotion and business-building methods. A
 few rely on it exclusively to build their businesses. Publicity is
 commonly used to generate “‘hot’’ leads for follow-up by mail,
 by phone, or in person, like the insurance agent on Al Parinello’s
 show did. Publicity is also commonly used to launch new prod-
 ucts without lots of advertising, like Raleigh did with the Mar-
 ilyn dol]. But there are many other ways to use publicity, and
 you should carefully consider how each one might apply in your
 situation.
    The Bottom-Line Secrets to Publicity: The 5 P’s of
              Publicity
   Whether you decide to go the do-it-yourself route and be
 your own publicist or you invest money to hire and use a public
 relations agent, the bottom line is the same. There are five keys
 to creating publicity and to getting publicity opportunities:
 1. Be predictive. The public loves predictions of the future.
   Every new year psychics like Jeanne Dixon get enormous
   amounts of publicity by issuing their predictions about world
   and national events, celebrities’ lives, and other subjects. Talk
   radio is frequently populated by experts, authors, researchers,
   and seers making predictions about everything from the stock
  market to the end of the world. In the business environment,
   author Faith Popcorn became famous on the strength of her

      is Mark Skousen’s Forecasts and Strategies, and the word
     forecasts is not in its title by accident. Mark is an experienced
      talk show guest and media manipulator, and he has learned
     the power of being predictive. In a speech in October 1989
      at an investment conference, Mark announced to 500 inves-
      tors and attending media, ““The Berlin Wall will be torn
     down,”’ and discussed the implications of that with investors,
     even though his prediction was greeted with laughter and cyn-
     icism. One month later, the Wall was down. Over the years,
     he has made a number of equally impressive predictions that
     have come true. (He has also made a number that haven’t,
     but public memory seems to be remarkably forgiving of
      seers.)
         . Be provocative. In my book The Ultimate Marketing Plan, I
      cite being boring as the #1 Marketing Sin. I believe your
     customers, clients, and prospects will tolerate just about
     anything and everything but being bored. Well, this is doubly
      true with publicity. The public has a very short attention span,
     and the media knows that grabbing and keeping the public’s
     attention requires the provocative. Doug Casey got tremen-
     dous publicity some years back for his book How to Profit
     from the Coming Economic Crisis. People instantly wanted
      to know—What crisis? When is it coming? How should I
     prepare?
      One of the most consistently successful users of radio talk
     show appearances for marketing purposes is Laura Corn, au-
     thor and self-publisher of the book 367 Questions Every
     Woman Should Ask Her Man. It is an obviously provocative
     topic. Regardless of who you are, whether you’re a woman
      or a man, married or single, young or old, it is almost irre-
      sistible. Aren’t you instantly curious about what these ques-
      tions are? Why should women ask them? What will men
     answer?
       Barbara DeAngelis, another popular author, seminar leader,
     infomercial star, and repeat guest on daytime talk shows,
     talks about “‘the five secret ticking time bombs in every in-

```

-----

```
  time bombs are. Do I have any ticking away in my rela-
  tionship?
    Authors of “‘conspiracy’’ books about topics ranging from -
  John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Chappaquiddick, and El-
   vis’s death to the Clintons’ past financial machinations and
     _ the president’s alleged sexual liaisons easily get publicity. A
  large segment of the population has immense, easily provoked
  distrust of all authority, and most people prefer an explanation
  for a tragedy, rather than chalking it up to happenstance. With —
  these tools working for them, conspiracy theorists can always
  command attention.
    Tax protestor, author, and speaker Irwin Schiff boldly
   States that all income taxes are voluntary and enforced col-
   lection of income tax is unconstitutional. On talk shows, he
  challenges anybody to bring him a section of the tax code
  that directly contradicts him. The fact—usually revealed by
  Irwin himself—that he has twice been put in prison and done
  time for tax evasion does not dissuade tens of thousands of
  people from buying his books and attending his seminars!
    Inventors of safety products, advocates for and against
  gun control, self-defense instructors, and manufacturers of
  burglar alarms all have found publicity opportunities thanks
   to the increasing public concern about crime, and those who
  take especially provocative positions are media favorites.
 3. Be public. By this, I mean mainstream. For example, it’s
  much easier for, say, Laura Corn to generate lots of media
  publicity than for me to do so; she deals with sex, love, and
  relationships, and nothing is more mainstream than that. I deal
  in business topics, of interest only to a limited percentage of
  the population. As a result, most of the publicity I do get is
  in business, financial, and trade publications, which does
  serve my purpose. But I don’t fit with Donahue, Oprah, Ger-
  aldo, or even Today very well. If you want that kind of major
  media exposure, you have to find a way to be mainstream.
 4. Be a personality. Broadcast media just about require that you
  have a dynamic or humorous or intriguing personality. Mat-
  thew Lesko huge directory-type books Info Power.

     phenomenally well, because he is a very excited, excitable,
     entertaining personality. Larry is virtually guaranteed a good
     show. Diet and exercise guru Richard Simmons is regularly
     welcomed by Leno, Letterman, and Regis and Kathie Lee
     because he is a character.
     Be persistent. Every show’s producers’ and hosts’ interests,
     concerns, and needs change on a day-to-day basis. This week,
     nobody is interested in the child psychologist who has in-
     vented a new line of educational toys that combat gender and
     racial prejudices. Next week, a group of girls sue a public
     school system for sexual harassment, and The Phil Donahue
     Show is going to put together a panel of experts to comment
     on juvenile sexual harassment. Now that psychologist could
     be hot.
      Most shows’ staffs maintain extensive files of press kits
     and materials that are submitted to them. I have several clients
    who have been called to appear on talk shows a month or
     even a year after they submitted their materials. But the
     smartest tactic is to frequently send new information, articles,
     press releases, and other materials to a target list of media
     contacts.

 YOU MIGHT MAKE YOUR MILLIONS
   FASTER BY SELLING OUT
    THAN BY STAYING IN
   here’s an old joke about the U.S. government social worker
   making the rounds of the Indian reservations, settling on this
 sleepy chieftain, and trying to motivate him, believing if she
 could get him into ‘‘the program,’’ all the others would follow.
   “‘We would pay for you to go to school and get an educa-
 tion,’’ she told him.
   *“Why would I do that?’’ he asked. He was siting on a creek
 bank, under a shade tree, with a fishing pole stuck in the mud,
 its line dangling in the water.
   ‘*So we could help you get a good job with a good
 company.”’
   ‘*‘Why would I want that?’’ he asked.
   ‘*Well, if you stayed there and worked hard for thirty or forty
 years, you’d be able to retire.’’
   ‘‘Why would I want to do that?’’ he asked.
   ***So you could spend the rest of your years relaxing, doing
 whatever you wanted to do.’’
   “‘Doin’ that now,’’ the chief answered.
   Of course, the distinct difference is to retire with money or
 without it, and, as the comedienne Totie Fields said, ‘‘I’ve been
 with money and without, and with is better.’’ I believe that the
 great dream of many entrepreneurs is to develop their business
 to a certain point and then have some giant corporation pay them

   make that happen. T. Harv Eker did that. And he asked himself
   the question, Why take a lifetime to get this done—why not do
    it fast?
       From Biz Dunce to Biz Whiz after Just
            Seventeen Lessons
      T. Harv Eker is one of the most interesting guys I’ve met on
    the speaking circuit. He’s a Canadian transplanted to sunny San
    Diego, where he occasionally puts on what he calls a “‘Street
   Smart Business Boot Camp,’’ and more frequently, there and in
    other cities, he supervises ‘‘Street Smart Business Schools,”’
   modeled somewhat after the Dale Carnegie Courses.
     I was a guest speaker at one of these camps the weekend
    after Thanksgiving in 1993. There were about 400 students there,
   and Harv had pulled together a diverse group of speakers—Rob-
    ert Allen, author of Nothing Down, the get-rich-in-real-estate
    bestseller; Ted Thomas, a joint-venture marketing expert; Ann
    Boe, a networking specialist, Dr. Wayne Dyer, a metaphysical
    philosopher; and me. Ironically, the most interesting speaker of
    all was probably Harv, because he told a story I’d never heard
    before, that of very deliberately setting out to create a business
    for the sole purpose of selling it for big money as quickly as
    possible.
     These days, Harv’s students call him ‘‘The Biz Whiz,’’ but
    for quite a while he was more of a biz dunce. Harv bumbled his
   way through seventeen different businesses in a relatively short
    period of time. ‘‘It stands to reason that if I have gone through
    that many businesses, only a few of them survived for any du-
    ration,’’ Harv admits, ‘‘but the more businesses I owned, the
    more lessons I learned. In 1983 I decided to get married and
    settle down. I also decided to get rich, once and for all. In order
    to stay rich, I realized that I had to do things differently than I
    had in the past.”’

```

-----

```
      Stay Away from Great New Ideas
   In analyzing what had caused him the most grief in his past
 business ventures, Harv determined it was making brand-new, in-
 ventive ideas work. That was risky, costly, and time-consuming.
 This time, he went in search of a business that was already proven,
 apparently poised for explosive growth, but nonexistent in his
 own area. And Harv found the home fitness retail store. ‘‘These
 stores were flying high in Los Angeles,’’ Harv recalls, ‘‘but no-
 body’d even seen one in Toronto, or anywhere in Canada, for
 that matter.’’
  By transplanting what was already working in one place to
 another place, Harv took a very valuable shortcut. In this in-
 stance, he had to be a good observer, astute enough to study the
 already successful business and understand the principles and
 Strategies that were causing its success, but he did not have to
 be a successful inventor or innovator.
        Pay Attention to Trends
   ‘‘T looked: at a number of successful, potentially transplant-
 able businesses and business ideas, but I settled on the fitness
 equipment store because it was in sync with not one but a num-
 ber of societal forces likely to insure its success. They were: (1)
 a general increase in health and fitness product sales; (2) an
 increase in the senior population, the increase in life expectancy
 making people over fifty-five the fastest-growing group (and
 these people needed to exercise more but weren’t eager to go to
 health clubs); (3) what Faith Popcorn (author, The Popcorn Re-
 port) identified as the ‘‘cocooning’’ trend—people staying at
 home; (4) the increase of home-based businesses, so people had
 to stay home; (5) women in the workplace [with] full-time ca-
 reers and families, [who had] no time to hang out at the health
 club; and, (6) the public’s passion for convenience.’”’
  Harv did a good job. In fact, these trends have held up over

   equipment advertised and sold via TV infomercials, such as
    those with ‘‘Body By Jake,’’ Joe Montana, Joe Piscopo, and Jane
   Fonda, via pervasive magazine and newspaper advertising, and
    in every department store, discount store, and warehouse club.
   Once there was only NordicTrack, now there are hundreds.
   Whether this trend holds up four years from now or not, I can’t
    predict. (You may be reading this book many years from now
   and say, Piscopo who?) But the trends Harv spotted did hold up
    long enough for him to become a millionaire.
        Determine to Build a Salable Asset,
           Not Just a Business
     The biggest thing Harv did differently is that he viewed his
   ‘new business as an asset, in his words, ‘‘similar to a house or
    piece of real estate.’’ He set the goal of cashing out as soon as
   he could get $1 million for the business, and a companion goal
    of doing that as quickly as possible, and that altered the way he
          - approached developing and running the business.
      In April 1984 Harv opened Fitnessland, the first fitness
   equipment store in Canada. ‘‘Most people look at businesses as
    vehicles for income,’’ Harv explains, “‘but my research indicated
    that businesses get bought for a combination of reasons and,
    often, income is of the least importance. There’s gross. sales,
    proof that the business is expandable and has potential to grow
    with the new buyer’s capital and ideas, public recognition, [and]
    market share. These are all important values to build into the
    property.”’
     With that in mind, Harv systematically reinvested virtually
    all the profit in growing the business’s number of outlets and
    gross sales and in creating a business image that was even bigger
    than the business itself. The first year, Fitnessland had $850,000
    in sales with a whopping $220,000 in profits, but in two and a
    half years, Harv expanded to ten stores with $7 million in gross
   combined—but $36,000 The money

 ance, in securing territorial exclusive marketing rights to certain
 products, and in generating as much media publicity as possible.
  Harv reasoned that these assets would have greater impor-
 tance and value to a larger company acquiring his business than
 would a higher profit number. And he believed that the image
 and publicity would attract suitors.
  He proved right on both counts. The first break came when
 Fitnessland’s advertising attracted the president of the Canadian
 operating division of the H. J. Heinz Corporation to the store to
 buy a treadmill. He was so impressed with what he saw, he
 started asking questions about the business, then told Harv that
 Heinz was on the lookout for businesses they felt they could
 grow into giants. Heinz’s acquisitions people were soon in-
 volved, and Harv had a serious, qualified suitor on his hands.
   Creating Competition: You’re More Desirable
     When More Than One Wants You
   ““Once I had the Heinz deal in play, I sent out letters to
 health-related companies in Canada. Basically, I told them a U.S.
 company was starting negotiations to buy my business, but that
 I would prefer to keep the company Canadian owned, if I
 could.’’ Harv adds, ‘‘And I had a detailed business plan to show
 them, forecasting expansion to 100 stores in Canada and in the
 United States, making the argument that capturing this market
 quickly was important.”’
  Soon Harv had seven other companies in the game, all con-
 sidering acquiring his company. In subtle ways, he let each dis-
 cover the others. This motivated Heinz to move quicker and
 more aggressively than it ordinarily would. It took a year—a
 long time for the impatient entrepreneur, but a short time for a
 major corporation to complete an acquisition—and Harv Eker
 cashed out of Fitnessland for $1.6 million, achieving his original
 goal of being an ‘‘after-tax millionaire.”’

         MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #17:
             CLARITY OF PURPOSE.
     If you really pin people down, even business owners and
   entrepreneurs, you’ll find most cannot clearly and concisely
   enunciate exactly what they are trying to accomplish this year,
    in three years, or in five years. They’re running around playing
   what I call ‘‘blind archery,’’ and that’s a pretty difficult, even
   dangerous game. Harv Eker had a very clear, concise understand-
   ing of what he wanted to get done through his business in five
   years or less: Walk away an after-tax millionaire. This definite
   objective then governed all of his creative thinking and
   decisions.
      In a similar fashion, most of my activities these days have
   something to do with the objective of accumulating 5,000 paid,
   happy, renewable, renewing subscribers to my marketing news-
    letter. I choose or turn down speaking engagements, joint-
   venture opportunities, and other projects based on whether or not
    they’ll make a contribution to achieving this goal. My entire
   mail-order business is conceived as a giant funnel leading to
   newsletter subscription. Being focused on one, clear beacon like
    this makes navigating the waters on a day-to-day basis a lot
    easier.
      ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO BE A PIONEER?
     A lot of pioneers get shot full of arrows and die. As Harv
    learned through his seventeen lessons, it is often a lot smarter
    and surer to find a way to build on the solid foundation of some-
    thing that is already a proven success, rather than creating some-
   thing entirely from scratch.
     I am a huge believer in creative theft. When I work as a
    consultant with one kind of business, I identify some principle
    of success, some strategy that is working for them, then take it

```

```
 something that the second client’s industry is doing and ‘‘steal’’
 it to apply in an entirely different industry. You can certainly do
 the same thing for yourself. Harv found a successful idea he
 could transplant geographically. You might do that, too. Or you
 might do as I do—find an idea you can transplant from one type
 of business to another.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #24:
      PAY ATTENTION TO DEVELOPING TRENDS.
   The idea is to see “‘leading indicators,’ not ‘‘trailing indi-
 cators.’’ For example, in 1993 the percentage of young people
 who smoke crept back up, fast-food and junk-food consumption
 increased, and the total number of people entering formal
 weight-loss programs declined. If you look at all the advertising
 you see for weight-loss products, fitness products, and health
 foods, you might find those facts hard to believe. But you’d be
 looking at ‘“‘trailing indicators’; the 1993 statistics may be
 “leading indicators.’’.In fact, some highly respected trend ana-
 lysts are using such facts as the basis for predicting a dramatic
 drop in sales for the health- and fitness-related businesses in the
 next three to five years.
   Faith Popcorn, a legendary trend predictor, has coined the
 name pleasure revenge reaction for this; in other words, the pub-
 lic has deprived itself and tortured itself to lose weight and get
 better bodies, many have only gained back weight lost through
 grueling or expensive diets, and now all that frustration is going
 to play itself out in people saying, ‘“The heck with it. If I want
 a banana split, I’m having a banana split.”’
   In 1984 Harv saw a lot of current and leading indicators that
 led him to believe in a coming boom in health and fitness, and
 he was right to the tune of $1 million. If he were looking at
 today’s indicators, Harv would be making very different choices
 about the type of business to develop.
       MILLIONAIRE-MAKER STRATEGY #42:
     SMART INVESTMENTS IN BUILDING VALUE.

```
    ness, or merging with a big, ‘‘deep pockets’’ parent, or even
    going public, it’s important to understand that net income is
    rarely the most important success factor. The business owner
    only using his business as a means of earning a living can (and,
    usually, should) make the bottom-line profit number his top pri-
    ority. But the entrepreneur with a bigger vision needs to build
    value, not just create income.
    Why Would a Ketchup Company Buy a Chain
          of Fitness Stores, Anyway?
     About eight years ago, I went to a seminar on how to sell
    your business put on by The Geneva Corporation, and one key
    principle I heard there for the first time has since been of im-
    mense value to me. Here it is:
       People and companies buy businesses for their reasons,
       not yours. Their reasons for buying not only have nothing
        to do with your reasons for selling—they’ll have little to
       do with the reasons you think somebody ought to have
       for buying your business.
    This means that you need to think very creatively when posi-
    tioning a business for sale and selecting and courting buyers.
    You have to crawl inside their minds and try to understand their
    .reasons for buying.
     With this in mind, I’ve since sold two of my businesses for
    considerably more than they were worth on paper. For example,
    I sold the manufacturing division of a company I owned to a
    direct competitor, with the appeal to him largely based on two
    things: the merging of my customer base with his existent op-
    eration, so he had instant added sales but no added costs, and
    the value to him of removing me from the marketplace as a
    competitor. Now, the truth is, he was whipping me in that com-

```
 ogy, and lower prices. But I was a skilled, tough marketer and
 a thorn in the side of his business. His company spent money
 on certain kinds of advertising that would not have been nec-
 essary if I was out of the picture.
   This value had nothing to do with the reasons most people
 think businesses are bought. For example, the equipment was a
 nonissue because of the differences in technology. The inventory
 was also a nonissue. Even the business name and identity were
 unimportant. In this case, two assets were involved: customers
 and elimination of an annoying competitor.
   Synergy often plays a role. I recently sold a specialized di-
 vision of one of my publishing companies to a small firm pro-
 viding services to the same unique niche market. For me, this
 was one of a number of product lines and markets. For them, it
 was their only market, and because all their resources and en-
 ergies were targeted at that market, it cost them less to promote
 additional products than it did me to deal with it as one of many
 opportunities. For me, it had actually become almost a nuisance,
 and it was being neglected because of that. They almost imme-
 diately doubled the sales of the product line they acquired from
 me because of their more dominant presence in the market and
 laser focus on the market. I made the argument that the business
_would pay for itself and be worth much more to them than to
 me. That was true, and it was the basis for a deal satisfactory to
 both of us. In Harv’s case, it so happens that the H. J. Heinz
 Corporation was already in health-related businesses—notably,
 they owned Weight Watchers International—and had targeted
 this as a big area of opportunity they wanted to exploit.
   There’s also an ego or arrogance factor at work when an
 entrepreneur’s business is bought by a big company. The big
 company’s executives believe they are much smarter and more
 capable than the entrepreneur ‘‘who got lucky.’’ This is why
 gross is much more important than net in most cases. Rapid
 growth of gross screams ‘‘potential.’’ But when they look at the
 low net, they chalk it up to the entrepreneur being an inept man-
 ager. ‘‘If we bring in a good management team,"’ they reason,

```

-----

```
    there’s nothing wrong with letting them be arrogant. Go ahead
   and be humble and dumb. And cash the check.
      It’s axiomatic, by the way, that the arrogant big company
   buys the entrepreneur’s business, ruins it, and destroys it in a
    matter of years. Gerardo Joffe, one of the real wizards of mail-
    order, built up a terrific business with Haverhills. It was a fore-
    runner to The Sharper Image. He sold it to Time/Life for a lot
    of money, and they ruined it. After they killed it completely and
    his noncompete agreement was void, Joffe started all over again
    and built up a Haverhills-clone called Hennikers.
     The big company that I sold my company’s manufacturing
    division to really got the short end of the stick in the deal, mostly
   thanks to their own arrogance. First of all, they devoutly believed
    I was wrong about many of my approaches to the business. Sec-
    ond, they believed they could dictate their policies to the cus-
    tomers if they became the only game in town. Third, they
   overestimated the value of the entire market. What they didn’t
   understand was the ‘‘smallness’’ of most of the clients in this
    particular market, so when they tried to force high minimum
    production runs on them and took away the ‘‘babying’’ person-
    alized service we’d been giving them, they lost 80 percent of the
   customer base over a couple of years. Other smaller competitors
    sprang up and took that business away from them. They still did
    okay. They made a profit on the deal. But nothing like they
    thought they would, because ego and arrogance got in their way.
      How to Get the Very Best Deal Possible
        When Selling Your Business
      I’ve violated most of these steps in the two deals I’ve done
    for myself, because I was willing to knowingly trade off dollars
    against speed and simplicity. In one case, I initiated the talks,
    flew to the candidate, pitched his executives, and closed a deal,
    all in two days. Could I have gotten more money by handling

```

-----

```
 or urge to appear otherwise. If you want maximum money,
 though, these are the six steps followed by those who get top
 dollar: :
 1. Do not need to sell. In most negotiations, the person most
  willing to walk away from the table wins. If Harv had not
  found a buyer, his $36,000 in profits could easily have gone
  to $50,000 or $60,000 the next year, $100,000 the year after
  that, and he could have gone on living very well running his
  chain of stores for years.
   . Demonstrate tremendous potential. 1 think one of the best
  cases that can be made to a buyer bigger than you are is that
  your business could grow much bigger, much faster if it only
  had the capital and credit, and be much more profitable if it
  only had the buyer’s expert management.
    Imagine having a farm that is productive, has good yields
  per acre, an immaculate appearance, and a good water supply,
  and you are farming it with a mule-drawn plow. Along comes
  a big company that owns and manages thousands of farms,
  has every imaginable piece of modern, automated equipment,
  efficiency experts, soil analysts, and so on. That’s how Harv’s
  business must have looked to Heinz, and he did nothing to
  interfere with that picture, and did everything he could to
  paint it. ‘What I’ve done is good—but imagine what you
  could do!”’ is the message. ;
    During the last couple of months that I was writing this
  book, Ron Perelman invested a very large sum of money in
  the Guthy-Renker Corporation. Ron Perelman is, according
  to Fortune’s 1993 list, one of the 101 richest people in the
  world, a billionaire and then some. The terms of the deal
  allowed Bill Guthy and Greg Renker to immediately take out
  capital gains and enhance their personal fortunes, provided
  the company with more capital and much more credit, and
  gave them special access to other assets and opportunities
  ‘within Perelman’s ‘‘empire’’ (such as Revlon; SCI Televi-
  sion, a chain of TV stations; Marvel Comics; Genesis Enter-
        New TV

```

-----

```
     company), and let them retain control over their company.
    Why would Ron Perelman make such a small deal, in com-
     parison to his other interests, and give them such a good deal?
     He must believe that the synergy between Guthy-Renker and
     his other interests is so great, and that the potential for grow-
     ing Guthy-Renker is so great, that just by adding his resources
     to the mix, the value of Guthy-Renker and his piece of Guthy-
     Renker will massively multiply.
      A lot of what went on in making this deal was, from
     Guthy-Renker’s side, ‘‘Look at everything we’ve done, but
     here’s what we could do if we had .. .’’ and from Perelman’s
     side, ‘‘What they’ve done is good, but imagine what they
     could do if they had a, b, c, d, and e, and we’ ve got all that.”’
    3. Attract suitors, don’t seek them. There are certain business
     situations where proactive, very aggressive action perversely
     works against you more often than not. In my business, sell-
     ing consulting and speaking services, you have to learn how
     to attract clients, because if you go right at them, they run
     away. The same thing’s true in finding buyers or major in-
     vestors for your business. If you go after them, you’ll prob- .
     ably drive them away or, at the very least, you’ll diminish
     the price you'll be able to negotiate and get.
       Capitalizing on having the first retail fitness product store
     in Canada, Harv did everything he could to create massive
     amounts of publicity for his company. He also invested in
     creating a corporate image that made his business appear big-
     ger and more sophisticated than it actually was. He deliber-
     ately assembled elements likely to be attractive to a big
     corporate buyer or investor. He carefully constructed a giant
     magnet and let it attract. ;
      When I look at Guthy-Renker’s deal with Ron Perelman,
     I see the payoff of several years of substantial investment in
     public relations and publicity that served no direct purpose as
      it was being done. To a much greater degree than the owners
     and leaders of the other companies in the infomercial indus-
      try, Greg Renker sought out and welcomed opportunities to

```

-----

```
  nal. He employed a professional publicist. He frequently gen-
  erated news releases. He got a lot of ‘‘spotlight time’’ as the
  organizer of this young industry’s trade association, the Na-
  tional Infomercial Marketing Association.
    Also, at the expense of certain and quick profits, Greg and
  Bill passed on infomercial projects likely to create negative
  publicity and regulatory agency interference. While other in-
  fomercial companies got hit with FTC, FDA, and state attor-
  ney generals’ actions and adverse publicity over some of their
  most successful but arguably sleazy shows, Guthy-Renker
  took a higher road, a more conservative approach, and in-
  vested heavily in thorough documentation of advertising
  claims made in their shows, and served as the primary force
  raising the production standards of the entire industry. There
  is no doubt they could have pulled greater short-term cash
  profits out of the business with a different approach. But just ~
  like Harv Eker learned, bottom-line income is not the most
  important factor in attracting favorable attention from much
  larger corporate entities.
   . Be patient. If you are going to design and develop a business
  with the intent of selling it in order to walk away a millionaire
  or better, I think you have to plan on a five- to ten-year time
  frame. Harv Eker got there in just shy of five years, Guthy-
  Renker in about seven. And as I look at similar examples, I
  see that five- to ten-year time frame appearing consistently.
    It also took Harv about a year to get from Heinz’s deci-
  sion to a done deal. And that required considerable patience!
  But most big corporations cannot and do not move with the
  speed the small entrepreneur is accustomed to. Most multi-
  million-dollar deals will take months to get done, and will
 come apart and be put back together a couple of times along
  the way.
  . Ignore conventional evaluations of what your business is
  worth. ‘‘My accountant,’’ Harv Eker said, ‘‘told me that the
  maximum my company was worth was $400,000.’’ Harv got
  $1.6 million. The accountant’s assessment will always be

```

-----

```
     textbook correct. But it is not the way to walk away wealthy.
     And, contrary to all the textbooks in the world, it is not the
     way big deals are done in the real world.
       In the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Paul
     Newman is ridiculed for riding a bicycle and talking about
     the modes of transportation of the future. His character says,
     ‘‘The whole world’s looking at things through bifocals while
     I’m lookin’ through binoculars.’’ Accountants use bifocals.
     You need to get your buyer looking through binoculars.
      ‘‘That vision thing,’’ as President Bush used to say, is very
     important.
    6. Start by asking for a lot more than you want. Actually, many
     smart negotiators believe in forcing the buyer to make an
     offer without first naming their price. Harv told me, ‘‘Ignor-
     ing the $400,000 my accountant told me about, I sat quietly
     and waited until the people at Heinz named a figure. It was
     $1 million. And I was ecstatic, but I calmly told them I wasn’t
     interested in selling unless it was so clearly worth my while
     that I couldn’t say no.’’ Harv then set his price at $2 million.
     They settled at $1.6 million.
       The most important thing that Harv did, though, was to
     create a bare minimum scenario below which he knew he
     would not go. ‘“‘There is no way,’’ Harv said, ‘‘that I was
     leaving that business unless I was an after-tax millionaire.’’
     In most cases, I believe in starting with a number double my
     acceptable price, and with a strong rationale for that doubled
     number.
      Earlier in this chapter I mentioned Gerardo Joffe. He started
    his first mail-order business, Haverhills, in 1966 and sold it in
    1971 to Time, Inc., for 18,000 shares of stock with a market
    value of $56.56 each. When he started Haverhills, he had no
    mail-order experience. He had a background as a mining engi-
    neer, no training or mentors in the field, little capital, and he
    was over forty years old at the time. He learned as he went along.
     One key thing he did, early on, was to lock in on the idea

```

-----

```
walk away a millionaire. Like Harv Eker, his intent all along
was to create a salable million-dollar asset. In his book How You
Too Can Make at Least One Million Dollars in the Mail-Order
Business, he points out an advantage of developing a mail-order
business for sale. “‘By the very nature of the mail-order business,
you will create multimillions of advertising impressions. The
name of your firm, even if still on the modest level of $1 to 2
million in sales, will have large public recognition and will al-
most have become a household word. Those in charge of ac-
quisitions in major corporations will know about you and your
business. They will have formed a positive impression about
your business and will be predisposed toward acquiring it.”’
  When Gerardo Joffe sold Haverhills to Time, he admits to
being in negotiations with three other firms also interested in
buying Haverhills. Like Harv Eker, Gerardo Joffe constructed
the right kind of magnet, then he let it do its job of attracting
suitors. And you cannot chalk it up to luck. After his noncompete
agreements with Time expired, he started an almost identical
business, Hennikers, which he sold to another mail-order com-
pany in 1979. Later, he started and built a third similar company,
Russells, which he sold to an airline in 1982. He then purchased
the name Haverhills back from Time and started another com-
pany. There is a model here that you can follow.

    How an ‘“Ordinary,’’ Small Hotel Gift Shop
       Became a $5 Million-a- Year Business
     Bob Neumann became a hotel owner sort of by accident. In
    1985 Bob opened a small, specialized gift shop, Grizzly’s Gifts,
    in the lobby of the Anchorage Hotel. His family had been in
    retailing for years. He saw the transition of Alaska’s economy
    from oil to tourism, so opening a gift shop featuring Alaskan
    artifacts, crafts, gifts, and souvenirs was a natural evolutionary
    event.

```

```
 gift store, among the Eskimo-made knives and blankets, salmon,
 seal oil candles, and scenic postcards, a funny little item,
 **Canned Alaskan Earthquake,’’ became the star. (This is a clev-
 erly labeled can that grumbles and shakes when it is picked up,
 and rocks from side to side if picked up and quickly set back
 down.) People began writing in and calling in to buy more of
 these Earthquakes, and Bob responded by first advertising that
 product, and then developing a catalog to make follow-up sales
 to his lists of customers.
  Then a little crisis hit. Grizzly’s Gifts’ home, the Anchorage
 Hotel, was a famous landmark visited by most tourists coming
 through the city. In its heyday, the Anchorage had hosted the
 likes of Will Rogers, Walt Disney, and President Warren Har-
 ding. Unfortunately, the hotel had lost its luster. In fact, it had
become a run-down dog housing prostitutes and drug addicts. Its
 decline led to its going on the block. Bob was certain that anyone
buying it would want to get rid of the few stores housed there,
including his and his parents’. Finding another prime downtown
 location would be prohibitively expensive, if not impossible. So
he bought the hotel in 1988. He and his wife then invested
$250,000 and a lot of hard work in turning the fleabag into a
classy, European-style hotel. The result has made Grizzly’s Gifts
prosper wildly; the store has doubled in size and, during the
prime tourism summer months, employs forty-five people. The
mail-order business has grown from 5 percent to 15 percent of
all of Grizzly’s Gifts’ business, and its sales have jumped from
$200,000 in 1985 to nearly $5 million in 1994! And that doesn’t
include the hotel business, which is also a raging success.
  Admittedly more reactively than proactively, but nonetheless
courageously and effectively, Bob Neumann has utilized the ul-
timate Millionaire-Maker Strategy: synergy. By fitting three
businesses together in a synergistic manner, the whole is much
more valuable and successful than the sum total of the parts.
Synergy takes pieces and multiplies rather than just adding.

       Succeeding in the Success Business
            with Synergy
    By now, you have probably seen a Celebrating Excel-
   lence catalog. If you haven’t received one in the mail, you
  may have seen them bound into airline magazines. The Cele-
   brating Excellence catalogs, now called Successories, feature
   plaques, posters, paperweights, awards, notecards and statio-
   nery, and T-shirts all sporting motivational, inspirational, cus-
   tomer service-oriented or management axioms, and books, gift
   books, and cassettes. Many of these are upscale products. The
   posters, for example, are beautiful original photographs—called
   ‘‘Action Art Lithographs’’—that sell for as much as $69.95
   each.
    The original catalog operation started small, as an extension
  of a printing and graphics business based in Lombard, Illinois.
   Its owner, Mac Anderson, himself a devout believer in good old-
   fashioned positive thinking, used his graphics company’s capa-
   bilities to create the business’s first products. After seven years
   of building his catalog business, Mac opened his first Succes-
   sories Store, with the idea that it would act as a showroom,
   corporate headquarters, and base of operations for his outside
   salesforce calling on businesses in the Chicago area. But the foot .
   traffic, off-the-street sales at the 1,700-square-foot store were
   pleasantly surprising. In 1991, its first year, the store exceeded
   $700,000 in sales.
    Mac then opened three more company-owned stores, and
   quickly put the power of duplication to work through franchis-
   ing. Today he owns over 80 franchised stores in U.S. cities,
   rapidly growing toward his goal of 250, plus distributors in Aus-
   tralia, Holland, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South
   Africa. The stores benefit from constant, massive national ad-
   vertising of all the locations through the millions of catalogs
   mailed and distributed via airline magazines and gift catalogs
   during the year. And almost every store has an outside sales-
                         focusing

  businesses.
    The catalogs provide fundamentally free advertising for the
  stores. The stores utilize the same catalogs as their own. The
  revenue from the stores and the existence of the distribution
  pipeline make it easier for the company to continually invest in
  new, original product development. The stores’ salesforces se-
  cure business from a type of clientele that might never walk in
  and buy off a store shelf, but, while doing so, automatically
  promote the stores and the catalogs, so that contacts they make
  but do not convert to clients may later visit a store or shop from
  a catalog. The outside salesforce and the advertising for the
  stores by the catalogs serve to make the store franchise a more
  certain, reliable success for the franchisee. Catalogs x Stores x
  Salesforces = Millions.
    The overall success of this three-pronged synergistic strategy
  is impressive: over 100,000 corporate customers, including
  Xerox, AT&T, 3M, and Ford, and total sales in 1993 exceeding
  $13 million. At the end of the first quarter of 1994, Celex Group,
  Inc., the parent of Successories, Creating Excellence, and its pub-
  lishing arm, Great Quotations, announced record sales and earn-
  ings, featuring a whopping 129 percent increase in sales
  compared to the same quarter in 1993. Barring any unforeseen
  disaster, Celex may as much as double in size over the next two
  years.
      The MiniConglomerate Philosophy
    I have long encouraged my clients to view their businesses
  and business opportunities very differently from most. If you
  start asking people ‘‘What business are you in?’’ or ‘‘What do
  you do?’’ you will usually get answers that impose very limited
  definitions on their activities. They box themselves in, mentally
  and otherwise. A person who owns a chain of jewelry stores, for
  example, may answer, at worst, ‘‘I’m a jeweler’’ to, at best, “‘I
  own a chain of jewelry stores.’’ But those very definitions pre-

```

    business or importing pearls from the South Seas or putting up-
    scale engraved gift kiosks in the same malls where they have
    stores or creating a ‘‘wedding store’’ or “‘wedding catalog’’ or
    a travel business specializing in unique honeymoon trips or...
     There is a difference between being focused and being re-
    stricted. One of my most frequently dispensed suggestions is that
   you focus on the customer. You'll recall my other references to
   TCV, Total Customer Value. Once you come to grips with the
    fact that the single biggest expense of business is acquiring a
    new customer, then it becomes evident that it can be easier and
   more profitable to grow by offering more products and services
    to the customers whose trust you have than by only searching
    for new customers. Then you can fit that idea together with other
    synergy. If you put two consumer service businesses together
    under one umbrella, you not only halve the cost of acquiring
    customers, you share fixed and operations expenses in order to
    create better bottom-line profits.
     You might also focus on the product. Disney was the first to
    ask the very smart question: Since our characters are eagerly
    licensed by manufacturers of all kinds of merchandise that sells
   by the multimillions in all kinds of stores, why don’t we have
    our own products sold in our own stores? Now it’s hard to walk
    into a mall anywhere without finding a busy, very profitable
   Disney Store. Their success awakened a sleepy Warner Brothers
    to the neglected product value in their characters, and now
    equally successful Warner Brothers stores are proliferating like
    crazy. Both Disney and Warner also have thriving catalog busi-
    nesses, and their catalogs promote their stores.
     When I coauthored the ‘‘Be Your Own Boss’’ products with
   Tony Robbins, Fran Tarkenton, and Entrepreneur magazine’s
    columnists, and the TV infomercial that promoted this product,
    I interviewed Beverly, a bright, dynamic lady who had used En-
    trepreneur’s Business Start-Up Guides to launch her gourmet
    muffin shop in Atlanta’s The Underground. She had a successful
    shop, baking and selling muffins, including many unusual muf-
    fins from her own recipes, such as ‘‘Meal-In-A-Muffin’’ items

  other ways to make money when a local Wal-Mart executive,
  who liked her products, asked if she could supply the area Wal-
  Mart stores with packaged muffins to sell.
   She did not say (or think): I’m not in the wholesale bakery
  business. She said yes. And, instantly, she was in the wholesale
  bakery business. Initially, she marshaled a night shift of workers
  who produced muffins for Wal-Mart stores right there in the
  store. But soon, the demand of Wal-Mart and other stores she
  added to her clientele forced her to expand to a larger muffin
  “*factory’’ in a lower rent area. The last time I talked to her, her
  wholesale business was much bigger and more lucrative than her
  store.
   Odds are, in your current business or the business you’re
  about to create, you have or will have an asset, be it the custom-
  ers, the product, or something else that could and should serve
  as the basis for very creative synergistic expansion. Here are a
  few quick tips for recognizing it and exploiting it:
         THINK BIGGER!
  Most big businesses began as small businesses. There’s no rea-
  son that you can’t expand, duplicate, diversify, combine, etc.,
  and turn your small business into an exciting, growing business.
          THINK BROADLY!
  Don’t define your business too narrowly. Give yourself mental
  creative room to maneuver and to respond to new opportunities.
          THINK LEVERAGE!
  What is your greatest asset? Is it a loyal, highly responsive cli-
  entele? Is it store traffic? A phenomenal location? Your product
  or products? Whatever it is, how can you get more leverage from
  it? How can you better exploit it? Mickey Mouse was a cartoon
  character, of use originally only in short cartoons for movie the-

```

```
   a cable TV network, and on and on and on.
         THINK SYNERGISTICALLY!
   What elements can you combine under your single roof or um-
   brella that multiply rather than just add to the value of your
   business?
        A Final Word from the Author
     There is a reason that people choose the United States of
   America over every other nation in the world. They wait pa-
   tiently and fight persistently to gain entry legally. They risk their
   lives to sneak in illegally. They come across the harsh, dark
   desert; they row here on rafts. This has been going on since the
   beginning of America, and it will go on as long as we remain a
    true free-enterprise society. Why? Because of the Great Ameri-
   can Dream.
     And they can have it. This remains a place, just about the
   only place, where anybody can set and achieve virtually any
   goal, regardless of where they start, regardless of the particular
   obstacles they carry with them, and that goal can certainly in-
   clude turning their ideas into a million dollars or more. This book
    is intended, in part, as a reaffirmation of the availability of The
   Dream.
     I tell people that I am woefully unqualified for every business
    activity I’m involved in, every success I have achieved. I’m one
   of the highest-paid advertising copywriters and marketing con-
    sultants in the field, yet I never attended college and never had
   any formai education or apprenticeship in advertising. I’m a very
    successful professional speaker who routinely earns $10,000 to
   $25,000 per speech (in fees plus educational materials sales), and
   who has shared the platform with a long list of celebrities, in-
   cluding two former U.S. presidents. But, when I was a kid, I
    stuttered almost uncontrollably, I got a C in high school speech

       * Charge premium prices and deliver premium value.
        ¢ Lead your marketing with irresistible offers.
       ¢ Create extra profit centers.
        ¢ Diversify your marketing efforts.
        ¢ Continually listen to your customers—react and re-
      spond.
        ¢ Deliberately build on customer loyalty.
      2. Exclusively control your products and businesses
        ¢ ‘‘Have’’ the market, then get the product (the reverse
      of most people’s approach).
        ¢ Pick products (and businesses) using proven criteria
       with your greatest interests.
        ¢ Negotiate for limited, carefully defined exclusive rights
       in a way that is a win-win for you and the manufac-
       turer or other party granting the rights.
        ¢ Remember, if you don’t ask, you don’t get!
      3. Profiting from service businesses or service com-
       ponents incorporated into other businesses

       small.)
        * Design services that solve people’s most vexing
       problems.
        * Design services that save people time.
        ¢ Specialize.
        * Follow your talents.

    others.
    * Turn your business or moneymaking system into a
    ‘‘business opportunity in a box.”’
   5. Get involved in the exciting world of direct
    marketing
    * Bypass middlemen and complicated distribution—go
    direct to the end user and build relationships with your
    consumers.
    * Use your marketing as a means of collecting data about
    your customers.
    ¢ Test, test, test.
    ¢ Tap into others’ databases and established customer
    relationships.
   6. Turn information into millions
    ¢ The most in-demand, most-consumed commodity of
    our time is information, _
    ¢ Packaging and selling information, with emphasis on
    publishing-on-demand, gives you enormous financial
    leverage.
    ¢ If you know “‘how to,’’ you have the basis for a prof-
    itable information marketing business.
    ¢ If you’re not going to be in the information business
    exclusively, at least incorporate information products
    and information marketing in your other business. Plus
    your other product(s) with information components.
   7. Publicize!
    ¢ Publicity is so powerful it can even build businesses
    with no other proactive advertising or marketing. This
    fact tells you that you must make it part of your mix

HOW TO USE ARISTOTLE ONASSIS’S
  BIGGEST BUSINESS SECRET:
 THE MILLION-DOLLAR ROLODEX
 Le billionaire Aristotle Onassis said that the secret to success
   in business is to know something nobody else knows. Along
 these lines, one of the most frustrating, time-consuming, and
 often costly challenges of turning ideas into profits is finding the
 right contacts, vendors, resources, information, and knowledge.
   Over the years, I have built up quite an arsenal of resources.
 I have already sifted and sorted through thousands to arrive at
 the relatively small number that I rely on repeatedly. In this
 chapter, I pass those on to you. You might think of it as having
 a million-dollar Rolodex on your desk, as it has cost me at least
 that much to assemble, and could be worth more than that to
 you now, just in time saved.
   In contacting these sources, it will be of benefit to let them
 know you read about them in my book. In many cases, you will
 get discounts or other special considerations as a result.
       Important Notices About the
        Million-Dollar Rolodex
    1. Although every effort has been made to ensure the
    accuracy of the listings provided here, the very na-
     ture of publishing a directory is that information
     will be out of date and incorrect even before the

```
       publisher can accept any responsibility for inaccura-
       cies in these listings. I will remind you that your li-
       brary’s business librarian can be incredibly helpful
       in tracking down directories, companies’ new ad-
       dresses and phone numbers, and all sorts of
       information.
             . Being included in these listings does not constitute
       endorsement by me or by the publisher. In many in-
       stances, I’ve listed suppliers and contacts I’ve had
       very good experiences with, but that’s just no guar-
       antee that you will have the same kind of experi-
       ence and feel the same way. Consider what I’ ve
       done here as a very valuable shortcut in your shop-
       ping and information-gathering activities, but do not
       consider it some kind of warranty. It is not. You
        are an adult, responsible for your own decisions.
       Caveat emptor.
             . Because time will elapse between the assembly of
        this information, its publication, and your obtaining
        it, all offers must be subject to change without
       notice.

     Direct-Mail Campaigns for My Business?
    Better than half of all the business successes I’ve used as
  examples in this book are significantly dependent, some almost
  entirely dependent, on direct mail. I believe that the greatest of
  all favors an entrepreneur can do for himself is to learn how to
  effectively use direct mail to promote ideas, products, services,
  and businesses.
   The success of a direct-mail campaign is roughly 60 percent
  dependent on the list, and the offer-to-list’s known interests

  pendent on format and appearance. The sales letter is the single

   How Can I Get Set Up to Accept Major Credit
        Cards from My Customers?
   Obtaining VISA/MasterCard merchant processing for direct-
 marketing businesses, especially new ones, is an increasingly
 vexing problem. The unfortunate truth is there is no really good
 answer. Persistence and patience will often be required. VISA/
 MC and their processing banks clearly discriminate against direct
 marketers.
          NEW HELP FOR START-UPS
    With the widespread use of 800 numbers, few catalog com-
    panies can survive today without offering credit card or-
    dering. But just try to find a credit card processor that will
    take small or new cataloguers as clients. It’s not easy.
      Jean Hill, the founder of start-up food cataloguer,
    Amara Kosher Meats in New York City, says she contacted
    15 processors and banks before she found one willing
     to take her business. Finally, New Hampshire—based
    Litle&Co. accepted Hill’s account under the Alliance Pro-
    gram, a new venture designed to help start-ups and small
    mailers with credit processing needs. [As of August 1993]
    the Program has 34 mailers, 15 waiting to start.
       **Litle has been so nice to deal with,’’ says Katherine
    Ansardi, founder of Indelible Blue, a computer software
    cataloguer. She has only one complaint: ‘‘It’s a little
    pricey,’’ she says. ‘“Litle requires a 10% retainer of sales
    that is causing us cash flow problems.”’
      Catalog participants (in Alliance) must offer a product
    rather than a service and must also pass a stringent credit
    check and site inspection.

      How Can I Handle Fulfillment
         of the Orders I Receive? »
   Many companies, especially start-ups, choose to handle their
 in-bound order-taking and their fulfillment internally, for maxi-
 mum control, maximum contact with customers, lowest costs,
 and loss control. My own preference is to handle as much of
 this hands-on, in-house, as possible. There are, however, a great
 many service companies that offer in-bound call services and

 Joe Cossman’s ‘“‘exploits”—and they honestly can be called noth-
 ing less—have been a constant source of inspiration to me since I _
 first read his book How I Made $1,000,000 in Mail-Order and
 You Can, Too over twenty years ago. More recently, it was a
 privilege to get to know him personally, in connection with an
 infomercial project. And, even though in his old age I found him
 to be irascible and difficult to deal with, I have to tell you that,
 in my experience, no one has as much practical experience in
 turning raw ideas, orphaned and odd products, and information
 into fortunes.

 Napoleon Hill
 You probably are already very familiar with Napoleon Hill. For
 the uninitiated: As a young man, Napoleon Hill was sent on a
 twenty-year mission by Andrew Carnegie, America’s first billion-
 aire, to personally interview and spend time with hundreds of the
 greatest achievers of their time in search of the unanimously
 shared secrets of success. The report of his findings, Think and
 Grow Richt, first published in 1937, has been a perennial best-
 selling book entirely through word-of-mouth recommendation.
You must read Think and Grow Rich!, which is available in
 bookstores.
 Tony Robbins
 If you’ve watched late-night television anytime in the past five
 years, you have undoubtedly seen Tony with Fran Tarkenton,
 Martin Sheen, and many celebrities discussing the benefits of his
 Personal Power Program. Well over $50 million worth of Per-
 sonal Power Programs have been sold through these TV infomer-
 cials alone. You can get information on Personal Power from the
 Guthy-Renker Corporation. Tony’s books Unlimited Power and
 Awaken the Giant Within are available in bookstores.

  “Dan Kennedy's smart marketing advice has been of great value to our business. |
  wish I'd read this book back when we started Joan Rivers Products. It certainly would
  have made our journey that much easier.”
  “Dan Kennedy can make dreams come true. You'll get a million dollars worth of value
  from this book. A ‘must read’ for entrepreneurs and CEOs.”
  “At our conferences we deal with thousands of inventors, authors, manufacturers and
  creative people bringing new products to the marketplace. Every one of them would
  profit tremendously by reading Dan Kennedy’s book. He describes every option for
  turning sound ideas into fortunes.”
  “It took us several years of creative persistence to finally bring our product to the
  marketplace. The challenges and obstacles that confronted us made reading your
  book that much more meaningful. We only wish it would have been published sever-
  al years ago. It certainly would have made our task much easier!”
  “As | went through these pages | saw many things I’m already doing. But | was amazed
  to discover how many things I’m not doing—but will do now! And the Million Dollar
  Rolodex at the back of the book is worth ten times the price of the book. You could
  spend $1,000 and attend the seminar, or buy the book and have the seminar at your
  fingertips forever. | like that idea!”
