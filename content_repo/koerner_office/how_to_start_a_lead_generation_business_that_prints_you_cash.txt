there are 200 000 average monthly searches for botox alone only in the us and the competition is low so top of page bid is five bucks but it's still low competition 22 year-over-year change so completely sold on this more generally speaking i'm completely sold on lead generation sites with programmatic seo and basically automated ai generated content plus paid google ads like kind of like a three-tier strategy so we're trying this all right welcome to the kerner office i'm still fired up from this episode i just had with connor gross he's a guy i met on twitter that's a lot like me he's 10 years younger than me he lives in new york but he has an e-commerce business he buys self-storage he wholesale self-storage he made 360 grand profit on a wholesale deal he's just always ideating launching things hacking like he's all like me and so i want to start interviewing people like that where we can just riff on ideas and we had no shortage of ideas programmatic seo lead generation sites botox high rocks selling energy bars you name it for like 50 minutes we just jammed on ideas non-stop and it was really fun so let me know if you like it and i want to have connor on every month or so enjoy we've got connor gross here connor is a friend that i met on twitter and he's a lot like me except younger you're in your 20s right connor yeah i just turned 27 last month so 10 years apart i'm 37 so connor lives in new york and he buys self-storage and he starts businesses and he's in e-commerce and we're doing a lot of the same stuff and he's definitely an idea guy so i just wanted connor to come on and just talk business ideas and just riff on some cool stuff yeah man i mean it's funny hearing you said the idea guy part too because i was on a call yesterday with a friend who actually lives in dallas fort worth so remind me to connect you with him if i haven't yet and we were talking he's two years younger than i am and he was like oh yeah i want to launch this business because i'm doing these things he has two companies right now both of them pay him a ton of money and he makes good money on it but he's like i'm not going to spoil the idea that he wants to go after only because it's you know he's very into it but he's like i want to do this and i want to do this for the next 50 years and this is gonna be my big thing and he's like i have so many ideas i hate the fact that i'm getting like you're shiny object syndrome and he was like what about you like what's your favorite business that you run right now it's like well if i'm being honest like it's probably going to be the next one because things things always seem better when you haven't started them yet and it's like that classic i don't know if you've seen the graph before but it's like you know you have this idea you're like why hasn't anyone thought about this yet and then you start getting into it you're like oh there's actually a ton of competition for this and then you start launching it you're like this is really hard and then you get a win or two and you're like okay it's actually not as bad as i thought like coming from the idea guy background it's like your favorite idea is always the next one because you don't know all the headaches and frustration struggles that are gonna you know be a part of that journey i know and it's kind of like we're hardwired to forget like forgetting is a feature not a bug like when i run ultra marathons every single time throughout the whole thing i'm like this is stupid i'm an idiot you're dumb why are you doing this no one cares that you're out here this literally doesn't matter you're in extreme pain this takes 36 hours never do this again and then i cross the finish line and i feel good and then it's like okay that was awesome i'm glad i finished but never doing again and then like two days later to like as if i could set an alarm to it i start looking up the next race it's like what and same with businesses like all right this is really hard this is really hard like let's stick to what you know like don't go out of your comfort zone and then i just either i'm an idiot or i just forget and i do it all over no it's i think it's human nature to forget like right now i'm moving to new york i'm in jersey at the time of this recording but my girlfriend took the bar the new york law bar last year and i remember her being extremely stressed out the entire stressed out the entire time and she was we're talking about it this past weekend because everyone's getting ready to take the bar again and she was like oh it wasn't that bad i was like you forget it's very it's very common nature to only remember the good things from a situation so yes yes so you you texted me about this idea what is tegas oh you don't know tegas i don't know tegas is that is that like an indie band tegas blew up tegas is well okay let me just google their thing so i can read out the exact name of it but it's effectively like intelligence research insights so if you ever heard of these companies where they they'll effectively say you have a hundred million dollar funds and you want to figure out you know you want to get involved in let's just use self-storage because it's relevant you want to get involved in the self-storage sector great you know nothing about self-storage tegas is going to connect you with everyone who owns or with professionals and people in the industry who own or like are involved with self-storage so realtors brokers owners sellers wholesalers whatever like if you are in the space and you know what you're talking about they are going to connect you with them now there are plenty of these like consulting style platforms the really interesting and arguably genius part of what tegas is doing is they're not marking up the conversation so if i turn around and say you know something i'm about to have conversations all day long about self-storage put some time on my calendar to you guess you know build me out of 250 an hour the normal company is going to say all right we're going to charge 500 an hour to meet with connor and we're going to take the difference so you can say like is that like catalan uh i catalan does that yep catalan does that who are alpha sites does that there are a couple other ones that do it and they you know they mark you up for your service but they're also you know bringing the client and so they provide a value what tegas does is pretty interesting is so you play a a platform fee kind of figure what the platform fee is i'm on their website right now but like any good company they you know pricing page and don't put the pricing on the other website so they will say all right i think it's like five or ten grand let's call it you pay that you get unlimited access to the people you want to talk to and with no markup so it's like the costco-esque model but more than that what you're also paying for is you get access to a database or a library of all of the other conversations that have ever been had on the platform and so because they transcribe them and so what they tell you is like all right if you if you book a time with connor and you talk about self-storage and you talk about how you want to you know take advantage of a deal down in southeast florida whatever they'll they'll remove like the incriminating slash you know highly personal details of the conversation but they will include the key insights and they'll give you a two i think it's a two to three week head start to act on that information and then afterwards the transcribing or the recording or the data is then put into their database as well i think that this is a super interesting type of business because it gets you all this really unique data without you having to build it at all like it's crowdsource data effectively i think building some kind of research company that can then turn into a data product for you have another example after i finish this ramp i think it'd be really really profitable so who's paying the platform fee is it people like taking the calls or making the calls the people that are making the calls so if you are if i'm a big hedge fund and i want to learn about self-storage i pay five to ten grand a year and then the self-storage expert doesn't pay anything he gets paid an hourly rate yep the self-storage expert gets paid an hourly rate right so they're the tigus is reaching out to these experts and they are saying join the platform it costs you nothing you can only make more money so it's a no-brainer pitch okay it's also pretty cool like you know from just to give you an idea in terms of like their customer base they have 3 000 customers and they're so like i don't know you and i come from the e-commerce world 3 000 customers is cool it's not anything crazy but they have 3 000 customers but they're valued at 4 billion um they do a lot in revenue and they have grown like a weed in the last five to six years so i think that one is really cool and so let me give you another breakdown in terms of this business model applied in a different industry that can be a little bit because i think yeah something that's like more that we could wrap our heads around yeah so i've got a friend college buddy one of my old roommates he is in the food sector so crazy background but like he graduated college and moved out to montana lived on a bison ranch and started basically creating their bison jerky line and like marketing it towards independent grocers and chain stores and all of that he quickly realized damn if you want to navigate either any of these small stores like you know joe's health food store on the corner of one two three main street or if you want to get into kroger's nationwide it's really hard because the little guys don't have their contact information online because they don't need it and the big guys don't have their contact information online because it's a hell of an org chart and it's difficult to navigate so he has since left that jerky business and he's working with someone else right now and what they do is they sell a service to small independent brands so if you have your chris's coffee and he says okay i'm gonna get you into every you know i'm gonna be your business development arm you're great at making coffee i'm great at sales we are going to call around all of these stores try to get you into all of the shops that you need our markup is we charge a small flat fee slash a recurring fee plus x percentage of whatever the po is that we get you at that company right so that alone is a good model it's it's a you can back into the profit on that model it's reoccurring revenue you eat what you kill so you know you only get part of the upside and it's niche so like it appeals well he's kind of like a broker right like he builds up all these relationships maybe it's with joe the owner of one grocery store maybe it's the regional buyer for albertson's and he's like hey i've got some bison jerky for you hey i've got some organic coffee for you and just take that cut of the purchase order and so he's a broker in that sense you know he builds up the business development arms for these different companies but the other really interesting thing that he does is he's he's basically like turning the light switch on in the room and he's like all right here's the contact information for the small guys here's the org chart who's the buyer in this category that email their phone number in this category and he takes all of this information and he basically sells his crm so he sells the crm as a data product where he says you're a small independent company you want to get into retail you don't want to pay me that's fine you don't have to pay me buy my data product instead and i think that's really cool because the data is essentially the sawdust let's call it yeah yeah of all of the work that he's doing for this service brand which is already profitable and now the cost of goods sold or like a product essentially that he's selling is a zero dollar fulfillment cost because he already has it built out so he's doing both he's doing but he's doing like the the higher ticket but harder part of just calling these guys on behalf of the food brands and then he's just is the data that he's selling just a monthly subscription or a one-time fee or what yep monthly subscription you get access to it it's it's updated on its daily basis you get new buyer information you get an email the contact information where they're at like it's a cool it's a cool concept that is cool because i mean he's probably going to end up making more than these food brands are he will definitely i mean unless unless he's working for the rx bar right you know eventually the food brands right this biz dev in house but he will definitely be making more than the food brands i think yeah i mean i like we used to own a company called send eats where we we did all the logistics for these niche these niche food brands and they don't make any money most of them go out of business it's a really brutal tough business so i'd rather be on the data side of it i agree there i went to school up in boston went to northeastern there were two guys one while i was in school one after i graduated that i got in contact with and the poster child of entrepreneurship at northeastern during the time that i was there was this company called eat your coffee they sold essentially call it rx bars with caffeine infused in them cool concept it was really niche and like this is also coming during the time when like right now i feel like if i'm on twitter if i'm reading entrepreneurship stuff people people are leaning more towards the business the boring stuff the things that are proven ideas this was during the time when like people wanted that uber people wanted to hear you run a company not just that it's a painting company but it's a sexy brand and the guys that were running this company they you know they launched it they formulated a way to get caffeine into a bar they scaled up they got some you know some fundraising they got into retail but i think at the end of the day they had you know yeah and okay exit like not to down talk them good friends of mine but like sure you know they had they had a fine exit it wasn't like like they are retiring on a beach somewhere after that you know i'm now i'm two or three four years postgrad at this point i had a conversation with this other kid who's at northeastern and he's like i am launching seaweed chocolate bar and i was like and he's like oh there's all the benefits of the seaweed and i was like i was like dude you seem smart like you seem like a hustler like i can tell just based on the fact that we're on this phone right now like you like coming up with ideas you like launching stuff you're like an entrepreneurial person like you will be successful in something that you do i'd never want to be the bearer of bad news when it comes to it like prove me wrong if this is the case but i would say you could probably make more money doing something that is more proof now yeah so you know unless you're unless you're like the rx bar founder who i know i don't know if you've if you've seen recently yeah yeah have you seen the new product he's launching what's it called i think it's called david i think so david's bar um i don't know if i ever is it is it in foreign i think so it's like the greek sculpted god yeah it's gonna be cool i don't know how he does it but it's like a hundred david protein yeah it's 150 calorie protein bar with 28 grams of protein all right if you are watching this clip right now you are watching this on youtube and if you are a fan of podcasts please check out my podcast while you're at it because sometimes i have podcasts that aren't on youtube and sometimes i have youtubes that aren't on podcasts so check out the kerner office on any podcast platform or you can go to tkopod.com also my newsletter we'll throw that in there there are no ads it's weekly it's different content than my podcast and youtube newsletter.chrisjkerner.com you'll see the link and we'll see you there holy cow i'm looking at it right now it has like a gold wrapper david yep so i don't think i don't think he's launched yet but you know if you're like hey you're the rx guy rx guy was like the pinnacle of all of this stuff a few years ago and now you're building this ultra macro bar you're going to be pretty successful well the problem with these food brands is you don't make any money until hopefully one day you get a big exit like rx bar because if you're growing then you have no cash you're constantly raising cash and spending it on new inventory so is the the inventory game yeah that's the problem i mean commerce game i know i know i will say on that though do you want to talk about the other thing i texted you because this is a food company i won't say who told me it because i i don't like outing people in public and i don't think these numbers are private do you know element i would assume right element what just l m n t and maybe electrolytes no i don't know if i do oh you don't know these guys okay look them look them up and then just okay for the sake of this call all right so yes i've seen this i've seen this before but i don't consume this you don't any reason why or just just having gotten around to it i don't see it around like it looks familiar the branding looks familiar but yeah i don't see it around okay so i know i know we're kind of putting on the spot here right now but these are electrolyte packets they've got salt in them they have potassium magnesium like their whole thesis is the fda or whoever's in charge of the narrative around the nutrition in the us always always saying salt is bad sodium is bad yeah have no salt have no sodium they're like okay if you are sedentary in your lifestyle and you have like diabetes sure if you're an athlete if you're mildly fit if you sweat during the day if you like have cognitive functions that require a lot of your focus by the day the average american is actually not getting enough salt for their for their day to day and so they create these really easy supplement packets where you drop in a drink i buy them all the time they taste great they're solid and genuinely notice that like if not even if you're hung over but like if coffee's just not doing it for you because maybe you've drank in your third cup of coffee and you're super dehydrated at this point these actually make me feel better both physically and mentally because it's like oh yeah i'm like replenishing something in my body seeing what you see now how much do you think they do in sales and profit i know that's a loaded question first of all like before i even get there like i totally agree with you like i did keto a while back and like all of the issues that people have with keto is because lack of salt right and like if you can get enough salt magnesium potassium in you're fine and when i was running ultra marathons like it all came down to to to electrolytes and i i genuinely believe that not enough people are drinking electrolytes on a daily basis so i'm sold on the thesis like geez i don't know nine figures top line eight figures bottom line 130 million in sales and with like let's say 22 margins okay you're extremely close 200 million top line 40 million bottom line dang okay wow for for a salt packet that's pretty crazy it's crazy because i i want to launch something like this i wrote a newsletter about it did you read that it's called busy juice oh yeah yeah yeah yes i did i did yeah it's just because like i i have the same problem i want to drink a gallon of water a day but water's boring right and so i started getting those mio packets just to make it more flavored and then it's like okay this is like 100 red dye number 40 and i'm drinking a gallon of it like i don't know what i'm doing but this can't and it's not like i felt bad i felt i just thought this can't be good for me right yeah and so i just started yeah i just started ordering crap on amazon and kind of experimenting tinkering and came up with this lemonade and it tastes like chick-fil-a lemonade but it's just lemon stevia and caffeine and i drink again and so i know exactly what's in it and it's caffeinated and it keeps me energized all day long and it keeps me hydrated and i can even put light salt so light salt is like part potassium part sodium and then you just got to throw some magnesium in there and you've got all your electrolytes so i've been drinking this myself and like i plan to sell it one day but it's one of those things where it's like you've got a consumer package good and it's e-commerce like food it's like all the hard things so i'm not i'm not excited about starting it but i also want to but i will say so you know don't sell the liquid right like i think i was gonna do only do powder i bet you could probably do that so i know i've read own the day on your life by marcus albury anyway like a lot of cool things from that book it's like like you know it all but it's like a good read because it's just talks about hey here's how to think about having a successful day as it relates to relationships working out like you know eating like all of this type of stuff but it always talks about and it's something i did for like a year afterwards and now i'm more on the element game but you wake up in the morning you're already dehydrated rather than just like don't drink coffee right away like you know this is all the energy improvement stuff too now but drink a glass of water and squeeze like a wedge of lemon in it and a little bit of salt drink that chill for like 20 minutes and then get your coffee and i started doing that i was like wow this is like maybe placebo sure noticeably different for me and i feel like for your busy juice thing too i could also see like you know maybe something that element's not doing this thing about the magnet magnesium potassium whatever but like even very small particles of dehydrated lemon dehydrated orange could potentially be cool as well so i mean i don't want to just make this an ad for like an electrolyte thing i think the reason i texted it to you from my business standpoint is this is also an idea that i've had for a while there is this entire category that i've talked about for two to three years that i really like but unfortunately the hard to execute upon category and the category is essentially like minimalism in a sense so i really like the idea of detoxing you know using your phone less i really like the idea of meditation i like the idea of fasting things that are essentially removing the stimulus and you know extra things that are constantly sold to us on a daily basis the tough part about that category is like by nature it's hard to create products and services in that category because you want to do less and i think that with element knowing how big it is and i think people are starting to begin to see that they are either you know doing a lot of sales or everywhere i think that doing very niche versions of that would be extremely beneficial so niche versions from one of two ways you know one is the what does it help with okay collagen element can you know for nails and and skin and all that that's starting to get overdone a little bit but the one that i wanted to do was just called like fast right or something like that and it's literally element designed for people who do intermittent fasting like it doesn't break their fast exactly so it's it's you wake up in the morning you put this in the water exactly what i just described here from the beginning of the day side and it's got supplement style margins right you sell you sell the thing for you know 80 90 gross margins on it and you just put it in your water in the morning and you get after it and you drink your black coffee and you have this doesn't break the fast make sure you have your electrolytes no flavoring you can add flavoring if you want whatever but like i think that is a cool concept or you could genuinely just take it and like slap a sport thing on it and to have it be element for soccer element for football element for track whatever what about like even element for like ultra endurance events and you could you could distribute that by just sending free packets to all the races to just put in like the race packets yep l.a marathon a couple years ago and like there was noon everywhere the noon things the idea is not new it's like there's a bunch of these coming out but everyone wants to be the nikes everyone wants to be the something to everyone category like even okay i don't know if you did this like would you always eat before you would go on runs not usually i usually ran fasted same so i feel like a sick name would be run fast yeah and it's like little salt packets before and it's like you know catch a double entendre is that the word where it's like okay you're running in a fasted state make sure you at least have the electrolytes that you need prior to going dude one of the stupidest good ideas that i had about a month ago on this podcast is electrolytes for dogs because i went on a run and i came home and my dog just started licking me which he doesn't normally do and i'm thinking you just need electrolytes like you are leeching my salt then i thought huh if i were like a dog lover i would think oh you poor thing you know like i need i'm not i love my dog but i'm not like a dog person so that you could totally just get literally get some co-packer that has salt magnesium and potassium to put it in a container and just say put this label on it for dogs dog and just sprinkle it on their food i was gonna say everyone's targeting the dog food bowl right like you look at farmer's dog it's a hundred million dollar plus business everyone's targeting the dog food bowl and no one's talking about the dog water bowl and it's just water like literally i same exact story i would i'm down the shore in jersey right now i went swimming in the ocean yesterday i came back and my parents dog was just like looking at my ankle i was like oh yeah you probably want the salt but like you know the most fun thing that happens to a dog's water bowl is people get is you put ice in it right like like there's gotta be something better than that for the dog and especially people who want the supplements or whatever i think even honestly i wonder if it would change the taster if they would notice but like people who give dogs or supplements that's a big category know if anyone is doing dog supplement powders where you just mix it into the water bowl that seems pretty interesting to me i don't know you know dogs don't drink all their water when sitting so maybe like it it recrystallizes or you have to mix it occasionally that might be annoying i don't know if it's viable but i could see that being kind of cool you know what else you could do that isn't like it isn't as easily shippable as a powder but have you ever you ever been deer hunting or anything no i love that yeah so when you go deer hunting you can buy like these salt blocks and you'll put it out there by by the stand and the deer will come and just look at because they need salt i wonder if you could get those like get the same manufacturer to just like break them down into much smaller pieces and just put that like next to the the bowl or like the food bowl or the water bowl because that is one concern is like your customers might over salt the dog and like kill him yeah and it could be a big liability but if it was like if the dog could control the level of salt that he was taking in it could be a different experience altogether oh 100 i i'll also say just that would remind me of a small story that you would appreciate being an ultra runner so i have a friend his name is ryan we grew up in the same town together and the guy is just a savage he runs ultra marathons several times a year like he's done like the moab 240 and like like that was insane it's insane well what the craziest part about it too isn't the moab 240 like i always joke about this it's like 242 miles and they're like yeah we're just gonna round down like when you're at the point where it's so many miles that like you just round down but anyway the guy is not built like a runner he's 5 10 190 pounds stocky guy but he's but he's just mentally different and he was telling me the story where he had one dnf and for listeners right now who don't know what dnfs dnf is did not finish so he's had one dnf in his entire career and the dnf came because he was training here in new jersey all summer for this race i forget what the i think it was bigfoot something one of the bigfoot races that's a one of the other 200 milers it's in uh washington like mount olympus okay so that's 200 yeah yeah so he was training for that and when he's out here training i guess you know this as well like you take salt packets because you sweat so much and it's it's not like you're running a marathon where it's like okay i can get through it like there are points where like if you don't have the salt or electrolyte it's like you're shutting down and so he's taking salt packets out here because it's summertime and he's sweating like crazy and he goes to run the race and he made two mistakes the first mistake he made was he bought salt packets but he like just bought them out of a cvs or whatever and didn't look at them and they were three times the strength of what he had been taking out here yeah and then and then secondly the climate was dramatically different i think if you said washington i thought it was colorado for some reason but like it's like somewhere it was just drier and less humid and so he was sweating less naturally and so he's taken three times more salt and sweating you know call it 30 less and he hit a point where he's like mile 95 and he's like my feet are so swollen that i physically cannot move anymore and like i think he broke some bones and and stuff like that so yeah it's a not not to derail from the from the dog supplement one but it's a crazy story no i've done that because it's really hard to regulate or even know how much salt you need like i i'd run ultra marathons and i'd roll up to an aid station and they'd have salt pills and i'm just like seven sure you know and then like yep i go to change my shoes and my feet look like elephant feet they're insane and then and then i'll start peeing like every 10 minutes on the trail like an insane amount and it's just getting all those fluids out because you've been retaining it so i could totally see that happening they're a crazy business it's also great well sorry actually very unimpressive businesses it seems like from from ryan who i talked to he says how you know he'll go to a race and there are a ton of volunteers and there are like 35 people in the starting line i was like is the is the race making any money he's like no no these people these people just love their stuff i know like i i wonder the same thing they're always begging for volunteers but then they have you know 3 000 entrance paying 200 bucks a piece and i'm like how are you not making money on this what are your thoughts on hyrox okay what is hyrox you don't know hyrox dude i don't i don't know how well so okay so look it up so so hyrox is i think it'll start taking off it is crossfit but different okay it's like a tough mudder but for crossfit yes yeah well well said so so it's how do i explain i'm anyone who listens to this right now that actually does hyrox is going to critique the hell out of my description so i'll read that's fine hey i've never even heard of it summary yes i'll read the summary right now with over 40 plus global races in 2023 seeing over 90 000 athletes and 50 000 spectators welcome to the world series of fitness racing hyrox is a fitness competition that combines an eight kilometer of running and eight functional workout stations it is an indoor hybrid fitness racing event that alternates running the functional exercises it builds itself as the world series of fitness racing and a sport for everybody so so is it like the crossfit games with more running i think it's the crossfit games but more accessible and i think here's the cool thing if so i i do a combination and you know i think my my knees pretty banged up right now so so less so right now but i do a combination of running jujitsu and lifting probably not do as much jujitsu in the future because i'm getting way too hurt but i think people like running in part from the you know the health benefits and setting prs whatever but it's specifically i think that pr element where when you're running you can say damn i should have some time on my splits here or i set a new pr for how far i was able to go and there's like this cool trophy case strava badge you know feeling to it lifting you don't get that as much unless you're sending prs and to be honest like if you're trying to pr all the time like you'll probably get hurt or things just like you you look good you can lift heavy but you don't feel that good all the time because you're just like damn things are tight things i just tweak my back whatever so i think that high rocks is pretty interesting because it gives people back that competitive nature that they want and that people love as a sport but in a more functional way that has maybe hopefully a lower injury rate and it's growing like crazy like if you look at even as google trends on high rocks or you look at all of the gyms that are popping up that are specific gyms for high rocks athletes you'll see that it's consistently been picking up for the last three to five years i think there's a big opportunity to build everything that has already been built for the crossfit space for the you know every other sport in the workspace specifically for high rocks and have a lot of success hmm so high rocks for different sports basically no i think i think different businesses for high rocks okay okay so so let's let's break it down like trx for example trx is a really trx and rogue are two really big crossfit brands and i'm sure that both of them can be applied to high rocks as well but like one thing that high rocks does as an example is they're really big on assault bikes and ski or machines i know that again i've never done this so if people have more information apologies but they're really big on those two machines because it's like kind of functional and it's a little bit more cardio based and pushing yourself like can you develop things that make you better at those machines can you develop a supplement brand as we were talking about before that is the supplement of high rocks you know can you build a content and new site that is specifically for high rocks will you be like i have a buddy who is building a gym right now over in denver where the average membership for that gym is like i said the average amount that people spend every single year that gym is twenty thousand dollars and they're marketing themselves as the premier high rocks gym and they do the blood work testing and they do recovery and and yeah recovery i'm sure is a big one here so i think that there are a lot of opportunities to see how you can make money from this growing sport pig piggyback on high rocks in other ways what's that what it is one thousand percent i like that i can't believe i never heard of it i mean like i've never been involved in crossfit or any of that like i just like to run and ride my bike all by myself for many miles at a time that's all i do yeah well i i mean this this i don't know if you have a competitive nature i don't know if you're running i do more for yourself i think it's worth a shot like i also just like it from the standpoint of you know i've done crossfit before i think crossfit's cool i lately i don't know like i'm about to sound older than i am on this podcast but like dude just starts hurting and i'm like i just tore my meniscus last month i re-herniated the disc three months ago and i'm at this point where i'm like i like i like having hobbies but i also like walking and so i need to start picking my hobbies a little bit more carefully yeah i think i'm built like i'm built like a cadillac i'm i'm like thick and like i don't get injured ever knock on wood but i know that if i run and i cycle like i'm just i'm not fast but i'm just like sturdy i'm just like a v8 i'm not gonna win any races but i'm just i'm just sturdy so that's good that's a good one maybe update your twitter bio built like a cadillac i want to hear about your lead gen business idea because i'm doing something in this right now and it is i i'm like so excited about it and i just want to copy and paste it in all the all the industries all right so this is i was hesitant to share this one because like i genuinely want to start this one but i in the in the spirit of not gatekeeping business ideas and i'll preface with this is if you hear this idea you're like that's a good idea i'm gonna do that just like dm me i'm like let me be a part of it like i'm gonna put money for it in some way or like i don't know anything i want i think it's such a good idea and will 100 work so here's the concept my girlfriend can't burp and there is a large community of individuals who cannot burp that was andrew wilkinson right he just came out yeah he just came out and did this long twitter thread that was all about how he couldn't burp but he fixed it and his life has changed so how did he fix it i don't remember but okay it's there i bet i bet it's what i'm about to describe then so if you're in this subreddit subreddit called r slash no burp there are 30 000 people in there close to 30 000 people and the lately the more i go around drinking and this came up two weeks ago and i'm like drinking at a bar in new york i'll bring up sarah usually drinks wine because the carbonation really upsets her or she'll drink you know twisted teas or some kind of like no carbonated beverage because the carbonation after two or three you're like damn i feel like i have to burp but i can't and it's like really bloating and uncomfortable so here's something that everyone has started to find out who experiences this there is a way to solve this you get botox in your neck very little like not that's that's what andrew wilkinson did i pulled up the tweet as you were talking so we got botox in his neck he didn't say neck but he said botox i believe it's in your neck this is not medical advice i don't want to pretend to come off as a doctor i'm not i think that's the solution based on what i've read and based on what i've researched for my girlfriends but it's like you have this feeling your entire life of like the equivalent of like chugging a beer and a seltzer and then having to hold it in afterwards like like nobody wants that and it is a growing thing there's somewhat of a hereditary thing like i know her mom can't we met some people over the fourth of july and we brought this up they're like i haven't been able to too i thought it was just me like i thought i was this crazy person but like my mom can't either and so i think it's i think it's a little bit hereditary i think it's a bigger thing than most people realize and when the when i say botox like i don't know know maybe i have somewhat of a stigma of this but like it's not like get rid of your wrinkles it's like you look physically no different afterwards but i got again i don't want to pretend like i'm giving medical advice here i think it has something to do with your lymph nodes or something that allows you to contract them and effectively get air out of your stomach i think i think that it would be such a killer and easy idea to start a content website called burp again or whatever you want and make so much content about the subject that i don't like i it would not be hard to rank to the top of google for why can't i burp how to burp again you know like bloating after carbonated beverage things like that and then creating lead gen for local areas where you can refer patients out to botox doctors which i think you know they do a handful of things plastic surgery and all of that other types of stuff and so like you're selling a very high ticket thing like you'll probably get paid very handsomely for these leads and i think it would crush i don't think it would be a 10 million dollar a year business i think that if you do it right and put it on autopilot you can probably get this thing up to doing a couple hundred thousand dollars per year in mostly profit again this is something that like if i had no companies today i would do this tomorrow but unfortunately it's just like not worth the time so if somebody's listening to this and they're like damn i like that concept shoot me a twitter dm connor gross and i'll pay for the money to set it up you have to do all the work and i'll kind of coach you through it a little bit but i love the idea so much i love this idea so i did a little research while you were talking first of all burp again.com is open so you could buy that before before this podcast goes live second of all i pulled up the google keyword planner i looked up botox can't burp i can't burp the competition on all of them is low there are 200 000 average monthly searches for botox alone only in the us and the competition is low so top of page bid is five bucks but it's still low competition 22 year-over-year change so completely sold on this more generally speaking i'm completely sold on lead generation sites with programmatic seo and basically automated ai generated content plus paid google ads like kind of like a three-tier strategy so we're trying this i'll tell you off the podcast what the industry is but we are trying this in an industry right now and i've done a ton of research on google keywords and there's over well over 100 maybe 300 different industries that could well that could go just as well if not better than the industry we chose and we're we're we haven't even launched but we're just putting out ai generated content that fits certain long tail keywords and then we have three different services that we offer in 1000 different us cities so we've programmatically generated 3000 landing pages and we're upping that to 5000 here soon that's just like service in city state service in city state with with like a lead capture form on everyone and we've only indexed like 236 of these 5000 pages so far and every single day it's like more and more and more we're ranking in the top 10 for terms we're getting clicks we're getting leads all of this you're getting leads yes like actual leads purely organic now before i did any of this i tested it with paid google ads and i was like okay i like what i this is really good let's invest some money into seo and it's really working and so we're actually thinking seriously about launching like a programmatic seo agency to where we could do this for others right it's like give me the industry we'll just kind of deliver it tie a bow on it deliver you a package you run the whole business we'll give you some pointers but you're going to pay us three to five six seven grand to just get everything set up for you i love it i think i think the thing that is helpful here is i think you have to create a lot of content around this business model because i think you know affiliate marketers and people who are like deeper in the trenches on the internet know about this all day it's not something that is widely talked about right now they do at least in the communities that you and i run in so i think proving that this can be an effective business model is super important one thing that i missed the mark on and sorry let me actually before i say what i missed the mark on i think the biggest thing for this whether it is a service or a product because i think people do a lot of the affiliate product stuff right now it has to be high ticket it makes no sense totally agree that's it's high ticket and i remember it was over or highly recurring i mean we're it's really it's the same way that right sure yeah yeah high ltv call it that lifetime value and i think one thing that i missed the mark on over covid is i was like i just sold my company i want to get into some kind of affiliate site and i like i've spent a day or two looking up content keywords and i think both my biggest strength and biggest weakness is i have a stupid bias to action where like it's great in most day-to-days when starting new things it tends to be a hindrance because i'm like i don't want to spend the time researching and figuring out if this is the right thing let me just get by the domain start the website you know hire a writer build out a keyword plan and just go after it and i did this it's in the dentistry space so i started i think it was i don't think i own the domain anymore i think it's called like superior smile or something like that and i was like doing lead gen or affiliate sales for water picks for retainers for like all that type of stuff very very low ticket items it wasn't worth the time wasn't worth the energy i shut it down like months later so total waste of time but where i think i missed the mark is i used to own a tiny house blog and the tiny house blog never made that much money i think it made uh a thousand or two thousand dollars in profit every single month but like nothing nothing crazy but like you know we rock we ranked for i bet if i even look it up now we ranked for like best appliances for tiny house best dishwasher for tiny house best furnace for tiny house and what i should have done a better job at is you know we had all this traffic we were doing original content to like i literally hired a writer to script facebook groups and like do like essentially like i don't know what they're called like profile pieces on different people who own tiny houses we should have done way more lead gen for somebody who wants a tiny house built you're selling a 20 30 thousand dollar thing if not arguably more and like people would pay several hundred dollars for that and i should have done that it just looks like it was the lowest priority on my to-do hence why i never got around to it we're buying tiny houses right now for rv parks and you almost can't find them for under 70 grand i mean they go up to one yeah it's way off in the prices yeah exactly so you know i mean there's always a trade-off though there's a trade-off between the volume and the ticket price right so 100 so you've got to find that happy medium yeah what i like about the service one like i think services are better services are for sure better because especially with like and also as i said my idea earlier like big disclaimer big asterisk on all of this i don't know if that's legal i don't know if you can legally sell uh leads in the medical space i think you have i think there are laws around legally selling leads to a legal space like to attorneys and stuff there is for legal i don't know about health care i have no idea either it feels like if there it is for legal maybe it should be for health care but that's a whole other thing but point point being i like the the business model a lot i think you you nailed it with a high ticket and we are doing that in ours but like i was looking up kitchen remodeling no one's bidding on kitchen remodeling that's like a 30 40 000 thing but the other side of the equation that is easy to ignore is you want a buyer of these leads that has a nationwide brand or else you're going to be juggling like hundreds of relationships with these blue collar business owners that are super flaky you know that's a good point so if you can find this venn diagram overlap of like high ticket high volume high search volume low competition and nationwide brands where you can talk to one person and he's like i've got 362 locations in all these cities we'll buy everything you send us that is the gold mine and and i think they do exist but it's hard to find and the other the other asterisk here is what is like what is google's ai going to do to this yeah 100 that's also why i think there's maybe a bigger push again to youtube like at the end of the day you need some level of discoverability all i'll say at least while we're speaking here today in july 17th 2024 like i i am not super worried about that off the bat like you google stuff right now and they show you their ai prompts and like i think google's doing a big disservice to themselves right now in my personal opinion because their ai suggested stuff is so bad that and i don't know if you agree with this but like it's quite literally trained me to automatically skip over it and go to what i'm used to what i'm familiar with now don't get me wrong over the next 10 years younger generations maybe it gets better maybe they start looking at it first and they're like i don't know it's better and then we get made fun of for being the old people who don't doesn't read the ai prompt because it was bad when we first saw it like totally valid but i think there's enough of a cash grab window in the short term and i think that there's there's always going to be people who need to find people and and have like discoverability via google via something yeah and i think no matter what google does with the area ai i think the the localization is important because like i was looking up one of these search terms in clarksville tennessee and let's just say it was it was fence repair clarksville tennessee and there were none right and this isn't actually this isn't true but it was some service in clarksville tennessee and there were zero locations whereas you would think clarksville there's like a hundred thousand people you would think there would be three right and so if i'm google's ai and i want to show you the best answer and someone searching fence repair clarksville tennessee even that like programmatic website they're going to show you because what else are they going to show you whereas if you're competing on a worldwide or a nationwide level they might like all those little gimmicks and hacks they might not ever get shown in the new ai right they might show you the most relevant thing and only one instead of pages of 10. another thing that i like about this programmatic idea is i compare it to like roll-ups private equity roll-ups i love roll-ups because there's so many industries to roll up and so it's like there's not a lot of competition in a lot of these like i heard a podcast about a guy that rolled up music schools only in denver and sold it for 40 million dollars right like who's thinking of rolling up music schools they're like let's do self-storage let's roll up dentists let's like all the obvious stuff but there's still thousands of industries that will be rolled up and some of them might take two decades just because there's so many and people don't think of it and so i think of this opportunity that same way where yeah the the growth hackers and the gray hat guys and the black hat wizard and all those guys have heard about this and they've been doing this for years but there's still so many random niches and opportunities that they haven't even thought of yet yeah and also like that's just the nature of it right like there are more popping up every single day if you started a lead gen for people to sign up for their first high rocks race right like new industry brand new thing like people people want that and so like if you have a great topical authority for how to get fit and like do it in an evergreen niche you'll always have more opportunities i think afterwards and that's also why people always stress the email list stuff and being able to own your audience like there are certainly benefits and advantages towards that as well i was just you mentioned in the roll-up part in general not to derail the conversation but one thing that i think is pretty cool is i was having conversations with this one guy down in south florida last christmas and he is starting a franchise where all he does is he buys chiropractor shops i think in terms of like business models and changing you know everyone who owns and buys software is very familiar with the reoccurring revenue model and how that can increase multiples and how that's like such a good business model he's buying chiropractor shops and all he's doing is he's changing the pricing model from you know if it's i don't know what the numbers are so i'm gonna get this wrong let's say it's 120 to visit a chiropractor and you go once a month he's gonna charge people 200 per month on a reoccurring revenue and you get unlimited cracks let's be honest you know certain things this works really better well with others it doesn't amc launches their movie pass like do you want to go to the movie theaters more than two times a month to make it worth it probably not but on the contrary too like i know people who buy car washes and they sell an unlimited car wash plan because you're paying 15 for your normal car wash but what if you pay 25 and every time you drove by you can get it done well guess what the cost of water and soap is negligible and the amount of times that you're actually going to use it versus it being nice in theory is low and so i like the idea too of taking those businesses that are usually one-off and they're there's something you do on a reoccurring basis but like not crazy often and saying do unlimited numbers of times but you're also going to be paying a monthly subscription that's genius like and he's of course he's he's doing that because it's already proven out like it just works right if it works in dustin florida it's going to work in bellevue washington you can do it with like teeth whitening too like unlimited yeah i mean do you yeah i don't know why there's such a dumb thought on mine i was like do you need to get it done more than once but yeah i drink enough coffee that i can imagine getting it done more than once would be helpful what about haircuts you just got the haircut coming out with a fresh cut would you pay something i wouldn't because i'm so cheap dude i go like three months between haircuts just because i get busy and i don't i don't really care what my hair looks like i'm married what i got to worry about that's a good point but that is i do like that idea though i think it would work in new york i also think it would work well because the type of person that wants a lot of haircuts throughout the month has shorter hair and so it's not like it would take super long especially if you're going frequent enough where it's like hey not a whole hell of a lot has happened in the last week but like i just want to get like lined up before friday night out or something like that yeah i'm wondering like how you could go into it like a barber shop and have them test just so you could like be a passive observer and see if it works then once it works it's like all right i'm gonna buy a thousand barber shops i yeah i bet it would work yeah 100 there's got to be one out there that does that i would have to think i bet there is reach out to them see it see if life's better or worse they're like yeah this one guy comes in every single day he's so annoying all he wants to do is talk you know there's probably you gotta put some rules around it your card didn't process this month bro sorry yeah for real well i know you've got a hard stop but thank you for joining connor where can we find
