There's a company in Silicon Valley that just raised $50 million and it's just a sales agent. It's a rapper. Rappers are raising eight figures.

A week ago, nothing was more low status than being a GPT rapper. It turns out they were just early to the game and that's all that matters. Automation has already saved us thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars worth of payroll.

AI in general is the greatest leverage point that organizations have to expand output without increasing headcount. Everybody listening, consider the door open. You just have to walk through it.

Okay. This is part two with me and Sam talking all kinds of crazy ideas. Part one was exactly a week ago today.

Let me know what you think. Did you see this tweet from Greg Eisenberg about deep seek and about chat GPT rappers and all that? I don't know.

I'm going to read this real quick because you're going to love this. Listeners are going to love this. So a lot of talk about rappers like, oh, it's just a chat GPT rapper.

There's nothing proprietary about it. And for those listening, a rapper is just something built on chat GPT that you could do 90% of within chat GPT. Built like around, around it.

Yeah. Anyway, he says deep seek just proved the quote worthless GPT rapper startups are actually the ones with real moats. A week ago, nothing was more low status than being a GPT rapper.

But I think we're learning that's dead wrong. Turns out they were just early to the game. And that's all that matters.

While deep seek meta anthropic and Microsoft battle over benchmark scores, these rapper companies have been quietly building the only moat that matters. Interface loyalty, which I have never heard that phrase before. And I'm obsessed with it.

I'm gonna keep going. Because of how big owning the LLM is for the national defense and the economy, the next breakthrough model is always two weeks away. Deep seek launches today.

Someone else drops a better one tomorrow. Someone compared open AI to AOL, right? Like they put down the rails.

They're the first, but they're not gonna be the last. Which I don't know if I agree with, but interesting take. Anyway, he says getting millions of people to make your product part of their daily workflow.

That's the real barrier to entry. Dude, I'm gonna read that again. Getting millions of people to make your product part of their daily workflow.

That is the real barrier to entry. Chat GPT didn't win because it had the best model. It won because it was dead simple to use.

The interface. And I think it has staying power because of that. This is why all those AI startups we dismiss are actually positioned to win.

They're not competing on model performance. They're competing on being the default way humans interact with AI. Frontier models are becoming commodities.

User habits aren't. While everyone obsesses over the next architecture breakthrough, the real game is being played in the interface layer. The moat isn't the model.

It's being the tool people reach for without thinking. Technology advantage is temporary. Interface lock-in is forever.

Keep shipping those wrappers, my friend. So, dude, what I was gonna say about your app is like people are gonna use that app for the next 20 years because it's their recipe app. My wife gets her recipes from Mel's kitchen cafe.com.

And we know Mel. She's a household name. She has all the stupid preamble about everything.

She has all the ads, but her recipes are great. Guess what? Like she's been using Mel forever because she knows the interface.

She's used to it. But she was switching a heartbeat to something without all that crap. And your users will too.

Once they learn how to cook with that thing, they're never like, you're gonna have a thousand competitors in a month, but none of your customers will even know they exist because they won't be looking for them. Yeah. And that's what, that's the logic is like, dude, the market is so big.

I'm just trying to make a land grab at it. And like, that's it. Like I'm with everything that he is saying.

We not around an AI rapper, but we experience very similar with creative OS, like a big, a big through line that we talk about is how do we continue to ingrain ourselves in the Facebook ad management workflow? Because now when people are going to start running, testing new ads, running new ads, they come to us first. Like there are other templates on the internet.

Don't get me wrong. Like decent ones. But like everyone just comes to us.

It's where they have their saved folders. They're saved inspiration. They're saved like.

Interface loyalty. We're selling a commodity. It's ad templates.

Like you can go find templates for creatives on Canva. Right. But like people like using OS for that saying, and it's like, it's the wrapper.

Like we wrapped our templates, which like templates equals AI in this AI chat GPT wrapper world of like wrapping something that is a commodity. And something that is not. And it works.

Like it's the, it's the lock in on, on the brand loyalty and all of that. And like, again, it goes back even when we talked about it of like, even just the mass market. We talked about selection bias last time.

It's like very much like all of us exist in this like kind of Twitter bubble or like LinkedIn bubble, whatever, where it's like, dude, people don't like, if I say the word deep seek to my sister, she'd be like, it's a new Indian restaurant. She was like, yeah. She's like, what are we talking about?

What do you mean? Like perplexity? Nobody knows.

Right. And so it's like the implementation of those tools specifically like into lifestyle or workflow, like doesn't mean anything to anybody. But like instant chef does.

And it's, it's open AI. It is chat GPT. Well, I'm not even, I'm not even building a custom model or training it.

I'm just like going to let it rip and trust that the user is only going to ask it cooking questions and that it can answer cooking questions. And you know, they're going to, they're going to start using it as their chat GPT. The grandma's that don't know about chat GPT.

They don't know. They're going to be like, they're going to tell their grandkids, you have to download instant chef to help you with your homework. And they're like, what are you talking about?

It's like, yeah, dude, it just helped me build my workout plan, dude. I don't know. It's so capable.

You know what I mean? It's like, but that sort of stuff, like, I think what, what Greg is saying is, is spot on is like, we're in an interesting position from a market. Market saturation space.

I saw even your, your video of the chat GPT operator doing the Facebook outreach. And it's like, dude, those people have no idea that that's even possible. Like zero.

You could build a wrapper that does that for people like flippers, people selling stuff. Like bro. It's like the wrapper game is unreal.

Like, cause all technology is really at the end of the day is like data. And the ability to move and manipulate that data and then display it to an end consumer. The back half of that is like, dude, there's 9 million APIs.

Every software tool has one. Like you can like, you can always get and manipulate data super easily. Yeah.

Whether it's the open AI. I, I've been playing around with the Apollo API from a lead gen clay. Right.

Like there's a billion. And those are all rappers. Like they're all rappers.

But you, even you like the techiest of tech and you're using Chad GPT. Like we're still using rappers. Right.

We're not the use case for like, it's an interface. It's a specialty. It's like, like, why don't you use your tax guy for your bookkeeping?

He can do it. Like, cause I gotta, I want a bookkeeping guy. Bookkeeping guy is just a rapper for the tax guy or vice versa.

Right. Right. Right.

Yeah. It's all, it's all that. And so I think it, it, the nice part, the benefit to like people specifically, like with, you know, knowing your audience, like people that are trying to kind of step into entrepreneurship or like any of that.

I think like, I'm a big first principles guy of like, dude, I promise it's not as complicated as it sounds like launching an AI powered chef app is like not some crazy situation. Like you find a contractor and those, this thing that plugs into open AI. Like I don't need to go build a custom model around this perfect AI chef.

It's like, no, like chat GPT open AI is spending all of their money making the best AI chef. Yeah. That's what they're doing.

I just have to get into the market. They're not pushing paid ads to chefs. They're not, yeah, they're not running ads at their use case being this perfect chef situation.

And that's the opportunity. Like, could you imagine if they were, if they had like a hundred marketing people throw, throwing Facebook ads? I mean, that'd be cool for them.

I mean, to be honest, they do. They have B, they have you, they have all of, right? Like theirs is the classic, like B to B to C like product.

Like they're selling it to businesses. So businesses can sell it to consumers. Yeah.

Like they're making their money. You know what I mean? And so it's like, it's up to us as that middleman business to then take what they're creating, which is so powerful and turn it into something that's like an applicable use case.

Why not just build a literal chat GPT rapper? That's literally just chat GPT with a different name. And it has really big letters.

All the font is big and you just push it with paid ads to people over 55, 60 years old. People are doing it. People are doing it.

That's it, dude. You just call it like life helper and it has big text. Literally.

And it's chat GPT. Ask it anything. Yeah.

60 bucks a year. You know, like, again, it's like first principles. I think I'll speak for myself.

Like, you know, that meme that's like the, the idiot. And then it like goes up to the guy. Yeah.

It would. Yeah. It's that.

And I was spending so much time as the midwit at almost out of like. It's an ego or a pride thing. It's ego.

It's like, I want to be like so smart that I have all these things or whatever. And it's like, dude, to be honest, like, I think I can just stack a bag slinging an AI wrapper on Facebook ads. Like, it's like going back, like, dude, like drop shipping.

Like, no, it's just, you're just running ads. You find something that works and you let it rip. And now I'm switching back.

I'm going back down the midwit side to the, well, maybe to the dumb side. I don't know which side I'm on, but it doesn't really matter. I'm just going to run more ads.

And like, that's literally like my entire thesis for the next, like forever is like run more ads at consumer products. And I just like the monetization model and the equity model and everything of software. Yeah.

And so it's like, I'm just going to drop. I'm like literally going to drop ship software where I just spend a thousand dollars to build a prayer app, a cooking app, a workout app, a productivity app, a life helper app, a like whatever I can think of. And just run ads because the asymmetric risk is like, oh, what happens?

What's the worst? I lose five grand. But like my upside is 30K and ARR in an asset that's worth a hundred grand.

It's like, I'll make that bet every day. Here's what you're going to learn. You're going to run these ads and I'm just completely making this up.

And for whatever reason, you're going to learn that Asian Americans are the one paying and downloading for it, downloading it. Right. And you're like, interesting.

I really can't get a good cost per acquisition from anyone except Asian Americans in Washington, Oregon, and the Northeast. Huh? And then you're going to pay another $800 and you're going to build like an Asian cooking app, same thing.

And then you're just going to, and then that's going to be the final thing that makes your bag. Like that's usually how these go. Like where you start is not where you finish.

And that's the whole point. A hundred percent. Like you start throwing, I mean, it's, it's unlimited content was the same thing.

It was an add on service that then we turned into a standalone because we're like, oh, this is what people actually want. Like, you know? And so I think, I think it's like, so iterative and it's like, I don't, yeah, I'm not sitting here thinking the template that I bought for this recipe app is God's gift.

So the chefs, like, but it will be at some point when I have six of them and like, that's the other piece, like to your points, like, why would I not have six? Why would I not spin up vegan keto? Yeah.

Healthy, not healthy. You know what I mean? Yeah.

It's the same thing. I'm doing another, I'm doing a B2B version of this too right now. Okay.

And so a little bit more expensive of a buy-in six grand, maybe five grand. I don't remember. And when you're doing cold outreach, you're using Apollo and instantly and like all of these different tools to like go and send these cold emails, which is awesome.

If you're like trying to go and bulk send, I want to send 10,000 emails. That's awesome. I also think specifically in the digital service provider world that there's a lot of boutique agencies and freelancers that like, aren't trying to send a thousand cold emails a month.

Like, I think that they want to connect with like five decision makers a month. Yeah. And so I'm basically just taking the contact data from Shopify store decision makers that are doing less than half a million dollars a month, right?

Cause that's higher propensity or higher odds that they want to work with freelancers or need external support. And then I'm just putting them all into a searchable, savable database with one click email. You just click the button that says connect and it loads in a little prompt, a little cold email script and you hit send.

And that's it. You don't have to, we're not talking about anything and it's just API wrappers. Like I'm just loading in contact data and enriching it.

It's like a DIY niche cold emailing. Yeah. Rapper.

Like if you, if your target market is Shopify stores or direct consumer brands, like you just sign up for, and I'm going to charge way less to build a legit cold email stack. You're spending three to $500 a month between lead list generation, enrichment, cold email, like all the things. I'm like, why would you not just want to sign up for $200 a year?

Yeah. Cause my cost is negligible and it's the same model. It's like, do I think that there are a thousand freelancers or a thousand agencies that would pay 200 bucks a year to be able to one click email decision makers at whatever brand they want?

Yeah. 200 K and ARR. It's beautiful.

That on autopilot, like, like, and I'm not sitting here being like, you know what I'm going to try to do is go compete with Apollo. And I don't really want to. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

Do I think I can make 200, $300,000 a year on a relative autopilot just by spending $5,000 and running some ads. And then it's like, I'm either cash flowing that money. Cause I'll have no team.

No, like I could have a VA run it for 1200 bucks a month. And then it's like, all right. It either sits there in cash flows or I sell it for, I mean, 200 on a half a million to a million dollars.

Right. Like, and it's, it's just a wrapper. If the ads don't convert very well, then you just switch it from Shopify decision makers to healthcare decision makers.

Like, and try that. And that's how I had him build it. I said, all I need to do is dual.

It's a, it's a relational database with two sides, company person. That's it. I'm just doing brands first because I have boys that run newsletters and direct consumer agency world.

And I can just go to them and say, Hey, I'll give you a hundred bucks for everybody. You get to sign up. Like call it a day.

Dude. Speaking of e-com, tell me about that guy that, you know, that has that he's making bank with Shopify affiliate links on Instagram. Oh yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. What's the play there?

Yeah. So basically I don't know if it's the same program now, but like middle to end of last year, you're gonna have to remind me some of the numbers. I don't remember exactly, but it was like, you sign up for, you get them to sign up for a dollar.

And then if they, it's like a dollar for their first, like a dollar a month for your first three months. And they were paying out like a hundred dollars in commission for people that signed up for that Shopify was. Yeah.

Yeah. Which like, he's, he's big enough. Like he's got, I don't know if it was a custom deal, but like they probably hooked him up, but then he was running ads and organic at a many chat automation that literally just pushed people out affiliate link.

And they stopped selling all of their econ courses, drop shipping courses. They stopped all of that. Give it all the way for free.

Wow. Just to do this funnel, just to do this program. Well, wasn't the genius part was that he was giving them like a free AI website builder.

Yeah. He partnered with another, whatever app. And he was like, get a free Shopify store.

We will literally build your Shopify store for you. And like, they'd swipe up, sign up for that dollar. He'd get paid.

Then they'd upload the theme or whatever it was. And so it was just a phenomenal angle on that offer. Not like get a free Shopify account.

It was like, yeah. Cause what do I do with that? Get a free Shopify store.

Like, what do I do with a Shopify store? Right. Yeah.

He's taking away all that friction. Yeah. It's like, you could literally just start running ads immediately by swiping up on his story, like in two minutes, like crazy.

Oh, okay. Dude, I want to switch, switch topics. So you saw my tweet.

You should do that for go high level. I was just thinking that, like, I need to partner with someone that offers like go high little templates, right? You should, you don't need to, you don't need to partner.

With anybody just go and use theirs. They have so many. And so like, I mean, I'd give you mine from unlimited.

Like an automated local service review automation, right? Yes. We will build like literally, literally.

So, okay. And in theory, you could charge more in white label because high level lets you white label. And so you could turn it into a digital service business pretty easily.

If you want to work on that, we'll keep our other stuff quiet. But like, if you want to work on that, I know how to do it. So video is cool, but you know, what's better long form audio via podcast and my newsletter, TKO pod.com.

Go there to subscribe for free to my newsletter. It's one email a week, very tactical. And then go to my audio podcast, three episodes a week, stuff like this.

You're going to love it. All free. No sleazy sales pitch.

TKO pod.com. Have you played around with a $200 a month opening? Dude, you almost got me to sign up for it last night.

You got it. And then I just didn't, but I will. You got to do it.

I will. So I posted the video for those who didn't see it. It was on, it's on YouTube and Twitter.

Thank you. It's me like asking people if I can, if they will pay me $200 to pick up their free piano, right? Automated.

And it like, it fills out the spreadsheet for me. And it's just like, when my mind is blown about technology, that's saying something. Cause I'm in the game.

Like I'm looking at this stuff all the time. Anyway, so I spent an hour this morning playing with it and I had it do four things. Okay.

I had it log into my Beehive account, scroll through all my newsletters, click on the poll that I put in every newsletter that says, how did you like this? Good, bad, great top tier. And I had it put everything in a spreadsheet for me.

Cause that's very tedious. There's no way to export it. It's something I was going to have to have my assistant do.

It did it for me while I worked. Okay. So now I know my highest ranked newsletters so I can improve my welcome flow so I can decrease my churn on my newsletter.

Yep. Awesome. Then I went back to Facebook marketplace and I said, I want you to search nationwide on Facebook marketplace for Gosney pizza ovens.

Find the same model. Compare prices. Find the, the rock box pizza oven.

That is grossly underpriced compared to market. And I want you to log all these in a spreadsheet with the link. Boom.

It gets to work and I'm just watching it. You ready for it? Now here's the crazy part.

I said, every time it would find one, it was like, all right, I found one. Is this good? I was like, stop asking me that.

Just put it in the spreadsheet. It's going to be good. It's stop asking.

Don't ask for permission every time. Just do it. Right.

So then this is what blew my mind. I went a step further and I said, move faster. And it did.

No way. It moved faster. And I'm like, okay, there's some technical limitations.

It just started. And I'm like, what is happening here? Hell yeah.

All I had to do was ask. Yeah. And so it did that blew my mind because here's, here's what I'm thinking.

And I'm not about to start this, but you know, people listening, like retail arbitrage is like the lowest hanging fruit of making money. Right. Yeah.

So if I'm selling stuff in my garage, I'm not going to listen on eBay because there's more friction. I got to ship it. It's a pain.

I'm going to put it on Facebook marketplace, even though I know it's worth less there. So I'm going to list it locally, yada, yada, yada. So what this bot can do is it can go find everything that's on Facebook marketplace.

That's underpriced. And then it can get an offer in place. Hey, I'll buy this 150 bucks.

Sure. Once it has the verbal yes, then it can copy and paste those pictures, put it on eBay, listed at 300 bucks. Buy it now.

Let's say market price is 350, 400. Sells within a day. You sell it.

Then you go back to the Facebook buyer or Facebook seller and say, all right, what's your Venmo? You Venmo them. Here's my address.

You give them the address of the buyer on eBay. You never take possession of the dang pizza oven. And it's just it's drop shipping through a bot.

It's literally what I did when I first started all of this when I was like 13 was doing that exact thing on eBay with iPhones. Same. I did that with iPhones.

Literally. All it was was like, cause buy it now or like buy now had come out. So it superseded the auction and people just wanted to buy stuff now and they'd pay a premium on eBay for it.

And so then I would just list every iPhone I could find. Yeah. Right.

And like buy now prices 20, 30% higher than what I knew I could get it for at auction. And then people would buy mine and I'd go to all the auctions that were about to end. And then I'd be like, and I knew my margin.

And so I was like, cool, I can pay up to 130 bucks for this iPhone 4S. Right. I get it for 110, change my address to the one that they had and it would just ship and I'd make my $20 split.

I was messing around in like eighth grade doing that exact same thing. And now you can do it with AI. In a hundred years.

Yeah. And the pizza ovens it was finding were actually like really well priced. Like they were actually good deals.

And I chose pizza ovens because I know the market and I wanted to know how good it was or not. And then, so on another podcast episode, I talk about this idea called nevercallagain.com where you use AI agents to call and get a bunch of quotes with a one click. Right.

Yeah. So using that framework, I'll literally read you my prompt right here. Are you ready for this?

I'm ready. This is my exact prompt. I said, gather catering quotes for a wedding in Dallas, Texas for 50 people featuring steak and two sides.

Reach out to 10 different caterers through the not.com using an excessively friendly tone in your communications. Provide the following contact information for the inquiries. Use May 11th as a tentative wedding date when required and submit these.

So I'm reading this, but this actually isn't my prompt. I saved the task and it redid my prompt based on everything that I asked it after because my original prompt was just like wedding in Dallas for 50 people. I didn't even say a date.

And then it goes to the not. And I thought it was going to have to create an account, but it didn't. It found a way around creating an account.

I didn't know that was possible. It starts reaching out to caterers and it chose May 11th for me. And I'm like, how did you get May 11th?

And it was like, well, it seems like a good enough time to prepare for a wedding. I was like, let's roll with that. Yeah.

And it starts reaching out to these caterers. And then I was like, move faster. And it did.

And then I start getting emails back from caterers that think I'm having a wedding. That's sick. As I worked.

That's sick. What are we doing? That's sick.

All right. You convinced me. I'll sign up tonight.

I'll be playing around. Lauren's going to be like, what are you doing over there? Like, dude, playing in the wedding.

Dude. Two more use cases. I said, go to Zillow.

Find me a for sale by owner home. That's significantly less than the Zestimate. It needs to be at least three months old.

It took 12 minutes, but it found me. Like it found one for me. Like if I were a flipper, boom, there's one that I could flip.

Immediately. Dude. And then I say, go to AliExpress.

Find me 10 companies that will send me free samples. And I said, I'm going to assume that the products on the homepage of AliExpress are trending. They're viral.

They're best sellers. So just use the homepage as your guide. Yeah.

And it starts messaging sellers about earbuds. I got people trying to send me free samples of earbuds from China now. So good.

What is happening? So good, dude. Talk me through the tangibles of this, right?

And so can you have multiple operators running at once? I don't think so. But you know what?

Let me try right now. I'll answer that question right now. Two tabs open, baby.

You know what I mean? That's if that's all it takes. I'm going to open this tab.

And so then the login function for you is what? You just take over the screen and log into whatever your account is on the browser that they have. So like Zillow as an example or Facebook.

Yeah. I'll show you how it works. So find a dirt cheap flight leaving from DFW to either LAX or JFK sometime over the next six months.

Non-stop under $100 round trip on Google flights. You ready for this? I'm ready.

Let's see what happens. Can you see it okay? This goes back to that trip trip idea that I had.

A literal travel agent. Remember I made the AI like travel planner? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah. Literally that, dude. This takes it a step further.

Yeah, this goes. I'll actually do it for you. All right.

So for those listening and not watching, it opens up Google flights. It's typing in DFW. And it literally behaves like a human.

Right. It will click the wrong thing. It'll go back.

Like you've seen bots, right? I've watched a bot control my screen. And it's like, it's a computer.

It's tactical. It's binary. It's like, dude, click.

Like it doesn't make mistakes. Right. But like, I feel like the genius of this is that it does make mistakes.

It looks like human behavior. Yeah. It's like Scott's cheap flights.com.

Right? That's like a $20 million business. You pay $100 a year to get cheap flights.

I don't need that. Right. I could run a task to do this for me every morning.

So sick. You watching it? Yeah.

And then at any point I can take control. But you see this. I've only given it one prompt.

Look. Right. $69.

$69. $69. Flight from DFW to LAX on April 1st.

I'll see you April 1st. Come on. I don't have an excuse now.

You kind of have to, dude. It's only $69. Dude, that is really cheap actually.

I know. Holy cow. When you said some $100, I was like, dang, that's a stretch.

But hey. Yeah. Look, there it is.

It says right here, worked for two minutes. There's the entire log. It takes a screenshot of what it does so I can go back and look.

I found a round trip flight from DFW to LAX and Google Flights for $69 with Frontier. The departure is on April 1st. Return on the 8th.

It's non-stop flight. You can view the details. That's crazy.

Should I say book it? Yeah. I'm unable to book it.

Interesting. Anyway. So like my mind is just blown.

Like I'm not sleeping tonight. I'm just going to keep playing with this. I'm with you.

I'm about to get deep in the weeds. It's just a growth hacker's dream. And the moment that it gets super interesting is when that can start to happen without the oversight to the same degree.

And running multiple at the same time. Right? Because it's like all of a sudden.

The big thing that I've been thinking about on that is just like where does. And we do it with not AI so much with automation though. Within all of our service businesses.

Right? Like how we automate as much as possible. But it's like at what.

Like where are the human checkpoints? Like when is it right for us? We kind of draw the line at human conversation.

Like I won't send a AI generated email to a client without a human looking at it. But at some point I feel like that won't be the case. And you can have AI check AI.

Be like does this match this. You know what I mean? Yeah.

Checking in on each other. Yeah. Like here's what's good.

And so I'm curious around some of that. Cause it's like, I mean automation. Zapier as a very like broad stroke for people like has already saved us thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars worth of payroll.

Right. And it's like, this is the next layer of that where it's truly, they branded it extremely well. I'm a fan of operator, right?

Yeah. Like perfect. And operator.

It logs everything in a blank spreadsheet. I don't put any column headers in there. So I just figured out by the way, to answer your question, I opened a tab.

I duplicated the tab in one of them. I started a new prompt and I said, now do DFW to Orlando. And the other one, I said, find me a flight from DFW to Seattle.

And they're both running at the same time. How many tabs can I do? That's what I'm saying.

You have a little army going right now. Thank God for ARC, huh? I'm a fan.

I'm a fan of ARC browser. ARC browser. Oh, dude.

You're going to have a whole workspace, like a whole new space. That's literally just all operators. You just name them whatever they're doing.

Why wouldn't I? Dude, I'm going to get so much done this year. Are you kidding me?

Well, and it's like, you could have, again, like, you hire one project manager that just like lives in ARC with eight operators. Yeah. And agents.

And yeah, dude, there's a company in Silicon Valley that just raised $50 million and it's just a sales agent. Right. It's a rapper.

It's an agent that goes out and finds leads for you. So sick. Like rappers are raising eight figures.

Yeah. As they should. Because again, it's like the underlying tech.

Like we think about it at unlimited a lot. Right. Like we're AI powered blog content.

Right. And like, that's why we're able to, to get people SEO results for way less money. And it's like the backend tools in AI that we use is the commodity.

We can find a better tool and just swap it out. We actually did. We upgraded our entire system today.

Yeah. And it's like, oh, our content quality just went up or now we're going to rank higher. Like not in like our clients, like they don't care if it's open AI or perplexity or like, it doesn't matter.

And so you just like can play the game on the top by being the rapper and none of them are going to like churn because we aren't using this tool anymore as our, like, it just needs to work. Right. And so it's like, if you can then, you know, say you build it on open AI and perplexity comes out with something crazy.

That's better for your use case. You just switch it over. As long as you're still delivering the value to your customer, they don't care.

What are some other use cases for this operator that you want to play around with? It's an interesting one. When you're a hammer, everything's a nail, right?

I'm, I'm testing things that are familiar to me, proximity bias, but you're an idea guy. What's relevant in your world? The use case that I want is a SEO, like keyword research, competitor research for Facebook ads.

Like, Hey, can you go in and, you know, create a spreadsheet of all of the Facebook ad links for my competitors? Like things like that. And like, cause you can get pretty specific, right?

Like we do a, uh, creative OS too with our inspiration boards. And it's like, can you find me 20 ad creatives from a search Atlas that have all been running for more than 30 days and log their URLs in a Google sheet. I'm doing something a little different, but I had a similar idea.

So for those listening, I shared my screen and I said, go to the Facebook ad library and find an ad that's been running for over three months in the fitness niche in the U S and Sam explained to everyone why this would be valuable. Uh, cause you want to know exactly what your competitors are spending the most money on as a soft indicator of what's performing the best. Mm-hmm so that you can then go and create similar content that has higher likelihood to perform.

So it's choosing a category dude. This is so cool. Dude.

Like I'm not even finessing it. It's just, right. My prompt is like 13 words long.

Right. I'm going to blow this up one sec. Here we go.

Now it hasn't set a filter yet. It will date. It will.

I was like, I have faith in this thing, dude. There it is. Oh, don't click.

No, no, it's not. Oh my God. Go faster.

Go faster. Type it. Just type.

Oh yeah. Yeah. Go faster or type the date in manually.

So for those listening, the Facebook ad library date filter starts in 2018. So the agent is like clicking month by month, by month, by month. Yeah.

It's crazy how it's so smart in some ways and it's so dumb and others. Yeah. Yeah.

But now it says entering the from date manually. And sure enough, there it is. October 1st.

First. Yep. 50,000 fitness related ads in the Facebook ad library, yada, yada, yada.

Should I narrow down the results? Yes. This prompt is really broad.

Find the ones that are winners. I wonder what it'll take that to mean. One thing that we do in the EU, they're required to give you like estimates of how much money has been spent on those ads.

And so we use that as a soft indicator. You told me about that. Yeah.

This is the meta ad library in the EU you're saying? Yeah. Yeah.

I don't mean, I don't remember exactly how we do it, but we pull that data into creative OS to give like what we call our performance indicator of like, if these things are being run for longer than X amount of time or spent more than X in total dollars, they would be considered winners. Okay. Because like you're not spending a hundred thousand dollars on a single ad creative if it's losing you money.

Yeah. Like it means it's working. Change it from on or after October 1st to on or before.

Because you want it to be ads that. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. And longer. It's still showing the newest ones.

Yeah. Like I don't care about an ad that's been running for four hours. Like we don't know anything about that ad.

And I'm going to have it look for AI cooking apps. Hell yeah. Hell yeah.

Brother. Hey, I cooking guys haven't been around for more than three months. Dude.

We'll see what it shows. Do you ever look at sensor tower? What's that?

It shows how many downloads apps are getting for free. Oh, sick. You've got to check that out.

I'm looking at her. I know. Hell yeah.

I'm excited to play in the consumer app space a little bit. Yeah. Dude, I found one cooking AI assistant.

Let's see. Are you sick of working your butt off posting? I don't know where it went.

I think it's at the top of this page. It needs to scroll up. Look, so I can take control here.

Right. That started right today. It's the, it didn't change the time filter.

Oh, okay. There's a tie cooking app. Yep.

There you go. I like the one on the left. AI GPT app.

AI chatbot for quick solutions and cooking help. That's the all in one app, dude. Yep.

That's what we're talking about. Yep. It's funny.

Cause my daughter had like a chat GPT app on her watch, but it wasn't the right one. It was just someone like keyword stuff. Literally dude.

It's crazy. Like they're litter. Like you say that when you were, you were like joking about it, but like, no, there are dudes that are literally just running rappers that are just straight AI.

I. That's just my gosh. Yeah.

All right. I'm going to change the date right here. Oh, I should have done this.

See, dude, even humans make mistakes. And see what I think it will do. Did you see that weird finger there?

Yeah. You can, you can show it what to do. And then it will like mimic your behavior.

Super interesting. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. That tracks. Oh, there's so much to play with dude.

Yeah. So it found one, but it's not an app anyway. Yeah, dude, this is just, it's crazy.

Like you're stupid to not just play around with this stuff all night long. Yeah. Like just find whatever the use cases, you know, it's like, especially for like solo shops, dude, like, like AI in general is the greatest leverage point that like sub five person organizations have to like expand output without increasing headcount.

And now, I mean, we're doing it as well. And like trying to continue to use it a lot more. Yeah.

It's an interesting one. Like it's, it's just opens the door, dude. Like consider the door open.

Everybody listening, consider the door open. You just have to walk through it. Yeah.

Yeah. Everything is just different forever. It's actually insane.

Well, dude, I literally have a headache. Like I just get so fired up about this. I need to take my, my daily boomer Tylenol for my 38 year old.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
