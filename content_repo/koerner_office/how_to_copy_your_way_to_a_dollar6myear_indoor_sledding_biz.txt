that ski resort had a webcam up on their snow tubing their whole season and so the so you can guess where i'm going with it this season before i literally just sat there with a clicker i've got it somewhere i need to find it and it's pretty easy to figure out how successful something like that is welcome to the corner office i think you're gonna love this one why because you love the last time i interviewed matthew ayers he was the guy that started the alpine slide business episode 29 to be exact we had a follow-up episode because we just couldn't get it all out so he talked all about his business pigeon forge snow and the subdivision that he's putting in and other random business ideas he's a cool guy i think you're gonna like it please like subscribe and share with your friends thank you when we last left off you have mentioned the pigeon forge snow but we didn't really get into what made you think to start that what did you see that triggered that idea what was the startup process like funding it like first month first year i want to hear the pigeon forge snow story because it's such a unique business yeah so that's a lot of questions right there i guess to give somebody a recap so pigeon for snow is a indoor snow park it's mainly uh snow tubing and it is actually the first it was the first of its kind in the u.s and so what i mean by that is it is actually first off it's temperature independent which means that it is not sub-zero so it's call it 65 to 70 degrees in the building at all times maybe sometimes people reference one and maybe dubai or whatever and those are sub-zero you you got to wear jackets or be really cold so so there's one and then the second thing is sometimes there's some snow parks but they're not open year long and yeah ours is year-long indoor temperature independent snow park so big word there i created this indoor snow park and a lot of people ask like how did i come up with that and as much as i would love to say that it was just my idea i actually took inspiration from another business about 30 or 45 minutes away there's a ski resort an outdoor ski resort and they have snow tubing every year from thanksgiving to to easter they guarantee it and so i was like how is that possible sometimes it's 70 degrees sometimes it's raining all that kind of stuff and so what i found out was they use these machines that basically make the snow inside these giant containers and they spit it out and they basically pile up snow all year long so people can snow tube and that really from the outside looking in is a critical part to their business because they can guarantee that so my next question was okay if they can do that can i just build a building and control the temperature and control the conditions and blow snow just like them and the answer was yes and once we enclosed the building we had to overcome other factors what do we do with all the melt and i one thing that i learned very quickly is water is snow's enemy and so if you have a glass and you put an ice cube in it and the ice cube starts melting it'll melt even faster when there's water accumulating and so anyways so we have to get rid of the melt as quickly as we can and so under the snow we designed this water capture system where we're basically we're getting the water away from the snow as quickly as possible the other thing is there is water in the air and there's water on top of the snow and so it's like okay how do we suck it out of the air suck it out of the snow and that's the technical term right yes exactly we have giant dehumidification systems that you might see in like ice skating rinks or whatever and so we're pulling all that water out of the air and what i think is really cool is uh it's gallons and gallons and gallons and gallons but we actually recycle it and we use it for snow um you know the next night or whatever and so anyways by controlling the temperature and conditions we're able to offer snow 365 24 7 in a controlled environment and it was like testing a theory with those machines and it worked and yeah i'm a big fan of testing things if you want to i can test how i can tell you how i even tested if there was demand for this yeah i want to hear all that two questions that come to mind as you talk first of all how when you saw the ski resort 30 minutes away and that was your inspiration how deeply did you go in like competitive intel did you camp out there did you talk to the manager i've done both right i've literally camped outside a store and counted people walking in and out like average order value 12 okay and then i've also been like that's a good idea i'm copying it and then that's it that's all my research yeah so so chris i think you can i think you're an honest guy and you will attest to this was not a pre-planned question so the answer to that was that ski resort had a webcam up on their snow tubing their whole season and so the so you can guess where i'm going with it the the season before i literally just sat there with a clicker i've got it somewhere i need to find it and it's pretty easy to figure out how successful something like that is on top of that you could only buy those tickets online and they had x number per per slot per day and on their website when you went to buy a ticket it'd say i don't know 40 out of 150 or whatever and so they made it so easy for you oh they were begging you to copy them i know it was insane and so yeah somewhere i need to find it somewhere i've got those notes and it's like i know probably down to 100 what they did in that season and so yeah as i was planning it i just counted that each day like as i was eating dinner or whatever i'm sitting there just counting had other people counting for me too and yeah and and then even after a week or two you get a pretty good idea of okay are they busy during the mornings or the evenings or whatever and yes i so for me at the time and still is snow was a huge financial bet and i was not going to risk uh my life uh in terms of uh being set financially and this and that and just my peace of mind for something that i wasn't sure that was going to work and so yeah i found every which way to test it i'm calling up potential customers this and that i had to make 100 sure that this thing is going to work and i got to a point that i was confident enough that it was and yeah it was through being a little bit creative in seeing some other people's success or failures and keeping track of that oh man i want to do a whole podcast series you could do a whole podcast period about just how to copy potential company how to quote draw inspiration like man it reminds me of e-commerce i come from the e-commerce world and it's so easy to reverse engineer how much business a store does you just you place an order you see the order number 24 hours later you place another order you subtract you multiply by 365 you account for seasonality and then you figure out their average order value and now you know how much any e-commerce store in the world does and then you can just i'm so cheap i don't even take delivery of the orders i just canceled i'm like never mind so funny i got what i needed i uh you know we talked last time about the coaster that i built and that there was a competitor doing that first and i think they actually changed their ticketing like receipt numbers because of me because yeah i just do that every day it was like zero zero one zero zero two and anyways yeah there's a lot of that and there's things that you'll hear other people doing that i would have never even thought of obviously you've got the classics like if it's a retail business you sit outside and count cars i think we've all been there to some extent and yeah there's a lot of things you can do i think that would be great inspiration for some people to have yeah you could ramble probably for hours about different ways to test ideas yeah i think that there's a common misconception with entrepreneurs that we're risk takers yeah and i feel like we are experts at mitigating risk like more than a w-2 worker like we do so much research because i've been there i've never launched anything that was that off the wall and risky i but it's like this can't fail we're talking seven figures here yeah this cannot fail and so i'm guessing what you did is you got their numbers and i want to hear what their numbers were and then they were you said they were like 30 40 minutes away if it was a ski resort it can't be in the middle of pigeon forge right so you're thinking right okay it's only upside i'm going to put this in the middle of pigeon forge i've been to your facility i know it's tucked back off the main road but it's like it's more convenient it's more temperature controlled i don't care about the rain in fact the rain could actually help me this worst case i do half of what they do and i make a 500 000 profit best case i do three times what they do right yeah yeah and so one thing that i usually get on to people about wasting too much time on is creating pork pro formas and budgets and stuff because usually they never come true but yep i spent a lot of time on mine and i can safely say i am so proud of that because it was so freaking accurate at the end i'm calling the electric company and trying to calculate like how much electricity i'm going to use this and that and then in terms of demand you hinted at it some people say okay if i best case scenario i have 100 customers a day and blah blah blah blah blah okay i want to know what is the least amount of customers i can have and still make this work and i worked backwards i said okay if this thing is a flop what does that look like and i was still happy with those results and then yeah it's it's something that a lot of people cheap out with some of their budget stuff and it's like why would you underestimate some of that stuff every single profile forma or budget i've ever put together you have this miscellaneous at the bottom and for me that's usually just some of everything plus 20 or 15 or whatever because you're going to miss stuff and it's about testing it's about working those numbers i will for next time i will go and look and see what the ski resort did it was something that the ski resort ober they are open from thanksgiving to easter typically so i've got a whole season or or actually three seasons that they are not open and so that should be a win the other thing was that that ski resort during the popular times during the winter they were selling out like i went on i'm sure so who knows what their who knows what their tam was right oh of course it's something that if you go on like local facebook groups or anything like that they were a little bit more popular when i was doing that but it's like people were like selling snow tubing tickets like black market whatever and yeah that's always a good sign yeah and so anyways i got really comfortable with the numbers both in terms of revenue and potential costs i was still nervous of course but believe it or not that was the least of my worries i just got so comfortable with it do you remember what they were doing ballpark yeah i mean it was definitely i i mean don't quote me on this but it was in the millions an amazing thing too is every year they would raise their ticket price so it was something like maybe like 25 plus taxes and fees and blah blah blah the first year then it was 30. then they went to dynamic pricing i think last year i love these guys i know all my trigger words i know i know and so i think they were at like 45 or 50 last year and yeah it's a classic like supply and demand issue where they've got more demand than supply so yeah good on them so you want it you just wanted to help them with that exactly uh hey i don't think they particularly liked me at first but we've come around and yeah they're doing great i'm doing great and yeah i mean i don't want anyone else to open up one but there would probably be room for another one yeah that's just just like your coaster story you just grow the market when there's so much demand for something yeah you just the rising tide situation exactly um my next question revolves around like your water capture system like yeah i've talked to a lot of entrepreneurs and sometimes they come up with this innovative method sometimes like they're actually having to beat their head against the wall and invent an innovative method and because that's the only way and a lot of times it's just like they outsourced it or it's very simple right like it's like water capture system i installed rain gutters right yeah i went to home depot i bought gutters and put them underneath the sides of the slide how extensive was that so that was something that i knew we had to have because you just go broke if you had to be on city water the whole time and i have said it a lot lately i don't know if you resonate with this or not but a lot of times i jump out of the plane holding the parachute and i try to put it on in the air don't recommend that for others but for me that's how it works and so really like if you go back and look at our blueprints we were building and for the water recycling system there's just a big question mark on the blueprints and it's like okay we'll figure it out the reason i was okay just figuring it out was it couldn't be that complicated basically at the end of the day what it is this the snow is on this hill and obviously through gravity as it melts it's going to go downhill and we have a huge collection tank under under the under the hill and then from there we have a series of pumps like you can buy locally and they take them different tanks and when it's something that it's actually on paper it's a pretty simple system obviously it took some engineering and there's no worse day than when i get the call in the morning that the pump is broken water everywhere but that happens a couple times a year i'm a big redundancy guy so now we have three pumps everywhere but but yeah it was something that i knew that was a critical element through this whole thing i had to have architects engineers blah blah blah even just from a legal standpoint but it was something that one of my favorite processes was sitting down and working with them and you just start spitballing ideas and you say hey we need a recycling system and somebody throws out this idea or that idea and you just work through it together or at least we did and so yeah it was something that was actually believe it or not like one of the very last things we figured out we just knew we would and no one ever really stressed about it it's funny how i imagine you encountered this in both of your businesses a few times where it's like you talk to some expert quote unquote expert and you're like all right i need to recapture and recycle this water and they're just we can't do that that's not a thing you know dude like i i have employees tell me this on a weekly basis where it's like hey we need to fix this marketing funnel so people get a text text twice and like yeah it doesn't it actually doesn't work like that it's like dude stop yeah we got rovers on mars like we've got we what is actually impossible today it's not an automation for sms it's not what recycling water and then you always figure it out you figure it out man i we are cut from the same cloth i mean i get so even sometimes personally frustrated and like i have to take a step back like when people say no it frustrates me but when people say i can't do something that really frustrates me and yeah people are so comfortable saying no or it can't work or whatever it's like that's what they gravitate towards first and even sometimes when i quote do the impossible even if it's something simple like it's just like okay on to the next reason why it won't work on to the next jason and it's like man and you know a funny story about experts one of the i think maybe the first person expert i hired in this was found out there was a guy that's what he specializes in terms of like friction coefficients of like snow and ice and snow tubing hills and all this kind of stuff so it's like perfect awesome you're hired and this is how long we are going to make the hill we need to figure out where are these people going to stop these are the tubes we're using blah blah blah this is what you do and so i got this fancy report and it's like okay you know all this engineering speak it's like great okay he knows what he's doing i guess and it was nowhere close it was absolutely nowhere close really yeah it was terrible because if you think about it there's way too many variables like temperature and water and humidity and yeah and you know how we did it we as soon as we could blow snow in the building we blew a bunch of snow i had some friends and family and whoever come over one night we all took turns going down the hill saw where we stopped we loaded up with sandbags and this and that and just experimented and thankfully we had some room there to play it wasn't a mission critical kind of equation sometimes for me at least i think playing around yourself and experimenting and seeing what you can find out is oftentimes way better than hiring an expert regardless how much they cost okay i've got so many thoughts here first of all i gotta get this out of my head so yeah the water recapture the gravity does its job you you accumulate water on the slide gravity pushes down to the bottom falls through a metal grate ends up in a tank pumps it up to a different tank and then the snow system needs an intake of water and instead of just using your city water it's just pulling from the recycled water right nailed it nailed it love it okay second i i have to imagine that the whole time you're doing this you're meeting with experts you're investing a ton of money like you're past the point of no return if i were you the big question mark in my mind is will this be fun enough yeah right was that a worry like that first trip down the slide must have been must have felt amazing when you got down it because that's the big question right yeah yeah of course you're right that was a huge worry obviously i tested that in a lot of ways one thing is i i think sometimes you know you can make up for a lot of mistakes through price and so it's like okay if i'm totally wrong what if it's five dollars or what if you know whatever can i make it out and yeah i agree so one of the things was and this was one of the reasons i hired the expert was you want you want to go fast enough that it's exciting and then you want to go slow enough that kids and whoever can do it and i'll be the first to admit i think we got a little lucky in that regard we ended up kind of clocking in around 30 miles an hour and if it was a lot faster than that probably too scary for some and if it's slower than that yeah it's going to get lame and so yeah that was a huge worry up until the very first day i am self admittedly i have very thin skin in terms of like i can take criticism i don't take criticism that sometimes and so it's like the first thing that yeah the first couple of people that had like a negative review or something that's like oh my gosh it's over oh my god screw you yeah yeah and so it's just yeah and and uh but anyways like then for every positive one it started outweigh all the negative ones and anyways yes i think we got a little lucky there i always knew in my back pocket that if we didn't a we can physically change some stuff and then b we can add and do more exciting things i've left it the same more or less mainly because it works there's a part of me that i feel like i should make time to add some more exciting elements to it i've got some really out there ideas but if man i'm just focused on whatever else and just never have that day when it's like okay let's figure out how to step this up but it's definitely needed sometime soon yeah one thing that i love about launching businesses in areas like pigeon forage which this is going to directly contradict what i said in our last episode 29 in our last episode i was saying like you need to put something like this not you but someone should put something like this in dallas like gem mining in dallas or an alpine slide in dallas because there's 9 million people baked in and they're getting visitors right yeah but the i think the counter argument to that is you have a fresh crop of people every year aren't there like 10 million people a year coming to yeah or more yeah it's wild i would love to know what percentage of them are there for the first time first repeat visitors yeah it's something that i grew up there my grandparents are from there and i have a unique insight of watching the demographics change over the years it used to really skew much older and that is changing more and more and i think that works to our favor yes i would love to know repeat versus first time but but yeah i think even millennials and even younger start to come in that's going to be better and better for us you spoke about doing it in dallas or whatever and i've got an idea that yeah if somebody wants help with i mean not financially but just knowledge i am a believer that you could do this somewhere like dallas but you don't have to invest millions and so how you would do that is they make those snow the snow machines that i have on mobile units so mobile is a loose word you've got a tractor trailer basically but you can move it around and believe it or not you just have to have access to just reasonable water like a little bit more than garden hose but not too much more and three-phase power the three days power it does get a little hairy but there's ways around that anyways i have thought about sometimes what if you went to call it dallas or i'm in knoxville the local mall or wherever that's not using a large part of their parking lot whether you just have snow just on flat ground that people can play with or you've got you know that you build a hill out of kind of plywood and stuff it doesn't or even out of snow it doesn't take much obviously you would have to work out some kind of lease or rev share but potentially that comes down to how much you can you know work out the snow machine you can rent for a month or whatever test the model before buying it yeah totally and or even just make it seasonal and say i'm gonna run it every november december january and um and so anyways yes it would take a little bit of capital but not what people probably have in their head um insurance is not as crazy i mean you have to find somebody that's on board with what you're doing but not as crazy and then past that you just need some you need a handful of people just i won't say minimum wage but whatever the the going rate is and you know past that it's some water and some electricity yeah so that if it were outside it would have to be seasonal right correct yeah okay yeah okay and that's honestly uh so even for us our best season is basically thanksgiving to you know sometime in january uh we will do maybe about a third of our total revenue for the year in that call it 60 day period people are just in the mindset you don't think they're sledding in july even if it would be really nice to get out of the heat you just totally totally i don't know i was gonna say you don't drink eggnog during the summer but that's also because they don't sell it but there's yeah but you still wouldn't yeah and that's why they don't sell it during the summer is because no one wants to do that so so yeah there's just something that triggers i guess and take it as far as you want get santa claus there whatever it is there's a lot you can do and i'm serious with that like if somebody needs some guidance or wants someone on that i think it would totally work i can't guarantee it but happy to help somebody okay awesome yeah well email matthew yeah if you have a question so i i like the idea of did you hear my podcast a couple ago where i had it was my call-in show and this guy had the flow rider idea yeah yeah you could put one something like that in a mall parking lot and just like it sounds awkward like parking spaces around this fake surfing structure but why the heck not so with the flow rider thing one thing so i've only been familiar with him like on cruises or things like that same and something like that i call a spectator activity like one person is doing it but like the gem mining kind of watching yes yes and like i i talk about this figurative like grandma all the time and you want something that grandma and the parents and the little brothers and sisters can all stand around and watch somebody do it it's something that i i think you've got to rope in the whole family to something like that you've got to have pictures whether the customers take them or you professionally do it and it's a memory for everybody even if somebody's not participating in it so love that you say it's awkward in a parking lot like sure but you can dress that up the other thing is like people love crowds if there's a crowd of people standing around watching something you're gonna go check that out and even if you were giving away i don't know free popsicles or something get the people over there and and then i think it takes care of itself i love the pictures idea or a video like you could just have a gopro running 24 7 and it's like hey all right let's go to check out it's 15 bucks that's 25 bucks if you want us to email you the video pictures later and we'll send it in 24 hours what if you did this i think the downside with it being a mall parking lot is i think this could be a very spontaneous impulsive thing and if you don't have your swimsuit you're not going to buy it true right yeah and so maybe you just go to all the hundreds of small the mid-sized water parks i mean in dfw there's dozens that you never no one has ever heard of and they don't have these and they're not about to put one in so just say hey we need 400 square feet somewhere anywhere and maybe you could even have them upsell like at the counter like all right the day pass is 35 but unlimited flow rider access is 45 and you just do a rev share with them yeah totally it comes with stuff like that i think it comes down to your skills of i wouldn't even say negotiating but like getting creative where there's a win for both people and yeah it it is tough because okay take snow i've got this big multi-million dollar facility and yeah i've had people come and pitch me hey can i put a vending machine in here and we'll split it and it's like hey no offense but i i can just buy it it's all good and so like you know that's a tough sell but i'm sure there is something that i would be open to as a business owner one of the biggest things when you're approaching business owners like that with kind of a deal or whatever is making sure that you're not giving them more headaches like you want to take away headaches and in fact like you just want to say hey man i can put money in your pocket and just let me do my thing and so yeah anyways like partnering with water parks we only have one or two here so i can't really speak to that but yeah if there's a lot somewhere like dallas it's like man it wouldn't take that much to just go talk to everyone or try to talk to everyone no and you just you get a contract in place and then you buy the thing yeah yeah oh yeah totally risk-free they even make these things and your guys water parks might have them but they're these like little booths you can stand in and dry off pretty quickly it just blows on you or whatever and like whether it's a mall parking lot or whatever like maybe you also have that and guess what you're gonna potentially charge for that too yeah or they have the sunscreen application booths have you seen them you just stand in and you put your arms out and it sprays you with sunscreen you serious sounds like torture funny i mean people pay for it so yeah so what was it sorry go ahead now what's your question what was the first month and year like for pigeon forage snow and covet aside have you had a down year just like a natural down year or is he have you just grown every year yeah i built snow in i i say 365 days it might have been a little bit longer but it was when i say 365 days it was every single day and so one thing was it's like okay gotta get open gotta get open and when i got open like i didn't have that realization it's like oh okay now it's just starting and i think i had maybe a month or two of like just crashing in bed and thankfully i had a lot of help but it's just like oh my gosh i i gotta take a break and it was something that you're trying to figure out all these things on the fly and so like the first i'll call it three four or five months we're rough in terms of figuring out what we need to do and what we need to fix and who we need to have and hire and blah blah blah sales wise it was good i spent those 365 days building a email list getting people excited how did you build the email list yeah so so probably our biggest thing was our facebook page a little bit by accident i just started posting pictures like i when the bulldozer came in to clear the dirt off the lot i just took some crappy pictures on my phone posted i said hey getting started and people were like this is your personal facebook account oh no i'm sorry i created one for snow and and okay you opened up a page okay yeah and at the time i don't think a lot of people at least in my area were doing that it's like okay wait until you have something official and you have something done but yeah i just let people follow along in the journey and i did all kinds of stuff like i created like these vip t-shirts with our logo on it and i i can't remember what you got you know you could come for free you know the first year so anyways if you bought one blah blah and so anyways yeah built up a lot of demand that way and so anyways we got open it was just even more work as soon as we got open we had an initial wave from grand opening and then died down we we opened up in the spring mid to late spring and we were going into unbeknownst to me the slower time of the year may that kind of may period is maybe our slowest month of the year and so that was a little disheartening i didn't know and so anyways it gave us a chance to catch up our first year i'm gonna say we did a couple million dollars which was good we made a profit definitely made a profit and then we just continued to go up then covet hit in 2020. i hope i don't know what it's like where you are but we were closed as a city for maybe like 30 days or something uh yeah yeah yeah and so anyways we became an escape you know for the rest of the country and so the whole town boomed so 2020 even though we're closed for 30 45 days that was actually our best year at that point even that was your second year we opened up in 2018.

yeah it's third year yeah and and then 2021 even better i don't know if we doubled but it was pretty dang close we were in like five six million range 2023 we backed off maybe 10 or 15 percent which was once again disheartening for me i was like oh my gosh okay so this isn't gonna go straight up but i think that was a rebound from covet and some craziness there i think the whole from what i can gather the whole towns that way and 2024 is about on pace i'd say with 2023 okay i constantly worry that there's some kind of like economic slowdown it hasn't happened yet but every year i worry about that but but yeah we're good in terms of sales it's just obviously it's awesome when the numbers go straight up so do you own the land and the building yeah that's probably a story for another day but yeah it was uh it was just really kind of creative way of getting the land and it just you know i think a lot of luck and and it just worked out with a seller that was tired and and so i stepped in there and it was a weird lot it is a weird lot and we had to do a lot of head scratching on like how do we make this work and so yeah you know when i talk about the millions invested most of it goes into the building and and the land and in fact the first call it year and a half i leased the machines in hindsight in hindsight yeah maybe like wasted money we talked about minimizing risk i didn't want to be able to hook for multi-million dollar machines and so that's what that's what everyone thinks the big cost is but no i bought those ones i knew we were good and i could pay for them in cash the building just any metal building like that or air in general 35 000 square feet is going to be costly but yeah we i tried to minimize everywhere i could i don't recommend this but like i installed the speaker system myself like the sound system like i mean yeah was that the best piece of my time i don't know you did what you could yeah yeah like i'm buying it off amazon myself like that kind of thing and so so anyways yeah uh yeah i forgot what the original question was but there you go yeah so you recouped your money over the course of two or three years on this yeah yeah or or less it's something that now in hindsight i have really good terms but i think i could have done even better but i think about debt a whole lot i've got several different loans for different things and like i said i worry a lot sometimes about the say the economy and stuff and what my kind of debt load should be i am nowhere close to being in trouble or whatever but it's something that i think about a lot and try to manage it's something that some debt i've refinanced or has come due at much higher rates which really sucks and then others are low and i might not pay them off for a long time and yeah on paper yes i have recouped everything and more that's awesome how how tall is your building yeah it varies i think the tallest point is maybe about 40 feet a good way to if you're standing in the front of the building outside and you're looking at it i believe that's 26 feet tall but the front facade so it varies a lot obviously we built a hill inside inside of buildings that's why there's the height knowing what i know now did it have to be as tall as it is no i think we could have shortened that i don't know what kind of cost savings there would have been let's say we brought it down five feet maybe it wouldn't be significant enough to do it but just one of those things we didn't know and another thing is we want to create this kind of grand big kind of feel anyways yeah it's a big building for sure it's something that i worried about cable if i need to repurpose it what is it going to be and and the best thing i can come up with is a movie theater thankfully i don't think that's going to happen but but yeah that was i was going to ask you that what else could this building be yeah because i know you thought of that yeah you could get creative with a bunch of stuff that i mean the big problem is half of the or two-thirds of the building is a big concrete hill i don't know all kinds of like storage or again i think you do a pretty sick movie theater take a little bit of work or yeah i don't i don't know i i yeah if i had to think of that i i'm not worried about i know i could repurpose it so if someone were to find a building with similar dimensions could they rent it and put one of these in there or would it be just too much yeah definitely so 2022 2023 i spent a lot of time working with two amazing guys that are super experienced with franchising and we met in person for months and started to develop this brand of how can we franchise this and it was something that i had a lot of stuff in my personal life going on outside of business and i just needed to put a pause on that but but anyways like i have we have done a lot of thinking about that and so really i think the best thing to do there is figure out what's your budget and work backwards because obviously if you say okay i've i got 10 million dollars to blow okay that's a different answer if you're just trying to piece something together okay maybe you look at something what i said with renting a snow machine or whatever but if you've got a building these are the things you have to figure out one you have to have a hill and everyone i think takes that for granted i think you can build it with scaffolding and plywood and stuff but you still like you gotta figure that out there's a lot of weight that's going on that in terms of the snow and the people and stuff and so not impossible it's been done before but that's a big one second thing is how are they going to get to the top of the hill i have a magic carpet you can definitely install one too it's not that crazy but if they're going to walk just keep that in mind and then like i said you need to be able you don't even have to recycle the water i would recommend it not that hard to do you just got to catch it drain it off somewhere filter it all that and then obviously you have to have the snow machines and stuff but yeah if you had i'm trying to think what would be a good like just an empty warehouse or something like that if you thought that it was a good location and the right kind of demand if you figured out how to build the hill which is not that hard but that's the biggest thing yeah you could definitely do something like that you can also consider don't do a huge hill like if you've got a big warehouse and you still want to do something like this blow a ton of snow in there and you can make little slides whether it's for kids or just whatever you can make a long a longer hill right yeah instead of a taller one yeah there's so much you can do just a quote normal warehouse would probably be good you're going to want to have a little bit insulation we don't have any anything special but you don't want like a barn or something like that unless it's just really cold so yeah i mean there's a lot of different ways you could hack this together it's it's tough because a lot of these existing buildings are in such industrial areas that consumers would never think to go to right yeah the first trampoline park i saw here in knoxville was i don't know way over 10 years ago and it's like in the middle of an industrial park and i know it's changed a lot but i thought it was the coolest thing ever like driving in this like weird industrial park and it was packed i haven't gone to one in a long time but i don't know if that would necessarily stop me but yeah i would definitely consider location for sure yeah i was thinking about trampoline parks too so with that in mind is there like a fun matthew 3.0 concept that you you dream about you got posters you got slides and and i also want to hear about what you're actually working on as well because we didn't yeah definitely so yeah i keep a running list of ideas and when it comes and i'm sure you've got a long list too but when it comes to amusements yeah it is such an amazing industry and so like i'm definitely going to do something new one kind of high level concept that i was thinking about is do you know what like a rube goldberg machine is have you ever heard it's like it's a name for a contraption of like if you ever played mousetrap back in the day where it's like one thing happens and there's blah blah blah and so anyways even though putt's a little tired i always think about it okay like what is everyone's favorite hole but it's the last one and it's because it does something crazy and it's like why can't every hole be like that and yeah do something cool there i've got some other rube goldberg putt yeah yeah yeah yeah and just some really cool just you know lasers laser trip sensor for this and then this drops and speaks and all kinds of crazy stuff that'd be cool i yeah i definitely will do something else in in the amusement space right now personally i am trying to i guess reel back a little bit and i've got so many irons in the fire and i ended up growing a lot and just doing everything myself and so actually i've made a commitment to myself and my girlfriend heather like i've got my next step has to be delegation and building out the team of of the right kind of people a delegation is something i am terrible at and so it's something that even though it's not that sexy that is my next my next thing if if anyone's listening to this and thinks that they can help me in whatever way i mean at least put it in the comments and i'll look at it but yeah i'm definitely going to build out a team to get some of my life back is the next thing that's smart yeah it's tough i'm still trying i've gotten better at it but it's not like something you like flip a switch and you're like all right everything's delegated it's just you always are working at it like every time i do something in a perfect world if i was strict with myself every time i do a task it's like do you have to be doing this chris do you have to be and 80 of the time it's no yeah yeah and and it's something that like even though i know that on paper it's like you you constantly struggle with this okay this is a one-off task i'll never repeat it again and it'll take me three times as long to explain it to somebody i'm just gonna do it and then i've ran into a lot of people that are good people but they i guess really want me to hold their hand through everything and maybe that's even my fault but it's something that i'm just looking for more people that are capable autonomous i want to support but can support me too instead of just me trying to build up somebody's career or lifestyle or whatever i need those great people and that's what i'm that's what i'm after yeah okay aren't you building something outside right now like you were talking about those kayak rental machines yeah what is yeah yeah what is that so yeah um i've got a subdivision i was working on even it's right before covid it's been just such a nightmare and so it's 80 acres it's beautiful if you want me to i can text you some pictures or whatever but it's it's right on the water and anyways we are in an area that is very short on housing and if you look at knoxville and sevierville and everything especially post-covid like prices were some of the highest increasing in the country and it's because that supply demand thing like the supply is not there and there's a huge demand and so anyways i was like okay i've done some what i think are amazing things how hard could be you know uh taking a farm and you know putting utilities in and chopping it up and putting a road in blah blah blah blah i'm not even building the homes i'm just selling them to somebody to build them and come to find out that's a little harder than i thought and really what is so hard about that is you're dealing with all these local utility companies all these local governments planning commission zoning all this work that i don't like i like to take action i like to build i to get my hands dirty you're dealing with processes and red tape and permits and procedures and you look at them and i mean i've even told them i'm like this is why there's housing problem no one can get anything done and so anyways i am close to the end there i did it in two phases the first phase was the largest and we'll call that a hundred home sites which are done people living there acres yeah yeah okay they're single family homes what size i'd love to hear that if you don't mind i'd love to hear the unit economics like what you paid for the land how much each lot is being sold for how many square feet and all that yeah of course it's something that i am still in the process and we've blown the budget out of the water it's in in a negative way anyways i can give you some rough stuff there's about 100 lots that i sold in the first phase and there's call it 75 lots coming in this phase that we're finishing we're actually paving today that's one of the last steps so close to being done and so anyways with the first phase and the second phase there's basically three kinds of lots there's what i call the standard lot there's a premium lot and there's a river lot or premium however you want to say it so standard lot you're looking at about a third of an acre comes with all utilities that's going to run call it 50 60 000 something like that just for the lot and then you've got premium lots which so are you selling the lots to builders or to the consumers and then they have to find their own mainly to one home builder but i have sold some individually but yeah so selling those to home builder then however they package it together maybe they however they come up with their price for the home the home i was originally wanting something that was what i would call affordable housing after covid i don't even know what that means the houses are probably you know three four hundred thousand dollars which their new construction uh three bedroom most of them that kind of thing uh beautiful so anyways then there are the premium lots which are larger than a third of an acre they might be um you know on a corner or just a better setting that's maybe 10 or 20 percent of lots and that'll be called on average 70 75 000 per lot what i receive and then there's the river lots which are like ultra premium i have sold quite a few of those i still have quite a few as well i think the cheapest one i sold was maybe a hundred thousand i think i sold one for like 180 000 170 000 so pretty good they're absolutely beautiful and so anyways yeah so you've got a blend of all of those i've got about 40 river lots in all so you work back and do the math i think probably just doing off the top of my head probably have a potential real estate that i would receive proceeds for when you add them all up then i'm probably don't quote me on this i'm probably in it i don't know five or six million in development costs something like that it's definitely it's taken years off my life so i don't know what that is what it's worth but money wise yes it is it is a good return i have learned that there is no one no other job title that's hated more than a developer so that is or a custom home builder that's a brutal business oh my gosh everyone hates you everyone thinks that you're just rolling in the money and not doing anything and so it's anyways i don't think i'm going to build another subdivision for a little bit it's been rough stuff but but no it's i am proud to be able to deliver homes to families a lot of them is their first home maybe it's forever home for some people really happy about that it's something that i think i just need to get step away from it a little bit take a breather and then i'm sure i'll do it again but yeah we're finishing up phase two if anyone wants to look it up the name of the subdivision is called the farm at river bend kind of fancy name but yeah i think it's beautiful i think it's a great all right in severeville yeah yeah it's um it's probably i don't know 20 or 30 minutes away from pitching forge snow in the countryside that kind of thing yeah maybe 20 30 minutes away from knoxville yeah it seems to be a popular area yeah definitely and so yeah if anyone's in the area or wants to move give me a shout i'll definitely definitely show you a house man i mean a riverfront lot for 150 i would love to live on the water that is oh yeah unreal yeah if i wasn't living i we bought our dream house like last year or something and yeah i i thought about moving down there and yeah thankfully i found where i live now and just so happy with it so matthew like why why do you go so hard on these ideas like you you just don't you don't start small you're like let's do a roller coaster let's do a five million dollar indoor ski resort let's do a ten million subdivision have you ever started a business that was like small you like dip your toes in and i mean i guess now that you say it like that yeah i never thought about like that especially when i was younger all the little hustles and you know flipping and this and that and it's all relative i i'll say even when i was coming out of college i started a crossfit gym with some friends and i started a frozen yogurt store when that was hot and like at the time each thing that i did was like the biggest thing for me you just kept leveling up yeah yeah and looking back at some of those things now i'm like okay that was nothing but man like i probably lost more sleep during the frozen yogurt store kind of days which in hindsight wasn't that big of a deal i lost a ton of sleep there and ton of stress and there were many times like whether it's just somebody being critical or whatever you just want to say okay i give up and and so anyways i think you're seeing hindsight's 2020 kind of thing i think you're seeing not my final form but where i currently am and you know another thing is like i said in the beginning like i think i like to jump out of the parachute and or jump out of the plane and figure it out with the parachute on the way down and there's something about that pressure i think that i do well under a lot of times i want to pull my hair out and scream like i and say i don't want to do this anymore but then when i'm sitting around long enough it's like okay let's you know let's try something else and yeah that's just how it goes yeah have you thought about putting an alpine coaster in beaver's bend i did a little research and i mean it's obviously two and a half hours from dfw they get two million visitors a year so a fifth or a sixth of the size of pigeon forge but there are zero coasters there right now yeah it's something that i get really nervous with any physical business that isn't my area that is does totally on me oh okay yeah you're all over it seems you know the u.s with some things and i've never done that before so maybe that is like a you know a new frontier for me yeah i mean it's you said yourself like you can't really start one of those for 10 million bucks nowadays so yeah but like again i think if somebody's listening and is inspired like there are ways around that or ways to get involved i did not do that first one all myself i did not own it all myself and there was somebody actually in the group that owned one percent of it did some survey and engineering work for us and i don't know if it was a mistake or not but he got one percent and so i think if somebody was determined enough like even a deal like that i would be happy to coach somebody through how to get involved in something like that i saw a lot of your comments on some of the posts you made about our conversation and yeah going back to everyone's just so saying why something won't work and it's their comfort blanket yeah it's they would never do it so that they don't want to think it would work what what shocked me about the the candy comment was you had half the people saying hey this has already been done so you can't yeah you lose that's great yeah yeah and then you've got the other half of the people saying no this can't work you're an idiot and it's like yeah both of you can't be germs yeah yeah yeah okay yeah and there were so many times i wanted to comment with i don't think they realized like oh i'm doing that i'll take a picture of my candy store right now and it's okay like people can doubt or hate or whatever but if there was actually somebody listening to this and like man i i want to try to like you know put something like that together you don't have to do it alone you don't have to be the main person but there are ways to get involved with something like that so for me i'm saying right now like i don't know how comfortable i would be about investing a sum like that in a different state so it's like how would i get involved one thing that i have is i can consult and that can take a lot of different forms i could also just i like to help and or maybe invest passively there's a lot of different forms how could you the person that has no experience do it okay we'll fly out here where i'm at not my house but in pigeon forge ride a lot of these ride them all i'll even get you the tickets if that's what you want figure out how they work take a bunch of pictures put together a presentation go back home or wherever this is going to go and start pitching some people on like hey this works i if you didn't watch the last one literally the investment decision was started by uh somebody that knew my family sent us a picture of a line of people lining up on this alpine coaster i'd never seen it before and that is what started it all like that video is what started it all and it's interesting because for every business i've started there's probably been a dozen each that started like that there's just an idea if someone came to me with and then it always fizzles yeah it never comes through right so the fact like how much had to go right for it to go from a picture text to you actually having a coaster right what incredible odds for that to actually have come to fruition yeah and i will have to compare idea books sometimes but mine is very thick of idea and even stuff that i've tested or tried and i'm sure you have too but it's something like yeah there's a ton of them that like either just didn't come together wasn't a good idea we didn't didn't get the right feedback at the right time to make something like that work and it's all good it's uh there are so so so many ideas out there and uh like my friend my friend had an idea just the other day and he told it to me and personally i didn't think it was the best idea but i was like hey why don't you why don't you go run this past a few people see what they think see if they can get excited about it too and his answer to me was that i don't want to tell them because they might steal it and yeah i know i just whatever yeah he just doesn't understand it yet of course and so i guess it's just like yeah there's people listening and they're like man yeah one exercise i do i was thinking i was journaling last night about delegation because i got this problem that i was talking about and it was like okay what creative ways can i fix this like what creative ways can i view how would i view this working in my life maybe in a non-traditional way and work backwards and so if your thing is i would love to be a part of an alpine coaster i would love to own even any of it and i'm willing to work really hard like start with that and work your way backwards like i'm literally saying contact me and i will help you get there not financially but through knowledge and and so yeah i mean if anyone's interested here's your shot all right you guys heard them yeah it's funny about ideas because a lot of times people think that you got to get the timing right of an idea and i think that is very true to an extent like you i'm usually more early than i am late to an idea but one thing that i've noticed about ideas that i never launched like i i could launch them today a decade or two later and it would still work yeah i remember in college this is 13 years ago i read an article about some guys out of utah a company called eco scraps and they went to grocery stores and restaurants and they got all of their organic waste and they did restaurants first but then eventually they learned they just wanted fruits and vegetables so they only went through uh grocery stores and the grocery stores were just paying someone to throw these away yeah and they their pitch was hey pay us to throw them away so they had a negative they had over 100 cogs right they were getting paid to take the stuff and then they literally just rented this big industrial warehouse in the middle of nowhere they stacked all this these nasty pieces of produce up they mixed in some sawdust because they needed some carbon and they just composted it indoors and then they bagged it up and sold it for like 12 a bag to home depot and lowe's and it was like really good soil and so it's like no one loses yeah right they get paid to take the product it's better soil and they ended up selling to chem like some major company and i was going to copy them with a couple investors when i was in college a few years ago and i had a couple lunches with them i put a deck together and we were literally just going to do the same thing yeah like i was in alabama they were in utah they only have 10 of the grocery stores in provo and they were crushing it so it's like there's plenty big enough and i never did and like i could launch that today and i remember going i went to whole foods actually like i got so far down the road with this idea i talked like yeah we don't we'd love to have you take our produce and that's like the hardest part and i could launch that today and it would still be just as good if not better exactly you know there was and around the same time period i was a student at alabama i read an article about insomnia cookies and it was just a cookie shop way before crumble their whole pitch was like college campuses and delivery open till 4 a.m and you could get like warm cookies and milk delivered to your door and they were crushing it and it was like they were open at old miss they're open at mississippi state they're open at lsu there's nothing in alabama yeah yeah there was nothing in alabama yeah and then i went to these investors and they're like yeah let's do it and i did a bunch of research i never did it and i don't regret it because i just did something else right but today right on the strip right next to this alabama stadium there's an insomnia cookies yeah yeah and they crushed it and that could have been mine and i think we are very similar because i could tell those stories all day too and like i i don't know i get a little pissed at myself sometimes like you see that and you're like man i i could have done that and no maybe that's a flaw with me but then i see others and it's like oh yeah okay so i was right and it's like okay yeah maybe i just would love to help people get past that idea phase and start figuring out how to actually make things happen in whatever capacity i just i don't know reading those comments again it's just like so many people are stuck on no and maybe the answer is no but yeah it's just like anyways i that's one reason why i'm supportive what you're doing i think it's amazing that the live call-ins where people are giving business ideas i i think i said this like i'm in the car literally like giving my opinion out loud yeah hey chris chris say this say this i know i know and so no you're doing great work man thank you thank you man this was fun i'd love to have you again i feel like you could talk forever definitely just yeah next time i'll make sure to get a a real connection i thought i had it but yeah
