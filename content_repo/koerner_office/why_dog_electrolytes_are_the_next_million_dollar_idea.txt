what some people are thinking right now well it's just stupid just put salt in other different packaging yes sometimes it can be that easy it can literally be that easy look at five hour energy oh you're just taking an energy drink and put it on the counter yes it's a look at billion dollar company look at liquid death yeah a billion dollar marketing it's just framing and marketing that's it yeah that's why i like it right that's why the salty dog name is like oh yeah that's genius i went to capital camp this week and like the best way to describe capital camp is a place for investors and people who are looking to raise funds to meet that's a networking event there's three types of people there's investors there's entrepreneurs who are looking to raise money and then there's entrepreneurs who are just going to network i went to network and honestly it's expensive it's ten thousand dollars a person but wait what there's no yeah yeah it's technically it's thirteen thousand five hundred per person no it's not but they do they have like little are you trolling me did you actually pay that did you not know this is this a bit is this like you're trying to make people laugh that are listening no no this is real i thought it was three thousand dollars are you serious yeah i remember when you and i were going back and forth texting each other and you were like i can't believe you didn't bring this up to me this was one of the reasons i didn't bring it up to you because it's thirteen thousand dollars it's not thirteen thousand i swear like tell me right now are you trolling no i'm not trolling i swear oh my god i got a discount code i didn't pay thirteen thousand what did you pay ten i'm not telling you what i paid oh my gosh i'm not i'm so good i revoke everything i said about having fomo i am so glad i did not go to that do you know how many businesses i could start with ten or thirteen thousand dollars that's 13 businesses do you know how many hypoallergenic cats my wife could buy two yeah because she just bought them it's awesome what she just bought cats we just bought two hypoallergenic cats for six and a piece oh okay i couldn't wait to tell you that this was a weird way to introduce this whole conversation you're anyways okay anyways we'll talk about that later so capital camp there's like already an initial filter right can you afford to go to capital camp how many were there there's 350 people there this is what i wanted to go through this with you the math right i can't help but do some of the back of the envelope math right you just start thinking about things you're like all right 350 attendees average cost ten thousand dollars 3.5 million dollars in revenue any were there any sponsors no well i shouldn't say that not that i know of and it wasn't noticeable for there to be sponsors there i mean you better not have sponsors if you're charging that much come on well and the thing i liked about this conference is it was it was fantastic it was by far the best conference or event i've ever been to okay now i have a mogan i'll i'll go through i'll go through these but like the first thing i wanted to do was kind of break down the economics of capital camp so 350 people ten thousand dollars a pop 3.5 million in revenue for four days essentially three and a half days but four days but then i started going through the costs i'm like all right 350 people three and a half nights 350 a night 450 000 for lodging cool food i said 100 per meal per person per day so three meals a day three and a half days 375 000 they had to rent the venues 250 000. whoa whoa whoa whoa but why are you including lodging do they pay for your lodging yeah yeah it was all included once we got there where did you stay everything i stayed at this hotel called like the stony brook inn or something it was actually funny there's two super nice hotels that they had people stay at close to the event and then there's a hotel really far away out in the boondocks that sucked and i didn't know it sucked until i they had a mix and mingle or whatever at one of the hotels it's probably random right they probably don't place people at certain hotels i go in the freaking hotel and it's like marble up flooring beautiful wood mahogany bookcases lining the walls as you enter like it's just very cosmopolitan feeling super nice the stony brook inn looks the way it sounds it's like a nice motel eight right like it's dumpy beat up yeah it is what it is anyways i talked to one of the people who were putting on the camp and i got some back of the envelope numbers basically it was like a thousand dollars per head per day for the staff now that includes like the planning the marketing the coordinating logistics all that stuff and so when i added everything up the total cost of the event was about three million dollars so you have like total money coming in 3.5 total cost event three so let's just say they made 500 000 on it now 500 000 is not a little sum of money it's it's a little margin to most people that's what i was going to say like for this like the point of it was not to make money off of this event the point of it is to promote permanent equity and for there to be deal flow and like to be the thought leader in the space so as i'm there i knew telling you those numbers would make you throw up so that's why i was so excited i have many thoughts so please proceed all right as i was there it got me thinking about this thesis that we've had for a while is that events and premium events in particular are going to become more and more sought after we're benefiting from two tailwinds one is coveted everybody worked from home it's been really hard to get people back to the office and remote work has persisted and because of that companies have larger budgets they can spend on these types of things and then we're also benefiting from social media like people are all on their phones so when you go and have real in-person experiences they're they're fantastic i this is my fourth conference this year i went to we had a tree trimming we had a tree trimming boot camp we had sm bash that we went to capital camp and then i'm going to another conference for convertkit in a week it's obvious there's a craving for like networking and community and as i was there i'm gonna give you some examples it was the best event i've ever been to because they cared about every little detail so it was in by only first of all you felt special high ticket price so you're already like okay i'm expecting a lot i check in they knew my name and they knew a little bit about me like it was obvious they had either looked at my linkedin or they read my bio like somehow they knew some stuff about me like they made some comments that i mean it does cost thirteen thousand dollars to do a linkedin search so that does make sense the girl comes up to me when i first check in i have my water bottle this much water left she's like would you like me to throw that away and get you a new water can i get you a little refresher i'm like yeah absolutely i probably took two thousand dollars every time uh you're gonna do this the whole time are you oh this is my bit now also can you be very clear that we are not this is not an advert capital camp they're not paying us no no no okay yeah no this is an ad for capital if they're paying you they ain't paying me the swag so they had all this swag right like it said capital camp there were shirts and hats and bags and all this stuff and when you went in they said swag's free take however much you want now obviously you and i look at it and we're like paid for that swag i grew up poor do you know what you're doing here i'm gonna i'm gonna clothe my family for three years but there's like this psychological check that happens where it's like they said take as much as you want but most people are gonna be like i don't want to be that guy yeah you know what i mean like all they did do you remember how many peanut m&ms i came home with from main street i'm still eating those peanut m&ms i literally am they had more food there this time than even oh don't tell me this it was amazing and like one of the other small touches was there you were never sitting by yourself alone unless you want it to be like so if you had your headphones in nobody bugged you but there's a number of times where i sat down because all the tables were full or i didn't know anybody and one of the camp staff members came up and they just started talking to me hey how's it going where are you from because they want you to feel included and special and that like you're having a good time now for an intro like you obviously it's one of your worst nightmares but i just thought it was exceptionally well done i thought it was exceptionally well done and it's got me on this continuing on this kick of like conferences boot camps live in-person events are not the future but they're going to be very popular over the next few years all right you got to go full andrew wilkinson when you describe it and be like it was beautiful it was it's a beautiful business purchased at a fair price it was a great business valued at a fair price it wasn't a cigarette but it was no it was it was it was a really well put on function uh again it reminded me of the boot camps that we did like we could do more of these boot camps or there's a lot of opportunity i think in the space for live events yeah all right go i want to hear your feedback first of all i went to texas roadhouse last week and the server was helping us and then the manager comes by and he's like is everything okay you guys doing okay and he left and i was like while he was there i was like uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh okay and then he left and i'm like oh i just i don't want to be talked to i i don't want to go to texas roadhouse to make friends with a server and a manager and a busboy and a host i was just triggered when you said that chris checks into texas roadhouse and he's like yeah so here's what's going to make it this a good night don't look at me don't talk to me don't think about me don't even fart in my general direction because i will sue this company faster than you can say what hey how's everyone doing tonight oh good 15 i'm sorry sir what oh that's just what your tip dropped to uh-huh oh i'm sorry oh 10 10 what is that oh could that be a bit should that be a bit let's do it write it down all right so first of all i hear you i agree with you to an extent sounds awesome and what i'm about to say is biased because i wasn't there and i have half fomo half glad i wasn't there i feel like whenever there's something expensive the business owner is much more likely to be like listen we're just this is a passion project we're just i mean like we're lucky to break even on this you know how many times i've heard that crap i'm sick of it i remember when sam par launched hampton and he did a beta group and he beta there it is i literally i had to wait for it and he emailed me for with a calendly link and i never took it but he's like hey uh this is five grand and it's i think it's 10 grand now per year and he's like but i don't make any money on that it's just i'm just trying to learn i'm like dude it's five thousand dollars to join a club and your cost is a zoom membership dude just be real with me dude we're all capitalists just tell me you're making good money or don't tell me anything about it just own the price like either own it or own how much money you're making but none of this like i'm just i do it for the love of the game we're lucky to break even but i just don't like that what does that have to do with capital camp because that's what they said to you they're like yeah it's a thousand dollars a day and so you were able to back end into the math and they know that other people are going to be doing that it's called capital camp but it's like i i don't believe that they only made 500 000. you don't think that the staffing costs a thousand dollars a day no i think you could like you could crunch it in a certain way where it would appear as such but i just i'm more speaking to the overall principle of that just own your prices just own it okay so you think it was like a big money maker that's the point of them doing it it puts you in a 13 per night hotel a hotel that i would have booked right which that's a problem yeah i don't disagree with you keep going anyway but it is very interesting the larger point of charging a lot of money for a high touch conference like that because it speaks to the point that you and i make about having the the value exceed the cost right hey can i refill your water the cost of that is almost nothing but the value is like but the value yeah so i i respect that and i like that are you going to change topics yes i just thought it spoke to their company ethos i thought it was like very well representative of them as a company i i think it's smart of them to try to position themselves as a connector within that world again i think they made money but i don't think that like to me the purpose of this if you've got a company that's doing 20 million dollars a year in ibada and this event makes you 600 000 or a million dollars like you're not putting this event on because it's like oh this is the main money driver right there's other uses of that capital that you could do to me it just signals that they're being very smart and strategic long term they're doing this to position themselves well so they can get more deal flow so they can be at the center of attention and attraction that's smart it's smart it's smart as i was just thinking of hypotheticals as you were talking so i actually wasn't listening that closely but i'm just thinking like you go back in a year and you it's in columbia right where the university of missouri is and you're like oh we're going to take you on a tour of the campus and show you something and you see that the library is like named after you because of your 13 000 contribution it's like the most money columbia missouri has ever seen in their lifetime ever i will caveat that i know brent beshore is a good guy and he's honest i don't doubt that he's doing the right thing and i think it's very smart of them to have another event six months later that costs a small fraction of that right agreed all right well i got some ideas some of these are stupid they're stupid in a way that the pet rock is stupid and that it could make you a lot of money and everyone's going to think you're an idiot for starting a business like this but then you'll get the last laugh i got this idea today i went on a 50 mile bike ride and yes i am flexing i didn't have to say the distance but i can go the distance so i came up from this bike ride covered in sweat my dog comes up to me and he just starts licking me and he always does that and it's like okay you you need some electrolytes you need some that's what he needs he just wants the salt right dog electrolytes okay i like that exactly and so let me get there though let me i i gotta walk you there okay i love my dog but i'm not like a dog person right you know me right like yeah it's kind of like kids i love my kids a lot other people's but you're not a kid person whatever right well i actually can't am but anyway dogs are just fine they're fine legally you're not allowed to be within 600 feet of a school well uh edit that out that's all i meant don't actually edit that out by the way he's so confused right now anyway so he starts licking me and i'm like okay if i were like a dog person and i had that same thought i'm gonna be thinking oh you poor thing we need to get you some more salt oh does your dog food not have enough salt that's how dog people are that's what you think yes you wouldn't just think oh you're a dog you lick everything no i'm saying if i were a dog person like a dog empath okay and then i had the same realization that maybe he's licking me because he needs electrolytes okay all right yeah then i might make the connection oh i feel so bad for you because you don't have enough electrolytes therefore i'm not doing a good enough job as your dog owner got it you with me okay yeah i'm with her and so it's like dog electrolytes salty dog that's what i'm calling it okay and here's what it is that's a very good name it's a very and my wife thought of it it's a very good name so we're in the car and i brought this up to her and i'm like all right give me i need a business name for dog electrolytes where you incorporate like dog into the word electrolytes some and she's just like salty dog and i'm like you are you're you're brilliant freaking rain man over there can we go home real quick it was anyway here's here's what you could do you could literally get you know what light salt is no it's 50 salt 50 potassium which is like two-thirds of electrolytes then you throw some magnesium in there that's basically electrolytes salt potassium and magnesium you can literally just take that and put it in a like a salt shaker and they do sell these i googled it but it there weren't a lot of search results and they have like dog chews for electrolytes and there was like one or two products is all okay i think there's a world where you could literally just put powdered electrolytes salt potassium magnesium in a shaker and just have people shake it on the dog food when you shake it like a salt shaker exactly what do you think salty dog what so this is going to be just because i'm not in this world at all like we as humans don't we try to watch our sodium intake we try to watch our salt intake like are there any i don't know secondary health impacts to the dog are they going to get like heart disease are they going to shoot oh dude we send a card we're going to burn with burning dogs we send a card with the potassium for burning dogs that say hey look when your dog dies don't be salty call burning dogs it's vertical integration it is i think it's a great idea thank you thank you i'm going to get ahead of what some people are thinking right now well it's just stupid just put salt in another different packaging yes sometimes it can be that easy it can literally be that easy look at five hour energy oh you're just taking an energy drink and put it on the counter yes it's a look at billion dollar company look at liquid death yeah a billion dollar marketing it's just marketing and marketing that's it yeah that's why i like it right that's why the salty dog name is like oh yeah that's genius it's an easy product to sell people will get it right away and it's yeah i like it i think it's great thank you yeah it's clean i've got a list of ideas that got away right i don't regret not starting a lot of things because i start so many things there's only so much time but one thing that i should have started was like dog seasoning i had this idea like no this is the background music for you to tell this idea i don't know you're putting me in a bad mood dog seasoning okay and it's like god it's like this okay okay is that not right i thought that's right oh my gosh i didn't know where you're going with that uh to feed the dog on top of his food right because they eat the same thing every day and once again i'm not a dog empath but if i were i'd feel bad for them to have having to eat the same thing every day because we're imputing our own emotions onto them yes they don't give a rip you know i buy that cheap dog food you already know i do and so i had i had this idea like a decade ago and it didn't exist and now it's a thing my friend it is a thing and it's pretty much too late for that dude you've always been early honestly you've always been early with these ideas there you go and like your wife says you always don't i won't say it it's like the idea do you remember i remember calling you in 2010 when i was at usc and i was like chris chris chris what would you think if on your wrist instead of it being a watch it was like a smartphone that sent you notifications you could wear it on your wrist i vaguely remember that and it would have your email and your text and it would show up and you're like that's stupid no one would ever no that's dumb nobody wants that no one would ever wear it sometimes we're too early we're too early that's right we're smart guys i freaking love that what else what else you got so you could do if we're talking about too early for dog seasoning you could penetrate that market with salty dog get in a bunch of households and say hey second product line seasoning you could go about it that way maybe we're not too you know what you would call the seasoning right yeah i know but i want i have a great name for it but i want to hear yours because it's probably dumb doggy style okay this is a kid friendly podcast this is a kid tell me that wouldn't be a good name tell me it wouldn't be a good name it's irrelevant it's memorable it'd be it'd be an incredible name it'd be an incredible name it would be my dude think about the commercial oh my gosh think about the commercial your dog's name is frank frank loves doggy style okay frank's favorite doggy style this is a kid's podcast this is kid friendly do you remember do you remember that kmart commercial where it was like free shipping pants ship i can ship my pants yeah i can ship your pants right now i just shipped my drawers yes that was uh kmart's hail mary into staying relevant it was such a good ad though it was such a good ad it fell at the four yard line we need to find whoever did that ad and do that ad for doggy style okay i'm ready be right back the reason i like like for real though the reason i like the space is because people's empathy towards their pets and the importance of pets and people's families is growing like crazy people having less kids they had they got more pets during covid and they're treating these pets like their family members they have more disposable income they can buy them different types of foods they can get them you know salty drinks because they're electrolytes are low there's a reason why vet clinics are booming there's pet insurance for health care obviously you've got burning dog cremation that yeah yeah pet cremation now because people want to take care of their dogs after they pass respectfully like it it's a real thing so i love thinking about ideas that are riding tailwinds you're not inventing a market you're looking at a market that's taking off and saying what could i do in this market that's it's already taking off how can i ride this wave and you come up with some of these ideas like salty dog there you go did you please tell me you already bought the domain i hadn't even are you surprised i'm sure i'm sure salty dog.com is taken it's gotta be unless it's salty d-a-w-g i think i've seen 13 seafood restaurants called salty dog so i'm sure the domain is taken but salty dog could call it salty dogs with a z salty dog seasoning.com is open wait no it's not open anyway let's move on anyways let's move on i got another one you ready go yeah okay so do you know what a bomb calorimeter is no it sounds like something that i don't know that scientists would have yes it is very good i found this very interesting basically the science of how many calories are in food okay do you know how a bomb calorimeter works i'm assuming it somehow measures the amount of calories in food but yeah but like the mechanics of it it's extremely interesting so no idea let's say you take a plate of spaghetti and meatballs okay you want to know how many calories are on that plate exactly hey how many calories are in my plate to meet the balls so you take the food power this is the power through segment you take the food and you dehydrate it you get all the water out okay then you grind it down to a powder why wouldn't you just not made the spaghetti why wouldn't you just done it before you made the spaghetti hear me out okay okay okay okay what if you're anyway just hear me out you dehydrate it you grind it down into a powder and then you press it into a pill form like a capsule okay tiny tiny form and then you put it in a it's like a cylinder a metal cylinder that has like a i don't know i don't remember chemistry like a something coming out of it and you measure the energy the calories that it burns off and you burn it you light it on fire inside that cylinder and it keeps all the heat in there it measures the heat the amount of energy emitted from that okay oh i didn't know that yeah so if you grind up a salad it's not going to get that hot in there if you grind up a bag of potato chips a lot of calories in that right yeah there's a lot of recent data that shows how inaccurate nutrition label facts are and i saw this myself in trying to manufacture busy juice there's very little oversight on what people put on the ingredient label and the nutrition label not there is oversight of course the fda right there's not as much as you might think it's not an exact science exactly and i think there's a growing body of people that want to know what they're eating right they want to know what they're putting in their bodies and so right now you can't just go to amazon and buy a calorimeter and it's technical it's expensive it's kind of weird it's usually done in a lab if we want to manufacture food we send it off to a lab and they do it for us i think there's a version where you can take this and put it in homes it's not going to be quite as accurate it's going to be simplified like an iphone and people can buy it it'll start with the health freaks right and then work its way down into more popularity and people can get like let's say you have a meal you eat every day and you want to know how many calories in that meal so every time you eat it you can you know it's consistent you can measure the calories in your food and i think it'd be cool for kids and i think it'd be cool for health freaks losing weight all that what do you think to quote the backstreet boys tell me why i don't get why that you would do this because there's a market for it it's not well you hear me out it's not going to be 100 accurate anyways it's not going to be accurate for every single meal it could be i guessed at that it could be very accurate it's not it's not 100 accurate it's telling you what the calories were for that meal that you dehydrated and burned but it's not necessarily for every meal that you do maybe there's different weights maybe i i don't know anyways beyond that it it's directionally correct which is essentially the labeling on the back of a piece of food like it's directionally correct like why do the extra work to be a little bit closer it's not telling you necessarily anything that different like what are we talking about here 20 i'm gonna need you to be a yes man here and just agree with everything i think it's actually a really good idea you know what i would call it what's that d's oh gosh listen they can't all be bangers but i think there is a there's a market for this and there is precedent for things being done in a lab like on a niche scale and then coming more mainstream no here's what i will say i think that food in particular is something that people are looking at a lot more especially as millennials people our age are getting to a place where they have more disposable income they're looking at what they put into their body like we grew up on gushers and microwavable food and lunchables and you look at the science now and the amount of plastic parts per million in our blood is incredible they're finding plastic like in people's testicles they're finding plastic in the cells of our what that's what it is never mind in our arteries like they're finding all these plastics in our food and so people are looking at this and saying we got to do something different really like we got to re-engineer the way that we package food the way we prepare for food the way we ship food the way that we feed the animals who we eat right like it's not just about the end user it's about what was done upstream so i think what you're identifying is definitely a growing trend of people who are interested in what they put in their body i just don't know how many people are like you i think you would buy something like this for sure i just don't know how big the market would be i agree it's a small market but i think if like you develop products for yourself right that is the best way to develop a business or a product to solve your own problem so if i had a ton of time on my hands i would do this i have no desire to do this right and i just know just because of the law of large numbers that there would be a small market for that and based on the precedent of other things being sold like this it would slowly expand and it would become more mainstream i have an idea off of your idea that i think is genius are you ready for this uh-huh i'm gonna take it totally different direction i think there's a youtube channel that could be created of you taking meals and then comparing the labeling of calories dehydrating it getting it down burning it and then actually measuring the calories that would be a cool youtube channel like that's such a good idea it has to exist right it probably doesn't because i've actually gone down youtube rabbit holes for this stuff and i didn't see anything like mainstream that is a really good because then then you have a youtube channel that people are watching and you can sell products through your youtube channel that you care about like food right like then you then you are tapping into the broader market of people who care about what they're putting into their bodies and and you had cited like hey this would be cool for kids to do i think like kids would really like that like my boys would love to watch a youtube channel about that where it's like all right tonight we're making pizza this is what the store says and it's like and you like list everything out now we're going to dehydrate it and you just go through the process film it anyways i think that could be a really cool content channel can i give you some more examples of things like this that went mainstream it's the pope catholic infrared thermometers those started out in industrial and scientific app applications it's like why do i need a different thermometer this one works great those are popular now ph meters right they were used in labs now they're used for all kinds of things who would have thought that we want to know what the ph is in our pool don't we have a pool guy for that people want to know spectral photo meters spectral photometers all right they were used in labs to measure the amount of light that a chemical substance absorbs and now they're used in the food industry uv sterilization right sterilizing these with uv that uv sterilization have you seen that product that was on shark tank that you put your phone in there and with yeah it disinfects it right that was there's one geiger counters they measure iron geiger ion is ionizing radiation look if you're going to cite these things at least be able to pronounce them ionizing radiation is what they measure okay now there is a market for buying these on amazon okay for what what do people use those for just like in the ukraine they're near chernobyl they're like how many i need to measure the geigers gregory why do you have a goiter growing on your neck measuring radiation also things that like like you said about microplastics there's going to be a world where micro what these laboratory tools are sold to the general public so that's what i think cool all right i got a topic i want to ask you about you ready let's go let's hear it so chris and i's experience is very different chris has experience launching and creating businesses from scratch my experience has been in buying and growing and selling businesses and one place in particular that we just have very different amounts of knowledge i.e chris knows a lot about it and i don't is in digital marketing and so we've actually been like you and i've been talking a lot about digital agencies potentially even launching one for the back of our audiences but have you seen this thing that google just rolled out last week ai summaries yes so google traditionally you type something into google and it will either well it'll do both it'll show people who have paid to be at the top of that search or it'll show search items that have gotten there organically and in the last week i'll listen all in about this did you last week i did yeah yeah it was really good and so last week they rolled out this thing using gemini their artificial intelligence where it's like actually giving answers to people and so seo traditionally search engine optimization these small and medium businesses would build their websites in a way that made them trustworthy right they would do their layout make sure that it loaded fast anything and everything to build trust but one of the biggest ways they built trust was through content and so you would have a lot of content on your site either blog posts or social media or just parts of your web page that explain things that google could then go and scrape and say oh this website has a lot of this information they rank higher because they're more trustworthy they also have all these backlinks to other websites right there's a whole game that you would play and seo in particular has been one of the best ways for organic traffic to come to websites so my question to you because i don't understand this stuff really well how do you see this impacting small businesses because we've seen unlimited rollout which is sam thompson and and steven ullman's company and they're focused on the long tail keywords it would seem to me that if google is spitting out answers to these questions and they're not allowing people to go click through the organic search results it's taking away the opportunity to grow organically without having to do the paper in fact this may actually be better for google because you have to actually pay for the ad space keep people on google longer too right right and now for a business owner like i gotta pay in order to rank as opposed to just the organic rank now i don't think it takes away from g geography but anyways you are like miles ahead of me in my knowledge of this it seems like a big deal to me what do you think of it it seems like a huge deal i don't know what's going to happen i think google was really worried for years and rightly so that ai was just going to crush them and now they're probably thinking oh this could be really good for us right and right it happened a few years ago when basically google would give you a summarized answer that they would pull from a website and then give you the source but think about how much time you actually spend on google.com when you search for something sometimes a millisecond the results pop up you click immediately how much time are you going to be spending on google once they put everything you need right there versus all these other websites that's what's really interesting about this is that google let's say they would quote it right and then they'd send you to the website now what they do is they crawl the web and then also based on all that data and information that you've put up there that made you trustworthy they've said oh this is the most trustworthy data we're going to use this as the basis for our answer but they're not giving attribution so they're going to give the answer but they're not going to cite their source or at least right now right they're not citing the source and so you've done all this work and you've created the content but now you don't even have the link to you and google i under i get it we have all this data why wouldn't we just give them the answer as opposed to sending them off platform to these other websites like it yeah that's the that's like the interesting shift to me so i think one of two things are going to happen i'm going to call it the walmart option okay and the option b i can't i i didn't prepare i can't think of an option b i can't think of a good name for it walmart option right walmart starts expanding across america and all these mom and pop stores go out of business oh what do we do what do we do walmart crushes everyone that's what you do they go out of business period and then eventually the pendulum swings a little bit it's like support small business but honestly walmart has never been better they're great right yeah yeah and so i could see that happening where it's like the big guy just wins again the trillion dollar company just wins and all these little you know the equivalent of a shoe shining shop aka all these random websites they just don't get traffic anymore and they're done they're toast and walmart might link to them as like a pad on the back in like the footnote but who's going to click that no right and so that's one option the other option is massive carnage and people not wanting multi-trillion dollar companies to win in uh class action lawsuits to to protect the little guy right with the wordpress blog but how is that sustainable like how are we going to like how are we just going to put our hands up to ai advancing and stop that yeah i think it is going to get litigated because of the attribution piece obviously we don't think of these small businesses as content creators but the content is proprietary of those businesses and i think what they're going to say is like look you built this model you used our proprietary data to build the model and now you're not compensating us for the model that you built so i think it's going to be decided in the courts but to your point there could be a ruling on that in five years there's a between now and five years is a lot of time there's a lot of businesses that can go out of business and so what google gets slapped on the hand in five years from now and says oops sorry yeah we'll put attribution but again okay there'll be a link there there's still they're still winning so it's not only the small businesses like i'm curious about digital agencies that do the seo stuff does this make them obsolete do they have to pivot there has to be a business opportunity in this like anytime there's a big disruption there's also a big business opportunity i don't know what it is yet i just haven't thought about it a ton this is a tangent but did you see the business that kamal sent us to look at to potentially buy so for the for anyone listening we're looking for businesses to buy right now and so kamal our awesome chief of staff has been sending businesses our way he sent a ui slash ux agency which is oh yeah i did see that user interface uh user experience agency i'm just going to read this real quick i have it pulled up i was floored at the numbers of this they're asking 5.5 million million their net profit is 1.8 a year okay so we're talking a 3x multiple on a digital agency that's growing that has seven figure ebitda and it's been around for six years with 17 employees and i was thinking about this my first gut reaction was oh this is oh this is interesting we could do something with this right and my second reaction is dude if i own this business i'm probably going to be selling this right now too so why would i buy this business like of all the things that ai is disrupting it's disrupting ui and ux like already we're already there it probably isn't even showing in their numbers yet right they're probably still growing and they'll be growing in three months but i bet you anything the owners are smart enough to know that their days are numbered yeah i remember this business now he said i didn't do a ton of research it was this week right yep um i would just want to know from the owner like why are they selling if there's a compelling reason that the owner is selling at this price point right like maybe oh my wife's sick or we need them like some there's a reason for it i could be interested but i tend to feel like you although i don't i also don't want to make a decision without knowing all of the data oh sure yeah so no no just like hear me out six months ago you're looking at google and you're like man ai is gonna freaking eat their lunch mm-hmm they screwed up the they screwed up the rollout of gemini first they call it bard then they call it gemini then they roll out gemini and it's like showing george washington as a black guy and there's a big outcry and then they just missed wave he was he was black in hamilton though so there's something to that so i just want to be respectful that's on me that's on me okay anyways like they've botched every rollout related to ai up until this point and then all of a sudden they they release this and you do like the second and third order effects of this and you start thinking they're going to make more money now from businesses paying them to be ranked because it's no longer through seo oh they're going to make more money now because people are going to be on their page longer this is actually a boon for them so but you weren't thinking that six months ago now you're thinking oh crap they're going to be much better placed and that's an example of the facts just hadn't we just hadn't been able to evaluate all the facts yet so for a business like this that kamal sent us i think there's a lot of fear from those agency owners that are like i got to get out because it's totally going to ruin and disrupt the business but there also could be a counter argument to say we just don't know yet maybe they're able to pivot maybe this is ultra beneficial to them and we don't know we haven't dug into the numbers but it's just changing so fast i think seo is about to have its biggest change ever but that it's not going away i think seo is no longer going to mean how you rank but it's going to mean did google choose your content to put in the summary for someone else's yeah it's freaky to think about we have businesses that rely on seo and are we going to be chosen are we going to be the the lucky one chosen is tribute to be in that summary or not right or like we we have another stealth project right now that we're hoping to be reliant on seo and now we're not investing a ton of money into that but what's that going to look like in a year so i have that argument right which is what we're talking about and then the other side is like my self-driving car analogy it's like the last five percent takes as long as the first 95 percent we could be you're years away from seeing any ramifications from this because it's so hard to dial in that last bit of data well i do think that there are two and this is like off the fly so this isn't very well thought out but i think that there's two different search results that we're talking about there's a knowledge result i have a question hey google what's the best recipe for pizza right and then there is a like a services related question which is i i need my roof fixed where can i find this in my area i don't see how it disrupts the services related searches as much because i think that you need it locally you're searching for something locally i i don't see how that is necessarily hurting you locally i see it more on this side where it's like in the past you would say what's the best pizza recipes and then all of a sudden you get led to laura's pizza blog three links down because it had the most content and then you click into that and you're like oh i really like her it turns out she sells a course so she sells a cookbook or she sells like she's relying on those searches in order to fund other services that she's that she's that she's selling that are incidental to it that aren't really the primary driver so i i do think it's bifurcated between the two but i think it's also only a matter of time before this one gets disrupted as well right because aren't there that's better than me aren't there a lot of businesses that function that way where it's like somebody just asks a question they start reading on their site they get down a couple things and all of a sudden they're purchasing something separate than what they originally googled but it's because that site showed up on that original google and that's how they drag traffic is that a fair way to look at it or am i like way off yeah i i think it is and i think we could also see a boon to companies like duck duck go where they can they could zig where where google's zagging and they could be like hey if you like getting 10 search results when you search for something that's us that's always us that's going to be us right that'd be interesting they could just take a hard stance on search needs to stay as it is google could also do this google could also say that could be a service hey pay me five dollars a month and i'll answer your questions or i'll just give you what you traditionally know as google and how many people would say like no i like this because right now it's like beta testing almost right at some point if they offered a paywall to it like i would look at that and be like no i'd rather just get the question answered then have to go through all the links it's like on on google.com it you could hit search you can hit show me or get lucky where it'll just take you to the first result instead it could just be like give me 10 search results versus give me the ai answer and people could choose and it's like an it's like a living a b test and they're going to see over time what people prefer this does definitely make me nervous about the digital services companies but particular the seo even the pay-per-click stuff because you just don't know but the flip side is they're going to figure it out first right people who are in that space are going to figure out where the arbitrage is to find those opportunities it's just when we're talking about a business that doesn't one point a year and it's a five million dollar purchase price do you want to take that big of a swing it's three years until we pay back the note but i don't know that would be that feels like a risky strategy think of a ui agency a user interface agency let's say how far away is ai from this right now where you say hey make me a website okay lots of sites can already do that boom website okay i want it to look like this website okay done all right now i need the function on the back end to look more like this done that's ui and ux what how far away from are we from that right now i feel like we're really close did you see this the demo with chat gpt4 oh like the way that they're yeah the multimodal stuff is is nuts they have a kid who's like trying to work on geometry and she's looking at the picture and telling him well okay which one's the hypotenuse i mean he guesses the wrong one and then it walks him through why that wasn't the right answer and wish i was high on pod news there it is i knew you were thinking that the second i saw you saw my smile key and peel it's a key and peel reference it's a great sketch
