nothing all right well Brandon let's hear from you you are the first speaker in Kerner's Corner and this will be one of one or one of many and it all depends on you Brandon sweet no pressure well I appreciate it so I am six months into having bought a struggling street sweeping business with my buddy and we're in we're in like Ventura California so I just kind of was made aware of the issues of wildfires and how many communities don't do street sweeping so nobody really advertises that and I was wondering how I can I guess my plan is to create awareness around the issue already there and then supply the the means to fix it so if you had any advice with that or or what yeah so in other words you want to invent the disease and sell the cure because people don't know that this is a disease right yeah so all right you bought the company six months ago you said struggling it's struggling now or it was struggling when you bought it it was it was basically just an asset sale with maybe five or six customers so it was struggling when we bought it we just thought you know we could always sell the assets for what we bought it for and why not why not try and turn it around okay five or six customers who is your customer is that the municipality it was some hoas and then the city or the county contract that they had for the next like two years so we've added we've probably doubled revenue but we're still like in that growing phase but yeah the plan is just to make more communities aware of this and then supply our street sweeping okay can you talk about like what your lifetime value is like what is like an average ticket price you paid by month or how does that work yeah so we do hourly work so it's one you're breaking up I believe you're breaking up there can you hear me I can now you broke up for a sec oh sorry so yeah we do hourly 185 for just people who call in for the day we just try and base it off that pricing and then we have we have county contracts HOAs at a certain price per month with like multiple sweeps okay is it like a weekly thing or a monthly thing uh everywhere is different most hello Miro is that you yep that's me awesome welcome yeah great so um can you guys hear me am I good to go I can hear you perfectly okay great Chris um yeah first off I want to I want to thank you for for doing this this is awesome I know you got like a hundred businesses that you run so I do appreciate it um so I've been following your stuff for a while now um on Twitter and just reading your newsletter and everything like that so the situation that I'm in currently is I don't have a business of my own I currently do a sales job and I I'm a contractor so I don't get paid a salary or anything anything like that but I do get paid um a pretty healthy commission I want to start a business but I'm sort of like in this like paralysis by analysis thing where I just don't know where to I don't know where to start I don't know if I should buy you know buy a business and just like you know take an SBA loan out and just like start something that's already there or if I should if I should start something off the ground and just see how it goes like I'm kind of I'm kind of in that place right now so I have some hard and soft skills but it's just like figuring out the next move to make and like where to focus because there's just so much opportunity out there and it's a hard to figure out like kind of where to point my energy you know yeah yeah so good news and bad news bad news is analysis by paralysis is like you know the biggest the biggest deterrent to starting a business so that sucks good news is what I've noticed is people that have that before they start a business usually end up being above average business owners because you're in the details you're in the analytics you're obsessing over the the metrics and so I think your future is bright now what type of money do you have to put into either buying or starting something right now like what what amount of money do you feel comfortable using to buy or start um I mean I I don't know it's hard to say really um I guess it would just depend on on the opportunity itself but I mean I would I would be comfortable investing somewhere from like 10 to 50,000 okay and what what ideas do you already have like what do you find yourself thinking about well you know the thing is right now like for the last four years I've been working remotely right and the thing is I like working remotely but what I also like is like getting out there and and and connecting with people so I think there's something there with customer service with connecting with people and like selling in person so it's just trying to figure out um what that is now business-wise I mean I've tossed around the idea of like buying a service business like a potential cleaning business or um you know a tree trimming business or something like that but I have no experience in that space so it's like hard just hard to say if that's the right direction to go in yeah and where do you live right now I'm actually a Texan myself you're in Dallas I know but I'm in Houston okay and what type of sales do you do and how many hours per week are you working realistically I mean I would say like it's I I probably work like 15 to 20 hours a week and I do like advertising sales so I do a lot of my selling through email and like zoom calls and so um I primarily work with a lot of companies that are like in the financial space so um yeah and you feel comfortable selling even in person yeah in person in person and uh you know virtually as well like on the phone or emails or zoom calls stuff like that and how would you say you rank compared to your peers your your colleagues selling the same thing um well I would say I would say I'm up there I mean I have a natural ability to like communicate effectively I feel like so um I think I'm in the upper tier compared to my peers okay and is there any like sector that you're already leaning towards like home services or I guess you said tree trimming or or house cleaning is there anything else outside of home services that where you think you could really leverage your sales skills um um I'm not sure um I mean I tried getting a cleaning business off the ground like probably about six months ago but like I what I found in Houston is the market's like super saturated and so it's like this race to the bottom with pricing and so like that was a big struggle where I would quote people a certain price and then they would just be like okay I can just get this random person to do it for like way less and so like I tried getting something up off the ground myself but it just didn't didn't pan out yeah so all right I'm just trying to ask a bunch of questions so I could like put my thoughts together I feel like you already have the two hardest boxes checked and that's you have time 10 to 15 hours a week for 15 to 20 whatever you said um thank you for being honest on that most people don't actually work a full 40 40 hour work week uh two you have cash 10 to 50 grand like that's plenty to start a business three you have one of the hardest skills out there to gain and that's sales like you've already done that so I tell my kids and I tell everyone if you can sell you can do anything and you should do anything you should start something you should not work for someone because that's one of the hardest skills to learn and people that are great at sales they they don't appreciate that because it's it's in their immediate orbit um if I were you I would ignore house cleaning because I've done that myself I had a house cleaning business it was called halo maids 2016 I hated my life it was the worst um I tweeted about this a couple months ago but I don't like the house cleaning business because it's not a binary outcome model like it's yeah you show up late you leave a hair like I don't know if you saw that or not but they're just yeah I did see that one yeah yeah there's so many ways you can mess up for like a 40 net profit like and it's super saturated like there's four or five ten people I could name off the top of my head that are selling courses on house cleaning services yeah so it's like so saturated so I don't like it for all of those reasons I don't like that it's low ticket I would think of it this way you have this super rare skill and that's sales you're not afraid to do it in person you live in like one of the most thriving economies in the country Houston Texas so I would stay exactly where you are uh geographically I would stay exactly where you are with regards to your skills and I would find that more of a high ticket home service like fencing foundation repair something something where you could find a subcontractor um to sub it out to and just start pounding the pavement like throw up a card website just do something by the end of today that that has you pop committed maybe it's a ten dollar domain name um just something to move the ball forward and honestly if I were you I would go buy a card website like a paid card account which is like 30 or 50 a year make yeah spend an hour or two making a website and then you can copy and paste website so I would copy that website five times and I would pick five high ticket home services maybe even roofing and just literally make that same website across five different home services and then just jump in Facebook groups and next door groups like tonight and just start asking around like what what are your pain points what types of services are you unable to find um and like that will lead you and you don't even have to pick one of the five until for a month two months three months right like start going down all the paths at once and just see where they lead you I don't like I don't like the idea of buying a business um for the shoes that you're in today because it's much more symmetric of an outcome but I think if you can learn with your own money and your own skills and just kind of get your feet wet risking almost nothing then one two three years from now you're going to feel a lot more comfortable and confident to buy a business should you want to or you might just say why would I spend all this money for a business when I know how to do all this stuff by now yeah that makes sense and then and then the idea then is just you know you build it out um kind of get validation through uh through the Facebook groups and everything like that and then I mean you're basically finding the job and then you basically contract that out to a vendor that you find that you trust that you've seen their work and then you basically uh I guess split it up that way yeah find the job first and then find the subcontractor okay perfect all right Chris thanks man I appreciate it yeah for sure all right uh we have Brandon back so I'll add him back in but if everyone if you want to speak if you would just comment on the um on here I can read through the comments and we can get the next people in after that so thanks mural I'll add Brandon in let's see if his connections a bit better Brandon there you are hear me yeah how's it going um sorry about that I must have must have lost connection or something um but I was saying yeah so we have a street yeah uh I just finished uh um yeah so I I was saying we have a street sweeping business in California um basically I I'm taking it over uh I just finished a baseball career and wanted to test this out so um yeah we have HOAs uh commercial contractors anyone building and then a bunch of just commercial jobs parking lot sweeping etc um so it's either per sweep or per hour and what is the average monthly ticket price um I would say anywhere from probably two thousand to three thousand uh depending on how big of a community it is or uh how long it takes but um basically a full day it's it's about a fifteen hundred to two thousand dollar day if it's eight hours okay and you might do one or two days a month for that customer yeah correct um some some want every week and some want uh twice monthly it kind of depends for um the county work how much they have in their budget um but that's kind of where we're meeting inspectors who are recommending more uh so kind of requesting more funds in order to do it okay and going back six months if you could see the future would you have still bought this business oh I don't know um that's hard to say so I have I would say it's growing uh we haven't yet gotten to the point where we're seeing that because we're still investing into the business um but I think there's I think it's a really good opportunity uh pretty much every local business around us that's a sweeping business has been bought out by venture capital um so that's our that's our like main competition but most of their clients come to us because they aren't getting service properly so if you have five to six customers what's your what's your tan like how many potential customers could you get without buying more trucks or really having to invest a bunch into capital into capital expenditures um let's see I think each truck can do if it's running full-time can do about 25 000 in revenue a month um and we have we have two trucks running one truck full-time one truck that is probably 30 hours a week and then we have two other trucks that we can fill so four trucks total yes and you're in ventura yeah ventura so a hundred thousand people or so do you do you go outside of ventura at all yeah we will travel wherever um we're pretty much all of ventura county los angeles um parts of santa barbara all those areas so is it safe to say you've got four trucks and you could do about 25 grand top line per truck today if you're fully at capacity yeah yeah possibly more if we did more night sweeps uh those just aren't as profitable okay what does the sales cycle look like how long does it take to acquire an average customer and have you acquired any since purchasing or are you just keeping what you what you purchased uh yeah so we had those five or six were probably the customers that we bought the business with um we get i would say five or six projects a month um just from a contractor who has an inspector coming in and needs to sweep um and then we've probably added five or six recurring uh sweeps to our schedule um but yeah it's there we just turned on ads probably two months ago and we have uh almost doubled in revenue each month what type of ads uh mostly just google google ads um um it just like we get calls we get um links to our website for forms uh to contact uh most of those and then but there i mean there's sometimes we'll get a contract for you know thirty thousand dollars a month call in um and it's it's just a matter of either lowest price that they're bidding out or um how long the project goes for okay are you are you listed on google my business yes we are what is do you mind saying the name of your business yeah it's cleanerstreets.com all right i'm just looking you up on google my business right now um do you do you have any idea of how uh like how much you're penetrating your total google ads budget for that area uh no like what is the how much could you totally be spending um in that geographical area on google maps i i would learn that first and foremost if you if you're telling me you doubled your business using uh google ads i said google maps i meant google ads um like that that feels like the answer to me right like increase your ad spend yeah are they converting okay yeah uh what is your daily budgeting pretty good um so we're doing probably i think it's like 2500 a month uh for ad spend okay um but how many i would say signed customers has that brought you probably nine or ten um some are one day projects and then some are recurring and then a lot are are people calling in asking if their streets getting swept so that they can move their cars okay okay and what is your most profitable type of customer like if you could only lean into one type of customer most recurring most profitable lowest headache who would that be uh probably construction the issue is those are shorter projects government like the city and county ones are very good if they're prevailing wage um those you just have a lot more complaints and headaches and they're usually bigger bids that only you're breaking up you're breaking up there brandon the bids don't come up very often you said can you hear me uh yeah i can can you hear me yeah sorry um yeah so the government projects are every couple of years every third year uh depending on the contract length so those are there's fewer and far between but definitely like the commercial builds are the most profitable okay all right so let me just give you my breakdown um there's a there's an endless trade-off between profitability and recurring revenue and or the sales cycle length and how long you keep a customer so it sounds to me like you love your construction company customers because they're more profitable the sales cycle is probably uh shorter but it's not as recurring right but it sounds like you you still like those customers the most the construction customers yeah yeah correct so all right if i were you i would start with your google my business profile you have one five-star review which is great i would try to get like 20 to 50 and that might seem insurmountable having you know being in b2b but even if you were to get end consumers to leave you five star reviews that would be amazing because google doesn't know people don't know they don't care that it's not a municipality leaving you a five-star review um that will help you get more organic business i would remove the llc from your business name and google my business i assume that's something that was that way when you bought the business there's no need to put it in there um and then i would really dig deep on your google ads like if you have a profitable google ads campaign your problem is already solved you just need to optimize it and scale up your ad spend like it's actually shocking how many businesses don't for lack of a better word qualify to really scale on google ads so if you have that that's the golden goose so lean into that keep doing that that's my first suggestion second suggestion is you're at an advantage because you're in a defined geographical area which means that if you're selling a high ticket recurring service as you are then your potential customers are all right there's only so many contractors or so many home builders or developers in ventura county um so i would start with something like apollo and scrape everyone um you can use out scraper as well if they're if they're listed on google maps which most of them will be and just build your master database of customers and say all right there are 300 people here that could be using my service and i only have three of them and it's probably going to look something like that and then just attack them every which way um if it's a higher ticket item and there's only so many customers out there as opposed to something like landscaping then you can really get personalized in your outreach um i mean you can find these builders on venmo and send them five bucks to get their attention you could send them a custom loom video spend five minutes send them a loom video and talk about how scraping sweeping their streets will you know add value to their lives and to their projects um but at the end of the day you want to test like five different things because that's going to truly tell you what which channel you want to lean into i would start with google ads a lot of times the answer is right in front of us and we don't even recognize it maybe go to upwork find someone that's an expert and pay them one or two hundred bucks for an audit i much prefer doing google ads audits than hiring an agency because a lot of times you know 80 20 to 80 of the value they're going to add is going to be in that audit and then at that point you can just take it over from there so you don't have to pay them three grand a month any thoughts on that yeah no that all makes a ton of sense and uh i i agree it i think we're at the point where we're um yeah trying to grow with very little management in place and so we're trying to put like those systems in in place so we can um provide like good service i love it but um yeah the google ads is is yeah about two months in so we're gonna continue hammering on that awesome well i hope this helps and thank you for calling in brandon yeah thank you all right thanks brandon i uh put out some requests for people to speak um i don't know if they've accepted or not oh joe has great joe why didn't you uh why don't you go next uh hey can you guys hear me okay yep perfect yep perfect um well long time reader first time caller um really enjoy the stuff you're doing um when i was in uh college um i we were on the same call with i think brian sullentrop uh-huh and uh and we were gavin i i ended up starting a vending machine business while in college um over in uh over in provo at the y um very cool and so that was really cool and then we uh graduated we traveled abroad for a little bit so i ended up uh giving the uh kind of giving the reins over to uh to my cousin who's in accounting really wanted to do some stuff so um anyway so we're not we're not there anymore we just moved to austin um and i'm wanting to do more like uh like an online business something i can kind of do more remote um because i've got a lot of experience with like web development things like that my um i want to do more remote stuff so um so that leads to the the business proposal for the thing that i'm doing right now which is um setting up websites for um for small businesses so i'm to start off i've kind of niched down to real estate agents um i got a list of a bunch of agents from realtor.com who don't have websites so i can cold email them um with uh with an offer to make a website for them for i'm starting off with like two grand um but i i don't know if this is if it's just totally unfounded i don't have a ton of data that i'm going off of and so i keep kind of getting this like um i don't know like heavy doubts with it um or i don't know if it'll if if i can validate kind of what i'm doing as i'm going through or if i'm wasting my time in certain areas so i'd love kind of like an audit of just where i could be improving just the general business process and what i shouldn't be worrying about okay um so your general idea is to make custom websites for real estate agents that don't have a website right yeah okay and is this still in the ideation phase or do you have a customer yet uh yeah still in the ideation phase um i just sent out my first like cold email um yesterday with a quick little um you know hey we can make a i can make a website for you and i attached a uh a screenshot of what it would look like with like their face their name and um and the area that they cover with their real estate to kind of see if that would work so so just very early stages have you thought of trying a different approach and going after real estate agents that already have a website that might be unoptimized or just for lack of a better word crappy and and like pitching to them why their website needs to be improved or should be improved and what they could get from a more optimized website because i don't like the idea of finding realtors that don't have websites because a there's a good chance they don't have a website because they are an inactive agent and like you scrape their data and it's six months or six years old or somewhere in between and so they don't want a website they don't even want to do anything with real estate um i also don't like it because it could be the opposite end of the spectrum and you've got this small town agent that just crushes it and i don't need a website i do just they're right you know like they could do much better if they had a website but it's not your job to convince them of that because you probably won't right right and so i'm thinking if you if you use built with to let's say let's say you use built with to scrape all of the websites that have a certain wordpress plugin right like maybe you know idx is um the the coding platform yeah idx is is like the api for for real estate right where it's like you link your mls to your website so you go to stacyrealtor.com and you can you know you can view houses not just her listings but like it's it's just like an api that pulls from the local mls like zillow oh that's awesome yeah so i i imagine i assume that wordpress has a plugin for idx uh so therefore they have to there's a million wordpress plugins if you find that plugin that supports idx and then use built with to export the hundred thousand plus websites that use that plugin then you can infer that those wordpress websites are realtor websites because they're using the idx plugin so now you know that all of these people have wordpress websites that are real estate websites that are probably they probably look really bad and or they probably don't convert well oh and or they're probably outdated and so then you could use those people and go find like what was their website called like grasshopper or carrot or something like there's a half a dozen sas platforms out there that will basically make uh real estate websites that look really really good um and you don't need to reinvent the wheel you can still charge two thousand dollars i know people that use card templates and charge two thousand dollars and it takes them 30 minutes to set up a site right like you you don't have to make this custom you could just piggyback off of some overfunded silicon valley real estate website startup i love that and just yeah exactly and just say hey and you don't even need to have a customer first you could just point to other real estate websites that are using that same platform and say hey stacy i see you're on wordpress good for you for having a website because it's surprising how many realtors don't so you're going to kind of compliment them but like did you know that a website that has x y and z features results in 36 more leads to real estate agents and it doesn't cost any more than wordpress um so it's like they want to know immediately how can a better website actually lead to more money in their pocket right because you don't want to you don't want to sell them oh your website's ugly i'll make it look better this will lead to more money in your pocket um and you pointing to other websites they're using that same platform the implication is that these are case studies these are your old customers but no you're just showing them examples right i love that yeah you can pull stats off of the platform's website like the 36 or whatever it is because i'm sure they have those stats and just piggyback on those stats um you can build your own website with that platform even though you're not a realtor and then you can go after people that are already sold on having a website they know it's important it a website is one of those things where it's been outdated forever you know it's outdated and you know you need to fix it you know you should fix it but you're not going to until you get a cold email you know like something has to be the impetus for you to do that and so you could be that cold email you can still charge what you want it doesn't have to be custom you can you can copy and paste all these websites literally like you do on call on card and then swap out the city and the name sweet okay i love this this is a fantastic i feel like this is uh kind of that last key in place to really make this work i love this good yeah i think uh i think this will work and honestly you can you can text them as well um there's the good and bad about selling to realtors i've done it my wife is one uh the good is that you can get their info super easily the bad is that because of that everyone is pitching to them non-stop but there is more good than bad because of all the people you're going to cold call they are the most likely to answer their phone um it could be a listing right so that's what i would do okay thank you i feel like i've got some good direction here absolutely good luck all right thanks joe um chris we have matthew stewart next he's a mobile home park owner he's looking for some advice there matthew you're up hey chris thanks for having me on and he thanks for uh allowing me to join here i uh we purchased about six parks over the last two years um in north alabama and tennessee uh three mh and three rv and um i had a couple of specific operational questions and marketing questions around the rv um parks in particular um one being you know we struggle a lot in the winter months um being in north alabama it's it's not as ideal as uh south alabama for for winter rving and um we see our income kind of fluctuate pretty drastically you know in the in the summer we're getting 25 000 or more a month and then in the winter it's down to 15 000 which really eats into a lot of our fixed costs um uh obviously causes a lot of a lot of stress and i'm trying to figure out ways to kind of even out our revenue and market to um people that that would be interested in in in winter rving um our target market is is typically contractors that are coming into the area you know obviously huntsville is growing like crazy and and um we're over in muscle shoals but we do get a lot of that bleed over and um and then also retired folks um we have a lot of retired folks that end up spending three to five years um sometimes at our rv parks so i was just kind of wanted to pick your brain on on what you've seen success in the past at your parks or uh if you have any ideas for how we might be able to target those people okay so is your revenue fluctuating because you said you had mh and rv parks is it fluctuating from the rvs then because it's month to month uh correct yeah our mh is is doing great okay and are these parks marketed as like an amenity rich short-term park or more as like a long-term low amenity park they're more of a longer term you know we we've got laundry bath house dog park you know kind of the basics um but we don't have any like pools or pickleball courts or anything like that and do you have how big are the parks on a pad side basis each uh they're both about 50 pads um we just added a couple tiny homes and those we've seen a lot of success with those just running out floyd furnished utilities included months a month so i'm considering that that might be a good strategy you know obviously it's capital intensive but um i have a hunch that those will be a lot easier to fill in the winter um it's a little bit easier to live in a tiny home than it is an rv in the winter it's true so muscle shoals and where's the other one they're both uh right there muscle shoals and then we have another one out in hot springs arkansas but i'm i'm kind of more focused on the muscle shoals ones right now because those are where we've been struggling okay so they're each about 50 pads both in muscle shoals are they both all rv or a mix of rv and mh uh they're all rv okay um so your revenue is dropping almost in half uh just because people are going back for their south for the winter yeah you know a lot of the contracts end around december and so we see a huge drop off in december and it doesn't really pick up until march or april so um you know there's like three months or sometimes four months that um you know they're they're pretty stressful have you thought about marketing um your vacancies on a yearly basis to account for that um i know up north it's pretty common like instead of 600 a month they'll charge eight grand for a year knowing that for four months at a time those pads are going to sit empty yeah i mean i really like that idea i thought about kind of offering some deals like you know sign up for a six month kind of lease and you get the seventh month free or something like that all the promotional stuff we've done referrals and stuff doesn't seem to have moved the needle at all all but uh you know i could explore that yearly option for sure have you ever talked to the customers that have left for the winter and like specifically ask them like why are you leaving did you know you were leaving when you got here is there something we could have done better or you just are just kind of assuming it's getting cold so they're they're leaving um so it yes i've talked to a few of them um a lot of them that i've talked to they're just their job is ending and they're moving on to somewhere else and a lot of them have said you know we'll probably come back in the next couple of years um because their their work will send them back but um uh i think that we could definitely do a better job of kind of having an exit survey whether it's a phone call or an email that we send to them allow them to give us some feedback as to why they might be leaving i don't think they're going to other parks in the area i think they're really just headed out of town and i've had a couple people ask you know should i please store my camper here for the winter so i don't have to move it and um you know what they'd be looking to pay for that you know at first i was against it because i thought i could fill those sites um you know but you know we're dropping from like 85 percent occupancy to like 50 um pretty quickly so um you know we definitely could have some sort of storage component and you know obviously there's no utility costs involved with that in the winter months do you have space to do that if they were not on the pad sites like um not really i mean we've there's a little bit at one of our parks um but we we've tried to maximize the amount of pads that we can we can put on these parks um all of our open space is um either on gas lines or um tends to flood a little bit so okay um what would you say the percentage mix is between people that leave that are like retirees more full-time of a tenant versus blue-collar workers that are there for a job um you know we've we've managed to keep most of most or all of our retired folks they're they kind of like enjoy the community we do community events and stuff and they kind of have like a little little click um they tend to stay together um it's it's pretty much mostly the contract workers um and i know there's still work going on in the area we're just not getting any of that yeah all right so the the surefire true way to really fix an occupancy issue is to buy a unit and it might be a tiny home it might be an rv uh we used to do this we bought a park in a city with literally like 800 people in it and not like outside of a big city it was it was out there right it was all by itself um kiowa oklahoma to be exact and the only way to fix occupancy at that park and i've never seen this not work was to buy a eight to fifteen thousand dollar trailer 25 to 35 feet usually five to ten years old um so not a motorhome just just to pull behind either gooseneck or or otherwise um and then do a lease to own and really target it towards people that are going to live there for six months to six years at a time it takes some capital obviously there's not really a way around that you don't really make money on the financing um i'm sure you can we never tried to uh we would just basically say you know your lot rent is 250 and your payment is 250 so it's 500 a month and then uh obviously if you have to eat the electric then it would be closer to 600 otherwise you would just it would be direct build um i've never seen that not work like if you were to go to facebook marketplace and post an ad like i would first go to facebook marketplace and see what trailers in your area are costing you could probably find one for 10 grand and then kind of back of the envelope what you know what that would look like and then just take some pictures from google images post an ad on facebook marketplace and muscle shoals and see how many inquiries you get and those are your future tenants is that is that a tenable idea a hundred percent i've been exploring that pretty pretty uh heavily it's good to hear it from you who's got a lot of experience here i've got a number of investors and you know they're um i i need to kind of convince them that this is the right the right move and so it's definitely good to hear from somebody with experience that this is this is the way to go um and i found a number of campers and park model um trailers and um also just tiny homes that i think i could probably keep our our purchase costs from around 15 to 20 000 and how well the units and um you know the rents what we're getting on those like we're renting a tiny home for 1100 a month right now um so it's a one bed one 400 square foot tiny home uh so i like i'm convinced that that's the way to go it's definitely good to hear you say that and then um another quick question on on the mh stuff you know obviously owning we we mostly own most of our homes and i i want to transition them to tenant owned um and i'm considering like giving away a lot of the homes and selling them for for dirt cheap just to kind of turn like turn the park into a tenant owned home park you know our basis in the parks is such that it would allow us to be operating a tenant owned home park at an eight cap even if we just gave away all the homes and right now they're they're running at about a 10 cap or 11 cap and so and i just hate having to deal with hvac and flooring issues and just running operating you know all the i think we have 77 mobile homes now and it's just a pain and it's expensive to hire people and um so i wanted to know have you ever done that before have you seen success and kind of what are the biggest risks you've seen with that absolutely um i mean that was our playbook was we would convert all the park owned homes to tenant owned homes and we would usually just do it uh for free um and a lot of times in in fact most of the time their payment wouldn't even change so if it were 700 a month then it's like hey um fyi uh your lot rent is 350 your payment is now 350. um we're going to deed you over the home if you want to move um then you have 90 days whatever you need um and we were very clear like this means that the home is now yours but it's now your responsibility as well right and i would say 20 of the people would just say yeah okay i'm out you know too hard but 80 and say okay you know they don't skip a beat they're not pissed they they get it um and you have to do it right like there are some states where you have to be like a mortgage broker to do that texas and oklahoma was was very forgiving i don't i don't know what alabama's laws are but yeah i i would definitely suggest doing that would you um suggest even trying to get like three to five grand out of these homes or just is it clean it depends on the condition um yeah i would unless they're just completely trash but yeah i think three to five they're in good shape i mean they would sell on facebook marketplace for 20 to 25 i'm sure oh then absolutely yeah i i wouldn't give those away if i were you okay and the um so the reason i want to get some money is to kind of build in sort of like a a maintenance fund for our tenants to say look you know obviously taking over the home means that you know if the hvac goes out it's your issue like we're willing to help you in the first year that's a good idea just a really good idea yeah i never thought of that that's a great idea i like that a lot yeah and just kind of keeping that away for a year and then after a year we can cash it out or pay down debt with it whatever but um okay yeah well you could even like you could give them an option to pay an extra 50 a month for that like fund and it's it's kind of like insurance it's like if you're paying into that and your ac goes out tomorrow you know we will proportionally use funds to help fix that right yeah but if you're not paying into that then you're on your own okay that's a great idea yeah i hadn't thought of that i like that okay well this has been helpful i don't want to pick up too much more of your time but um i really appreciate you having me on and giving me this advice absolutely matthew thank you all right cool thanks matthew all right chris we got david next he wants to start a business that he can get his kids involved with david you're up hey chris uh appreciate appreciate all your insight so um i'm actually looking for a business for myself and my kids so i heard you mention kids i heard you mention that your wife's a realtor so we have that kind of in common so just to give you a a little bit of an idea i think the first speaker um had a little similarity with my myself as well so i'm in sales i'm in mortgage sales um and we have a portfolio of long-term and short-term rental properties that we currently own um it's fun however the i think property values have have really like shot up and we've just got like some investment capital that i'd like to start looking into to explore like different new business ventures um so uh like i said we're in a smaller town uh norfolk virginia it's not as big as houston or any of the other places that i've kind of heard so far um and uh just just trying to get your your insight on like different businesses that we can uh get into that would like require minimal direct involvement um and allow for like operational management through like hired help so when you talk about the the short-term rental business is that what you do professionally or you own that real estate personally so i own the real estate personally okay and then you you have a job in in the mortgage industry yes okay and you because of the fact the home values have gone up so much you're not really looking to scale that business right now you'd rather try something else as well well so i'm very disciplined with what i buy and and that i mean i guess that could be a good and a bad thing right so i think i've everything that i've bought so far has been really good values and i've uh double triple quadrupled and sometimes even like 10 15 time like my initial capital investment however everything that i'm offering on right now i'm getting outbid on so everyone's fighting for that same type of property that i'm looking for now so i'm just looking to get into other like other businesses like you know i'm uh i'm i'm heavily involved in a lot of like um digital marketing groups so like you know i believe in like the one minute videos to google my business and all that other stuff so just trying to get some business ideas that could maybe take advantage of some of the skills that i currently already have and the knowledge that are currently already have and just um you know get virtual assistants to run local service ads or google ads to scale and build or buy into a franchise i'm really not sure man i'm just uh grasping for straws at this point so what if you have this idea to start a business with your with your family i assume that you already have a couple ideas that are top of mind you're you're kind of throwing around home services what ideas have you guys talked or thought about already so you really caught my attention on one tweet that i mean i still can't get out of my head and that's where the whole 13 year old son comes into play too right um so that was the bounce house business so i've basically gone back and read a bunch of your tweets and i was like oh i didn't even know this guy has a newsletter so i i think i i don't know what kind of businesses we can get into i mean i've considered buying land and putting warehouse space there because you know we're we're part of a soccer academy and you know i've had people reach out to me saying they want to build like batting cages and all this other stuff i have contractors constantly reaching out to me every single day saying hey they need storage so they want to buy a house with a bunch of land so they can build all this storage space so i'm just trying to figure out how i can like you know solve a need um but solve a need in a smaller town because i don't have any intention of leaving this town for the next 15 years um so i just need to put my money to work and and and scale into profitable businesses that don't require a lot of involvement from me yeah okay so i'm getting some ideas so you're in norfolk i've got the map pulled up here what i don't know if you want to like blast out like where you live exactly but i kind of want to get an idea of how rural or urban that you are uh norfolk norfolk is i mean i live in a town that has a very similar uh population as norfolk okay okay um how is land prohibitively expensive there i don't think so i mean i've got a i've got a lot of resources to get land to i mean there's auction land um i mean i think zoning and uh you know the use of the land and clearing of the land may be my only challenges but depending on what your business idea is i'm sure i can find land okay so i i'm biased obviously but that just you know everyone's biased so i'm going to give you ideas that i've had because these are the ideas that i'm working with every day and i see the promise there there's all kinds of things that i work with that i don't tweet about because it doesn't look promising and i would never start it right but the 2100 square foot metal building in my it's not technically my backyard the property behind me is amazing like i i had no idea how much demand there is for um for metal like ugly simple kit metal buildings that you can order on the internet and have someone come install that are between 1500 and 5000 square feet they're like there is no shortage of ways that you can use these things so if i were you i would go find call it one to five acres you don't need a lot of space um of raw land make sure it's zoned right um make sure that you can put a metal building on it before you buy it obviously and i would literally buy one of those metal buildings um like like i tweeted about for that sports complex idea um you want to get it extra well insulated you want to put hvac in there you want to put plumbing in there get a bathroom in there and then you have a foundation that you can do any number of things so put it near the edge of your property to where if you were to add more metal buildings um there'd be plenty of space to uh at that point you can do this so you can subdivide it and rent out part of it to pay the note on all of it um you can rent out the entire thing uh you can go buy five bounce houses and store them there before you even talked about anything i was going to suggest that if you're going to start a business with your kids that you should start some sort of a rental business um i mean there's a lot of water in norfolk like i know a guy that does kayak rentals that just crushes it uh he just absolutely crushes it you could store those there you could store bounce houses there you could just rent it out um you could start a home services business there you could you could have classic car parking there but if you have hvac and a bathroom and the zoning and a cheap metal building uh i say cheap it's cheap relative to you know building any other type of building there's a zillion things you can do with it and that buys you a good year before you really have to decide okay what do you think of that i mean i think it's a great idea um so i think it was your tweet you had an indoor soccer you had a indoor soccer field right okay so how much are those buildings typically and what it costs to put up so i bought the land um as it was uh i i bought the building in the land it was already there but i believe it was like i mean this was 2016 2017 when they put it up i think it was like 60 grand back then um it's probably two or three times that by now um but it's i mean it's extremely affordable i i don't know what prices are lately but okay okay no this is this is good i mean this is definitely right up my alley i think if i have enough land i can maybe do some outdoor contractor parking as well oh absolutely yeah okay okay so yeah of the kid-friendly businesses i mean do you think that the bounce house in in a small town like this would possibly work or laser tag or those little orby guns or what are what are you thinking would be a good business for like a 13 year old like highly motivated kid to to start i think a good business like a good rental business for kids is one um with a broad enough name and a broad enough offering that you could really hone in on any one of them so uh you might cringe at this but there's a lot of money in like um petting like petting zoo like mobile petting zoo businesses um i don't know if you want to raise animals no no not at all but i mean you could do you could do the bounce house idea you at the same time as the laser tag idea as a kayak rental like like just a rental all in one all in one with the the sole idea that we're not going to do all in one forever we're going to see where the demand is right but how much does it cost to buy all this stuff it's it's all fairly cheap cheap so yeah so i mean i did start a a mobile um like festival business and and that worked out really well but now i've got a trailer full of restaurant supplies that i can't sell yeah um that's that's just the downside of it i i think that if you're if you're starting the type of business that we're talking about they're cheaper assets than restaurant supplies um i mean you can even rent out wedding wreaths that's a good size business um or just wedding chairs like there's if i were more prepared i'd list off a dozen things that you could rent out but there's all kinds of how do you manage people only need for a weekend so how do you manage to be in so many businesses without having to put yourself into all of this do you have a bunch of partnerships because i mean ultimately i would like to get out of what i'm doing i i don't like it i mean i like it i really do like it but it it ties me to virginia right my goal is to be able to you know be able to travel everywhere um be able to work remotely and and just manage businesses uh without having to you know be ready for that you know that christmas eve phone call that they're asking about hey i want to i want to buy this house and i need a i need a mortgage that closes in 14 days yeah so for something like that i mean i'm not sure that this type of business will eventually get me out of this without tying me to this area well first of all any any business is sellable right like you could sell it if you needed to you could shut it down if you needed to it doesn't sound like you're you're trying to start a billion dollar idea um i wouldn't get hung up on that like i would just try to start something that whets your appetite helps you taste entrepreneurship a little more than you already have get your kids involved and then whatever skills you acquire along the way even if you end up just moving to your dream location and shutting it down you'll be able to pick it back up um when you get your new place okay all right well i appreciate it chris and uh yeah thanks for absolutely thanks for all the knowledge that you put out there yeah thanks david all right thanks david go ahead chris yeah we got one more here last one up is tommy tommy uh go for it and if anyone didn't get a chance to go um we'll do this again next week and we'll put you at the top of the list next week so yeah hey chris thanks for uh thanks for doing this a long time follower i'm mostly a twitter lurker in the uh real estate and you know small business uh space of of twitter but uh come from a family that's owned an auto garage for since 1964 um in alexandria virginia um you know grew up working on cars with my dad and my uncles and my grandpa and uh i went off to play college sports got a corporate job and so i've been in federal sales for five and a half almost five years now four and a half years um did a small state coaching college ball after after college but um two years ago just by completely accidentally started a moving business um so i was just driving down the highway one day driving out to my mom's about two hours away and i just every 30 seconds i saw a u-haul truck uh so i went out and i bought a five by eight trailer that i figured i'd use it for hauling my motorcycle around you know and then you know able to use well you know playing flag football the next weekend guy says i gotta go pick up a u-haul you know i'm getting my floors redone and so i said i'll just use my trailer instead so he puts his couch and his coffee table on there while he's getting his house remodeled right uh you know gave me 60 bucks for that and then he told a buddy about it next week trailers rented out for 100 bucks and so on and so forth right so we we took that and and this is just nights and weekends uh got on next door and on facebook marketplace just messaging you know the properties for rent properties for sale you know somebody posts on next door that they need help donating furniture and all that stuff so um had a buddy who was a strength trainer uh got laid off during covid because all the gyms closed and was at night school so he and i just started picking up furniture for people on nights and weekends now we own again two hours later we've done about 275k in revenue we've got two trucks um i'm still working full time in my software sales job and kind of running the business per se while he's running the field so he drives the truck to every job manages the cruise does all the materials all that stuff so essentially what i'm looking for and and david by the way i have a lot of interest in the the norfolk virginia beach hampton area we just did a trip down there so david if you're still on shoot me a dm let's connect i was also thinking that david could do a trailer rental business put him in his metal building yeah not that you want to compare it was but literally the day before i rented out to my buddy i i went and got some spray paint some stencils from lowe's and you know did uh tommy's trailers llc and my personal phone number on it you know and so yeah just i think just again every every other kid i went to high school with half of them is a you know a realtor or you know working in the mortgage space and obviously where i live is is very high growth area right outside washington dc so i think my family's name kind of carries a lot of weight given that our auto garage specializes in german imports so we have a lot of high ticket clientele but i think what my question is is you know we're not making enough to i am i am the uh the bottleneck here right i'm doing all the sales i'm doing all the estimating um you know my partner is great at the physical work and man field work but not the uh you know answer the phone call and and customer service and and giving out estimates in front of customers type of guy right so either you know we've got offers to buy our our name from some of the other local uh in town moving companies to uh to kind of you know sell the name and then kind of come on board as a contract salesman um but i really see this as an opportunity to be an add-on business for our family's auto garage and then kind of spin up other home service businesses out of it almost forming like a holding company to where we have we've got the auto garage we've got the moving and storage business you know maybe throw in landscaping or home painting or you know things like that as i kind of continue to grow this you know year over year so that's just kind of where i'm coming from really curious your thoughts on kind of growing a service business and kind of removing myself as as the bottleneck or the face of the business so that it really has an opportunity to flourish if you were to only keep doing what you're doing how much room is there left to grow in your area a ton i mean dc is just an absolute monster of growth right now i'm sitting outside of a senior living facility that's getting built on top of an old mcdonald's right now my buddy's the the the broker realtor that's helping lease all these units right now so we get we get calls like this every single day to where we're trying to you know we're getting a lot of office move uh type type deals coming in now too so again i'm the bottleneck because i'm i'm not ready to quit my full-time job just to you know replace that salary and and go on on this is not we're not there yet you know i have full faith that if i did quit my day job i could i could replace my salary in a couple months but you know it's a it's a chicken or the egg situation right married three kids you don't want to lose that stability right off the bat oh how many trucks do you have uh we own two trucks i'm trying to sell the first smaller truck so we can go ahead and buy a second bigger truck um and we are local only i don't do any interstate um again we the you know hampton roads area down in norfolk area you know the other day but that was uh kind of a family friend helping job and i don't prefer to go long distance if we don't have to and do you do any paid ads but what type of marketing are you doing today so 90 of what we're doing is referral based um you know me and my business partner both went to high school here um we just know everybody um i spend a little bit on google and i spend uh i spend money on next door that's been great for us because that's where we got started so we kind of have our niche of being the local guys on next door the go-to guys and then other that we have we've got our logo and everything up on one truck and and on off days we drive that thing around town and park it in uh high traffic areas like near the target or down on king street where all the businesses are and where all the tourists are coming through and things like that do you have any data that shows that that's working parking your truck in those areas yeah yeah we just got a call uh this morning actually from a lady who saw our truck parked near my buddy's house uh in downtown alexandria um asking if we can come give her a quote from march 18th how if you were to pair this with your your family's auto business how do you think you could leverage that like what what is the upsell what is the crossover there yeah so um i think it's just brand name like like like name recognition right you know our business has been here for 60 years we're a stalwart right i mean we're we are the go-to guys for your your german you know import vehicles um it's a very very high-end high ticket um auto garage that has a really really strong reputation in a in a a fairly wealthy area um so a lot of these customers are are you're breaking up tommy i can't hear you yeah yeah tomie dropped for me i don't know tom are you there maybe they have a family member you know moving or something like that but i haven't used it as leverage okay does your does the auto business keep a good record of your your past customers because they're a good crm there um not for my moving business no it's completely no i know i know i know it's separate but oh yeah absolutely yeah everything they've they've got it all automated a whole automated crm system there and i assume your family would be okay like leveraging that relationship yeah absolutely like i've i've gone so far as to like i said i've got my uncle you know has flyers out you know on the uh on the front counter for us and and we bring our truck there to do all of our maintenance anyway so again it's a high traffic area where we kind of use it as a billboard you know once okay so is it true that the busy season is just coming up it's like going to hear in a month or two yeah absolutely so december and january were awful um february has been great march is going to start looking really good april through august is absolutely crazy okay all right well all right i've got my prescription i'm going to suggest something that i don't normally do because it gives me anxiety but tell me i think you need to quit your job man like yeah you have everything right now you've got it all lined up you're about to get a bigger truck you've got a whole crm with probably tens of thousands if not definitely thousands of customers of your family business that they would be willing um to to to lend you it's everyone that has a car has a need for moving so although it's not like landscaping and trees there is crossover there right and if if you or someone in your family were to start hitting the phones uh on the car side of the business to say hey you know whatever your last name is what's your last name uh kesterman you know the kesterman you know the kesterman family how we do business we do the same thing on our moving side of our business we've been open for a couple years we're looking to really scale and expand um do you have any moving needs or do you know of anyone that does right like that is super low-hanging fruit furthermore you're you're dabbling in google ads you could scale that also i had a call just yesterday with a billboard salesman for clear channel and i specifically asked him this is just coincidental i said what which of your clients can actually say um your billboards brought me more business because billboards you know it's it's kind of like brand awareness it's it's really hard to track it and he said moving companies it's like when they put a billboard in the woodlands or in sugarland or college station they start getting calls from those areas and they're able to track it like you could throw up a couple billboards and blow up your business like i i hate suggesting that people quit their jobs because people always come to me looking for me to convince them to do that forgetting the fact that i've never had to do that i've always been a business owner and the thought of having a six figure job having three kids to support and then quitting it stresses me out so i don't want other people to do that but in your case like you're gonna figure it out you're gonna you're gonna find more business than you ever thought was possible and so we could talk about you know landscaping and other home services but this could be a 10 million dollar business just moving locally um i would just keep leaning into that wrap your trucks get a third truck take a little risk leverage up your google ad spend i have your website pulled up optimize your website website my sister threw that together first no it's fine it's better than nothing it's better than nothing and um i would just i would just go deeper on that yeah yeah that's uh that's a conversation we've had i'm like i got a couple of contracts i'm trying to sell i think like august 30th is my my hard cutoff date for the uh for the sales job right you don't want to leave that commission on the table before you go all in so okay yeah that's kind of what we're looking at right now yeah but you got this man i mean you're gonna be shocked like you're gonna be mad that you didn't quit sooner once you see the progress that you make after you quit yeah yeah i've been on the fence about it for about a year now we're just we're at the point where we're growing so fast that i'm i'm the guy that's in the way because i'm trying to do two things at once so it's either hire a sales guy or make this make this my all-in thing you know well and that was my that was going to be my first suggestion before i heard how promising this was and that was just record all of your sales calls like record everything you're doing like as harsh as it sounds you're replaceable right nick saban's replaceable you're replaceable you can hire someone you know even if you even if you absolutely refuse to quit your job you could find someone to do as good of a job as you especially if you were able to keep your finger over them and and keep good close tabs on them and not just let them run wild yeah cool well chris that's all i had i just wanted to uh just kind of get your thoughts on on what avenue to take so appreciate it yeah good absolutely good luck well um thank you everyone i had fun uh i hope you learned something and uh i think we'll try this again next week so would love to chat with you then
