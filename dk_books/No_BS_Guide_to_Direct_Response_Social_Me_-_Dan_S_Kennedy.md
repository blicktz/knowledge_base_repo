###### Forget about highlighting text or dog-earing pages … I actually ripped several pages right out of the book and taped them on my office wall for easy reference. I was just thumbing through at first and found a Facebook

 who believe “clicks” are marketing, awaken! Yes, you must measure effectiveness of your campaigns. Yes, you want a highly leveraged ROI.
 And, yes, most firms have not yet figured out how to monetize internet- based marketing. That was me. But it doesn’t have to be you. Each chapter reveals solutions to help you implement a profitable social media marketing

###### This book puts the “direct” in “direct response” with clear, candid, practical
 advice for anyone trying to rise above the avalanche of social media outreach. Their emphasis on results—meaning revenue, not awareness—is
 honest and a refreshing reminder how to allocate our time and resources
 most efficiently.

###### A lot has been written about leveraging social media and we have been conditioned to believe it’s easy, and it just happens. I haven’t found a book that clearly tells you how to leverage social media to generate leads—until now. Dan and Kim show you how to get a strong ROI, increased sales, and
 explain why you shouldn’t worry about metrics that don’t matter: “likes”
 and “comments.”

—DAVID H. MATTSON, CEO AND PRESIDENT OF SANDLER TRAINING,

[WWW.SANDLER.COM](http://www.sandler.com/)

###### This book is so valuable that I’ve handed it to my staff to implement its techniques. Kim and Dan lay out exact methods with case studies on how they got the results, which are so often held close to the chest of marketers.
 They teach you how to convert cold leads to paying customers, and the
 exact metrics of options and lifetime value of a customer.

[—DR. JEREMY WEISZ, FOUNDER OF INSPIREDINSIDER, WWW.INSPIREDINSIDER.COM](http://www.inspiredinsider.com/)

###### I’m usually a speed reader who can finish a book in a couple hours, but this
 book is so helpful that I savored it and read it slowly. I freakin’ love how Dan puts down social media because he’s voicing the issues that kept me from buying ads there. And I learned a lot from seeing how Kim’s process
 can lead to the measurable results that Dan demands.

[—ANDREW WARNER, FOUNDER OF MIXERGY.COM, WWW.MIXERGY.COM](http://www.mixergy.com/)

###### Every time you communicate, you are either adding value or taking up space. No B.S. Guide to Direct Response Social Media Marketing teaches
 marketers how to cater messages for their audience. Dan and Kim’s combination of direct marketing principles and social media know-how make it easy for business owners to target their audience and stand out from
 competitors.

 direct contrast, this book details how to take Dan Kennedy-style direct response marketing and apply it to social media to ensure real results. If you
 are going to use social media marketing for your business, arm yourself
 with this book by Kennedy and Walsh Phillips.

### In the Last Moments …

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

 In the last moments of finishing this book, I received the unfortunate news that Dan Kennedy had come down with an infection and only had a few days left to live.
 I was in Capri on holiday, and although I was with close friends, none of them were part of this world of crazy pants direct-response entrepreneurs who would fully understand the impact of this news, nor did I want to ruin their vacation. So, I turned to the very thing this book is centered on … social media. There I got to see story after story shared about the difference Dan had made in others’ lives. (See just some of the many stories shared on pages xvi to xviii.)


-----

-----

-----

###### Not only did it provide comfort and solace, but inspiration to continue to pursue the mission of this book … helping you get your message out in a way that people will listen and more important, take action.
 Admittedly, I love the irony that tribute after tribute was posted on Facebook about a guy who could only be reached with a fax machine.
 While it wasn’t easy to complete the book not knowing if I would be able to talk to my co-author again until we get to heaven, I knew finishing this is exactly what he would have wanted. That and making sure there are a lot of calls-to-action in each chapter. In miraculous news, as the book was in final editing, Dan recovered and literally walked out of hospice. His living legacy lives on.
 If you want to truly honor him while he is here to appreciate it, read, absorb, and then take action. His legacy multiplies the more we all succeed.


-----

#### A Lot Has Changed … March 3, 2015

###### That’s when the original No B.S. Direct Response Social Media Marketing book was submitted for print. To say a lot has changed since then would be an understatement.
 Barak Obama was president, Facebook Live was just available to celebrities, and Meerkat and Periscope were supposedly the next biggest things. Today Facebook Live is one of the most effective ways to grow your business on social media.
 Back in 2015, Instagram was used to show chiseled physiques and not something you’d use for business.
 Now with over a billion active users, it is rich in opportunities to generate leads and flip them into sales, regardless of industry, niche, or geographic location. And it is still possible to grow this platform organically, aka for free.
 Personally, a lot has changed as well. Dan Kennedy went through another sale of GKIC Insider’s Circle, now No B.S. Inner Circle, purchased by one of his longtime proteges, Adam Witty.
 I sold my marketing agency to Josh Turner, founder of LinkedSelling, enabling my dream of devoting time to growing a coaching and training business, Powerful Professionals. And the focus? It worked. Powerful Professionals was just ranked No. 475 on the “Inc. 5000” for the growth we’ve had since 2015.
 Dan released multiple books since 2015, including the new Magnetic Marketing: How to Attract a Flood of New Customers That Pay, Stay, and Refer (ForbesBooks, 2018), https://amzn.to/2liZfqc, and I released my first solo book under Entrepreneur Press, The Ultimate Guide to Instagram for Business (Entrepreneur Press, 2017).
 Dan still hates social media with a venomous passion, except for how it can make money for him and his clients.
 I still love it, for not only the ROI from my audience of a million plus, but also because of the power of community. I’ve seen firsthand how an online network can bring comfort to a grieving parent, resources to a family post-fire, and joy for those achieving milestones.

###### Yes, there are problems—dollars wasted by businesses, a comparison trap of “grass is greener” envy, and a time suck of epic proportion.
 But that’s humans, my friend, not the media. The good news is, your story can be different: one of success and triumph; one of years of hard work that leads to your “overnight success” and becomes folklore for those entrepreneurs who come after you.
 You are different because you have chosen to arm yourself with the knowledge, strategy, and path to accomplish your goals. That—along with your gumption and a little chutzpah—is all it takes.
 In this edition, we’ve revised a lot. There’s a chapter on Instagram and LinkedIn, how to use live video to generate leads, and the power of filling your sales funnel through social media, and so much more.
 The strategies are timeless and the techniques up to date. Start with the Introduction, and take action one strategy at a time. No matter how slow you go, keep moving forward.

### Introduction

#### Why Would I Write a Book About Social Media and More Important, Why Should You Read It?

###### by Dan Kennedy Everyone’s talking about it, but nobody knows what they’re talking about.
 As pervasive as this nonsense is, the buzz is becoming quantifiable, and more businesses are feeling pressure to join the social media bandwagon. But what are consumers’ purchases really telling us about social media’s influence? And what mistakes can you hope to avoid without falling victim to the buzz?
 An unbiased, independent poll conducted by Gallup in May and June 2014 revealed that 63% of consumers are not influenced by social media regarding their buying choices, and only 5% claim social media has significant impact on their buying decisions.
 According to the May 26, 2017, Social Media Week article titled “How Social Media Is Influencing Purchasing Decisions,” “Seventy-four percent of shoppers make buying decisions based on social media.”[1] The Sprout Social 2019 Index dives a bit deeper on the subject, making the point that “this shift isn’t specific to B2C companies. B2B businesses are benefiting from social media’s purchasing influence too. Marketers need to identify what types of content and social actions will take that connection a step further. Sixty-one percent of social followers said posts offering discounts could encourage them to make a first purchase, while 45% said informational material would convince them to buy.”[2]
 I have no love affair with social media. In broadest context, I consider it a “cancer of narcissism” destructive to society, a way for people to feel important with zero reason or merit, thus removing essential motivation for a creative and constructive work. It brings other ills, too, with which I won’t bore you.


-----

###### As a marketing and sales media expert, I lean toward Tupperware CEO Rick Goings’ characterization of it as “antisocial media.” I see enormous waste of time and money by people creating small and unscalable traffic but also, in some cases, huge traffic to YouTube videos, Facebook sites, etc., with little monetary results.
 But with all that said, I hold stock in a tobacco company, so I am not above making money on things I would not personally consume, and even consider a plague on society.
 I also know smart people who manage to consistently use social media for real lead generation and produce directly creditable sales results.
 So despite being a giraffe on a tricycle about all this, I’m in it. The reason I tell you this is to make the point: There are times in your life you are going to feel, maybe actually be, and certainly be looked at, like a giraffe on a tricycle.
 Sometimes you volunteer for this—like my early days in speaking. “Awkward” doesn’t even come close. Sometimes it is pushed upon you— my corporate and personal bankruptcies all those moons ago. “Humiliating,” “depressing,” and “frightening” are inadequate adjectives.
 When asked how he arrived at his brilliant discoveries, Einstein said, “I grope.”
 Much has been said and written about trying to abbreviate the qualities and characteristics and behavior of top achievers, mostly in futility. There are no correct simple answers to anything, but if you had a gun against my pet—The Million Dollar Dog’s cute little head—and demanded the ultimate abbreviation, I’d say, resilience.
 That includes a lot of groping … with the new, with the difficult, with problems.
 For at least as long as I choose to keep working at my trade, I must agree to some groping and coping. It’s all OK. It is never what you bungle that defines you or your success.
 Robert Downey Jr. is today a hugely successful and extremely rich actor. Only a handful of years ago, he was in and out of rehab, unbankable, uninsurable, and written off for dead by most in Hollywood.
 Two real estate crashes ago, Donald Trump was fundamentally bankrupt, bedeviled by multiple creditors (including Chinese bankers), publicly embarrassed, and written off as dead by much of the media—the


-----

###### same media that genuflects today. Such stories are the true stories of the rich and most of the rich and famous.
 The fact of the matter is, I decided it was important to co-author a book about direct-response social media marketing, and again with this revised edition, because no matter what I say, you are most likely still going to move forward with it. And in fact, some of the time, I recommend that you do.
 I do have clients getting direct, profitable results, and I do see legitimate marketing being done in this venue. If you venture into social media, handle it with care. Do not be peer-pressured to follow how others are using it. I’d say 99% of them are doing it wrong.
 One of your best defenses is to stay grounded about profit—not gross revenue. Real profit is the only proof of sound strategy or (as an investor) of capable management. I actually sat in a corporate boardroom and listened as a board member urged one small company’s leaders to copycat a Facebook strategy, using a big name company (in a different, unrelated industry) as the shining example to emulate—despite there being no evidence of any kind of profit derived from its grandiose exercise.
 Incredibly, the others took him seriously. They should have burned him at the stake.
 This is not to say that online or social media can’t be made to disgorge profit. Chris Cardell, a client of mine, described his uses of this media to earn great profits. My co-author Kim Walsh Phillips also created real, measurable, and profitable results from social media for her clients I know personally—and people I know can count. And now that she sold her agency, her students tout success in the strategies she teaches at Powerful Professionals.
 This is why I wrote this book with her. She uses direct-response marketing principles to drive real results and profit. This must be your standard—money math—and no other.
 Unfortunately, most businesses proceed without caution and make a lot of mistakes in the process. Proceed with extreme diligence to ensure you are not in the majority. Once again, that isn’t the wise place to be.

#### Data Speaks Louder Than Beliefs


-----

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips My heart was beating so fast I was sure everyone else in the room could hear it. Boom, boom boom … boom, boom, boom …
 After I was done sharing my cost-per-client acquisition numbers and that my specialty was direct-response social media, the man said, “A social media person who actually cares about the numbers? I’ve never met anyone like you before. I’d like to hire you to work on my social media and bring you in to speak at my event of Shark investments.”
 Inside I was freaking out. Kevin “Mr. Wonderful” O’Leary from NBC’s Shark Tank just asked me to do consulting work for him and speak at an event with people from the show. I mean, could this really be happening?
 While my insides were a cyclone of pandemonium, I managed to squeak out, “That sounds like a great plan to me.”
 All I could think was: Wait until I can tell my husband what just happened …
 The Tall One (aka my husband Ian) and I spent many a Friday night after putting our girls to bed snuggled up on the couch geeking out on watching Shark Tank. We’d make bets on whether or not the entrepreneurs would get the deal, roll our eyes at some of the silly answers the guests would give, and always agree with Mr. Wonderful’s assessment.
 When I got the chance to work with Kevin as a consultant for his investment firm, it was a giddy fan girl moment. And it just got better.
 Turns out, he’s incredibly kind in person, but still no BS when it comes to business. That made me even more of a fan girl. He listened without hesitation to advice about his social media marketing and immediately saw a positive ROI.
 We were hired to work with his investment firm, O’Leary Ventures’ newest initiative, Beanstox, a mobile app (see Figure I.1). Beanstox puts the power of investing in the hands of anyone who’s ever wanted to invest in stocks. Through the app, you can invest in big-name stocks, such as Apple and Disney, and do so by purchasing only a small percentage of a share. For example, you can make your first trade for less than $15 total.

**FIGURE I.1: Beanstox App**


-----

###### We were hired to increase Beanstox’s paid subscriptions. They had invested in other marketing avenues previously—such as radio and promotional appearances—and while they had some success, they were only seeing a 5 to 10% conversion rate from free downloads to paid subscriptions.
 This seems to be a common challenge within many businesses; they can bring in prospects with free “lead magnets” or free app downloads, but when it comes to the actual exchange of money, sales aren’t where they want them to be.


-----

###### In comes the power of direct-response Facebook marketing—a Facebook ads campaign focused on the goal of getting paid subscribers. We started by testing several variations of the campaign using assorted videos of Kevin, static images, and different copy options.
 The results? Mr. Wonderful-worthy. Daily downloads increased more than 300%, from around 40 per day to up to 120 per day with the addition of Facebook marketing. Within two weeks of launching, the conversion rate more than doubled (see Figure I.2).

**FIGURE I.2 : Beanstox Conversion Rate**

###### Beyond the front-end Facebook campaign, we identified additional areas where the campaign could be optimized. For example, we saw that Android users were coming in at a higher cost, so we dove deeper into the data to find out why. We identified that Android users are shown a permission request to share various pieces of information with the app (photos, locations, etc.) instead of going straight to the app download. This was preventing potential users from completing their download process. Identifying these types of opportunities for optimization throughout the entire funnel is a key for maximizing results.
 The overall ROI on the Beanstox campaign, including the fee paid to my firm, was over 200%. As in, for every dollar Beanstox put into marketing, they received more than two dollars back.


-----

###### As Mr. Wonderful would say, that’s what “showing the numbers” is all about.
 If you want a ringing endorsement of social media providing an ROI that is measurable and trackable, take it from a guy notorious about the numbers. Kevin said:
 Not only is Kim the first social media marketer I ever heard that even mentions ROI, but that is her main focus. She is the first marketer I have ever recommended to all of my Shark Tank investments and who I use for my personal business. She has my full endorsement.
 I went from working with Kevin’s investment firm to growing his celebrity Instagram and Facebook accounts. Using the same strategies I now teach, we saw immediate—like while we were still meeting—growth.
 Seeing such success from projects where I worked directly with him, Kevin invited me to consult with some of his Shark Tank investments, several of whom became clients themselves.
 When I sold my marketing company, Elite Digital Group, at the end of 2017 and launched a mastermind, one of Kevin’s investments—Snarky Tea —joined and is still a member to this day. (See the Snarky Tea campaign on page 179.)
 At the last event I went to with Mr. Wonderful, he gave me several bottles of his Kevin O’Leary Fine Wines as a gift. I mean it’s a tough job, but someone has to do it … (As a side note, they are under $20 a bottle and delicious. Worth checking out, as you can see below.)

###### I’ve had the chance to work with several celebrities over the years, both at my firm and now in our coaching business Powerful Professionals, including Top Chef superstar Stephen Asprinio when he opened his first restaurant, Nat King Cole’s Generation Hope foundation with his daughters to raise money for students who can’t afford instruments, and several TV and movie superstars presently.
 The good news is, what works for them works for regular folks, too. You’ll find case study after case study—from B2B to B2C, from online business to offline business, from local to national—in the pages of this book. Pick your favorite and launch right away to start getting leads and turning them into cash-paying customers within a few minutes.
 And because social media’s “how to” changes faster than Katy Perry’s hairstyle, we’ve put together a cheat sheet for you to get it all done quickly. Get yours at Nobssocialmediabook.com.
 No matter what, remember … Results rule, period.

##### CHAPTER 1

### In Search of

## Something Better

#### How to Find Profit in an Unprofitable World

###### by Dan Kennedy Regardless of the media, be profit focused.
 Some media readily lends itself to direct-response advertising and marketing. Some doesn’t. Social media, for the most part, doesn’t. It is like trying to use Jell-O as cement.
 Marrying social media (which has its own profound culture, cultural norms, and participant expectations) with direct response (which has clear and, by definition, direct purpose) is like an arranged or forced marriage between strangers distrustful of each other and from different ethnic, religious, or socio-economic backgrounds. To reach back, it is reminiscent of Lonesome George Goebel’s line about feeling like a pair of scuffed brown shoes worn with a formal tuxedo. It is, frankly, a poor match.
 Still, it is also now necessary. If I bowed to my own preferences, I’d advise you to ignore all of it. But even if I did, you won’t, and I’d be a tree falling in a distant, deserted forest.
 If you are going to be drawn into the ever-expanding morass of social media (and it is extremely unlikely you won’t be), then you need to insist it repay all the attention, time, and money you invest in it. I doubt you’ll stay a stubborn opt-out as I am personally. You obviously bought this book because you’re already in and getting deeper.


-----

###### With two exceptions, all my private clients (as of this writing) are in. Most are managing—with some difficulty—to make it pay. That’s the thing. You cannot afford to just let it play. It must
 You can’t afford to buy into nonsensical “new metrics” promulgated by the promoters of social media or by users ignorant of—or by virtue of employment by big, dumb companies—divorced from real economics. If you feel you must have presence, if you must participate, you must make it pay. In real dollars, not imaginary, hopeful metrics. Money.
 We are all in the money business. Not the likes, friends, views, tweets, retweets, and viral videos business. The Money Business.
 Most fail miserably at The Money Business. Only 1% get rich, and only another 4% achieve significant financial independence from owning and operating businesses of their own. The other 95% come up way, way short. One reason for all this failure is naïve, fantastical, delusional thinking and false optimism vs. accurate thinking. Weak-minded, thus overly influenced by peers, staff, a vocal minority of customers, popular fads, and each new, bright, shiny object vs. tough-minded thinking focused on direct profit from every investment. To that end, incidentally, I urge getting and reading my scariest, toughest, bluntest book, No B.S. Guide to Ruthless Management of People and Profits (Second Edition). You don’t want to fail at The Money Business.
 Social media as a direct-response marketing tool has another problem: a growing hazard. Its chief owners at Google, Facebook, and others don’t like it. They dislike harsh, factual measurement of return on investment. They are openly, busily striving to attract more and more big, dumb corporate advertisers with big buckets of Wall Street money and a love of brand and image and bragging rights through numbers divorced from direct sales. They are in hot pursuit of advertisers who do not insist on direct return on investment. They have outright said as much, and I have been reporting on this evolution in my newsletters, notably The No B.S. Marketing Letter (GKIC.com).
 The trouble for you is, these big brand advertisers are kings, queens, princes, and princesses moving into the social media castle. They view you as part of a rat infestation, and the castle landlord is very sympathetic to their wishes.


-----

###### Trying to do marketing that actually works in this environment grows more difficult by the day. In fact, Facebook is regularly throwing advertisers right out the back door of the castle. To get back in, companies are required to redo their sites and behavior in ways that neuter effectiveness. Do not underestimate this problem.
 Still, it now seems necessary to engage in this struggle—as sanely and smartly as possible. It is for that reason that I agreed to act as “chairman” of this book and that I chose Kim Walsh Phillips to be its “CEO.” In a field rife with fools and charlatans, I and my clients have found her to be a rare truth-teller—someone who views this media collection accurately and not through rosetinted glasses under the influence of Ecstasy, and someone who does understand direct response. She is a trustworthy sherpa through a dangerous jungle.

 My Two Instructions My message about all social media and about this book is a simple one: Be careful and be demanding. Brook no bullshit.
 Consider Twitter’s former CFO, Anthony Noto, who infamously erred in sending a private message out into the public arena. As he painfully discovered, once such an error—of mechanics or of impulse—is made, it can be forwarded to the universe—fast—and it can’t be stopped.
 The news is chock-full of executives, celebrities, and athletes being wounded and, in a few cases, ruined by an ill-advised tweet or Facebook post. Or, for that matter, hacked email. Even the private is no longer reliably private. Sony Pictures execs found this out. These same mistakes made even more commonly by small-business owners and entrepreneurs never make the TV news or get reported in The Wall Street Journal, but they foster mayhem just the same. This is also an environment where every complainant and every looney bird has a megaphone. The more you are present and active, the more you expose yourself to their type of social media terrorism: negative reviews, outright attacks, and bothersome complaints to the Facebooks of the world. This must be closely monitored and managed. It’s a price of playing in this sandbox. It carries an actual price tag.
 Be careful, too, not to treat any or all of this as a replacement for any other media or for a sensible multimedia business strategy. The worst


-----

###### number in business is one. Don’t count Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., as three, five, or 50. Social media is One. If you are overly dependent on any One, you are overly vulnerable—at enormous risk.
 My client Chris Cardell in the UK is extremely clever about using Facebook profitably. At the time I wrote this, he was merrily minting money with it. But you couldn’t take direct mail away from him at gunpoint. He also uses pay-per-click and email, online video sales letters, radio, TV, and newspapers. He won’t be caught being lazy about this. And if Facebook boots him from the castle, he’ll survive quite well. More than enough will still be coming for tea ‘n’ crumpets.
 A different client, after months of tussling with Facebook, getting booted and then getting back in, finally walked away. This client has upped advertising in newspapers nationwide and is happy about the results.
 I can’t tell you what your decisions should be. However, this book can certainly help you make the best possible choice. What I can tell you with ironclad certainty is that over-dependence puts you in peril. The only secure strategy is a multimedia marketing strategy and a multichannel sales strategy.
 If you are a success with social media, fine. This book can be a huge help. But if more than 20% of your leads, customers, or revenue comes from social media or more than 20% of your relationship with customers relies on it, you are a fool who is cruisin’ for a bruisin’.
 Next, be demanding. In a poll reported in USA Today, 61% of small- business owners could not document or prove any direct return on their investments in social media activity, yet 50% said they were increasing time and money commitments—and only 7% said they were cutting back on it. Incredible. The CEO of a social media agency insisted those latter business owners were wrong. He claimed they do get returns from social media activity—they just don’t know what they are when they see them. If you like being told you are an idiot, you’d love this guy. I sleep pretty soundly, but I know whether I’ve had sex during the night. Nobody’s going to tell me I am having a lot of sex but just not smart enough to know it.
 After one of retail’s big days, Black Friday, another USA Today article reported a 40% increase in social media campaigns by retailers like Walmart, Sears, and Amazon, yet IBM Smarter Commerce (which tracks sales of the top 500 retail sites) reported a decrease in online sales that day.


-----

###### Then an expert said, “While it may be hard to track how all this drives sales, most retailers agree that having people talking about their brand or store is better than not.”
 Advertising software automation company Nanigans revealed current research in October 2018 detailing retailers’ ever-evolving Black Friday strategies. According to their data, “Marketers revealed that a quarter of their annual ad budgets are used to target shoppers during Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend. With total U.S. digital ad spend by retailers expected to exceed $23 billion in 2018, retailers plan to allocate almost $6 billion in media toward this four-day period.
 In terms of where advertisers are putting their dollars, the Facebook- Google duopoly is the clear winner. Retailers indicated that Google Search and Display (35%) and Facebook (18%) dominate their planned channels, but Amazon is a close third (15%). This underscores the appeal of Amazon’s evolving online ecosystem to retailers and reinforces the company’s growing momentum in digital advertising.
 “Nearly half of U.S. consumers now start their product search on Amazon, meaning the retail giant offers an attractive model for brands hoping to capture the attention of active buyers during the 2018 holiday shopping season,” said Ric Calvillo, CEO and co-founder of Nanigans. “However, retailers’ decision to pump ad spend into Amazon may be shortsighted. The company has built an ecosystem that makes it both an attractive ecommerce ad platform and a retailer’s top competitor.”
 Additional key findings from the study include:

 • More than half (51%) of retailers plan to keep 2018 holiday season ad
 budgets about the same as last year, while 48% plan to increase the amount they spend on holiday ads.
 • Retailers don’t focus much of their holiday ad spend on last-minute
 shoppers, which could be a missed opportunity as it’s a pivotal time to generate brand exposure. Almost half (47%) prioritize early-season campaigns, 48% focus on prime-season buyers, and just 5% target late-season shoppers.
 • Retail marketers plan to dedicate 14% of their campaign budgets to
 video ads during the 2018 holiday shopping season.


-----

###### • 30% of retailers want to see higher ROI from their holiday ad spend,
 and 87% would reallocate some of this budget to other areas if they could. Specifically, 49% of respondents would reinvest their holiday ad spend in martech and adtech technology, if possible.
 • 29% of marketers surveyed agree they can’t change holiday ad spend
 strategy due to organizational leaders holding them back.
 • For a majority of retailers, the holidays positively impact acquiring
 more customers with significant value, but the trade-off is the fact that 25% of marketers report dramatically higher cost of customer acquisition during this time.
 • The holiday advertising season starts early for the majority of
 retailers, with 64% of those surveyed implementing campaigns before Halloween.”[1]

 If that is consensus thinking, the consensus is made up of morons who’ve lost a grip on the business they’re in. You are not in the business of being talked about. You are in the business of selling things. You are not in the buzz business. You are in The Money Business. Refuse to be dissuaded from that simple, straightforward fact.

 The Marketing Success Triangle Has NOT Changed: RIGHT Markets Get RIGHT Message By RIGHT Media.
 Simply broadcasting a message to millions by social media accomplishes little for most businesses. Companies like GoPro (the camera company) and Red Bull are great examples of brand-builders using viral videos and social media to rise from obscurity to fame in the marketplace. But your business is probably not kin to theirs. You have to be very careful —again that advice, be careful—to model and emulate businesses with much in common with your own. Capital and human resources, for example. If you are funding your business’s growth from its profits or money borrowed by mortgaging your home and your grandma’s wheelchair, you are in an entirely different place than a company into which hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital and Wall Street money flow.
 Further, viral explosions are not all they’re cracked up to be, as Greg Levitt, cofounder of 33Across.com, a social media sharing platform, admits. From his firm’s research:


-----

###### • Consumers are most likely to share articles, news, and content related
 to science, but only 9% of person-to-person recipients click on the shared links regarding these topics.
 • Timely news and political items are less widely shared at 2%, but the
 click rates are 86% and 77%, respectively.
 • Business-related: only a 4% share and a 24% click on the shared
 links.
 • Health: 3% share, 15% click.
 • Celebrity and entertainment: 2% share, but 40% click.
 • Consumer reviews of products, businesses: 1% share, 4% click.
 • Personal finance: 1% share, 11% click.

 (The above stats were based on 500 publishers of online content.) Levitt explains the wide disparity between share and click rates as “ego sharing,” that is, senders sharing content they believe boosts their perceived intelligence, informed status, etc., regardless of whether they think recipients will find it interesting or not. The overall average is 3% sharing of content and 24% of recipients clicking on shared links.
 To me, this says there are only two useful plays: First, work with a tightly targeted list of thought-leader, market-leader, and influential recipients to deliver content of high interest and value that enhances their status if shared—to hit or beat the 3% bar, but so that the 24% of those recipients who are shared with are ideal for you; or second, you need a massive volume outreach so the 3% matters.
 The stats about forwarding/sharing of “reviews” about products and businesses suggest that angst over this—and time and money spent on it— may be overdone.
 Ironically, and in the face of what I have pointed out above, you can make a case that it is important to include social media as part of your integrated marketing plan. But approach it strategically, with the same direct-response and sound business principles that you would in any other media channel. Social media is no different than any other media.

 The Stuff of Bank Deposits Has NOT Changed You can’t go to the bank and deposit likes, views, retweets, viral explosions, social media conversations, or brand recognition. Bankers are


-----

###### extremely narrow-minded. They won’t even accept vegetables grown in your backyard garden or bitcoin. They want real money.
 You must insist on exactly the same thing from all media. Contrary to popular belief, no media is different. No media gets a pass because it is different. Don’t be fooled. Be open-minded, creative, and opportunistic. But always keep a watchful eye on the bottom line.
 Opportunism and skepticism are not mutually exclusive. They can and should work in concert, like partners, like Walt Disney, the visionary, and Roy Disney, the money watcher, worked in tandem. Approach social media this way, and you’ll avoid being burnt.

#### From In Desperate Need to In-Demand

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips I have a sign in my office that defines my modus operandi since becoming a Dan Kennedy convert:

 In God we trust, all others bring data.
 —William Edwards Deming

 Like so many, my introduction to Dan was through his No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses. That was the starting point of a series of life-changing events that led to the unlikely combination of a legendary contrarian marketer (who is not a fan of social media) writing a book with a marketing maven who uses social media every second of every day.
 It started like this … I was thinking to myself, “She looks so beautiful.” My daughter was only a couple of weeks old and was perfect. Blue eyes that sparkled. Ten toes. Ten fingers that loved to wrap around my pinky. Her skin smelled like heaven, and she was beautiful. But … she cried. A lot.
 Pretty much anytime she was awake and wasn’t nursing, she cried. She needed me all the time to comfort her and bring her solace. I was needed by this little person.
 She was sleeping peacefully at this moment and content. Swaddled up in her pink blanket in her pack-and-play, she looked so peaceful. She


-----

###### looked so beautiful. And now it was my time to cry. Warm stinging tears ran down my face as I confronted a harsh reality. If I didn’t go back to work in the next week or so, my company would go bankrupt. I only had enough cash to cover one more payroll and that was it.
 My baby needed me. My staff needed me. The thing was, up to this point, my business was built on a lot of hard work: 18-hour days/7 days a week sometimes. That was the only way I kept the business afloat. For ten years, our survival was dependent on me running around all day—networking and volunteering for groups like the Chamber and Rotary Club (also known as “working for free”). I would then spend all night doing client work and weekends getting caught up.
 The work we did back then was the traditional marketing agency kind— awareness-based public relations and marketing. We did a lot of branding work for our clients without much thought on how that would result in sales. The truth was, we didn’t know any better.
 We were successful in creating beautiful designs and logos and in getting our clients’ faces in the paper, but nothing we did was measurable. While we were often told how much our clients loved us, we were the “fluff” of the budget. I spent so much time selling new accounts only to lose them at contract renewal time.
 I would staff up for the work we got and then be left covering a big payroll when clients ended their contracts. I kept this house of cards together with cheap imitation Elmer’s Glue® and it worked—but barely.
 When I took time off to take care of my new baby, it all fell apart. I never wanted to be in that position again. Not just for me now, but for my innocent and perfect daughter.
 I am a woman of faith, and so I did the only thing I thought could help …
 I prayed. I prayed that the struggles I faced for the last ten years would end. I prayed that I would stop killing myself working around the clock just to be poor. (Let me tell you, there are much better ways to be broke than working your fanny off.) I prayed for dramatic change.
 It was then that my dear friend Jon Toy gave me a book. It was Dan Kennedy’s No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses (Entrepreneur Press, 2018). In a few days I had devoured it and started putting it into action. A few changes caused dramatic results. I found


-----

###### that I could stop wishing for things to be different, and I could instead make them different. I could change my pool of prospects, multiply my lead flow, and give myself a raise, week after week.
 In one year, we more than 10X’d our revenue and profit. And it changed everything … I could work for clients that I loved, I could take time off without things falling apart, and I could take care of the team that stood by me through the hard times.
 When I started offering direct-response social media services, I got paid $375 per month. When I sold the agency, our monthly minimum had raised to $3,500. Even the fact that I was able to sell my firm and have a great exit is proof of the power of the strategies in this book.
 I went from one time hocking my engagement ring because it was all I had left to help make payroll to a having a multimillion-dollar firm I was able to sell and focus on what I believe to be my true purpose in life—our business coaching company, Powerful Professionals, which was just named to the “Inc. 5000,” the fastest-growing companies in the United States.
 Being ROI-focused is very profitable. I control my own schedule now, starting early in the morning before my kids wake up and stopping when they get off the bus. I usually have two or three children’s activities to attend during a workday and I have arranged my schedule to be there for them at every milestone, celebration, and the occasional tear to wipe away. I went from having a full-time nanny to an occasional babysitter.
 My big indulgence (besides shoes) is travel, and we do it often. In the last year I’ve gone to Paris, London, Mexico, Belize, Capri, all across the U.S. with multiple stops in Palm Beach, L.A. and NYC and, of course, my first love … Disney. All for fun.
 Because travel brings me joy and when I travel, my business still grows. My favorite thing about making this change is that now I wake up excited every day for what’s in store. I am so thankful for this journey. The gifts I have bring value to those I work with, and I find great pleasure in doing so.
 And so should you. While you will discover the exact blueprint we followed that you can use to grow your own business in the chapters to come, there is one lesson


-----

###### to start with right now …
 … no matter where you are along the journey, you can change the outcome. Starting today.
 Right this minute. You have value that should be shared with the world. You just first need to reach those who need you and convince them to respond to your ad.
 Seal the deal, and say to yourself right now: “If it’s not going to get me results, I am not going to do it.” C’mon, I know it may feel silly, but say it out loud right now as a commitment to yourself and your future growth. You have value and deserve to be paid for it.
 “If it’s not going to get me results, I am not going to do it.” Are you in? If you are, go ahead and post this on your social media profiles right now:
 If it’s not going to get me results, I am not going to do it. #IAmIn In the next chapter, I have a story about what is possible and real with direct-response social media marketing. If you do it right, it attracts new qualified leads and sales even while you are asleep.
 Let’s do this.

##### CHAPTER 2

### Social Media Is Not

## Marketing

#### Media Is Not Marketing

###### by Dan Kennedy In the 2012 Olympics, U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympian of all time (beating gymnast Larisa Latynina’s prior record of 18 medals). Phelps earned his 19th Olympic medal in the men’s 4 × 200-meter freestyle relay. His current medal count of 28 is made up of 23 gold, two silver, and two bronze.
 Although he had a great Olympics, it could have easily not gone his way.
 In fact, prior to the Olympics Phelps fell short of many people’s expectations, including his own. His problems began after the 2008 Olympics when he got lazy. He stopped doing the things that brought him success in the first place, like going to the pool to train every day. Until 2011, when he was bested by his teammate Ryan Lochte in the 200-meter individual medley at the world championships.
 That’s when Phelps got back to the basics, doing the things he needed to do to win again.
 The funny thing with swimmers is that no matter how long they’ve been swimming, they do the same thing day in, day out to prepare for their races.
 Take U.S. swimmer Dara Torres, who at the age of 41, became the oldest Olympic swimming medalist in history when she won two Olympic


-----

###### silver medals in 2008. Despite having swam her whole life, she never forgot the basics. She did the same workouts as every other sprint swimmer on her team, such as kicking and drills. She kept the foundational pieces in place as circumstances around her changed.
 Despite his success in the 2012 Olympics, Phelps announced his retirement directly after their conclusion. But like a true champion, he didn’t stay poolside for long.
 At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the games for the fourth Olympics in a row.
 He announced his second retirement on August 12, 2016, having won more medals than anyone else in the Olympics at final count of 28. According to a Fox News story by Chris Chase, if Michael Phelps was a country, he’d be ranked 32nd on the alltime medal count. That’s all-time, as in everything a country has won in 120 years and 28 Summer Olympics.
 While you may never be an Olympic Record holder, you can follow the success principle of staying true to the same behaviors that got you in there in the first place.

 Contrary to Popular Belief… The internet is not as special as most people think, and media is not marketing. The same disciplined business and marketing practices must be kept in place to drive real results. Very few will do this, so very few will ever see results through social media marketing, or any marketing for that matter.
 Social media has a lot of the same dangers that email marketing does. It is free and can be distributed quickly with a very low barrier to entry. Not much thought or strategy needs to be put into place in order to launch messaging or paid ads.

 WHY SO MANY BUSINESSES ARE FAILING Just because it is social media doesn’t mean it shouldn’t use all the same principles as direct-response marketing.
 It’s been 40 years or more since I replaced old-fashioned prospecting grunt work for a 100% measurable way to attract a predictable, reliable stream of ideal clients.


-----

###### Success at getting qualified clients, customers, or patients has a lot more to do with understanding the real secrets of direct-response marketing and a lot less to do with chasing prospects through tweets and status updates.
 I’ve been entirely DR (direct response) since 1975 and pioneered a few things of my own. Although the fundamentals and the principles of this do not change, it is still really about applying tested and proven mail order methodology to nonmail order businesses.
 The overwhelming majority of commerce of all kinds is driven by direct response.
 Everyone from the credit card industry to the apparel industry, from the information business to the local service business is using direct response. The fundamental principle of my approach to marketing is this: Let’s make sure we’re talking to highly interested, highly motivated, very appropriate prospects for what it is that we have to offer people, who will have a high level of interest the minute we show up.
 Do a decent job of selling to them, instead of trying to reduce everything to 140-character tweets, videos no longer that 3.8 minutes, and no sales letters with words more than two syllables so that everybody can pay attention.

 WHY YOU ARE THE SAME Everybody believes their business is different. That this doesn’t apply to them. That no one else is doing this in their industry. Just because they aren’t using the written word to sell, it must be acceptable because they are making sales. Maybe it’s “acceptable.” But using better sales copy gives you a competitive edge. Especially when you possess this number-one skill and others don’t.
 Darin Garman was making sales in real estate, but he wasn’t happy with the process and was becoming increasingly frustrated doing a lot of work only to lose the sale to a competitor.
 No one was using sales letters to sell apartment buildings until Darin decided to do it. Not only did he succeed at selling apartment buildings with sales letters, but he also got the people he predetermined were good candidates to respond. Plus, when he did some research, he found he had moved into a position where his office, Heartland Investment Partners,


-----

###### handled 70% of all apartment building transactions. That was not the case before he started using sales letters.
 It does not matter whether your client is the CEO or the broom pusher or which media channels you use, everybody buys the same way. They all go through the same process. They all go through the same emotional journey.

 The Basics of Effective Marketing There are just a few plain and simple direct-marketing rules to follow, and by committing to them, you’ll reap the long-term benefits you desire and develop a long-lasting business foundation.
 These basics are skipped by most businesses using Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn as their primary sources of communication. Realize you have choices, and you can make your marketing dollars work harder for you by offering people more than one reason and more than one means of responding to you.
 However many channels you market in, there are basic rules you need to understand in order to succeed. These foundational concepts must be fully comprehended, practiced, managed, and enforced.

 1. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN OFFER There is a popular saying out there that “content is king.” I would disagree. The sale is king. Without it, you have no market share and no kingdom to rule over. Your social media marketing needs to have an offer, telling your ideal prospects exactly what to do and why they want to do it right now. It should be irresistible and time sensitive, and give them some type of transformative value if they take action.
 Ideally, it’s a Godfather’s Offer—one that the appropriate prospect or customer can’t refuse.

 2. THERE WILL BE A REASON TO RESPOND RIGHT NOW The hidden cost and failure in all advertising and marketing is in the almost-persuaded. They were tempted to respond. They nearly responded. They got right up to the edge of response, but then set it aside to do later or to mull over or to check out more the next time they were at their computers. When they get to that edge, we must reach across and pull them


-----

###### past it. There must be a good reason for them not to stop short or delay or ponder. There must be urgency.

 3. THERE WILL BE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS Most people do a reasonably good job of following directions. For the most part, they stop on red and go on green, stand in the lines they’re told to stand in, fill out the forms they’re given to fill out, and applaud when the Applause sign comes on. Most people are well conditioned from infancy, in every environment, to do as they are told.
 Most marketers’ failures and disappointments result from giving confusing directions—or no directions at all. Confused or uncertain consumers do nothing. And people rarely buy anything of consequence without being asked. Sharing content alone will not bring measurable results from your social media. You must walk your prospect through the steps you want them to take in order to make the sale.

 4. THERE WILL BE TRACKING AND MEASUREMENT If you want real profits from your marketing, you are no longer going to permit any advertising, marketing, or selling investments to be made without direct and accurate tracking, measurement, and accountability. You will be given all sorts of arguments against such a harsh position by media salespeople, by online media champions talking a “new” language of “new metrics,” by staff and peers. You will hear terms like “engagement” and “reach” and “virality,” with no data to back up the results. You will smile and politely say, “Rubbish.” Each dollar sent out to forage must come back with more and/or must meet predetermined objectives. There will be no freeloaders; there will be no slackers.

 5. THERE WILL BE FOLLOW-UP Often, I find business owners with more holes in their bucket than they’ve got bucket! People read your ad, get your letter, see your sign, find you online, call or visit your place of business, ask your receptionist or staff questions, and that’s it. There’s no capture of the prospect’s name, physical address, email address, and no offer to immediately send an information package, free report, coupons. This is criminal waste.


-----

###### I’ve been poor, so I abhor and detest and condemn waste. Just how much waste are you permitting to slop around in your business? Probably a lot. When you invest in advertising and marketing, you don’t just pay for the customers you get. You pay a price for every call, every walk-in. Every one. Doing nothing with one is like flushing money down the toilet.
 To be simplistic, if you invest $1,000 in an ad campaign and get 50 phone calls, you bought each call for $20. If you’re going to waste one, take a nice, crisp $20 bill, go into the bathroom, tear the bill into pieces, let the pieces flutter into the toilet, and flush. Stand there and watch it go away. If you’re going to do nothing with 30 of those 50 calls, stand there and do it 30 times. Feel it.
 You probably won’t like how it feels. Good. Remember that feeling every time you fail—and it is failure—to thoroughly follow up on a lead or customer.

 6. RESULTS RULE Results Rule. Period. Consider the simple agreement: You want your car hand-washed and waxed outside, vacuumed inside, for which you will pay your neighbor’s teen $20. If he does not wash or wax or vacuum the car but wants the $20 anyway, what possible “story” could he offer in place of the result of a clean car that would satisfy you? I would hope none. You didn’t offer to pay for a story. You offered to pay for a clean car. The same is true with advertising and marketing investments in social media. Do not let anyone confuse, bamboozle, or convince you otherwise. Further, no opinions count—not even yours. Only results matter.

#### Breakthrough Moments

 When I first read Dan’s No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing for Non- Direct Marketing Businesses (Entrepreneur Press, 2018), I was hooked. I felt like I did as a kid when I was finally able to ride a bike beyond my driveway by myself. The possibilities were endless.

 I recognized that what I was doing before wasn’t working and it was time to make a change. If I ever wanted to sell my company, it had to first stop losing money and I had to stop losing the joy of running it.

 What I Needed to Change First

 1. Positioning. This is your place in the marketplace.
 I had to change my position as a consulting firm that was in demand instead of “in desperate need.” I needed to stop competing in a crowded marketplace of local “full service” marketing agencies that could do everything for everyone. I had to stop being a commodity. Commodities compete on price, and the cheapest one wins. That is what working really hard for free looked like, and I couldn’t survive that way any longer.
 I had to become the expert in my industry so that when prospects came my way, I was the only firm they were going to talk to. It needed to become more of a privilege for them to meet with me vs. the other way around. It wasn’t all smoke and mirrors though. I am the industry expert when it comes to direct-response social media marketing with a high ROI. There is no other person with the same expertise as me. (Guess what, the same is true for you.) 2. Pricing. Being the cheapest wasn’t paying the bills, and that needed
 to change. I slowly started to increase new-client pricing. Admittedly it wasn’t until two years later that I finally raised prices with some of my long-term accounts. A lot left, but some stayed even though their monthly services fee was triple what it was when they started. Because even with the price increase, they were still making money hand over fist. This gave us fewer clients but more profit. Everyone was happy. Our minimum monthly fee to work with private clients went from $350 a month to $3,500 a month when I sold the agency. Ten times what it was when I started this process. Being fluff-free is very profitable. 3. Target market. My clients had been confined to the area in which I
 lived at this point. And that wasn’t working. Local brick-and-mortar


-----

###### businesses in my community couldn’t afford to pay what we needed to earn in order to survive, or for the level of service we really needed to get tangible results. My target market had to grow beyond the five-mile radius of my office to a national and international stage in order to reach those who understood direct-response marketing and were hungry to expand to the digital marketplace. Thankfully, we knew the media channel that could reach a larger audience. (Hint, you are reading a book all about it.) 4. Media. First, I needed to actually use media. Up to this point, my
 marketing centered around my hand reaching out to someone else’s as I shook it. I owned a marketing company, yet grew my business by prospecting personally. In fact, it was all person-to-person, and I needed to scale quickly. I had to grow my list to include those I was targeting and to go beyond those I knew. I started in a channel I was most familiar with, LinkedIn, and then moved on to Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ (remember when that was a thing?). My results were astonishing. But more on that later.

 Of course, I had no money, so I couldn’t start by buying media. I also had limited time balancing the baby and my business. So, I started simple.
 I began by writing a weekly email that I also posted on my blog. I then distributed links to the blog through my social media channels. I focused my messaging on “marketing equaling results” and shared that anything else was pointless. I tried to be a little controversial to stand out in a crowded marketplace. Dan’s advice of “trying to be everything to everyone results in being nothing to anybody” stuck in my head. I had to focus on working with those who wanted results beyond just awareness. I had to focus on those who wanted measurement of results, accountability for their marketing, and a high ROI. Those who just wanted “branding” were no longer my target market. I was making a commitment to show clients not just our work, but their results… and I was all in.

 THE RESULTS The amazing thing was that my social media and blog strategy started to work. My strategies were producing results. I began to get prospect inquiries from businesses I had not met at a networking event. They were


-----

###### coming to me because I was the social media expert on getting a high Return on Investment. I used these same strategies in my clients’ businesses, and they worked there as well. At contract renewal time, our contracts weren’t being cut. In fact, clients were increasing their budgets.
 I landed some large accounts and cash flow improved, then I started to be able to choose my clients, instead of taking anyone with a pulse and a checkbook. I admit, saying “No, thank you” to someone who proves to be difficult during the sales process became one of my greatest joys. I love having the ability to prevent future pain for my team (and myself, for that matter) from someone who would obviously be a tyrant. (In case you were wondering, tyrants do not make great clients.)
 During this time, I also got more involved in the organization Dan Kennedy started, the GKIC Insider’s Circle. Unfortunately, I learned that Dan doesn’t have an affinity for women with hyphenated last names and also despised social media. Both were because he had never received much ROI from either.
 But I persisted. I would test all the direct-response strategies I learned in the channel I knew best—social media. I would try out these strategies first with my own business and then use what worked best to benefit our clients. Through this process, I grew my email list from 1,200 names (all of which I had received by going to a networking event, getting a card, and then entering it manually into my database) to more than 21,000 in just over one year using Facebook as our primary lead source.
 I also grew our revenue over 327%. We went from a company struggling to make payroll to a seven-figure business. I woke up every day with gratitude and kept up the strategies I was learning—and they kept paying off.

 My Lucky Broken iPad About a year into this large company shift, I was driving home one night after picking up my iPad from a repair shop. My then 1-year-old daughter had shattered its glass doing what 1-year-olds do. That happened to be one lucky iPad because as I drove home that night, I listened to the previous month’s audio program I received for being a Diamond member of GKIC.


-----

###### Listening, I discovered I could apply for a contest. The prize was a Mastermind Weekend with Dan at Disney World.
 The day I learned of this potentially life-changing opportunity also happened to be the last day of the contest. Never being one to shy away from a challenge of time, I raced home, helped my husband put the girls to bed, and with him cheering me (thankfully I am blessed to have a supportive husband, who also happens to be very cute, I might add), I set to work.
 I opened an e-fax account (did I mention Dan doesn’t use email?), wrote my application, sent it in, and waited.
 Waiting is my least favorite! But winning is my most favorite. The day I received a fax from him about being chosen as a finalist, I did an extended happy dance. Being a finalist meant that I was able to compete in a live phone-in program where I would share with others what I discovered through my time with GKIC and Dan that had changed my business and life. I would speak about the strategies I learned and the practices I put in place because of them. Independent judges would choose the winner, and Dan would announce the results live on the call.
 I was born for this challenge! I went into the contest believing that even if I didn’t win, this was my chance to share my gratitude with Dan for all I had learned through him that had changed my life.
 I spent a lot of time preparing for the competition. Thankfully over the course of the year of change, I became friends with some brilliant and kind entrepreneurs. I consulted dear friends who had competed as finalists in the past. They offered some poignant insights.
 I prepared by writing a script, buying the domain www.ILiveOnPlanetDan.com to post all my examples, and spent some time praying before the call.
 I was sooooooooo nervous. I sat alone in the most quiet space of my office building—our nursery. I provided child care for our staff members’ children along with my girls, but on this day, none of them were in. So, there I sat among jumpers and dolls and pastels bearing these young folks’ names, waiting.

 FINALLY IT WAS MY TURN


-----

###### My hands shook. My voice trembled. My heart beat so fast I thought Dan could hear it. But I kept reading my script. And reading. And reading. Dan, who had a reputation for being a curmudgeon, was supportive throughout and encouraged me to keep going.
 I finished my presentation and took a deep breath. Breathing was something I didn’t do much of back then.
 I had to wait to listen to the other callers. That was torture. Don’t get me wrong, they all had great stories, but waiting is my least favorite. It seemed like forever until they were done.
 Then it was time for a decision. The judges had chosen their favorite, and Dan was going to announce it after a few housekeeping items.

 AND THE WINNER WAS … Not me. Dang!
 Dan was kind to share that I was the other person he was debating on, but the judges felt strongly about awarding the contestant who was a manufacturer who successfully put direct-response marketing practices in place.
 But wait, all was not lost! In an act of delight and surprise, Dan announced that for the first time ever he was going to allow all the finalists to come to the Mastermind. We would have to pay our way to come, but if we did that, once we were there, we could participate in all activities for the weekend. We just needed to fax him and let him know if we were in.
 I couldn’t send in my acceptance fast enough. Two months later, I had my chance to present at the Winner’s Weekend Mastermind at Disney and get to know Dan better. We each had a hot seat, and I brought my A-Game. Afterwards at dinner, Dan approached the table and said, “I have a client I’d like you to work on. Send me a fax after this.”
 When he walked away, a friend I still have to this day, Steve Sipress, said, “You’ve just been called up from the Minor League to the Majors.”
 And major, it was. I landed the organization he started as a client and ran all their lead generation for over three years, generating millions of dollars for them and significant notoriety for my firm. I got to work with celebrities in our niche like Rich Schefren, Ron LeGrand, Jim Lange, Chris Cardell, Nick Nanton,


-----

###### Pamela Yellen, and Robin Robins. It’s through knowing Dan that I got to work with Josh Turner who eventually made an offer and purchased my company.
 And now, of course, our partnership has produced the book you are reading and the updated version. Two years into working together, Dan Kennedy wrote a book with a woman with a hyphenated last name about social media: Me.
 A 20-year “overnight” success story of preparation meeting opportunity and going the extra mile, because my friend, it is a lot less crowded there.

 WORK SMARTER. NOT HARDER. Amen.

### From the Bottom Up,

## Direct Response

#### Six Direct-Response Marketing Principles that Have to be Applied to Social Media Marketing or
 You Might As Well Set Your Money on Fire (As
 Most Companies Do)

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Some marketing facts according to the Chief Marketing Officer Council:

 • 28% of marketers have reduced their advertising budget to fund more
 digital marketing (February 2015).
 • Worldwide social network ad spending reached $16.10 billion in
 2014, a 45.3% increase from 2013 that pushed social’s share of overall digital ad investment to 11.5%. Combined social network ad dollars from North America, Western Europe, and Asia-Pacific represented 93.7% of global expenditure (January 2015).
 • Marketers spent $4.4 billion on mobile advertising in the U.S. in
 2012. That figure doubled to $8.5 billion in 2013, and is projected to quadruple to $31.1 billion by 2017. Search advertising represents about half of the total (November 2014).
 • U.S. marketers spend an average of 2.5% of their total company
 revenue on digital marketing activities, according to a new report by


-----

###### Gartner Inc.
 • Social media advertising spend in the U.S. is expected to reach $18.4
 billion in 2019.
 • Marketers are increasing social ad budgets (up 32% in 2018 alone)
 and producing more ads than ever before. One of every four Facebook pages now uses paid media, and Facebook already accounts for 23% of total U.S. digital ad spending.
 • Emarketer estimated that the ad spending on social video in the U.S.
 increased by 38.1% during 2018, reaching $7.85 billion.
 • Facebook controlled 84.9% of this social video ad growth.
 • Social media is the most relevant advertising channel for 50% of Gen
 Z and 42% of Millennials.
 • 57% of Millennials feel that ads are becoming more relevant.
 • 45% of Gen Z and 41% of Gen X-ers feel the same, while only 27%
 of Baby Boomers feel this way.
 • Noncustomers are three times more likely than customers to visit
 retailers from social media ads.
 • 50% of consumers said that seeing user-generated content would
 increase their chances of buying products through a brand’s social media.
 • 49% said that easy payment systems (like Amazon Pay) would
 increase their chances of buying through social media.
 • Social Media Examiner conducted its annual survey of 3,000
 companies on their use and results from social media marketing, and the outcomes are horrifying, yet not surprising. While 86% of marketers indicate that social media is important for their business, 89% said “increased exposure” was their number-one benefit, and only 37% of marketers think their Facebook efforts are effective. Over 75% of them don’t know how to measure their results.[1]

 How This Way of Thinking Is Dead Wrong But here’s the thing: Anyone who either doesn’t know if their marketing is working and/or thinks the focus should be awareness building and not revenue generation could make some small but significant tweaks to their efforts and drive huge results.


-----

###### I have gone back to Dan’s collection of teachings time and time again while testing direct-response principles on social media. Many direct- response marketers think social media is complete fluff—and for a lot companies, it is. That’s because most marketers do not apply any direct- marketing tactics to their strategic approach (if they are even strategic at all).
 When I ran the agency, we spent thousands of dollars each day and millions each year in social media advertisements and used direct-response marketing principles to achieve financially rewarding results for our clients, and frankly, for us too, which did make us giddy—we were all known to do a daily happy dance or two. Today, we are still testing with thousands of dollars a day, and the same strategies apply.
 Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of marketing tactics in the pages that follow, let’s cover a few of Dan’s key business principles as applied to social media.

 1. HAVE A PLAN TO SELL FROM THE VERY BEGINNING In social media, you never want to come across as the used-car salesman pouncing on his next kill, but you do need to ensure you give your prospects a consistent opportunity to connect and do business with you. If you don’t, you will not realize a return of your marketing dollars and staff resources spent online. (General Motors is king of this. They did nothing to give an effective call to action and then declared social media advertising to be a waste of time and money. It is back on now, by the way.)

 2. TYPES OF OFFERS Lead generation. An incentive for your recipient to provide contact information. This is done through offering something of inherent value that is so good your recipient would pay for it, except they won’t have to because you will be giving it away for free. This can include any incentive such as a report, white paper, gift certificate, or ticket to a live event.
 Sale. It is possible to sell directly to cold traffic on social media. We do it every day using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram, but there are a few key things to remember. There should be something special about your offer, such as it is being sold online first, or offered at a special price, or at least it is positioned as though it is something special.


-----

###### If in contrast you post the same sale at the same price on social media as you do everywhere else, then you are most likely not going to realize great results. Social media is a cocktail party, not a shopping mall, and the only way to get people to pay attention to something being shared is to make sure it is really interesting. Do that, and everyone pays attention and wants in first.
 For example, when we came out with a new course on how to add 1,000 email addresses to your list using free social media, we didn’t pitch the course. Instead, the pitch was for a free workshop on how to grow your list. We positioned it that way because a workshop has value, different than a webinar.
 To see what message resonated most, we looked at the “share count,” aka the number of times someone shared the ad with their network. This demonstrates how interesting/fascinating they found the offer.
 This one ad alone has been shared 10 times (see Figure 3.1 on page 36). Imagine if each person sharing it only has 100 friends. That’s still 1,000 receiving a personal recommendation from a friend to take my free workshop.
 Plus, the social proof of the comments and “likes” has Facebook giving us better pricing on all our ads.
 Make your offers worthy of sharing.

 3. DON’T MAKE DELAYING A DESIRABLE OPTION While automation is possible in social media, setting up your offers and just letting them run forever is not effective in the least. Your offers should be fresh, new, and ever-changing with clear deadlines. Offer weekly perks to purchase, opt-in, comment, or share. Always give a deadline and incentive for taking action now.
 Satori Method ran a free energy workshop using a free media, Facebook Live, that was only on for six days yet drove thousands to their list, using no paid ads The founders Tristan and Sabrina Truscott are two of my Inner Circle Mastermind Members and you’ll discover more about how they used social media later in this book (see Figure 3.2 on page 37).

**FIGURE 3.1: Social Share Ad**

**FIGURE 3.2 : Energy Expansion**

###### 4. GIVE VERY CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO
 RIGHT NOW Want your audience to click over to your website? Tell them to do it, clearly.
 In posts, put your link on its own line. Go here now, visit this page and enroll, pick up your phone, dial the number and talk to a Customer


-----

###### Concierge now (see Figure 3.3 on page 38 for an example). The less work they have to do to figure out the next step, the more likely they are to take action.

**FIGURE 3.3: Call Out on Click**


-----

###### 5. THERE WILL BE TRACKING AND MEASUREMENT How will you ever know the ROI on your social media marketing unless you track it? We have a lot of fun at my company, but we are a serious bunch when it comes to tracking.


-----

###### Use tracking options available in each social media network profile and advertising platform. They all have conversion tracking, analytics, and insights. Use them. On your end, you should also track unique forms, landing pages, and URLs. All this is hard or easy depending on your back- end program. Not all adapt well to intense measurement. But something is better than the nothing most do, because that is the kind of results they get … nothing.

 6. BRANDING SHOULD BE A BYPRODUCT OF EFFECTIVE DIRECT-RESPONSE
 MARKETING, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND In social media, all your posts, promotions, photos, and posturing should have a goal of sales, not branding. This may seem in conflict with the strategic approach to present valuable content 85% of the time and only sell 15% of the time, but the opposite is true. All your content should be developed with a goal of selling 15% of the time, meaning your posts should be cultivating interest and need in whatever pain your product will relieve when you make your pitch. In addition, this means money should only be spent on driving leads and sales, not on post engagement or building “likes.” Your page will not end up with 1 million engaged posting fans. Your goal should be ROI instead of popularity.

 RESULTS RULE. PERIOD. There is an endless supply of conjecture by social media “experts.” Be very cautious whenever you hear a universal truth about any type of social media marketing. When we ran the agency, we placed thousands of advertising dollars each day for clients across industries, geography, and products, and what we have found is that nothing can be deemed a universal truth, not even within the same industry. The only thing you should use to determine your spend and marketing direction are the results of your ads and posts. This is why everything needs to be tracked and checked every day. Yup, every day. Our client reporting was different than “clicks” and “engagement” metrics. We told our clients exactly what they spent for ads, for our fee, and how many qualified leads or customers resulted, so they always got an exact ROI on their spend. We then used this data to make their ad campaign more effective. Any other information is fluff and should be ignored.


-----

###### Now, running Powerful Professionals, I require the same kind of reporting from my internal team who does this for me. We meet twice a week and review ad spend, leads generated, sales, and profit. Staying on top of these metrics is what has allowed us to grow so quickly.
 Are there more direct-response marketing truths that should be applied? Absolutely, and that is why you’ll need the rest of this book. Keep reading to discover exactly how to launch your first (or next) results-driven social media sales campaign.

#### The Importance of Creating Your Unique Selling
 Proposition

###### by Dan Kennedy I was reading an extensive survey about measuring the impact of advertising slogans. Among the slogans and advertising tag lines for 22 of the biggest U.S. advertisers, only six were recognized by more than 10% of the consumers surveyed.
 In other words, not even 1 out of 10 consumers could correctly identify 90% of the slogans. In fact, 16 of the 22 advertisers had slogans no one knew, although each spent more than $100 million a year advertising theirs!
 Three of these much-advertised slogans scored 0% recognition. 0%! Take the test, to see if you can name any of the big, dumb companies that match these slogans:

 1. We’re with You 2. That Was Easy 3. The Stuff of Life

 Only Walmart’s “Always Low Prices” was recognized by 64% of the consumers tested. (And by the way, if you can’t have the lowest prices, you might as well be the highest. Not much cache in “Almost Always Almost Lowest Prices Most Days.”)
 Those faring poorly, like #1 above, argued that it had only been advertising its slogan for YEARS!!!! Quote, “It takes time to build brand identity.” The spokesman for #3 justified its disaster as “only a transitional


-----

###### slogan,” stating the company was moving toward yet another new brand- focused identity, whatever the beejeezus that is. Translation: New slogan being thunk up.
 The real laughter is that the copy of this article was from USA Today’s website, and at its end, two companies paid to advertise their services, doing, yep, “corporate branding.”

 Is a Slogan a Brand? Isn’t a Slogan Just Like a USP? No, a slogan is not a brand, and these results are not exactly an indictment of all brand-building approaches.
 For example, the kind of “personal branding” I teach encompasses more than a slogan and is usually more targeted to a market.
 However, it’s easy to have that go awry and wind up with branding that looks good but does nothing. There’s a tightrope to walk there, and it’s easy to fall off. Most ad agency types do.
 A slogan is definitely not a USP, although it can represent, telegraph, or at least be congruent with a USP in your small-business marketing.
 Actually, Walmart’s is the only slogan in all the ones tested via this survey that enunciates a USP. It is, not coincidentally, the only effective slogan. The others not only fail the Dan Kennedy USP Question #1 (Why should I, your prospect, choose to do business with you vs. any and every other option?), but they are also so generic they could be used by anybody.
 For example, “That Was Easy” could certainly work for Boston Market —how easy it is to put a “home cooked” dinner on the family table—or for Ditech—how easy it is to get a home loan.
 Warning: If anybody and everybody can use your USP, it ain’t one. If any and every Tom, Dick, and Mary can use your slogan, why on earth would you want it?
 In each of these cases, the minute the ad agency charlatans revealed these slogans in the corporate clients’ boardrooms, the CEOs should have stood up, pulled out a gun, shot one of them somewhere it would really hurt and bleed a lot but not kill him, and yelled, “Next.”
 This is the kind of chronic stupidity I encountered when working with big, dumb companies like Weight Watchers and Mass Mutual. (Incidentally, Weight Watchers could use any of the above three loser slogans. Mass could use two of them. And probably would.)


-----

###### Every company behind these losers had a spokesperson ready with an excuse. Nobody said, truthfully, “We’re idiots.”
 I have the reputation of being anti-brand. Actually, I’m not “anti-brand” at all and, as you can observe, have diligently turned myself into a personality brand. (Go ahead, Google “Dan Kennedy” and see what turns up. Be sure you’ve packed a lunch. You’ll be there a while.) I also have “NO B.S.” as a brand extending over books, newsletters, products, and “RENEGADE MILLIONAIRE” to a lesser extent.
 I do counsel against investing directly into brand-building, especially with large-company-style “image” advertising that cannot be accurately and ruthlessly held accountable.
 A few principles and tips about your brand identity:

 1. By all means, work at creating name-brand identity and recognition
 for yourself and your small business, but do it where it counts, with a carefully selected target, niche, or subculture market small enough that you can have impact with whatever resources you have, defined narrowly enough you can create compelling messages for it. A giant market is only useful to someone with a giant wallet. You do not want to waste your life peeing into the ocean. (For example, I have aimed myself at “entrepreneurs” pretty successfully, but “corporate America” has been sacrificed. Stephen Covey may have 10,000 copies of one of his books bought by American Airlines or Citibank. I most assuredly will not.) Whatever your business, nationally or locally, there is a prime market and a prime audience. Build brand identity with them. 2. A brand or brand identity is, essentially, a recognized symbol that
 represents and calls to mind what you and your business is about. I maintain it should also be designed to resonate with a very specific who your business is for. Many marketers are reasonably clear about their what but woefully unclear about their who, thus their what is often wrong. 3. By all means, work at creating name-brand identity and recognition
 for yourself and your business, but do it as a byproduct and bonus of solid, accountable, profitable direct-response advertising and


-----

###### marketing. Avoid buying it outright, such as with image advertising. Refer to the “Direct Marketing DIET” on pages 20 and 21 of my No B.S. Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses book. 4. Do not confuse “brand identity” with logos and slogans. Logos,
 slogans, color schemes, and other imagery are simply devices used to convey or support brand identity, just as typefaces are a means of conveying words. Brand identity is about ideas first and representations of ideas second. 5. If you do develop brand identity, develop a “customer culture” with
 it, so your brand is theirs. Think Starbucks or Disney. The customers are part of something, not just people being sold to. But, whatever you do, don’t blindly copy big companies’ advertising practices. Very, very, very carefully learn from the very few smart ones, like Disney. But remember they are playing in a different league with different rules and different means of keeping score. As an example, you may keep score by profit while they must keep score by stock price (which rarely, formulaically reflects profit). And they have more resources than you do. 6. For most small businesses, personal branding is far superior to
 corporate/business branding. People prefer dealing with people, rather than with nameless, faceless, soulless institutions. Put yourself out there! 7. Most basic, starting-point summary: Begin with WHO is your
 business for? + WHAT do you want to be known for, by WHO? then HOW can you represent, symbolize, and summarize that in a memorable way.

 (For more on direct-response branding, pick up my No B.S. Guide to Brand-Building by Direct Response: The Ultimate No Holds Barred Plan to Creating and Profiting from a Powerful Brand Without Buying It
 [Entrepreneur Press, 2014]). I wrote it with two very successful business owners who were building a multimillion-dollar fitness empire, Forrest Walden and Jim Cavale. They use social media for lead generation, but that is only one of many things they do.)
 “Don’t be in too much of a hurry to promote until you get good. Otherwise, you just speed up the rate at which the world finds out you’re no

###### good,” said public speaker Cavett Robert.
 In reality, the principles behind the USP have been talked about to death. You can call it the Purple Cow, your market position, your winning difference, or just the answer to Why Should Anyone Read Your Blog, connect with you on LinkedIn, “Like” you on Facebook, follow you on Twitter, or click on your ad.
 The reason the USP has been talked to death is that this core idea is essential to effective marketing. Even though defining your USP is one of the best places to start when you’re building a solid marketing plan, it also seems to be one of the easiest places for people to get lost.
 USP can be defined this way: When you set out to attract a new, prospective customer to your business for the first time, there is one paramount question you must answer:
 “Why should I choose your business/product/service vs. any/every other competitive option available to me?”
 It simply means “justify your reason to exist.” You must know the facts, features, benefits, and promises that your business makes—inside-out, upside-down, backwards, forwards, and sideways. Because if you can’t clearly articulate what makes your business unique, how can you expect anyone else to care?
 You will need to crow about your business if you expect it to expand, but it’s pivotal that you trumpet the right things.
 The right USP coupled with the right offer, especially at the right time and place, is important for any business. For a business fighting for attention with millions of other blogs all over the world, it’s essential.
 It is imperative you can answer the following questions:

 • What is unique about my product?
 • What is unique about my delivery?
 • What is unique about my service?
 • What industry norms does my company bend or break?
 • What is unique about my personality?
 • What is my story?
 • Who or what are my “enemies”?
 • What is unique about my best customers?


-----

###### Your very first priority as you embark on social media marketing is to get laser focused on what sets you apart. What makes you unique in your industry?
 If you cannot come up with very clear answers to these questions, you’re going to need to make some changes to your business. Period. This is crucial. This is foundational.
 Take a long, hard look at your answers and then ask yourself, “How can I incorporate this uniqueness into my marketing? How can I exploit it? How can I use it in every marketing piece I produce?” Then do it. Take action. Implement. Today.

##### CHAPTER 4

### It’s Not All About You.

## Or Is It?

#### The Most Powerful Marketing Tactic (per Google)

###### by Dan Kennedy An age-old copywriting secret is to “enter the conversation already happening in your prospect’s mind.” One of the easiest ways to do this is to look at what everyone is talking about.
 According to USA Today, Google reported the top three trending searches for 2014 were for Robin Williams following his passing, Kim Kardashian’s wedding to Kanye West, and Jared Leto.
 Yahoo! reported the top obsessions for 2013 included Miley Cyrus “twerking,” Duck Dynasty, the casting of Fifty Shades of Grey, and The Walking Dead.
 According to Business Insider, Google reported the top three trending searches for 2018 were for the World Cup, Avicii following his passing, and Mac Miller, also following his passing.[1]
 BestLife reports the top three biggest pop culture obsessions of 2018 featured the Black Panther movie, the Royal Wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and Beyoncé, as the first female headliner at the famous Coachella music festival.[2]
 The popularity of these searches indicates what is on your prospect’s mind. Obviously, they are celebrity-related. People love celebrities. They’re obsessed with them. A single celebrity death will often trump media


-----

###### coverage over anything else, even if the reality of other news is far more staggering.
 People are fascinated by celebrities, and that trend isn’t going to change. It’s only growing. And, inexplicably, people confuse celebrity with credibility.
 This is good news for smart marketers. Every year billions of dollars are spent on celebrity endorsements. People will buy whatever celebrities eat, drink, wear, and drive. They want to know what celebrities do, and where they shop, live, and do business. Tap into celebrity and you have access to the most powerful marketing force available.
 It’s easier than you think. If you do business on a local level, it’s relatively easy and inexpensive to become a local celebrity. If you do business nationally but in a niche market, it’s also relatively inexpensive.
 Make yourself famous by writing articles and books, giving lectures, and being active in industry and community affairs. Feature yourself in your advertising, videos, webinars, and social media networks. Get interviewed on radio and TV, and post the files on your website.
 It’s worth noting that, these days, the lines between PR, public relations, and paid, commercial advertising as a means of creating celebrity status are blurred.
 When entertainment TV reporter Leeza Gibbons interviewed and profiled motivational speaker Tony Robbins in an infomercial, was that as good as being on the TV show Entertainment Tonight? Yes. In some respects it was even better—because this suggests strategy.
 If you could get three-time NFL Super Bowl Champion Emmitt Smith to appear in one of your ads, do you think it would get more attention than an ad without a celebrity?
 Using advertorials in newspapers and magazines, paid radio and/or TV time, self-published books, and social media networks, you can do the same thing once only accomplished through publicity and public relations. Not to mention you can exert complete control over the process, unlike live interviews where you are at the host’s mercy.
 Whether you hire celebrity endorsers or transform yourself into a celebrity, you want to create a connection between your product and


-----

###### service. Celebrity is undeniably one of the most powerful tools in your marketing toolbox.
 This draws attention, enhances the buying decision, and increases the loyalty of your consumers. Plus it increases credibility.
 One of the smartest moves you can make is to capitalize on the growing trend of celebrity fascination. Build your own celebrity, or connect with others to form an association between them and your business.

#### How to Create Celebrity Status and Why You
 Should

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Three minutes.
 That’s exactly how long it took for Kylie Jenner’s makeup line to sell on its release.
 Its incredible popularity allowed the young “mogul” to be reported by Money magazine as the youngest “self-made” billionaire in the world.
 And while you might argue that she had a little help, you can’t argue that it was the most successful makeup launch of all time. Because unlike other makeup lines, Kylie had celebrity status and a massive following.
 Of course, this phenomenon goes beyond the Kardashians. Early in my career, I did a lot of work in the Palm Beach/Miami Luxury and Celebrity Market. From launching the Nat King Cole Generation Hope foundation, to planning the event and PR for the restaurant opening of Top Chef contestant Stephen Asprinio, to running events for Dine magazine, where celebrities and pseudo-celebrities would sometimes drop by (and there was a whole lot of glam, but little else), I worked with people who valued being “seen” over being “heard.” (See Figure 4.1 on page 53.)
 And even before Facebook existed, before everyone had a camera on their phone, people were making sure to get their photos taken with the celebrities as much as possible. Just being near these famous people somehow made them more famous.
 It’s how a lot of organizations, concerts, and galas make more money with VIP and upgraded ticket events today. They offer the chance to have your photo taken with the celebrity.


-----

###### Like it or not, the people have spoken. And they love celebrity. The good news is, you can leverage this to your advantage. Big time. Let’s fast-forward to today and focus on you. There is something better than rubbing shoulders with a celebrity: being a celebrity yourself.

###### No longer do you need to get on the front page of The New York Times to launch your book, product, service, or company. No longer do you need to get a spot on the Today Show or win a big award to dominate your market.
 Note to The New York Times: If you want to put this book on your cover, I’ll take it.

###### Now, with simple brand positioning, you can turn yourself into the authority and expert in your market. This allows you to increase your attraction to your perfect prospect, decrease the time needed to close a sale, and increase the amount of money you receive from each customer.

 Turn Yourself into a Celebrity Using Facebook to Increase Your Sales
 DETERMINE YOUR UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION What makes you different from your competitors, and how can you leverage that in your marketing?
 My distinction is that I am not just a social media expert, I also empower entrepreneurs to lean into their superpowers so they can grow their businesses profitably and have a company and life that they love. I share this fact often because the more you tell your audience what your story is, the more they will share it with others.
 Creating a following, developing a relationship, and staying in touch— before you make an offer or try to sell something—puts you in a can’t-lose position. Your audience knows, likes/loves, and trusts you. They are ready to buy. In fact, they ask to buy something.
 So, when do you start? Weeks before your launch? Days? Like the old proverb says, “The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago; the second best time is today.”
 The best time to grow your audience is right now. No matter what else you have going on, have planned, or hope to do, you should grow your audience. It is the most important asset of your business. More important than your product, program, or service. Seriously.
 You can always update your program. You can even change your product. But you can’t go back in time and grow an audience.
 It is one of the things I am most thankful for in our company that we have in place. Having an audience has allowed me to land book deals with cash advances and launch to best-selling status. It allows us to win affiliate contests that bring in extra cash, and it gives us the ability to launch new products, programs, and services to sales right away without having to waste thousands in advertising.
 Recently, we launched our new RISE magazine, and in one day, sold thousands of dollars in subscriptions (see Figure 4.2 on page 56). That


-----

###### never would have happened if we tried promoting our magazine on Facebook to people who didn’t know us. Never. Would. Have. Happened.
 We have also come in the top ten for multiple affiliate launches, competing against the “big dawgs,” like Eben Pagan, Brian Tracy, Jeff Walker, and the like. Because I’ve grown my list and keep in touch with them, and continually give them value, when I recommend something (which I only do when it rocks, of course), they listen, take action, and sign up.
 And my favorite thing: We’ve been able to launch two successful masterminds in the past year with the most amazing entrepreneurs I’ve ever met (see Figure 4.3 on page 57). Working with them is literally my favorite thing I do for work. And this is only possible because of building an audience first. Nurturing them. Giving them value. Taking good care of them because they trust me and that is what is called for me to do.
 The future of business lies in the list, in the relationship you build with your audience, and the value you give them. Not in the transaction of the sale.

**FIGURE 4.2: Our New Rise Magazine**

###### The more value you give, the more value you get from your business. Thankfully, it is easy to create a celebrity-worthy spotlight that sets you up as the superstar of your niche, attracts the perfect prospect, and gets you paid more each time.
 Start with these steps …

###### Mastermind

 1. GET A PROFESSIONAL HEADSHOT When I see someone using a selfie as their headshot photo, it instantly screams, “I am not the expert.” It is unprofessional and gives off the immediate wrong impression. I mean, selfie? Really?
 We have a total of nine seconds to grab someone’s attention and to make an impression.
 If you take into consideration how quickly someone can scroll through their newsfeed, the time is cut in half. What do you want your picture to say about you? What do you want your prospects, clients/customers/patients, and future employees to think of you when they see your photo?
 Get a professional photo taken. And do it when you are at your best. Wear tailored, pressed clothing. Get your hair and makeup done with an on-site stylist (for men and women). I am blessed to have a go-to “make me


-----

###### look my best” team, but you can easily find someone who can come to you via Thumbtack, Priv, Glamsquad, or even WeddingWire.
 This isn’t about changing your look. This is about looking like the best you, and for that, I leave it to the professionals.

 2. HAVE YOUR COVER PHOTOS PROFESSIONALLY DESIGNED Trying to piecemeal together a good look for your Cover Photo with Canva or Word Swag is not easy, and while I used to teach that you should try to do this yourself, I’ve changed my tune. I’ve seen too many DIY cover photos that look terrible. Most people just don’t have an innate eye for design, so it is 100% worth it to hire a professional to do this for you. Check out Upwork.com or Design Pickle if you are looking for ongoing design support. And while you’re at it, have them design a cover photo for all your social media platforms.

 3. PUT OUT EXPERT CONTENT Spend one half-day a month to create your content for that month, and you can leverage it over and over again.
 First, pick a theme for the month, and then write four blog posts to support it.

 • Set goals.
 • Develop a monthly theme that supports your sales goals.
 • Create weekly subtopics that fit in each monthly theme.
 • Develop supporting content.

 Example for IT Services:

 • Set goals: Sell Cyber Security Audits
 • Develop a monthly theme that supports your sales goals: How To
 Protect Yourself From Being Hacked
 • Create weekly subtopics that fit in each monthly theme: Is your email
 being sold on the dark web? Mistakes Employees Make, Policies to Prevent Being Hacked, and Hacking Case Study
 • Develop supporting content: write blog series and newsletter articles


-----

###### 4. SPREAD THE WORD Now that you’ve gotten your “pretty” on with your profile pic and cover photo, and written and edited your expert content, it is time to spread the word about your fabulous self. For each of those blogs …

 1. Write posts promoting the articles and run them on all your social
 media platforms (see Figure 4.4).

**FIGURE 4.4: Facebook Post Promoting Articles**

###### 2. Turn them into a Facebook Live video that links to the blog (see
 Figure 4.5).

**FIGURE 4.5: Facebook Live Video Linking to a Blog**


-----

###### This is the incredible way to get a lot of free promotion for your post. In fact, Facebook gives you 6x more reach with Facebook Live than other posts. (As in free advertising!) 3. Get repeat use of all your posts! Use an automated posting program
 like MeetEdgar to recirculate your content and continue to reach your market. This way, every article you ever write can continue to reach your new prime prospects over and over again.

 5. HAVE GOOD PEOPLE Pull in your “team” to help (after all, celebrities have “people,” don’t they?). There are great resources on sites like www.HireMyMom.com, www.Upwork.com, Fancyhands.com, and www.textbroker.com to get your posts written, images designed, and your posts scheduled for you.
 Ready to walk the red carpet to prospecting success? Then make sure all your networks reflect your brand. Most important, stay consistent. Becoming the celebrity of your niche is not a once-and-done tactic. But playing the long game can reap big rewards.
 Say cheese.

##### CHAPTER 5

### What Is Your Niche?

#### Niche Marketing

###### by Dan Kennedy There are riches in niches for your small-business marketing.
 The first official international convention of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas was held in Branson, Missouri, attended by over 300 professional Santas with real beards (a niche within the Santa niche!), plus some Mrs. Santas and a few nebbishy elves horning in on the fun.
 I was at a National Speakers Association convention in the late ’70s not much bigger than this. Now NSA has 5,000+ members and is the trade association of that industry. And with local chapters around the world, and more getting going, GKIC is an international association of a size to be reckoned with.
 Each of these associations and all others (there are thousands) represents a lucrative niche market for somebody.
 After he failed to gain the support of his employer, James Perez-Foster, a former partner at Bainbridge Advisors, left his job to focus on the Hispanic market. He saw an underserved market with a lot of potential and wanted to focus on this target market.
 He started Solera National Bank, which is dedicated to serving Colorado’s growing population of Hispanic and minority-owned businesses.
 According to a study done by ShareThis, U.S. Latinos are:

 • five times more likely to share content vs. non-Hispanics,
 • twice as likely to click on shared content vs. non-Hispanics,


-----

###### • twice as likely to purchase the products they share vs. non-Hispanics,
 and
 • have four times the brand loyalty of non-Hispanics.

 The point: In every market/business, there are specialty opportunities. Find yours.

 When Choosing an Audience: Better to Pick a Small Haystack and More
 Needles than a Big Haystack with Hardly any Needles We all know the “needle in the haystack” metaphor. The idea here is it’s better to choose a small, well-defined niche and have a ton of followers in that small niche than to pick a large one where your message won’t be heard.

 HOW TO USE THIS IN YOUR OWN BUSINESS If you already have chosen a niche (whether large or small), you can carve out an even smaller niche for yourself through specialization.
 You can do this simply by redefining what it is you do and finding a smaller group of people who are seeking those specialty services. Experts within their space are constantly redefining themselves to serve a smaller, more defined niche—“a smaller haystack.”
 To define this special space and create that unique niche, you just need to ask yourself a few simple questions:

 1. Who? Who is the specific buyer or person you are trying to reach?
 Get to know them, define them, and understand their behaviors. 2. Why? Why is this important? Why are you doing this? 3.  Needs/Benefits? What need are you fulfilling? What does that
 customer want from you, and what problem will be solved?

 And finally, target a very specific niche market to start. Finding and selecting a specialized target market is a safer and better bet than targeting the masses when starting out.
 Look at it this way. If you want to sell your product or service to the general public, you need a substantial marketing budget because you’ll need


-----

###### to run ads in major publications, do massive direct-mail campaigns, and spend larger amounts on internet advertising.
 Why not hitch your wagon to a smaller niche market so you can really start to make hay?

#### Be a Magnet to Your Target Customers

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Kari Voutilainen only sold about 50 of his timepieces each year for the last ten years. And he was satisfied with that.
 Voutilainen is a Finnish watchmaker who specializes in a Vingt-8 wristwatch, a platinum G.M.T. (Greenwich Mean Time) model with hand- fabricated movement. The price of these watches starts at $86,000 each.
 Voutilainen doesn’t try to create products for everyone. He has a niche that he focuses on diligently. His V-8R watch won the Men’s Watch Prize in the esteemed Grand Prix d’Horlogerie competition.
 When asked if he was going to limit production if the market decreases, he said, “Even if there is a 10% decrease in interest, that means only five buyers for me. I can go out and find five more people to buy these watches.”
 50 products, $4.3 million in revenue. Not bad.

 Your Own Million-Dollar Blueprint When it comes to creating a social media campaign that will produce six- plus figures a month, you can’t guess at it, hope at it, or simply manifest it. Sorry.
 If there was a way, believe me that would be the entirety of the book … the one spell you have to conjure to get all of this to work.
 The good news is, you can follow a blueprint and make it happen. It starts with a framework I have named the “M.O.M. Method.” Because after all, Mom knows best.

 • M for Magnet. This is how you get your target market to pay attention
 and be drawn to you. So you can stop chasing after them. The magnet is not necessarily the item you are ultimately selling, but it is just how


-----

###### to get them to pay attention. In crass terms, think of it as the gorgeous half-naked woman on the billboard whose purpose is to sell a man’s watch. Or the large inflatable dancing man outside the retail store on the day of a big sale. Or the samples of Orange Chicken given out in the mall food court beckoning customers in.
 Getting your prospects to pay attention is the first step in getting them to listen to what you have to say next. Luckily, there are easy- peasy ways to know exactly what your target market will pay attention to. We’ll dive into that in the next few pages.
 • O for Opt-In. This is the flood of traffic you need from social media
 in order to get the contact information from your prospects. Growing your list is mission critical because if any of your social channels disappears, you still need to be able to communicate with your list. We will dive into how to get free and paid traffic (that pays for itself) in the chapters to come.
 • M for Monetize. Once you have a list, it’s bank time. Your fans will
 want your products, programs, and services. Your job is to sell them your own—or find others you can recommend and promote. In Chapter 10 we will dive into how to monetize your list.

 Magnetic Success Knowing who you are is important. I used to present my company as a “full-service marketing agency.” But really, what does that even mean?
 For me, it meant a lot of angst. With no focus or niche, we attracted every type of local small business that needed help. They usually had no marketing funnel set up, no list to work with, and no budget. We attracted a lot of businesses like that.
 These small businesses were awful at paying, so even when my contracts were close to covering expenses, we still couldn’t pay our bills. The most important time each day was 3 P.M. because that was when a deposit had to reach the bank to count for that day. Our mail carrier had to arrive before 3 P.M., and there needed to be a check in there, or something would fall apart. Our internet might be shut down. A vendor paramount to a


-----

###### marketing firm, like a printer, might cut us off (rightfully so), or worse, I would risk not being able to make payroll.
 Some days the mail carrier came before 3 P.M. And some days she didn’t. As I think back on it, she usually didn’t. We had a very slow mail carrier in those years who would use my office building to hide out and take an extended break before delivering the mail. I tried using my Italian death stare, but even that didn’t work.
 Being all things to everyone means never being able to choose your customers or business growth. You have no control over the future of your company if you try to attract everyone.
 Narrow your focus. Targeting your audience to as small a group as possible allows you to offer content that is valuable to that group so you can build a strong relationship and increase your chances of brand conversion.
 It is much better to have 500 raving fans than 10,000 tepid followers. You want to attract and engage exactly the type of person who will pay you what you are worth. Remember …

 SOMEONE ALREADY HAS THE MONEY THAT WILL BE YOUR NEXT SALE Your job is to figure out who they are and why they will give it to you.

 • Look at the top 10% of your customers by revenue or, better yet, by
 profit.
 • Make a list of these customers and look for trends.
 • Run the “whose vacation do you want to go on?” test. Think about all
 of your customers, and if they invited you on vacation with them or to a conference they were going to, and there were going to be thousands of people just like them there, whose conference would you want to go to?

 I come from the belief that as long as you are going to work really hard at growing your business, you might as well enjoy it. Whoever you picture can exemplify your niche. As long as you are profitable with this target market and enjoy working with them, then you have found your niche.
 And you can create the business you really want.


-----

###### When we were getting too many looky-loos with more dreams than cash on our webinars, we changed who we were targeting. Instead of basing our demographics on the who, we based them on the “what they have done before.” Meaning, we created Facebook Look-Alike audiences based on similar demographics of those who had spent the most money with us before.
 Our prospects improved, and so did our sales. (Want to see how to create your own super effective look-alike list? Get this and more at nobssocialmediabook.com/powerpack.)

 Once You Determine the “Who,” You Are Just Getting Started Before you start to deliver your message in any medium, you must know who your market is.
 It is imperative that you develop your perfect prospect “avatar.” This is everything about the key perfect customers you want to flood into your business.
 Things to focus on when creating your avatar include sex, age, profession, marital status, sexual orientation, location, native language, education, income, technological expertise, and family composition. Equally important to discover are their media-buying habits, interests, frustrations, and other favorite brand pages. All this research goes into the strategy behind our current clients’ work.
 And go beyond the obvious. At the surface, we target entrepreneurs. But we’ve gone even deeper than that.
 Our most successful members are those who have been in business at least three years and have been relying on word-of-mouth and referrals for lead generation.
 Still kind of obvious, right? We went even farther recognizing that those who have success are the action takers, those who don’t just sit back and wait for things to happen. They are implementers who move with speed.
 Who is this when it comes to targeting? I can’t divulge all of our secrets, of course, but one target market is frequent fliers. They either work outside of their local town which is a sign


-----

###### they are busy getting things done or they travel for pleasure. Either way, they are a mover and shaker.
 Just applying that filter to our marketing has allowed us to directly target our ideal coaching client.

 1. Its customers are married and college-educated, with many having
 attended graduate school. All have a higher income, education, and home value than the average Facebook user (see Figure 5.1 on page 71). 2. Most use desktop and mobile, but a quarter use desktop only. This is
 significantly higher than the average Facebook user and a positive when trying to market online—because this company’s ideal prospects are more likely to be looking at their messaging on a larger screen.

**FIGURE 5.1: Relationship Status vs. Education Level**

###### Only 5% are mobile-only users, which is 86% less than the average Facebook user (see Figure 5.2).

**FIGURE 5.2: Device Users**


-----

###### 3. They spend less money online than the average Facebook user (see
 Figure 5.3 on page 72). Only 45% rank medium to high in online spending. Most would assume you should ignore those who don’t spend online. These metrics say something different entirely. 4. Its buyers are more likely to make business purchases and to take on
 subscription services (see Figure 5.4 on page 72). 5. They own their home (see Figure 5.5 on page 73).

**FIGURE 5.3: Online Purchases**

###### 6. They primarily put everything on a credit card, with 20% having a
 travel credit card and 30% a premium credit card (see Figure 5.6).

**FIGURE 5.6: Spending Methods**

###### 7. In looking at their Lifestyle Cluster, 15% of them are “Summit
 Estate Families” (see Figure 5.7).

**FIGURE 5.7: Lifestyle**


-----

###### “Summit Estate” families are enjoying the good life—luxury travel, entertainment, and consumption of every kind are within easy reach.
 The above information is drawn from Acxiom, the data mining company behind the segmentation software “Perspectives.” Just think about the Established Elite (also shown in Figure 5.7). They mostly come from segments defined as Active Lifestyle, Corporate Connections, Top Professionals, and Active. How much more effective can your messaging be with this information? You can speak directly to your best target customers to attract more of them and ignore everyone else. Not only will this bring you more ideal customers, but it will save you money as there is no reason to focus on the masses.
 The key thing is that this is an analysis of its customers’ data, not its list of people who simply opted in and never bought anything. If you take a look at those stats, the picture is much different.
 For a website traffic breakdown, see Figure 5.8.

**FIGURE 5.8: Demographic Breakdown A**


-----

###### Several profiles rank higher than average (see Figure 5.9 on page 76). More people make online purchases (see Figure 5.10 on page 76). Subscription services are no higher than average compared to their fans (see Figure 5.11 on page 77).
 Online spending is fairly average with slightly fewer people purchasing this way (see Figure 5.12 on page 77).
 Subscription services are not dramatically higher than the average (see Figure 5.13 on page 78).
 No one type of interest or demographic stands out.

###### Clearly, when creating a look-alike audience, it should focus on its best customers to get more like them, those who typically do not spend money


-----

###### online but do spend money on subscription services.
 If we had looked at our client’s overall traffic and not its customers, our marketing focus would have been a lot less effective. By comparing what was different among the markets, we could pinpoint characteristics of its most profitable prospect.
 So how does this strategy play out? We learned the characteristics of the company’s members, which were different from others, and targeted them with our ads. In those demographics, we saw that business travel ranked high. So, we started to target a look-alike of its membership list, plus American Airlines. These have produced subscriptions from cold traffic at a return of 300% of the ad cost. These golden nuggets are where your real ROI comes into play because your competitors will not target these hidden demographics. They will stay within the obvious competitors.

#### You Can’t Always Get What You Want, But You
 Can Give Them What They Want

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Getting your target market to pay attention is an art and science.
 Research firms pay millions each year to figure this out for big brands. You could try calling and asking nicely for them to give you all their secrets and research findings. My guess is that they are not going to want to divulge that information.
 Good news is, using Facebook you can get it for free, right now. After Facebook came under attack for some shenanigans involving Trump, Russians, and the election, Facebook decided to let us all see who and how people were advertising. In fact, you can now see all the past and present ads of your top competitors, right now. You don’t even need a Facebook Ads account to access it.
 Simply visit https://www.facebook.com/ads/library and type in the name of another business. If they’ve run Facebook ads before, they will come up.
 Using myself as an example, see Figure 5.14 on page 80 for what this looks like.


-----

###### Research at least ten different competitors in your niche and see their full campaigns, landing pages, offers, and magnets. Opt-in. Then take out your credit card and buy. And do what every good entrepreneur does … be willing to invest in getting this figured out.
 And by all means do not use a cop-out of “I can’t find anyone in my niche that is running ads.” That is a lazy answer, and the road to success is not run by the lazy. Keep looking. It does not need to be direct competitors. Just those that serve the same market as you.

**FIGURE 5.14: Ads Library**

###### For instance, Infusionsoft software isn’t a competitor of mine. We use their software and are a certified partner reselling it with a bonus package, but they do serve the same market as me, so it makes sense to check out their ads that produce results.
 Dive into those that serve your niche to uncover what’s working right now so you know what to model. That’s model, not copy. Use this research for inspiration on what your MOM Blueprint will be.

#### Survey Your Best Customers

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips When you know who your best customers are, your next step is to get to know them better.
 Guessing is good. Like when I am trying to help my kids pass the time in line to board a roller coaster at the mall, by playing the “I spy” game. Or when I am putting a few dollars down on the roulette wheel when a speaking engagement takes me to Vegas.
 But guessing is not good when it comes to marketing, especially when the answers are available to you. Guessing then is similar to baking a bad cake. There’s a recipe with all the measurements and measuring cups next to you, but instead you just toss ingredients into a bowl. Sure, there is a chance you’ll get it right, but it would have been better if you’d followed the recipe. And there’s a pretty good chance you’ll just screw up the whole thing.
 Research is good. But it isn’t sexy. So most businesses skip it. But research can be exciting. Seriously.
 You can actually get leads while you are researching your target market. By sending out a simple one-question audience survey, you can gain amazing results that can influence your marketing and generate revenue.

 Sample One-Question Surveys

 • “What’s the number-one question you have about (XYZ industry)?”
 • “If you could change one thing about (XYZ industry), what would it
 be?”
 • “If you had a magic wand, what’s the one thing you would like to be
 different about (XYZ industry or their pain or frustration)?”

 The answers to these questions can provide you with the following results.

 • Factual data about the likes, habits, hobbies, and needs of your target
 market. Effective marketing is based on facts, not guesses.


-----

###### Determining the needs of your target market through research will give you the greatest chance of success.
 • A report you can use to get publicity. Once your survey is complete,
 release your findings to the media as a “State of the Industry” report. Done well, this will not only give you fantastic media coverage, but also establish you as “the expert” in your field to the media, making you the go-to choice for future stories.
 • Provides a plethora of effective copy you can use in your marketing.
 When you ask your target market what they want to know more about in your industry, their answers come in their own words. This gives you the exact copy to use in your marketing and content development. This will not only resonate better with your audience, but will help your Search Engine Optimization—since you will write copy the way your audience will search for it. Also use this copy as subject lines in your emails, headlines in your social media ads, and the opening lines of your email campaigns.
 • Hands you qualified leads (The money question!). Within the answers
 of your target market, you can find new customers, upsell opportunities from current customers, and identify referral sources and other business opportunities. The last time we ran this question, we found a treasure trove of responses, including speaking engagement offers, prospect interview requests, and referral opportunities.

 A few tips on a seamless execution:

 • Use the free resource SurveyMonkey to draft your question.
 • Offer a prize to one lucky respondent or an incentive to each person,
 like an ebook, free report, or video.
 • Distribute the survey through email, your blog, and/or social media
 channels.
 • Give a deadline of only a week to take the survey.
 • Review the results.

 We recently did a rather comprehensive survey about the social media marketing behaviors of businesses. We offered the significant incentive of a

###### $997 video training. Of course, it cost me nothing, but the perception of value is all that matters to increase responses. Through this survey, we were able to discover our audience’s biggest frustrations, in their own words. I used respondents’ exact statements as the bullet points in a webinar following this project.
 We also leveraged the survey to get PR for our firm, as a lead magnet, and as a special gift for our Marketing Insiders Elite Members.
 And we got new clients out of it, generating the only important metric— profit.
 Money, intel, and PR? That is a valuable process.

### Magnetic Leads

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### How to Quickly Create an Effective Lead Magnet

###### As Dan shared, your Magnetic Offer is something your best prospects would pay for, even if it weren’t free. But, of course, all they need to do is give you their contact information. This is an effective way to start lifelong customer relationships with cold Facebook traffic.

 Why Lead Magnets Work When it comes to generating leads online, reaching out to prospects on social media and elsewhere isn’t enough. Merely asking people for their contact information won’t get you very far. You need to offer something of value in exchange, and it needs to be something worthwhile to your target audience. Put simply, you need to develop an assortment of lead magnets to walk your target market toward the sale.
 Thankfully, you don’t have to pour huge amounts of time, effort, or money into developing lead magnets. In fact, you shouldn’t.
 For example, if I am going to offer a free guide about Facebook, I am not going to include every step-by-step on how to run an effective Facebook ad campaign because: 1) There would be no reason for students to continue to learn from me, and more important, 2) they would be completely overwhelmed and most likely run away from the topic altogether. The guide can focus on one aspect of what they need and give real value, but not provide the entire story.
 This isn’t just about selling. It’s about being effective for your prospect.


-----

###### If it seems like too much work either to consume or execute, it generally does not test well as a lead magnet. Brands, speakers, and experts often think it is their obligation to tell prospects everything. But the contrary is true. You are doing a disservice to your target market if you give too much information. They will not be motivated to move forward to take action.
 The reason is in our brain chemistry. Prospects want a quick win, giving themselves a speedy dose of dopamine.
 Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain’s reward and pleasure centers. Dopamine also helps regulate movement and emotional responses, and enables us not only to see rewards, but to take action toward them. (Source: Psychology Today.)
 Dopamine is one of our body’s triggers for motivation. It is what propels us forward. It’s behind all the little actions in our day, such as getting out of bed and taking a shower, to the more advanced actions like achieving goals. It is our reward trigger that makes sure we don’t sit around like sloths all day.
 It is your job to propel prospects forward into action. The moment they consume your lead magnet, they should get a quick dose of dopamine compelling them to continue along the path to a sale. Yes, this is manipulative. But necessary. Your prospect craves it.
 If you have a product or service that meets the needs of your target market, then you have a moral obligation to purposefully use triggers to drive them to action. I believe there is nothing immoral or unethical about using triggers to drive your target market to take action in order to ensure they get what they need.
 Imagine meeting the love of your life while walking down the street in a crowded city. For a moment, you lock eyes while passing by, instantly connect, and within only a few seconds of conversation, decide to get married.
 Other than some movie where there is a fairy godmother doing her thing, this would be impossible, right? Of course, it would.
 Yet that is what most Facebook marketing hopes will happen every single time they run an ad campaign. They launch an ad trying to sell something at hello. Passing by in a crowded space in a split second, they ask the prospect to marry them.
 It doesn’t work that way.


-----

###### The good news is you can take your prospect from stranger to customer in one transaction … all by first picking your “What’s Next” strategy and then by growing your audience.
 You want the “next step” to be free, but so good that if it weren’t, people would pay for it anyway. We call this step the “Juicy Carrot.” You are trying to attract as many bunnies (an animal that loves to multiply) to your offer as possible.
 Here’s how:

 STEP ONE: YOUR JUICY CARROT Before launching any audience-building campaign, always, always, always (and yes, always) figure out what you want your audience to do after they agree to follow you.
 Having a “next step” Juicy Carrot ensures that there is ROI (aka cha- ching). Because you aren’t just getting clicks, you are audience-building, growing your list, and driving in sales.
 A few of the many Juicy Carrot options to choose from:

 1. Join Your List. Powerhouse member and photographer extraordinaire
 Lisa Roberti launched her Wildlife and Nature Guild so her followers could join her list and follow her photography safaris (see Figure 6.1). Her passion is protecting our endangered wildlife and creating advocacy in her tribe.

**FIGURE 6.1: Join-Our-List Juicy Carrot**


-----

###### 2.  Take a Free Gift. Inner Circle Mastermind member David Stelzl
 gives a Free Risk Assessment Template to his prospects, IT firms, which they can use with their prospects to get more clients (see Figure 6.2 on page 89).

**FIGURE 6.2: Free Gift Juicy Carrot**


-----

###### 3. Free Webcast. Right on my Cover Photo, I am promoting our weekly
 webinar: “How to Get 10,000 Facebook Fans in 72 Hours” (see Figure 6.3).

**FIGURE 6.3: Free Webcast Juicy Carrot**

###### 4. Powerhouse members Sabrina and Tristan offer “more information”
 on their certification program as the next step for their followers (see Figure 6.4 on page 90).

**FIGURE 6.4: More Information Juicy Carrot**


-----

###### STEP TWO: SETTING UP FOR SUCCESS When you’ve figured out what your Juicy Carrot is, give yourself a fist bump. You are crushing this.
 Then, put a link to that on all your social media accounts. As you grow your followers, you always want them to know “what’s next.”
 You are now officially a “direct-response marketer”—as in one who cares about not just the sizzle but the steak, too, aka you want your marketing to produce results.

 CONTESTS AS LEAD MAGNETS Why would they enter this? No, really?
 Contests can be an effective way to build your list and sales. We ran one for the first edition of this book and had over 1,000 people apply for a social media package and to be spotlighted in the book. This gave us a lot of content, new contacts on our email list, and hundreds of warm leads.


-----

###### Engaging through a contest is effective. This is the thought process behind “gamification,” defined as the application of typical elements of game playing (e.g., point scoring, competition with others, rules of play) to other areas of activity, typically as an online marketing technique to encourage engagement with a product or service.
 Put another way, make your marketing more “fun” so your prospects are eager to participate. Leverage gamification as a lead magnet to acquire new prospects.
 Run your contest outside of your social networks. If you run your contest on your page, you cannot require people to give you their email address and/or like your page in order to enter. Instead, send your traffic to a landing page outside of Facebook (instead of using the Facebook plugins to host the page on a Facebook tab). Move your prospects to a channel with the greatest chance of entering.
 And importantly, give away a prize that also works as a way to qualify your leads. Instead of a generic iPad or Visa gift card, give away something your quality prospects would like, such as a gift certificate to your business, consulting time, a ticket to an event, merchandise, etc. When I owned the agency, Bath Planet, a bathroom remodeling business, was a client and we gave away a bathroom remodeling package, and for another client, One- Hour Heating and Air Conditioning, we gave away a furnace.
 Whatever your lead magnet/Juicy Carrot is, use it to draw your lead away from social media in order to acquire people’s contact information so you can nurture them into a sale. (See Figures 6.5 through 6.8 on pages 92 through 94.)
 Start with one, optimize it, and move on to the next. See what your audience responds best to in not just opt-ins but in full conversions to customers.

###### Because in the end, the dollars generated through your lead magnet and the sales funnel that follows is the only metric that really matters.

 And nothing has proven to give a higher ROI than social media marketing. Dollar for dollar, day in and day out, over and over again—you get the idea. Social media marketing produces a higher return per dollar spent than anything else.

 How Do I Reach My Target Audience? Once you have your Juicy Carrot ready, it is time to get your perfect prospects to fill it in.
 After new email subscribers join our list, they are offered the opportunity to ask me a marketing question. Frequently it’s for help choosing an exact target market. I’ve been asked, “How do I reach seniors?” “How do I reach an affluent group?” “How do I reach small

-----

###### business owners?” or “How do I reach owners of Sugar Gliders?” (which by the way are the cutest nocturnal flying creatures you ever did see and the niche of one of our coaching members).
 How do you reach any specific market you are looking to conquer? If you don’t have a list of customers to upload to Facebook and create a “look-alike” audience, then you can target other people’s fan pages. Find the pages of the people your people like by going into Facebook Audience Insights and typing in a page name of a guru in your niche. Up will come the other pages those people like.

 Segment Interests to Optimize Effectively We optimize ads daily, and one of the key ways we do this is by narrowing the targeted audience of each ad. If you want to sell tennis racquets, you could target fans of the U.S. Open, Nike Tennis, and Andre Agassi, plus those who like tennis. We typically categorize interests and demographics and put them in different look-alike categories.
 Play around with each of the main options (demographic, interests, and behavior), run some A/B tests, and determine which avenue works best for your business. This is the kind of marketing none of your competitors is doing but can give you an incredible return on investment. Most who read this book won’t take action, but if you do, you will quickly grow your ROI.
 Now go find your equivalent of the Ohio Family with six kids that likes HGTV that converts really well for one of our financial planners.
 You have been challenged. Be different than most and accept.

#### Get Your Target Market to Opt-In

###### I am fascinated by the story of Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos. I am also one of their Prime Members and a company stockholder.
 Jeff Bezos got the idea to start Amazon after he came across the fact that web usage was growing at 2,300% annually. He had just turned 30 years old and been married for a year. When he told his wife he wanted to quit his job and do this crazy thing that probably wouldn’t work since most startups don’t, she told him to go for it.
 Interestingly, Amazon’s initial public offering went nuts in 1997— but then came the crash.


-----

###### According to Business Insider, “For a while, analysts called the company ‘Amazon Bomb.’ But Amazon survived for two reasons: Users kept coming to the site in bigger numbers, and Jeff never promised shareholders anything but a long-term vision.” Since then, Amazon.com has expanded beyond selling books to selling almost everything, from clothes to bird cages to a grossly dramatic replica of five pounds of human flesh, for example. (And some day when you have time on your hands, check out the reviews for sugar-free gummy bears. It’s interesting because people love it and hate it for the same reason—it’s a gastric nightmare! It has 1,400+ humorous product reviews.)
 By 2009, Amazon was up 5,000% since its IPO. And I am a happy stockholder.
 (If you want to read more about Amazon’s story, check out The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon by Brad Stone [Back Bay Books, 2014]. It is a very candid telling of how Bezos created a new disruptive way of doing business.)
 You may not be trying to create the next Amazon. But if you offer a quality product or service you believe in, or people have a need for what you offer, or you want to get more customers, clients, or patients, and you want to increase sales to your current customers, clients, or patients, then you are going to need your target market to respond to your ads.
 After you’ve decided on the who and the what … it’s time to launch! When you are ready to launch your ad campaign, be sure to avoid these mistakes.

 • Do not spend just to spend. I get it. There is a lot of pressure to launch
 your ads. But before you know whether your campaign will produce results, keep your credit card in your wallet. Test before launching with warm traffic, like your email list or social media followers. If you don’t have those yet, and you need to spend to test, start very slowly, at around $25/day. No need to go broke seeing if your offer is a winner.
 • Do not try to be everything to everybody. Make sure your copy and
 images speak to a specific audience. We’ve seen businesses set up their audience to be very narrow but then use the same image for


-----

###### every audience. Being broad with your messaging is a quick way to waste your money.
 • Do not make the ad about you or your product/program/service/event.
 Ads that speak directly to your target market and share why someone should click on the ad (or play the video or Like your page) will perform a lot better.
 • Do not copy other ads you see on Facebook. Most of the people doing
 social media marketing are doing it terribly, terribly wrong and are not seeing measurable success. Follow them and you’ll get the same thing as them … bupkis.

 Instead, read the next chapter on how to write an effective ad.

##### CHAPTER 7

### Fill Your Funnel

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### Launching Your Offer

###### Once you know who you are targeting and what they want, and your Juicy Carrot is good to go, it is time to send traffic—aka people—to it.
 In this chapter you will discover my favorite hacks for each social media channel in building an audience quickly for free. In the next chapter you will discover paid strategies that will help you scale (and profit) quickly.

 Facebook As of the writing of this book, Facebook still has more locations for you to gather leads than any other social media channel. From the Newsfeed to your Business Page, Messenger, and Groups, you can use multiple channels all within the same platform.
 Let’s dive into each and learn how to get the most opt-ins for free from your Juicy Carrot.

 Your Business Page Lead Mecca Last year my company, Powerful Professionals, generated $54,387 for free from my Facebook Page. How?
 I promoted the sweet biscuits and gravy out of my Juicy Carrots on my page.
 Most businesses just let their page sit there and collect dust. You, on the other hand, will use it to gather leads.


-----

###### Here’s how:

 1. YOUR COVER PHOTO Use your Cover Photo on Facebook as a billboard for a Call to Action to your Juicy Carrot. When your prospect clicks on the Cover Photo, up will come a description of the image, and in it, you can include a link of your choice.
 We change our cover photo to match the promotion we are working on. See Figures 7.1 thru 7.3.
 What does your cover photo promote? Your blog? Your email?

**FIGURE 7.1: Facebook Cover Photo and Description Example A**

**FIGURE 7.2: Facebook Cover Photo and Description Example B**

**FIGURE 7.3: Facebook Cover Photo and Description Example C**

###### Try adding a next step to increase your lead-to-sale conversation and see your ROI rise right away.
 And to leverage a professional appearance, I recommend you get your cover photo designed by a professional. DIY Cover Photos look DIY. If there is anywhere you want to spend the money to make a first impression, it is here. Plus, when you assign this, you can assign dimensions for LinkedIn and Twitter, too, so all three channels match.


###### Download resources for getting your Cover Photo done for you at

-----

###### Revise your Facebook “About” descriptions and add a link to your Juicy Carrot everywhere you can (see Figure 7.4). Not 2,342 different links. Just one path to your Juicy Carrot.

**FIGURE 7.4: Call-to-Action Link on Kim’s About Page**

###### Do all your bios and descriptions on your social media pages have links to the next step?

 2. THE THREE-LINE POST Facebook’s platform gives us the most opportunity to promote our Juicy Carrot within a post, because when crafted correctly, the entire post and image will link directly to your Juicy Carrot page. You can accomplish this in a simple three-line post:


-----

###### • Line One: Get the reader’s attention by asking a question about the
 problem you are about to solve for them.
 • Line Two: Tease that there is a solution to that problem.
 • Line Three: Give a link to the call to action.

 Important: Type the copy and link in before adding any photos. Let the preview of the page come up and then add your pictures afterward so the entire post becomes clickable to your Juicy Carrot.


###### Get a step-by-step video tutorial at nobssocialmediabook.com/powerpack.


###### Post several times a week with a twist on the copy and different images, but always with a link to your Juicy Carrot. (See Figure 7.5 for an example of a three-line post.)

**FIGURE 7.5: Three-Line Post**


-----

###### 3. FACEBOOK LIVE Growing up as a child of a first-generation American-born parent, I was taught to value a dollar and make the most of every opportunity. My father also taught us to go up for tenth helpings at All You Can Eat Buffets. (In Italian, we call this being a “Gavone.”) Thankfully, I quickly got over the buffet thing, and unless it is New Year’s Day brunch at the Breakers on Palm Beach, you won’t find me at one.
 But being conscious of a dollar and making the most of every opportunity is something that has never left my value system. So, when it comes to lead generation, I am all in for getting as much as I can for every dollar I spend …
 … Hence, why my lead generation BFF is Facebook Live. OK, this is supposed to be the free section, but it’s almost free, because with less than $5 spent, you can reach your exact target market and drive them to join your email list and/or buy your products, programs, and services. The best part is, there is no guess work required.


-----

###### Before you spend any money, you can post your Facebook Live for free to see if you get any kind of reaction from your target market, and only if you do, then you can promote it to your intended target market. (Love me some free market research.)
 Fantastically, there are a lot of uses for this type of post, too, such as:

 1. Promote your blog post topic, and include a link to get more readers
 of your content. 2. Share a tip from your “Juicy Carrot,” and include a link for opt-ins. 3. Give a strategy related to an affiliate offer, and include a link for opt ins. 4. Broadcast a preview of a webinar, seminar, or event, and give a link
 to register. 5. Interview a client, referral source, or thought leader, and share a link
 to learn more. 6. Livestream an event with a link to register for a future one or a link
 to buy the product, program, or service you are promoting.

 And that is just the start. All you need is a phone or computer to broadcast. No fancy-schmancy equipment or expensive software to buy. Unlike my shoe collection, this platform is cheap and fabulous (see Figure 7.6).
 Facebook Live is better than anything I’ve experienced in social media, ever. You can reach more people faster than anything else and for free or just a tiny bit of ad spend.

###### Instagram Hacks INSTA-LAUNCH I’ve tested a lot when it comes to Instagram. Many things didn’t work. But a few worked really, really well.
 In this section you’ll discover how to quickly score your first or next 1,000 Instagram followers and reach your target market so you can grow your list and scale your business.
 Why bother with Instagram? Instagram has over a billion people—more than NBC, CBS, FOX, and all the major networks combined.
 Plus 80% of all Instagram users say they purchased something because they discovered it on Instagram. So not only can you grow your massive following easily without spending money on ads, but you can get purchasers directly from this platform.
 You can take years growing your following. Or you can use the shortcuts I’ve discovered.
 I first found them because Entrepreneur Press, my publisher and the fabulous people behind this book, asked me to write a book on Instagram after the book you are reading now published and did well.
 At the time, I had only 352 Instagram followers. So, I told myself, “All right, well, if I’m going to put out a book about being an Instagram expert, I better get it together and become an Instagram expert. I’m going to have to study. I’m going to have to grow my Instagram account, and I’ve got to do it fast.”


-----

###### So, I tried a whole lot of stuff. I took a deep dive into research, I experimented, I took courses, I listened to podcasts. I did all the research for you, and I tested everything.
 Most of the stuff frankly did not work. It was a bunch of hogwash— people making stuff up, as gurus like to do on the internet. They rent a Ferrari, stand in front of it for a few minutes, and then tell us some hack that doesn’t work.
 But there were several techniques that worked incredibly well, and in less than one year, I went from 352 followers to over 10,000.
 The following are the exact strategies you can use to quickly grow your Instagram following:

 HASHTAGS The number-one thing to start with is hashtags. Hashtags are how people find information that they’re looking for, kind of like little file folders inside of Instagram.
 Let’s say I’m planning a trip to Disney, and I’m going to stay at the Grand Floridian. I might search Instagram for “#Disney,” or “#GrandFloridian” and see posts with information about the Grand Floridian (see Figure 7.7).

**FIGURE 7.7: #GrandFloridian Instagram Posts**


-----

###### Or, let’s say I’m trying to find tax hacks. I could type in “#taxdeductions” (see Figure 7.8). Or, let’s say I love me some sushi; I might search “#sushi.” One that I actually follow is called Rooftop Bars, “#rooftopbars,” which features pictures from different fabulous rooftop bars all around the world (see Figure 7.9 on page 109).

**FIGURE 7.8: #taxdeductions Instagram Posts**


-----

###### I love to get myself a drink with a great view when I’m traveling, or I can do so virtually on any day.
 Hashtags are how people who are looking for you can find you. They are everything. And you can organically grow your Instagram following without spending a bunch of money on advertising.

**FIGURE 7.9: #rooftopbars Instagram Posts**


-----

###### Which hashtag should you use in your post to get the best results? There are several hashtag directories you can use. According to Influencer Marketing Hub, the 25 most popular hashtags are:

 1. #love 2. #instagood 3. #photooftheday 4. #fashion 5. #beautiful 6. #happy 7. #cute 8. #tbt 9. #like4like 10. #followme


-----

###### 11. #picoftheday 12. #follow 13. #me 14. #selfie 15. #summer 16. #art 17. #instadaily 18. #friends 19. #repost 20. #nature 21. #girl 22. #fun 23. #style 24. #smile 25. #food

 However, remember that very popular hashtags may not be very effective, because you’re just one in a sea of noise. You won’t have a very specific audience.
 Instead, go after your niche to attract your perfect prospect. It’s the difference between generic #work and specific #momboss. Or even more specific with #fitmomboss.
 In this narrower niche you could accurately target women who are moms, who own their own company, and who are into fitness. The more specific you get, the more likely your message will resonate with your target market.
 But how do you figure out which hashtag to use? It’s really super simple.
 Find ten people with at least 10,000 followers in your niche on Instagram. They may not do the exact same thing that you do. (Because you may be thinking, “No one does what I do.”) And that’s cool. I mean, you are unique. You’re created with a purpose. But there are other people who serve the same niche you do. So, find them.
 Maybe you serve small businesses, or people who are going through a divorce, or who are seeking fitness. Whatever it is, find similar businesses (that may or may not be similar to you) that serve the same market. That’s


-----

###### all that’s important. It doesn’t matter what they do. What matters is that they serve the same people as you.
 Next, check what hashtags they are using. Make a list of them, because those are what you’re going to use to test in your own posts.
 For example, in my niche I might check out Russell Brunson. (I’m not saying that I’ve ever done this, but I do this all the time.) On his posts are hashtags like #socialmediamarketing, #businessrefined, and #marketinglife.
 The easiest way to keep track of hashtags and use them in posts is to keep a list in the notes section of your phone—so you can copy and paste when needed. Then just keep testing different hashtags to see which ones give you the best reach.
 It is important to know that you can include up to 30 hashtags in a post. Test how many work best for you, but I’ve found around 15 is the sweet spot to include without it impacting reach.
 Nonetheless … test, test, test.

 INSTA-STORIES Insta-Stories have become the most popular part of Instagram. While you can include a link to whatever you like once you have more than 10,000 followers, anyone can use stories from the start.
 Getting 10,000 followers is a good reach goal because linking to your next webinar, Juicy Carrot, or live event is free lead generation. But until then, keep using Insta-stories.
 Here’s how to use Instagram Stories:

 1. Click on the camera icon in the top left or the ‘+’ on your profile
 picture, or simply swipe right and click on the camera icon. 2. Tap the white circle in the middle to take a picture, hold it for a
 video, or tap the gallery icon in the left corner (or just swipe up) to use existing media on your phone. (More options for Instagram below.) 3. Edit your photo or video and get it just the way you like it using
 Instagram’s various editing options with the ability to add hashtags and text to the image. (Have fun exploring.) 4. Tap the « Your Story » button to post publicly.


-----

###### 5. You can also save it to your phone to download and use later for
 another purpose.

 Important to note … Unlike the dimensions for standard square Instagram posts, stories are shot vertically. Your photos and videos should be sized accordingly, at 1080 pixels wide by 1920 pixels tall. Thankfully, you can resize your images and videos right inside of Instagram by pinching the image on screen.
 If you post more than one story in a 24-hour period—which on Instagram is quite welcome—anything added to your camera roll should show when you swipe up in the stories camera view.
 With stories, you can do a bunch of things like…

 • A 30-second video
 • Instagram Live
 • Boomerang (quick video on repeat)
 • Zoom in (getting closer to your subject)

 Play around with it and see what works best for your brand. Normally stories will disappear in 24 hours, but if you want it to appear longer, click on the highlight button and save it to the top part of your profile.
 Instagram Stories give you free traffic from people seeking your message, so it’s worth spending the time to test.

 MORE INSTAGRAM GROWTH TOOLS There are more tools to grow your Instagram following …

 •  Emojis. Using emojis gets your post more engagement and hence
 more reach each time. Why? I don’t know, but as I’ve shared, my favorite quote is, “In God I trust, everyone else bring data,” and the data shows that Instagram loves those little emojis. Put them in your post descriptions and comments.
 • Engagement with other pages. Follow key pages in your niche where
 your followers hang out. Comment and like their posts for another way to grow your following. Many people will follow you back if you


-----

###### like their page or comment on their posts. Give some love and get some in return. Especially when you are first starting.
 • Use your other channels to promote your Instagram page. Leverage
 your followers. No matter how small, woo followers to Instagram from other platforms.
 If you have a Facebook channel, email list, YouTube subscribers, readers of your blog, or LinkedIn connections, spend one week promoting the bazooka out of your Instagram. Get everybody to come on over and follow your page.
 You can even offer prizes or incentives or a series like, “This week I’m going to be offering tips about XYZ thing on Instagram. Follow me there. Comment on my page and you can win XYZ.”
 Leverage what you have and promote your challenge up to once per quarter for a whole week, putting it on your schedule ahead of time so you are sure to remember to do it.
 • Create or join an Instagram cluster. Instagram clusters are when a
 group of people agrees to like and comment on each other’s posts to spur engagement on a profile. This activity will help distribution of your post to more of your followers. I joined one when I was experimenting, and while it eventually fizzled out, it was great in the beginning and worth doing.
 Get a group of six to ten people and share that “When I post on Instagram, I will message all of you. Go ahead and Like and Comment on my post.”
 This creates a virtual Bat Signal to Instagram when you do it, telling them, “Ooh, people are enjoying this post,” so they will share it with more people. Do that for each other in your cluster, and your posts will tend to spread to a lot more people.

 PAY TO PLAY STRATEGIES Influencer Marketing There is always an audience gathered that is perfect for you. All that they’re waiting for is your message—like they woke up today, praying, wishing they’d hear from you. They’re already gathered together. How do you get to them?


-----

###### The fantastic thing about Instagram is besides just hashtags we can also leverage other people’s audiences.
 Your future tribe is gathered together in little virtual cocktail parties on Instagram, and you don’t need an invitation to join them. Instead, you can find them by leveraging other people’s audiences, also known as “Influencers.”
 You can pay influencers to promote you. It’s an amazing way to get a lot of eyes on your brand and acquire new followers inexpensively.
 You can find these Influencers by looking for pages with a large number of followers, but who are following a small number of others, and without a person in the profile picture. Often it features one of the “top posts” in a hashtag search instead. Influencers’ posts are pulled into the “Top Posts” search listing Instagram’s Hashtag results.
 For example, @Luxuryworldtraveler had a bunch of followers and a link in their bio about sales inquiries. They are a promotion page and Influencer. See Figure 7.10.

**FIGURE 7.10: Instagram Influencer Page**

###### You can go to these pages directly or contact an Influencer broker who will negotiate for you and hold the money in escrow to make sure the brand does what they are supposed to do before getting paid.
 You can also pay to grow your followers on Instagram.

 PROMOTING A POST


-----

###### You can put a few ad dollars behind your most popular posts and promote them to increase your followers.
 When one of my Instagram posts is doing well, I’ll tap the Promote button, and with just a couple bucks, I get massive engagement and followers on Instagram.
 The ROI is incredible. And truth be told, it is significantly more effective than boosting a post on Facebook. Really, with just a few dollars you can get a lot of reach, engagement, followers, and even list growth.

 How to Promote a Post

 1. When you find a post is doing well, simply click on the blue
 “promote post” button located below the post. 2. You then have the option to choose where your ad will send viewers
 to. If you’re trying to grow your followers, you’re going to want to choose to send them to your profile. You then can either create your audience or have Instagram create your audience for you. 3. Next is budget. You can promote with as little as $2 a day. I like to
 test $5 a day for 6 days, spending just $30 and getting maximum results. (Toasting to the good old days of Facebook advertising that are back again with Instagram.) 4. Finally, set up your payment information and click “create
 promotion.” 5. Do a Happy Dance/Superbowl Shuffle/Fortnite boogie (depending
 on your age and interest) to celebrate because you just increased your Instagram followers.

 And you are done! Expect massive engagement and hundreds of followers for just a few dollars. It’s amazing.
 Of course, before spending anything on Instagram, make sure your bio is set up with a link to your Juicy Carrot. In the end, this isn’t just about growing your Instagram followers. It is about lead generation.
 Instagram is vital to growing your audience, your lists, and sales. You can grow quickly with these hacks, building your email list and driving

 If you aren’t on yet, don’t fear. The best time to start is right now. And I have a little cheat sheet for you, as a bonus for reading this book. Visit nobssocialmediabook.com/powerpack for my top ten Instagram Posts to use as a guide for your own content.

 LinkedIn As I shared earlier, before I discovered direct-response marketing, I spent a whole lot of time and money because I was continuously chasing people who were not in my target market. I was busy all the time with nothing to show for it.
 Once I discovered results-based marketing, the core of this book, I knew I wanted to start using it to land more clients. The problem was, I didn’t have an advertising budget.
 After I read Dan’s original book, No B.S. Direct Marketing: The Ultimate No-Holds-Barred Kick-Butt Take-No-Prisoners Direct Marketing for Non-Direct Marketing Businesses, I needed to find a way to expand my network and attract better paying clients … without spending money on ads.
 In came LinkedIn. I began sharing content daily about getting leads and sales using social media. Not just likes or clicks, but leads and sales.
 And for the first time in my career, a client came to me that I had never met before.
 On Saturday, January 22, 2010, I was in the kitchen in our tiny third- floor apartment. I was pregnant with our first child and a bit crazy with hormones, so when my husband heard me screaming, he thought I had officially lost it.
 He was delighted to find out that I was just really happy. A prospect had contacted me because of the marketing I was doing online.
 This message came from the president of an accounting firm:

 Hi, Kim. I don’t believe we’ve ever met. However, I’m familiar with you and your company via the social media sphere. I’m looking for a marketing firm with a robust understanding of social media to


-----

###### advise, provide feedback on a periodic basis as it relates to our marketing strategy, and marketing and social media initiatives and campaigns. If this is something you’d like to explore further, please call me or drop me an email. Steve.

 It was so hard to wait until Monday to contact him … but I did. And I got the client.

 SO WHY LINKEDIN FOR YOU? There are over 500 million people on LinkedIn. It’s a huge channel, larger than any television network you could reach. And someone new joins every two seconds.
 Executives from every Fortune 500 company are on there, so these are legit, high-net worth contacts with high executive experience. Members conduct over 2 billion searches each day. So, people are on there—looking for products, programs, and services. And if you want to close a sale, you’ve got to be where the people are, right? Because before you can close that sale, you’ve got to get their attention. They’re on LinkedIn right now waiting to talk to you.
 LinkedIn combines networking with data generation, the ultimate in ROI-based networking.
 Early on, I spent so much time going to Chamber networking events, thinking, “Gosh, I wish I could just see little bubbles above people’s heads, telling me whether they are the decision maker. Do they need what I have to offer?” I wanted to cut through all the clutter to connect with only those who were a best match for my services.
 On LinkedIn you can network that way because you see all the vital stats right on the profile. You’ll know who they are, whether they are a decision maker, what experience they have, and what they are interested in. Is this someone who would be a good match for you? You can find out before you ever waste a single second networking.
 LinkedIn allows you to conduct all this research upfront: You can spy on your competitors. You can see a list of their top clients and activity. You can also check out your prospects to discover who’s recommending them and interacting with them.


-----

###### You can actually click on the activity button on their profile to see all the ways they’ve been interacting with people, letting you know more about their network.
 Use this as an ongoing information-gathering tool. Visit the profiles of your Dream 100. Read their posts and articles. If they are members of any groups, consider these as suggestions for other groups you can join. It will also show you what keywords and skill sets they are interested in.
 When you visit someone’s account, take a look at the “skills” they have listed to understand their interests and focus. This gives you a lot of great information before those prospect meetings you were already engaged in.
 Quick Win: Check out the meetings on your calendar for the next two weeks. Connect with those prospects via LinkedIn now, and check out their profiles to get to know them better. When you meet in person, mention something you read about them on their profile. This will blow them away with the research you did ahead of your meeting.

 YOUR LINKEDIN HOME BASE It is time to get your LinkedIn house in order, following one of my favorite Colin Powell quotes: “There are no secrets to success. It’s the result of preparation and hard work.”
 One great way to get started before you create your LinkedIn profile is to visit a site called answerthepublic.com. Ignore the creepy dude in the background and just type in your topic.
 The website will show you all the questions people ask on Google surrounding that topic. For example, I typed in “Facebook marketing” and received a huge list of questions people were asking right now about Facebook marketing. Because these questions are being asked in Google, using this information can help your search rankings later.
 For example, if someone asks, “How to make money with Facebook marketing,” you can write a blog post or article titled “How to make money on Facebook through marketing.” Then you will be more likely to pop up in similar search results. Now you just jumped ahead of all your competitors because people can find you.
 The same goes with writing your LinkedIn profile. The more terms and phrases you can use from what people are actually searching for, the more


-----

###### often you’ll show up in those 2 billion daily searches on LinkedIn—and more often on Google, because LinkedIn is integrated with Google search. Not only are you now driving more traffic from LinkedIn, but you’ll also benefit from more people learning about you on Google. How cool is that?
 How to do it:

 • Visit answerthepublic.com, type in your topic, then download those
 lists of questions as a PDF. It’s totally free.
 • Use this for content ideas, as mentioned above. You can use the
 questions word-for-word.
 • You will also uncover how people talk about your niche and how you
 should be describing it.
 • Too often marketers and business owners use jargon terms the end
 user doesn’t know. When you design your copy the same way your target market talks about it, you will be light-years ahead in building their trust.
 • Some key things to remember when creating or updating your
 LinkedIn profile:
 • Same is lame; looking like everybody else is not going to help you
 stand out. Standing out is a quick way to tell them, “Hmm, this is something different. This might be a new opportunity, something worth checking out.” It’s going to create curiosity, which will help grab attention.
 • Keywords rule. Use words that people are already looking for,
 borrowed from that answerthepublic search.
 • Make your entire profile about the individual, not about you. People
 won’t care about you until they know that you care first. But they won’t know you care until you take time to develop a relationship with them. However, you can’t develop this relationship until you get them to pay attention. So, what do they care about? Themselves. Make it all about them, giving them what they want. That is the key way to get started.
 • Remember, copy counts—the way you describe things, and the way
 you write. This can give you a huge competitive advantage for standing out and being different from the very, very beginning.


-----

###### Profile Picture When it comes to your LinkedIn profile, make sure you use a profile picture. Not a selfie. Delete that picture of you with your dog. This should be a professional photograph. It is very important.
 As far as your profile picture, smiling rules. You are five times more likely to be contacted by a prospect if you are smiling in your headshot … so if you’re a smirker, or a nonsmiler, or look constipated in all your photos, it’s time to get over it and smile so you could be five times more likely to be contacted.
 Action shots where you are smiling are a bonus. Let’s say you have a great picture of you on stage, at an event, perhaps raising your hand, getting the whole audience involved—great! Or if you’re a scientist or a doctor in your white lab coat and you’re smiling—great. Either way, make sure it looks professional.
 An image or logo is effective for brand building, so if you want to add that detail to your profile picture, go for it. Just don’t use your logo as the profile picture itself.
 A great resource for hiring a professional photographer is thumbtack.com. Search for “headshot photographer,” and you’ll find a lot of great options, typically with portfolios already available. It’s an incredible way to find a pro.

 Headline Next, flesh out your headline, your description, your skills, and your endorsements.
 When it comes to your headline, you can use it for many different things:

 • to establish your authority
 • to go after your target market
 • to utilize keywords so that you’re found more often

 It does need to be 120 characters or less. Decide first what is your goal—just one. Do you want more prospects, more sales conversations, more speaking gigs, or maybe even a book deal?


-----

###### Whatever it might be, focus on just one goal you can accomplish with your LinkedIn profile.
 This will make a difference in how you write your LinkedIn profile. For example, one of my coaching clients uses LinkedIn specifically to get more industrial cleaning clients. The headline he utilizes is “Creating sparkling first impressions for patients at doctors’ offices and health-care facilities through custodial services.” Just by reading his profile you can tell who he serves and what he does for them.
 For my marketing agency I used a headline of “Creates revenue on demand through direct-response social media marketing. Digital marketing strategist, author, and speaker.”
 My headline now is, “Empowers Entrepreneurs to Lean into Their Super Powers to Scale Profitably & Create the Business & Life They Love.”
 Change your headline to reflect who you want to attract and what you can do for them.
 Add a new cover photo promoting your Juicy Carrot (as taught on page 88).
 The LinkedIn cover photo is not clickable, so make sure to include your URL in your profile bio as well.
 Write your summary in the first person so you are having a conversation with the reader, sharing why they should contact/hire you/buy from you. What difference will you create for them?
 Make them want to get to know you. Tell them why it matters. And write as though you were talking to them so they can already begin to feel like you’re developing a relationship with them. As they get to know you and your voice, you’re either going to resonate with them or not. Better that they know now so you can spend your time attracting those you were meant to serve and repel everybody else, because you don’t have time for that business.
 As a bonus, once you have written your summary, you can use it in all sorts of places like a Facebook story or the About Us on your website.
 Finally, fill in the Skills section to make you more “searchable” on LinkedIn.

 Long-Form Posts


-----

###### The next thing to do is use LinkedIn’s long-form posts to set you up as an authority. They’re SEO-optimized—meaning they’re incorporated with Google. They’re kind of like blog posts on LinkedIn.
 When you write long-form posts, you will show up more often in searches. It can also drive traffic to your site because you can include any links you want. Plus, it gives clout because it builds out your network. They can see who’s viewing it, and you can see who’s commenting on it—so you know how to connect with them later on.
 From the top of the dashboard, click “video, images, write an article,” and choose “write an article.” LinkedIn will bring you to a blank page, and you can cut and paste any blog or Word doc, or you can start from scratch by adding text, links, and images as you go. You can also add a title and video, and play around with the style of the page. It is easy to use and it creates an interactive post for your readers.


###### You can get more out of your overall content by posting it first on your website, and then a few days later sharing it on LinkedIn and
 Twitter.


###### After you post, it gives you an opportunity to share, so go ahead and share it elsewhere, bringing you even more distribution.
 You can ask your team to Like it, because that fuels the fire, giving juice to LinkedIn so they’ll share it with more people. Then tweet out a link to your article.
 Video posts also do very well on LinkedIn and should be incorporated into your overall content strategy to build engagement and drive more leads onto your list.

 GROWING YOUR NETWORK It’s “show me the money time,” aka prospecting on LinkedIn. Hopefully you have already established your one goal for using LinkedIn.
 We’ve all received those incredibly annoying contacts on LinkedIn from somebody you’ve never met or maybe who just connected with you … and


-----

###### they’re already asking you to buy something. Not cool. Nobody’s going to marry you at hello, so don’t be one of those annoying people. Don’t do it.
 Instead when prospecting, first research your target market, then establish a connection through a three-contact process, and only then ask for the appointment or opt-in or whatever your goal might be.
 A few examples … A Member of our Inner Circle Mastermind wanted more clients for her IT firm. She used LinkedIn to send out invitations to a lunch-and-learn about how to use voice-over-IP to actually make more sales by handling calls better. This topic is something her ideal clients would care about— generating three times more sales without spending a dime on advertising.
 That’s a more powerful invitation than, “Hey, do you want to have a conversation about voice-over-IP?” No one wants to have a conversation about that. But they do want more sales, so get your target market to lean in by using language that resonates with them.
 Another Inner Circle Mastermind member, Scott Whitaker, Founder of Membership Multipliers, uses LinkedIn to engage in conversations with key decision makers in order to land VIP client accounts.

 YOUR DREAM 100 On LinkedIn, focus on your Dream 100—the top 100 prospects, JV partners, media outlets, or any other dream connection you’d like to make. Spending time connecting with this group will rapidly multiply your results.
 Here’s how:

 1. Set a timer for 15 minutes and craft a list of your Dream 100. Don’t
 hold back with the dreaming … pick exactly who you want to do business with, work on a partnership with, or be featured in a media outlet. 2. Locate these individuals using LinkedIn’s search box. 3. Visit their profile and look at their recent LinkedIn activity. Did they
 post anything? Interact with a post? What insights can you get from their profile? 4. Connect with them using this message: “(name), I’ve followed your
 work with (company) for a while now and what you have been doing is incredible. I would love to learn more by connecting here.”


-----

###### 5. Once you are connected, this person can start seeing your LinkedIn
 videos, long-form posts, and updates for free. 6. Download your LinkedIn contact list and upload the contact list to
 your Facebook Ads Manager as a Custom Audience for retargeting. Only spend money on your top prospects/dream connections of all time.

 More LinkedIn connection scripts you can use:

 1. If you met at a conference, event, or in-person meeting:
 “Hi, Bob. It was great to meet you at this event. I’d love to connect with you here as well as keep in touch and discover more about your business.” 2. If you share a connection:
 “Hi, Bob. I see that you’re connected to one of my close associates. I’d love to connect with you on here in order to discover more about your business.” 3. If you read a post by this person:
 “ Hi, Bob. I came across your blog post/article (or news story you were mentioned in), and I’d love to connect with you here to find out more about your business. I was particularly interested in … “ 4. If you are members of the same LinkedIn group, association, or
 organization: “ Hi, Bob. You and I are both members of XYZ group. I’d love to connect with you here to discover more about your business.”

 If you are interested in turning connections into sales conversations, in addition to posting regularly, you can systematically prospect via LinkedIn.

 • Message One: “Hi, Bob. Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. I came
 across this article I thought you might find useful.” Then share an article with them.
 •  Message Two: One week later, research the company and find
 something current that’s interesting. “Hey, Bob. I just saw that your company achieved XYZ. Congratulations.” Then you can ask a question about it. Or “I hope you found that last article useful. We


-----

###### have a case study on the same topic I thought you might enjoy.” Or you can link to a long-form post you posted on LinkedIn.

 You’re just sharing content to begin to establish a deeper relationship. Continue on with another message each week …

 •  Message Three: It’s time to go in for the kill and share. “Hey. I’m
 Bob. I want to have a conversation with you about what I can sell you.” Just kidding, although I get these messages all the time on LinkedIn.
 •  Instead, make Message Three: “Greetings, Bob. I’d love to get to
 know you and your company better and see if it makes sense for us to work together. Please let me know if you’re open to this. In the meantime, I came across this article I thought you might be interested in.”

 Over time, you’ve established you know who they are, you know what they care about, and you’ve given value. That’s when you can ask for that sales appointment. Alternatively, if you invite them to an event from the very beginning, you can lean in quicker.
 The best way to get a response from your connection is to show up in multiple ways and not just in their inbox. Run your ads in their newsfeed on Facebook, post long-form content on LinkedIn, and use videos to build authority, which will give you a much better chance of getting a return contact.
 The best way to use LinkedIn is to schedule time to do it. Just thinking about it as a goal will not make it happen unless you do something about it.
 Schedule ten minutes a day to dive in deep, make those stronger connections, build out your network, and move your prospects along from someone who’s never had a conversation with you to someone you close as your next big sale.

 Twitter “Twitter,” you say … “Isn’t that platform dead?”
 To the contrary.


-----

###### While it never grew as much as the others, users of Twitter are highly engaged and buy things they see on the platform.
 According to Twitter’s own statistics:

 • 66% of people have discovered a new business on Twitter
 • 94% are planning to buy something from businesses they follow on
 Twitter
 • 69% of people have bought something as a result of a tweet

 So how to leverage the platform?

 1. Create two accounts. Do you have a personal account that you use
 for things other than business? If so, the first thing you need to do is create another profile that is just used for your business brand. No mixing of the accounts. 2. Link to your Juicy Carrot in your bio. Include a link in your bio to
 your Juicy Carrot and leverage hashtags in your niche. (Create your list the same way you did with Instagram. See page 105.) 3. Put a call to action in your cover photo. Hopefully you already made
 a Twitter cover photo image when you created your Facebook one, but if not, now is the time. Make sure it includes a URL to go right to your Juicy Carrot. 4. Post manually, up to six times a day. Unlike other newsfeeds, Twitter
 users welcome frequent posting. Plus, tweets do not last long, since no one is scrolling a timeline for days looking for what they missed. Make sure to use the same posting format mentioned before … create curiosity and give a link to take action while also including hashtags. 5. Find those you want to connect with. Similar to the Dream 100 on
 LinkedIn, you can follow whoever you want on Twitter and interact with them.

 Craft a list of your Dream 100 and start following, tagging, and messaging your dream tribe to get even more out of the platform. (See Figure 7.11 on page 130 for an example of an effective tweet.)

###### Scale Your Audience Quickly with Just a Little Ad Spend Want to grow your audience quickly without a big budget? This time no fairy godmother is required. You can stick your pinky toe in the water of ad spend and quickly grow your audiences. A few quick-win strategies to use:

 1.  Facebook. A little unknown targeting option on Facebook is
 “Worldwide.” If you launch a “Page Promotion” campaign targeting a worldwide audience, you can grow your audience quickly with very little ad spend (see Figure 7.12 on page 131). After a few days of going international, you can then flip over to the U.S., or other country of choice, and get local likes for pennies on the dollar.
 We’ve generated over $56,743 in sales just from a Facebook fan coming to the page, clicking on the cover photo, and becoming a customer. (Insert happy dance.)
 For a free workshop on how to get 10,000 fans and turn them into your next cash-paying customers, visit 3daysto10k.com.

**FIGURE 7.12: Facebook Page Promotion**

###### 2. Instagram. You can boost a post for just a few dollars and drive in
 hundreds of followers. Use posts that will get you the best results if you choose to use them as ads later on.
 Here’s how:
 • First, hit “Promote” under your post of choice (see Figure 7.13
 on page 132).
 • Second, choose “Profile” as the thing to promote (see Figure
 7.14 on page 133).
 • Then pick who you want to promote to (see Figure 7.15 on page
 134).
 • Then, pick your budget (see Figure 7.16 on page 135).

##### CHAPTER 8

### Scaling Results with

## Paid Ads

###### by Kelly LeMay


#### Side Note from Kim

###### A chapter by someone else on Facebook ads?
 You betcha. Kelly has been my behind-the-scenes magic maker for over 14 years. She has been with me since Facebook started offering ads, taught herself how to do them, and eventually ran the agency and client ad accounts. Since we sold, she manages our Facebook ads and teaches our coaching clients how to do theirs. There is no one better in our industry to learn from than this creative Facebook ninja.


###### Back when Kim owned the agency, I was doing work for a local family attraction. Our graphic designer created several beautiful Facebook BOGO ads and, in an epic blonde moment, I mistakenly used just their logo. Typically we don’t recommend this (especially if it is sized wrong and cuts off half the image, like this one did). I didn’t realize the mistake I had made


-----

###### until checking the ad the next day… when I saw that the logo was the best performing ad they had.
 Long story short, I like to operate under the assumption that I have no clue what is going to grab an audience’s attention. We’ve done years of testing and tweaking Facebook ads, and I’m going to share with you all the insider secrets.

 Writing Ad Copy I like testing at least two different types of copy—one short, one long. The best part is that I’m never starting from scratch; I’m always using one of my trusty templates, which saves me a ton of time.
 First, we’ll test a short version that follows this simple three-line template:

 1. Pose a question to your target market:
 Want to uncover a new way to get as many clients as you want quickly and easily for your coaching, consulting, or services business?

 2. Offer a solution:

 See Figures 8.1 on page 141 and 8.2 on page 142 for examples.

**FIGURE 8.1: Example of a Short-Copy Ad Using the 3-Line Template**


-----

###### Next, we’ll test a long storytelling version of the copy following this template:
 Tell a story of struggle:

 “Will this ever get easier?”

 I was ten years into running my firm and things still seemed really hard. Every client we had came from me going and getting them.


-----

###### Usually from attending a painful networking event with those annoying nametag stickers that always got caught in my long hair.

**FIGURE 8.2: Example of a Short-Copy Ad Using the 3-Line Template**


-----

###### Share what your hopes were (your prospect’s pain points):

 What I needed was a way to generate clients on auto-pilot … to quickly and easily fill my sales pipeline with qualified leads who


-----

###### were ready to pull the trigger. (And I’m not going to lie, I also wanted them to have the budget to pay me more than the clients I currently had on the roster.)

 The “pinnacle moment” everything changed:

 I remember the first time I got an incoming message that changed everything.

 It was from Steve, and he messaged me … “We’ve never met, but I see you as an expert, and I’d like to hire you to do consulting work for my firm.”

 (Happy dance! )

 This new way of getting clients was working. And it kept working. And working. And … well, you get the idea.

 Share your results:

 Through this new system I was able to grow our firm to 7+ figures
 work with some amazing clients, including several celebrities, and eventually sell our firm for a really good exit. Taking my team of 17 on a cruise to celebrate was incredible.

 Call to action:

 It all started with a new way of doing things … I put together a free course for you to show you exactly what to do to get more clients right now. Imagine … getting new clients quickly and easily, over and over again … That’s exactly what you will discover when we get together on the webcast.

###### You’ll notice both versions include a few different emojis to draw the eye in and keep the reader engaged. These are a few of my favorites:

 (I never thought I’d be well into my thirties with a “List of Favorite Emojis” … but here I am ) See Figure 8.3 for an example.

**FIGURE 8.3: Example of Longer, Story-Telling Copy Template**

###### Imagery


-----

###### For Powerful Professionals, we know that lifestyle photos and photos of Kim perform best. But it took some testing for us to arrive at that conclusion. We tested all kinds of images—stock photos, illustrations, real- life photos—and I suggest you do the same. Bonus points if you find an image that has a pop of red because that always draws the eye in. Here are some ideas:

 1. Lifestyle:

 • Working from home/beach/other relaxing location
 • Enjoying time with kids/grandkids
 • Celebrity/luxury life
 • Vacationing with your family

 2. Saving Money or Making Money:

 • Money falling from the sky
 • Stacks of money

 3. Celebrity/Guru:

 • Photo of yourself—city background

 Types of Ads to Run DRIVE TRAFFIC TO BLOG CONTENT Kim has a huge audience of people who already know, like, and trust her. But in order to steadily grow that audience, we needed to continue to add new people into our funnel. Asking someone to opt-in to your Juicy Carrot is kind of like asking someone on a date. You wouldn’t walk up to a stranger and say, “Let me take you to dinner Friday.”
 Most people would find that creepy. The same goes with online advertising. So, driving traffic to a blog is a great way to warm up an audience and build a relationship before you ask them to opt-in for something.
 In some instances, we’ve seen our opt-in cost drop by 25% when using this strategy.


-----

###### Bonus Tip: Have an opportunity for someone to opt-in to your Juicy Carrot through a sidebar on your blog (see Figure 8.4).

**FIGURE 8.4: Example of a Juicy Carrot Opt-In a Blog Sidebar**

###### RETARGET You know when you are shopping online for a nice pair of summer flip- flops and then you start seeing ads in your Facebook newsfeed for flip- flops? That’s retargeting, and it’s all done through the magic of the pixel.
 After driving traffic to your blog, you can retarget visitors with an opt- in. For example, we send people to a blog titled “How to Quickly Grow Your Audience & Sales … in Just Four Steps.” Once someone lands on that article they will begin seeing ads for our 10,000 Fans webinar. This is a great way to build trust with your audience before asking them to take action.
 To do this, you’ll need to create a Web Audience. For instructions, visit: www.powerfulprofessionals.com/webaudience.

 VIDEO ADS


-----

###### This is an amazing low-cost way to reach your audience. We love using video ads to target a specific audience. For example, someone registers for a future webinar. You can keep them engaged by creating a quick video with some tools, hacks, or other valuable content to share before the webinar. If you already held your webinar, create a video for the nonbuyers and target them for seven days after your webinar to help push the “on the fencers” to purchase.

 DIRECT TO OPT-IN If you’re running Facebook ads that ask someone to take action (register for an event, opt-in, purchase something), the Facebook pixel will allow you to track exactly how many people clicked on your ad and took that action. Having this data allows you to experiment with your ad imagery, ad copy, and audiences to see what performs the best. Data is power!
 Not only that, but just like a good pan in cooking, your Facebook pixel becomes “seasoned” over time. Also, as you get more opt-ins or registrants, the pixel learns more information about the type of person you are trying to reach and will start focusing your ads to those people. Pretty smart!

 Ad Placement When you advertise on Facebook you can also launch your ads to Instagram (even if you aren’t on Instagram). It’s a beautiful thing—two birds, one stone. Facebook also allows you to break out performance based on placement so you can see how each performs differently.
 For the most part, you can set up your Instagram ads the same as Facebook. Just know that any links in your ad copy won’t be clickable (though the ad image is still clickable).
 With the focus of Instagram being visual, it’s important to use high- quality, vibrant images so your ads will stand out. See Figure 8.5 for an example of an Instagram ad.

###### The True Key to Success The tips I’ve shared are strategies we’ve learned over the span of years, running thousands of ads. But do you want to know the real secret to success?
 Just get started. That’s it. When we were first started running Facebook ads, we weren’t doing it right. Definitely not.
 Did we see success? Yes. Did we fall flat on our faces? Yes.

##### CHAPTER 9

### From LinkedIn

## to Sale


#### Side Note from Kim

###### “I’d like to buy your company.”
 He spoke these words as we swiftly walked to dinner with the rest of the attendees at this top affiliate mastermind.
 Josh Turner was expressing his interest in purchasing my firm after hearing earlier in the day that I was considering selling. While this should have made me nervous, it didn’t. Something just felt right from the moment he suggested it.
 Our companies were so similar. His for LinkedIn and mine for Facebook.
 Our philosophies on caring for our people and clients aligned. Our vision for work/life balance mirrored each other.
 He was ready to move, and so was I. And three months after that conversation, he would own the agency I spent 18 years running.
 We’ve stayed aligned since the sale, and I’ve continued to be impressed by their work and client service. The results they bring their accounts are unparalleled. It is because of this that I asked Josh

#### How to Book High-End Sales Appointments from
 Social Media

###### by Josh Turner What if I told you that any business could fail overnight? Even a business that sees an annual revenue in eight or nine figures and seems to have everything figured out is at risk if it doesn’t have one seemingly simple thing: a reliable way to bring in new customers.
 Now that may seem obvious. But far too many small-business owners are put in a tough spot.
 You need to maintain what you’ve got, but if you aren’t focusing on how to consistently generate new sales opportunities, who else will? It’s your number-one priority, pure and simple.
 The first time that I learned this lesson, I was just 21 years old. I was working for my dad’s remodeling business on the side between college classes. I thought we were doing great. From outward appearances, things were thriving. He was always busy working. I had plans to join him full time after college. But behind the scenes, being busy wasn’t the same thing as having a consistent pipeline of opportunities. And when things turned south, there were no leads to call upon. Dad had to shut the doors. I was shaken. I didn’t think this was ever a possibility.
 The second time I learned it was a couple years later after I landed a new job at BOA Construction. I was in charge of the finance department, among other things. The good news was that, in just a few short years, we went from $5 million to over $23 million in annual revenue! But the reality was that we were living paycheck to paycheck.
 When times were good, we had a lot of work, but our sales team was more focused on working with current clients or asking for referrals (which are no doubt critical, but they can’t be your only focus).
 So, in 2008, when the market got more competitive, our sales team couldn’t find any new business because consistent prospecting and


-----

###### appointment setting hadn’t been prioritized. The work dried up. One day, we realized we couldn’t afford to keep the lights on anymore. Finally, in 2009, the company was forced to shut its doors.
 Both companies failed because they weren’t able to generate enough new business. We provided great services and our clients loved us … but alone that’s not enough.
 It was one of the lowest moments of my life. I felt like a total failure. The business I was so proud to have been a part of … it was simply gone. I was like so many other people, cast aside by the corporate world and out on my own.
 I had seen enough by this point, so when I started my own business in early 2010, I decided I was definitely not going to fall into that trap ever again. So, with my finance background and a LinkedIn network of about 500 contacts, I decided to call myself an “outsourced CFO.” I created a terrible-looking website and had some business cards made at Kinko’s. They were terrible too. But I was in the game.
 It wasn’t so easy. I started riding what I call the “cash-flow roller coaster.” Things would be great for a month or so, and I was extremely busy—spending most of my time working hard for my clients, not looking for new ones. Before I knew it, things started slowing down, and because I wasn’t keeping the pipeline full, I was suddenly out of work. I had fallen into the same trap after all …
 That’s when I set out to discover how to truly generate a consistent flow of opportunities and leads so that I could protect myself from the cash-flow roller coaster. Not only that, but I also set out to discover how I could grow my business without having to work all the time once I got my client- generating machine rolling.
 I realized something critical and so simple that I had originally dismissed it as too “old school” because none of the marketing thought leaders were saying anything about it. At the end of the day, I found the only way to get more clients was to get in front of more prospects and schedule more appointments, consultations, strategy sessions, and sales calls. I wrote a very simple math formula (remember my finance background :-)) on a Post-It note at my desk: More appointments = More sales.


-----

###### In order to do that, I had to question my approach and what I had been doing. I simplified my marketing drastically and put all my efforts behind tasks that directly resulted in appointments. What I found was that I could use social media in a very systematic way to find my ideal clients (the exact market for my services), book appointments (creating consistent new sales opportunities), and grow my business to over seven figures. Today, I help businesses all over the world do the exact same thing.
 My company, LinkedSelling, recently conducted a study of over 1,300 business owners. And through it we uncovered some troubling data. Most notably, 88% of business owners struggle to maintain consistent cash flow. Only 12% said that they do not have cash-flow problems. That’s not just crazy, it’s downright unacceptable.
 A lot of online strategies, including those in this book, are geared toward internet marketers who sell online training courses, but there are so many more businesses out there who are desperate to get appointments with high-quality prospects. If you sell a high-end service or product via appointment, this chapter will teach you the myths to avoid (that most businesses learn the hard way), as well as the exact outreach and lead generation strategies I use on Facebook and LinkedIn to get hundreds of quality appointments for my sales staff.
 So if you are interested in learning exactly what I did to get off the cash- flow roller coaster and grow my business to almost eight-figures in just a few years using a combination of paid and unpaid tactics, keep reading.

 Social Media Myths: Can I Really Get Sales Appointments via Social
 Media? When I started LinkedSelling, I turned to social media and soon learned why people don’t have success. All too often, myths about social media keep businesses from using it to book appointments with new leads. As a result, of course, they end up losing opportunities to close more clients. I don’t want that to happen to you.

 MYTH #1: MY PROSPECTS AREN’T ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR DON’T ACTIVELY
 USE THE PLATFORMS The myth is based around this type of thinking:


-----

###### • “This won’t work because I’m B2B …”
 • “I work with C-level executives; they don’t spend time on social media
 …”
 • “I don’t think my business is ‘exciting enough’ to capture attention on
 social media …”
 • “I’m not selling a book or online course, and my fees are too high for
 social media to work …”

 Anything above sound like you? If so, you need to keep reading more than you could ever know.
 If you only think of Facebook as a place to post cat memes and Sunday brunch pictures, you probably won’t get great results booking appointments. However, if you understand the psychology of Facebook users as opposed to LinkedIn, for example, you can position your outreach and your ads to attract ideal prospects, taking into account the mindset they’re in when they’re on these platforms.
 The truth is, if your ideal client is on social media (and they are), you can and should use it for nurturing prospects and booking sales appointments. It all depends on your approach. Even more traditional businesses like professional service providers, consultants, IT companies, marketing agencies, and more can use social media to get high-end prospects to booked sales appointments.
 “But Josh, I target C-suite execs and successful business owners, and they don’t use social media like the rest of us.”
 How can you know where your audience is? Consider this: Over 1.56B users log on to Facebook every day, spending an average of 43 minutes on the platform. On LinkedIn, over 40% of their 640M users log in daily.
 Combined, that’s 1.81B users logging in every single day. So, if you’re wondering whether you can find your audience on social media, if they use the internet, there is a high chance they’re on either Facebook or LinkedIn.
 Now, if you’re a B2B business specifically, you’re probably already comfortable with the idea of LinkedIn, but maybe you’re concerned about whether or not you can get appointments from other businesses on Facebook. Let me set your mind at ease and tell you that decision-makers exist on Facebook as well. In fact, Facebook has found decision-makers are


-----

###### 2.2X more likely to be daily users than nondecision-makers. And there are over 70 million businesses on Facebook.
 So, to discount either LinkedIn or Facebook entirely would be a massive mistake and result in opportunities left on the table.
 This leads into the second myth …

 MYTH #2: LEADS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA ARE NEVER QUALIFIED I’ve spoken to a lot of people who say something like: “This won’t work because the lead quality is no good …” This is very common when people think of social media, because again, they think of things like pictures of people’s kids, travel photos, food photos, and self-help quotes. And yet, as a lead generation company, we wouldn’t have been able to deliver any type of direct, measurable ROI if the leads we delivered weren’t good. It’s all in your strategy and approach.
 A common phrase I hear from business owners at events, masterminds, and online is, “This won’t work for me because I’m not selling a product. I sell a high-ticket service, and my audience doesn’t buy just because they saw an ad online or a message in their inbox.” While it’s true that many use Facebook to sell ecommerce products—physical or low-priced digital products—again, it’s a myth that you can’t sell high-end services on Facebook. We’ve proved that it works on both Facebook and LinkedIn … but that’s because the system we use is different than the spray-and-pray approach or direct-to-offer ads that most people try.

 MYTH #3: LEAD GENERATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS TOO EXPENSIVE The third myth we hear all the time is: “Why do I hear about people who aren’t getting great results on Facebook and LinkedIn?”
 It’s easy to find the people who complain about using social media for business appointments. Here’s my advice: Disregard what they’re saying. While they’re complaining about social media because they haven’t gotten results, we’re getting leads and booking appointments. I think we’re doing something right.
 Don’t feel bad though if you’ve been thinking this; you’re not alone. Let’s take Facebook as an example. According to the Content Marketing Institute, a global content marketing education and training organization,


-----

###### only 38% of B2B marketers surveyed say Facebook is effective for B2B marketing. But why?
 The answer to that is simple—too often the Facebook services that people buy from a typical “Facebook ads” agency are not actually designed to get results for businesses with high-ticket offers. Or at least not the types of results that matter to you and your bottom line. Remember, comments and likes don’t pay the bills. Most are trying strategies that were doomed from the start.
 Another reason is that people complicate the entire process, believing they need complex funnels and long online pipelines before asking for an appointment. This only results in confusion for you and, ultimately, your prospects.
 Through the work we do with our clients, we’ve proved that it’s not only possible to toss these myths to the side, but to overcome them using the same strategies I used to get appointments and grow my business, and the same strategies we now use for our clients.

 The Process for Generating a Flood of New Leads It all starts with knowing your prospect inside and out and getting their attention at the top of the funnel. Utilizing LinkedIn, Facebook, or any other platform you’ve identified and confirmed as places your target market can be found, you can quickly identify thousands of prospects that fit your prospect profile, then update your social profiles and your messaging to attract them. I’ll tell you how you can do exactly that in just a minute.
 From there, the key is to systematically reach out to these highly targeted prospects in a nonsalesy manner to first get them to agree to be in your network and then to agree to start a conversation through your nurture messaging.
 When you reach out to prospects and leverage common contacts, many of these business leaders will be open to connecting with you. (Yes, there is an art and science to doing this the right way, and we’ll talk about that further below.)
 Next may be the most important factor to remember: Once you’re connected to a new prospect, do not start pitching. That’s the best way to spoil the relationship. Instead, you want to design and execute a campaign that stays in front of them on a regular basis.


-----

###### This will position you and your business as a trusted advisor and as a resource to your prime prospects. Remember, your goal with this campaign is to stay in front of them and should include three primary components:

 1. TOP OF MIND CAMPAIGN VIA STATUS UPDATES By keeping your name and message in front of prospects, you’ll be the one they think of when they are in the market for your services. With the decline of traditional interruption marketing tactics, social media status updates have become one of the most powerful mechanisms for achieving a top of mind drip campaign. While this works on several social media platforms, it is especially true on LinkedIn, where it’s not as saturated as Facebook’s organic reach.

 2. PERSONAL MESSAGING CAMPAIGN (POSITION YOURSELF AS A TRUSTED
 RESOURCE) This step is why your competitors have no clue that these strategies even exist; it works behind the scenes. Believe it or not, you can connect with thousands of new prospects over time. This keeps you top of mind. But the real action is the systematic messaging campaign you can use to keep in touch and make sure they know who to turn to when they need your services. It works because it positions you and your business as a trusted resource.
 What happens is, over a short time frame, you’ll send a number of personal one-on-one messages to your most important prospects. For a while, these messages will contain nothing but valuable content. Case studies, articles, conversation. Your prospects will appreciate it and love the content.

 3. ZERO MOMENT OF TRUTH (STRATEGY FOR GOING FOR THE PHONE CALL) Once you get them to the point where they “know, like, and trust” you, that’s when you want to go for the phone call. It’s the transition point—and it’s here that a lot of people have problems. However, if you’ve sent your outreach messages and proved enough value, it’s likely that you’ll get a very high response rate. In fact, at this point, your prospects can hardly say no. On average our clients see 21 to 30% of total prospects agree to a phone call as a result.


-----

###### Be aware that at this stage, some of these prospects may be in the market for your services today. Those are certainly ideal situations. Others might not be ready right away, but now you’re miles ahead of the competition. You’ve built rapport. When the time comes, you’re in. Now you can work them through your typical funnel with email follow-ups, invitations to grab a coffee or a round of golf, whatever your typical sales process consists of. Don’t forget that on top of that, you’ll continue to run your top of mind campaign.
 What it boils down to is this: Some will become clients quickly. Others will require more time. Either way, both scenarios are covered and have positioned you as the leader in the clubhouse to win their business.

 This is the step-by-step playbook we use and adapt for our client campaigns that allows us to hand-deliver quality appointments from social media contacts consistently.

 When You’re Ready to Scale: Paid Strategies for Getting Appointments
 from Facebook and LinkedIn My company is known best for its ability to deliver outbound organic leads. This is perfect for businesses that need to get in front of very targeted, hard- to-reach prospects and that sell highend contracts or offers. These types of businesses use our organic outreach strategies to dramatically grow their businesses, even with just a few clients every single month.
 However, if you’re in a position where you’re ready to scale your efforts and you want to get in touch with hundreds or thousands of leads every month, we have refined an approach to paid ads that makes it possible to book a large volume of quality appointments each month.
 The truth is every business has growing pains. Amazon, Apple, and Facebook didn’t get to where they are today without facing adversity. Or without having to break through plateaus.
 But they aren’t the only ones. Companies of all sizes hit points where their growth is threatened.


-----

###### The companies we work closely with that accelerate past these points of stagnation have a documented process they follow to move past their obstacles.
 Here is what you need to do to break through if sales have begun to plateau.
 You need a process that generates a large volume of more at-bats, that does not rely solely on referrals, word of mouth, events, etc. Something that delivers appointments to your sales team day in and day out.
 What we have found that generates the most bang for your buck is not creating complex funnels and client journeys but to simplify as much as possible so you do not lose your prospects along the way.
 This doesn’t just apply to B2B businesses that sell high-ticket or enterprise services. These strategies have worked with every type of business from martial arts studios, gyms, health centers, insurance companies, bathtub refinishing companies, and many more!

 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PAID ADS ON FACEBOOK VS. LINKEDIN Finally, before I share with you the paid strategies we use, I want to address a very common question we get about using paid ads on Facebook and LinkedIn:
 Which is better for my business? At LinkedSelling, we use both Facebook and LinkedIn ads because we know how to find our audience on both platforms, and we know how to cater our messaging to each platform for best results.
 However, there are a few key differences you should be aware of. The main one you should know is that Facebook generally delivers a lower cost per lead. This attracts a lot of business owners and marketers because they obviously are chasing the biggest ROI and reducing the cost per lead plays a big part. However, the benefit of LinkedIn ads is that even though the cost per lead is generally more expensive, for most of the businesses we work with, the quality of leads is significantly greater.
 This means that on Facebook you might pay less per lead, but you will typically need more leads in order to find your ideal prospect. On LinkedIn, it’s easier to book appointments with the exact type of prospect that you’re looking for, and in general, more of your leads will be a better match for your business.


-----

###### The Three Types of Funnels We Use Now that you know the main differences, here are the three types of funnels we use to book appointments with cold traffic:

 1. The DTA Funnel
 This stands for the Direct-to-Appointment Funnel Campaign and only includes three steps. It’s easy to get excited about complex “funnel hacker” style funnels, but for most businesses that stuff is overkill. Leveraging LinkedIn’s insane targeting capabilities can get you right to the point so you can ask qualified prospects to raise their hand to let you know they are interested.
 There’s nuance here. If done correctly, this is the quickest way to get hot leads … but done poorly, it can completely turn off your prospect before they even consider taking action.
 Focus on just three simple steps:

 • LinkedIn Ad that directly calls out your prospect—be relevant.
 • Pre-populated native LinkedIn Lead form—be convenient.
 • Appointment bookings and follow-up—be proactive.

 Simple by design, this avoids wasted time, and it just flat-out works. LinkedIn is a different animal than Facebook. Your prospects are on there every day with business on their mind. We book hundreds of sales appointments from this, month after month, with fairly minimal edits needed.
 A few things to consider:
 • Video is better than a still photo. We found that using video for
 the sponsored post, whether that’s a talking head video or an explainer video, far outperforms still photos because, let’s be honest, a direct-to-appointment ad is a very, very big ask. This funnel may be simple, but standard marketing principles still apply; you have to dig into your prospect’s pain to get them to take action. Video provides a better opportunity to do this.
 • Ad copy and positioning. The copy is really framed like this: Do
 you fit this profile? Do you have this problem? If so, click here to figure out how to solve that problem.
 That’s it.


-----

###### Always call out exactly who you’re targeting, as we’ve found that gets much better results and makes it feel like the ad was written directly for them.
 •  Pre-populated Lead Forms on LinkedIn. The benefit is that it
 makes it that much easier for your prospect to book a call with you. They don’t need to fill out anything when you use a pre- populated lead form that automatically pulls their information from LinkedIn—including phone number, email, and more. You can even ask a custom question. Doing this, they only need to click two buttons. They don’t have to spend a bunch of time answering tons of questions and typing. Instead they just click two buttons and they’re in.
 As you can see, the DTA requires no external landing pages and no 27-part funnels. That’s just not needed. Remember, if someone gets to this stage and wants to opt in, it means there’s a very high probability that they fit that profile and are a solid lead.

 2. The RTA Funnel
 The RTA Funnel is the Report-to-Appointment Funnel. Again, keep things simple with only two real steps: Download Report AND Book an Appointment. By “report,” I mean any lead magnet. We’ve found that the “report” terminology appeals to a higher-level prospect, as they are looking for a winning playbook but are not necessarily planning on doing it themselves.
 Here are the steps:

 • LinkedIn Ad that calls your prospect out directly—be relevant
 • Pre-Populated LinkedIn Lead or Facebook Lead Form—be
 convenient
 • Appointment bookings and follow-up—be proactive
 • On the thank-you page, offer them the opportunity to book an
 appointment

 Here are a few tips:


-----

###### • Quickly provide an opportunity to book a call: There’s no reason
 why we should delay what we want. We want to get to that phone call. There is no reason to wait before you offer this. You have to capitalize on the momentum gained from them opting in for your content. This moment is the only opportunity when you are guaranteed to have that prospect’s attention again, so don’t waste it.
 •  Make sure the report solves a very specific problem for your
 targeted prospect: They’ll click on your ad if they are moved to find the answer to an urgent problem. Everyone and every business has pain, and your report needs to acknowledge that pain while showing them what the solution looks like. Stay focused on your prospect. No one wants a report about how great your product or service is. So, make the report about their pain and not about how great you are.
 •  Offer to book an appointment on the Thank-You page. Again,
 this is worth repeating. There is no reason to wait before you offer to book an appointment. Keep it simple, and give them every opportunity to get on your calendar.

 3. The WTA Funnel
 The WTA funnel, or Webinar-to-Appointment Funnel, is a strategy that we frequently use internally at LinkedSelling. Webinars are nothing new. If you are reading this book, chances are that you’ve attended at least one. Traditionally, webinars are used to sell low-cost products and online courses, but they are one of the best tools for establishing yourself as a thought leader, educating your prospects on how you can help, and then scheduling sales appointments or strategy sessions directly from the webinar.
 Here’s how the WTA Funnel works:

 • Your prospect sees an ad for a webinar on LinkedIn or Facebook
 (in our case, it’s most often both).
 • They click the ad and are taken to the webinar registration page
 that clearly states what you solve and who you solve it for.
 • On average you can expect 35 to 45% to attend the webinar.


-----

###### • At the height of the webinar, after you’ve provided value and
 they are the most engaged, offer strategy sessions or consultations to walk them through what your solution looks like for their business.
 • Frequent follow-up to all registrants, who did not schedule time
 to speak, through email, text messaging, and calling.

 The goal of this presentation is to really attack your prospect’s pain points while showing them what the path to success looks like. Give them just enough to understand what needs to happen for things to get better. And then offer the call to talk about customizing that plan and how you can help them get to that place even quicker.
 This is an amazing way to turn a complete stranger into a raving fan … into an interested prospect … into a paying client in under an hour.

 These are the three types of funnels we use on both LinkedIn and Facebook, adapting each to the audience and platform as necessary. They simplify most people’s marketing campaigns dramatically and focus on the absolute most important part of lead generation—getting leads to book appointments.

### The Magical World

## of Email

#### The Monetizing Magic, Crafting Effective Emails

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips Let’s start with a little quiz …
 Are you a great friend or an annoying cousin? As in… oh geez, there’s that (insert name of your annoying third cousin). He’s the one who hasn’t seen you in years, but within minutes of being in the same room is pitching you on joining some pyramid scheme, or trying to sell you a timeshare, or hinting that he needs a job and you seem like the perfect employer.
 Or are you that great friend who stays in touch with your bestie? The one who keeps in contact just because you care, who shares things that surprise and delight on a regular basis, who is funny and entertaining … always good for a laugh or a shoulder to cry on … sometimes in the same phone call.
 What type of emailer are you? If you’ve got an email list of ten or more people, it is time to stop being Captain Stinky Cousin Pants and become a great friend to your list. By staying in regular communication when you aren’t promoting something or asking for a sale, your list will be ready and waiting when you do want them to take action.


-----

###### Too many businesses just let those leads sit there. You’ve got to stay in touch to get the most from all you do in social media channels.
 I’ve been emailing my list regularly for years now. They know I care. They know I give value, and they know that when I do sell something, it is going to only be something I have already vetted.
 And I love staying in touch with them. But how often should you email? I am a proponent of daily emailing … that’s right, daily. Just like a daily check-in with a friend, a daily email helps nurture a relationship.
 I know it can seem overwhelming, but once you get into a rhythm of sending a daily email, it becomes second nature. You start looking for things in your life to email about.
 When we aren’t in the throes of promotion, I follow this format, then flip over to more promotion during a launch, and then go back to the daily conversation emails right afterward.
 Here’s the format I like to follow:

 1. Subject line that creates curiosity 2. Personalized greeting 3. Tell a story of something that happened 4. Tie it into a business lesson 5. Mention how it relates to a product, program, or service you offer, or
 an upcoming event. 6. P.S. to one of your programs or events or a regular P.S. with several
 options that you use each time.

 On the following pages I’ve included a sample of my last few emails so you can get a sense of the flow of the daily post. They aren’t long, but they keep in touch and share little moments of my life along with things my audience will value.
 If daily seems overwhelming, start three times a week, and if that’s too much, once a week works. Staying consistent is necessary when building a good relationship with your list, just like building a good friendship. (No flakey friends allowed.)
 Check out these emails, and then try crafting your own.

###### Email 1

 Subject: What’s your room number?

 Hey there, NAME,

 Happy Friday!

 This week I’m off-site at a conference (more on that tomorrow) with our Director of Membership, DeeAnn. Funny story from when we first arrived …

 There are thousands at this conference and before we started, each lunch spot was filled with a long line. We decided to skip lunch and stop by the gift shop and pick up some snacks to tide us over (nuts and Korean BBQ Jerky work great as a lunch fill-in, and mints because you are going to need them after this snack).

 So there we were at the checkout, and as I went to pay for our purchase, the woman behind the register sighed when I said, “I want to charge it to my room.” She then moved to the other side of the register and yelled from a good 20 feet away, “What’s your room number?”

 I paused, looking at the long line waiting behind me, and then I told her.

 She asked me to repeat it again …

 I took a deep breath.

 I could have gotten irritated. I could have told her that type of personal information yelled across a crowded store was a serious customer service faux pas and a violation of my privacy.

 But I didn’t. I simply told her yet again and made a joke by saying, “And my cell phone number is …” And I laughed a bit.

 Right at that moment, someone in the line yelled to me, “Hey, I am in your program! Thank you for getting me 10,000 fans!”


-----

###### Others around her started asking what she meant, so she started explaining our program as an ambassador of sorts. Others in line started to sign up for our weekly free training at 3daysto10k.com.

 So instead of freaking out and making a scene, I got a few new followers and made one of our members feel great about her decision to be a part of our tribe.

 See, the thing is, you’ve always got to act the way you’d want everyone to see you, because you never know who is there and who is watching. And it’s easy when you are always your authentic self.

 Be you. Be kind. And grow your audience.

 More on why I’m here tomorrow …

 Subject: Gift Inside, NAME

 Hey there, NAME,

 Tomorrow I am headed to San Diego as a featured speaker at Traffic and Conversion, sharing the stage with little guys like Sir Richard Branson, Rachel Hollis, and Ryan Deiss.

 But this past week I wasn’t speaking, or coaching, or performing … I was absorbing, learning, and listening … sharpening my tools, and working on my craft.

 I believe to continue to grow, you’ve got to keep both ears open and see the success path that other brilliant souls have laid out before you.

 Being present without “this is why this won’t work for me” or “nope, done that before” thinking, I’ve had a light bulb moment … Will share details soon. (It is pretty freaking exciting and all about you achieving your dreams.)

 You know, sometimes the answer is there all along. You just have to give your brain the occasional moment of stillness to hear it. One of my keys to success in making this happen is attending events filled with people I want to surround myself with.

 Email 3

 Subject: About that subject line …

 Funny story, NAME,

 Friday I sent out an email telling the story of a comical interaction with the clerk as I traveled in Nashville.

 The subject line was … “What’s your room number?”

 It drove in a lot of responses. Yet it wasn’t quite what I expected.

 You see, many didn’t even open up the email; they just skimmed quickly and sent me their phone number. One after another, after another. Some sent me their room number as well …

 Customer service folks chuckled …

 And then I sent my Combat Marine Veteran husband to their homes to set them straight. (Just kidding.)

 But I was reminded about the power of a clear call to action and a good subject line. You see, you can have the best email in the world, but if no


-----

###### one opens it, if no one reads it, if they don’t engage … it won’t get read. And they won’t take action.

 So where to get started?

 Clear over clever.

 Start by trying to just be clear, even testing putting your actual call to action in the subject line. And then test some more. Give value and grow your business.

 And probably don’t ask for someone’s number in your subject line … just sayin’.

 Subject: He was cursing like a drunken sailor

 Hey there, NAME,

 Saturday I was at an event and the speaker Garrett White came out swinging, using a lot of profanity to the group. I was a bit shocked. (Which is what I am certain he was going for.)

 He was brash and aggressive. Not my thing, per se, but I wanted to see what he had up his sleeve …

 In a matter of one hour, he took the crowd from high-energy aggression to hugging and crying … letting their guard down so they could break their limiting beliefs.


-----

###### Did he have to start crassly to get them there?

 While there are, of course, other methods of doing it, I am certain that if he had started by pushing for tears and hugs at the beginning, this alpha crowd wouldn’t have responded well.

 What he did was first come to them where they were comfortable and could trust him, and then he asked them to get uncomfortable to go beyond their “norm.”

 Now, as a master trainer, he could do this in an hour’s time.

 And not to brag, but I, too, can take my audience from laughing to going deeper as they recognize their “why” and realize the only thing standing in their way is their willingness to take action.

 Yet not all speakers get this right …

 There were several at the conference who went out of order, trying to go too deep too fast, and others who shared too much of their story and didn’t relate it back to the audience. As an audience member, that feels uncomfortable for us and the speaker.

 So how do you do things in the “right” order?

 I’m working on a brand-new live workshop to share the “behind the scenes” of my million-dollar webinar. Stay tuned for details on this in a few weeks.

 Can’t wait!

 Cheers,

###### Subject: What happened when I spilled my entire drink in his lap

 Hey, NAME,

 On Sunday I was flying for work and unlike most first-class evening flights, I didn’t partake in my favorite cocktail. (Vodka and Fresca. Don’t judge it until you try it.)

 I had a long night ahead with two events to attend after landing, so I stuck to a glass of seltzer and a cup of hot water to which I added in my favorite tea … “Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice.”

 So there I was sipping away, working on my next book. As I went to plug my phone into the headrest in front of me, my computer flipped and hit my glass of seltzer and soaked the man sitting next to me, and (worse?) woke him up from his nap.

 While I did all that I could—jumping up, getting the flight attendants to help me clean up the mess—there wasn’t really a way to get him dry without sticking his pants out the plane window … and I didn’t think that was worth suggesting.

 Thankfully, he was really kind about the whole thing and didn’t suggest that I find a seat on the wing.

 Yet it was my fault. I had too much going on and didn’t keep my eye on the danger zone of the potential for an accident to occur. And while this time it was just seltzer, other times in my business it was something else.

 Back when I sold my agency last year, we were busy transitioning the company. Cash flow was strong, and I took my eye off the ball. Because of a small tech glitch, most of our members weren’t charged for an entire month. That meant we lost tens of thousands of dollars.

 Seriously. Tens of thousands.


-----

###### Of course we learned from that and now have systems in place, ensuring our operations run smoothly, including payments. But keeping my eye on the most important things is always a challenge. Because they are not usually the most fun.

 However, I can either wish for accidents to never happen again, or I can do everything in my power to ensure they won’t.

 I choose action and accountability, for that is the only way to ensure lasting change. The same goes for our tribe of Powerful Professionals who do the same with our weekly Made to Thrive Mondays challenge …

 What do you choose today?

 Cheers,

 A Quick Sales Surge Email She wrote one email, took her dog for a walk, and returned to thousands in sales. Did she write a 3,000-word email that took her days? Nope.
 Did she promise to give all of her delicious product away? Uh-uh. What she sent out is what we call “The Credit Email.” Instead of offering a special or discount, you give your customers or clients a credit to use on your products, programs, or services. It works so well because instead of just another promotion cluttering up the inbox, it is perceived as having value and it drives people to action.
 Jenni-Lyn Williams, founder of Snarky Tea, used the Credit Email template after we suggested it on a VIP private consulting day, and she sent it to everyone who had previously made a purchase, giving them a credit to use on another purchase.


-----

###### She then did one follow-up email reminding them of their credit (see Figure 10.1).

**FIGURE 10.1: Snarky Tea Credit Reminder Email**

###### This one campaign produced thousands in sales. Here’s another one, used by a private coaching client, Kinetics Cosmetics (see Figure 10.2):

**FIGURE 10.2: Kinetics Cosmetics Reminder Email**


-----

###### This also works for online courses, giving a credit to use on future purchases; or for professional services, giving a credit to use toward a consulting package, onboarding, or the first month of an ongoing package.
 When I had the agency, we used it to convert our one-time project clients into ongoing accounts.
 Here’s how it works.

 • Get the reader’s attention, mentioning the credit in the subject line.
 • Tell them why they are getting the credit.
 • Explain what they can use the credit for.


-----

###### • Give a deadline to use the credit.

 Here’s an example (see Figure 10.3):

**FIGURE 10.3: Kim’s Credit Email**

###### I recently shared this strategy on a Powerful Professional Business Coaching Masterclass, and one of our Inner Circle Mastermind Members


-----

###### tried it, using his birthday as a credit.
 He shared: “The best part about my birthday was actually running one of Kim Phillips’ credit emails! I sold four of my courses, generating $3,800 in cash and an additional $4K in installments over the next five months!
 The numbers may not be huge, but I still get excited whenever I make a sale without actually talking with someone. ” Some things to keep in mind when crafting your credit email:

 • Make the credit an odd number. It will seem much more real.
 • Give a week or less to use it. Give them too long, and they won’t.
 • Only send once every six months to customers. Too often, and it will
 lose its effectiveness.

 Try a credit email today to create a cash surge for your list.

#### What Disney VIP Treatment Can Teach You
 about Email Marketing

###### by Dan Kennedy As a fan of Disney, I think one of the greatest services it offers is a VIP guided tour.
 This allows you to do things such as skip to the front of the line, get led in through secret back doors, and basically do more in one day (and in great style) than most may ever imagine.
 It’s a premium service, so as you can imagine, there are people who say the price is exorbitant. These are the same people who complain about having to wait in long lines at Disney and only having time to go on four attractions during the entire day.
 Maybe if they considered that you can, for example, go on 12 attractions in the time it takes others to go on one attraction, they would see the value. Maybe they’d realize in the end, with a guide, you can do in one day what it takes the average person multiple days, even a week, to do.
 I see this in business all the time. People look for the easiest, fastest, or cheapest route without considering the whole picture.
 Email marketing is a prime example.


-----

###### Many businesses think, because it’s so easy to use, they don’t need to put as much thought, time, or planning into it as they do with direct-mail campaigns.
 Then these same people complain about their poor open rates, declining click-throughs, and deflated results.
 If you want better results, you have to consider the whole picture. And you have to invest in making your emails better.
 For instance, one key disadvantage of email is that there are a lot more of them flooding your customers’ inboxes every day, many more than there are pieces of mail being delivered to their regular mailbox.
 That means a lot more competition for eyeballs. So, you don’t want to be sloppy about what you are sending. Rather than firing off an email in ten minutes and blasting it out to your entire list without much thought or consideration, take the time to establish a plan, with response or conversion goals, so you know exactly what you want your audience to do before you ever write your email.
 And make sure you’ve included the core elements needed in each email you send.
 Consistency is also a factor. While you can execute a direct-mail campaign at random times, once you start sending emails, you should deliver them consistently week in, week out, without exception.
 If you send email in a hit or miss, random fashion, or go missing from their inbox, people will forget about you in a heartbeat—even if you return to a regular, predictable schedule at a later date.
 This doesn’t mean you can’t send emails at other times apart from your schedule. If you take care of the readers on your email list by sending valuable, relevant emails at regular intervals, they will pay attention at other times too.
 There are many strategies you can combine with your email marketing to improve your results and increase your profits—in many cases, well beyond the standard ROI you see quoted in studies.
 In fact, rarely do I consult with a client where there aren’t untapped opportunities within their email strategy, including ways to combine email with other media to get a higher response.
 Strategies to use with opt-ins can separate the looky-loos from hyperactive buyers, increase profits, improve click-throughs, or even create


-----

###### more loyal customers, clients, or patients.
 Split-test your subject lines, layout, email length, time sent, call to action, and so on, and then examine your results to see what is working and what isn’t.
 There is no free pass to the front of the line. If you want your emails to be the first thing your customers want to open, you have to invest time and resources in making them worthy.


#### #NoBSsm Social Takeaways

###### • Do NOT use your email subject line to promote you. Use the
 subject line to entice the reader to open the message and read more. #NoBSsm

 • Include a clear call to action in your emails. People are too busy
 to figure out what you want from them … so they won’t. #NoBSsm

 • Write every one of your marketing emails like it’s a personal
 communication, and focus entirely on the reader of the email. #NoBSsm

 • Your email subject lines should be entertaining, engaging, or
 invite curiosity. #NoBSsm

 • Never assume you know best. Everything should be tested in
 small batches before the big launch. #NoBSsm

 • Determine who your target market trusts the most, and utilize
 that voice in your messaging. #NoBSsm

##### CHAPTER 11

### Engaging Online:

## What to Post About

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### Increase Your Free Reach

###### When it comes to social media, the more comments, likes, and shares you get, the higher your engagement level is and the more your content will be shown to others for free. If you can keep that engagement level even when you aren’t promoting anything, when it comes time to promote, you will have more reach into the newsfeeds of your target audience.

 Strategies to Create Engagement I like to follow a formula of 85% PBS and 15% QVC, meaning you give valuable and nonsales content 85% of the time and only self-promote or sell 15% of the time. You can look at this as one or two posts from every seven are going to be promotional. Stacking non-promotional posts when you aren’t in a launch serves you well for when you are.

 CREATE ORIGINAL VISUAL CONTENT Social media is a visual, quick-paced medium that requires you not only compete with other businesses, but also with content being produced by your target market’s friends and family, all of which are being shown on the same information feed.


-----

###### To get the attention from your prospect away from “What Aunt Mary is making for dinner tonight,” create original free content that invites the reader to share.
 This is your opportunity to establish yourself as the thought leader and the expert in your industry, so create visuals out of your quotes and blog posts. I recommend scheduling time to batch your post creation and put together 30 at a time that you can use for the month, ensuring you have enough content to post daily.
 Let’s first dive into some of my favorite apps/tools for creating content and then a formula for the posts themselves.

 1. Tools for Content Creation While running Powerful Professionals Business Coaching, writing a series of books for Entrepreneur Press, and raising two young girls, I am often asked, “How do you do it all?”
 My response is generally, “Laughter, prayer, and coffee.” Very true … but that’s not all. In reality, there are 8,907 things I depend on to make my time more efficient and effective. This includes my “can’t-live-without-them” resources, many of which help me keep up my daily posting schedule. Think of these as a collection of “easy buttons” you can use to cut time spent on social content creation to just a fraction.

 Design Apps Some people collect figurines, put together train sets, or spend time on puzzles. I investigate time-saving apps.
 Finding new tools to save me time/improve workflow is a hobby of mine and makes me giddy. Yes, I am that much of a nerd.
 Good news for you, I did the research and you get to use the apps.

 • Canva. Design everything for social media (posts, ads, cover photos,
 and more) and/or anything else you need to design with the custom- dimensions feature. This is my go-to design app when working on Desktop. Even though we have several designers on staff, I use the app for creating ad variations on the fly to keep our costs low and lead


-----

###### flow high. (See Figures 11.1 below and 11.2, on page 190, for examples of ads created using Canva.)

**FIGURE 11.1: Facebook Ad Created with Canva App**

**FIGURE 11.2: Instagram Ad Created with Canva App**


-----

###### • Word Swag. If one could marry an app, I would be willing to commit
 polygamy with this one. (Just kidding … kind of.) In a matter of seconds, you create gorgeous images that make you look like you can actually design. Which I cannot. But this app can. I use these images for social media and to create logos and webinar slides. (See Figures 11.3 and 11.4, on page 191 for some examples.)
 •  Facetune2. I was a fan of the original Facetune for turning my
 ordinary iPhone photos into professional-looking images, but this new version is seven bazillion times better. You can still do the fancy things like whiten teeth, smooth out wrinkles, and improve coloring (not saying how I know this, of course), but you can do the same thing in real-time photos and videos. This app is the social content creator’s bff. For reals.
 Figure 11.5 (on page 192) was created with the app after a workout with no makeup on … the app is that good.

**FIGURE 11.3: Image Created Using Word Swag App**


-----

**FIGURE 11.4: Image Created Using Word Swag App**


-----

**FIGURE 11.5: Create Professional-Quality Photos Using Facetune2 App**


-----

###### • Swish. This app is a legit game changer for video and ad creation. It
 comes with video and music you can use, and in just a few seconds, create your own professionally produced video. (See Figure 11.6 on page 193 for an example.)

 2. Tools for Copy Writing

 • Words That Sell. From Amazon: More than 6,000 words and phrases
 that make the difference between “yadda-yadda-yadda” and copy that sells.
 More than 75 lists of powerful and persuasive words and phrases, including 21 new lists for this edition cross-referencing categories to jump-start creative thinking (see Figure 11.7 on page 193).
 I write a lot of copy every day and find myself starting to use the same exact phrases and descriptions over and over again. This book by Richard Bayan (McGraw-Hill Education, 2006) helps keep my copy fresh and more effective. Plus, when suffering from writer’s

#### What to Post About

###### Some harsh reality about content creation … Posting is less about what “comes natural” and more about doing what works.
 I’ve studied the top social media marketers in every niche imaginable and found what works best on social.
 First, never use stock photos that look like stock photos. They do not perform well.
 Use your phone, a good selfie stick, and a tripod, then get to work batching photos. Here’s what does work:

 • Looking at camera
 • Looking away from camera
 • Laughing
 • Looking down
 • Nature
 • Coffee cup and computer

 See Figures 11.9 through 11.12 on pages 196 to 199 for some prime examples of photos that work.

**FIGURE 11.12: Photos in Nature Perform Well**

###### Ask Questions The simple act of posing a question on social media is the quickest and simplest way to signal that you’re looking for input. Being willing to ask for feedback and listen to what is and isn’t working not only helps your business grow, but it also builds loyalty.
 Oreo cookies, at over 40 million engaged fans, is very successful at this. Nabisco infamously ran the “cookie or crème?” campaign—getting over 1 million people to answer on the Oreo Facebook page. It was a campaign to engage Millennials and obtain contact information for its customers.

 Use Fill-in-the-Blank Posts Fill-in-the-blank posts are a go-to way to increase engagement. Here’s an example from our client, The Fertility Center: Fill in the blank: I am a ____ woman. (See Figure 11.13 on page 201.)

 Write a Photo Caption Post a funny or unique photo of your company or your products at work, or another photo you find online, and ask people to make up their own caption. These posts can be smaller giveaways where the winners get coupons or other prizes. It’s a tried-and-true way to keep your visitors entertained.
 We did this for Ron LeGrand, a real estate investment training guru, and the results were phenomenal.
 Mary Lorson, the Account Manager leading this project at the time, wrote:

 When our client shared a quirky photo of himself looking at a horse, we saw an opportunity. We posted the photo on Facebook and took a lighthearted approach with this post: “Okay, everyone, this photo is BEGGING for a good caption. We’d love to hear your ideas!” (See Figure 11.14 on page 201.)

**FIGURE 11.13: Fill-in-the-Blank Posts Inspire Increased Engagement**

**FIGURE 11.14: Ron LeGrand Photo Posted with Request for Caption to**

###### Inspire Engagement


-----

###### We posted our own comments to keep the mood light and provided replies or “Likes” for each suggestion to keep engagement high. After the first few days, we “spontaneously” suggested that since suggestions were so good, we should hold a contest. Two days later, we announced the winning caption would win a customized T-shirt, then created a link to keep the contest legal. In the next few weeks, we created only two additional newsfeed posts, with links back to the photo, reminding people of the contest. Over the 20 days the contest ran, we received more than 70 entries and 24 Likes, all without any media spend. (See Figure 11.15.)

 To make sure this happens despite how crazy your week may get, systematize the process using a form tied into your CRM and a set schedule of awarding prizes.
 Make sure to announce the winner each week publicly to encourage others to participate in the following week’s post. (Plus, this gives you another post and another chance for engagement.)

 Here’s a Posting Schedule Template to Help You Get Started

##### CHAPTER 12

### Why Micro-Commitments

## Matter

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

 It is fairly obvious that those who know you will be more likely to respond to an offer than someone who has never heard of you before. The same is true of your social media audience. They see so many messages in a day from people they don’t know, connect with, or care about that they completely ignore. They don’t have time for nonsense or to figure out why they should buy from you. After all, that’s not their job. It’s yours.
 Before you go for the sale, start from a position of value with your target market. First, let them know why you are a good match for their needs, why you are an expert in your field, and why they should pay attention to what you have to say. They will care because you are leading with messaging that is all about them.
 And that’s all they care about.

#### The Year of the Blog

 A blog is just a channel. It is your content in a digital medium. You still need to have effective messaging in order to get a high ROI. Remember, for every channel, your customers and prospects are the ones holding the remote control. Do not give them a reason to hit the mute button.
 What is true now is that your social media marketing efforts will crash and burn if you don’t offer content as part of the equation. And there are many reasons to develop great content.

 How to Draw in Leads with Your Blog Great SEO (search engine optimization), aka how people can find your blog, can no longer be manipulated by using tricks of the past. Internet “experts” used to teach cheat methods of using thousands of hidden pages or meta tags. Trying this will get you in trouble with the biggest search engines and cause you to lose time and money.
 At one point, German car manufacturer BMW was blacklisted by the search giant Google. Google’s top rule is that companies should design websites for users and not search engines. BMW admittedly used “doorway pages” in order to boost its web traffic. For this offense, the car manufacturing giant saw its top-ranking numbers dive drastically to a zero ranking.
 When it comes to ranking higher on Google for content, some of the things they are looking for include:

 •  Click-through rates. Once people come to your site, do they click
 around? Do they engage with your content in any way?


-----

###### Tactic: Offer links in your blog posts, and ask for comments and questions at the end of the post.
 • Scroll rate. Do your visitors go below the fold, below what they see
 on their first screen, when they visit your site? Tactic: Break paragraphs and images up on your blogs so they are only partially visible on the top third of your web page. Entice your viewer to scroll down to see what else is on the page.
 • Time on page. How long do they spend engaging with content on your
 page? Tactic: Include multimedia resources, such as audio files to listen to or videos to watch that support your blog content.
 • Bounce rate. (Obvious sign for Google that your stuff stinks.) This is
 if someone comes to your page and immediately leaves. Tactic: Make sure your ads match what viewers will see on the landing page you are inviting them to visit. Speak directly to viewers, letting them know that this page was meant for them.
 • Spelling and grammar. Proofing does matter! Google is scanning for
 content churned out by robots by checking the grammar and spelling to make sure it is good. Tactic: Make proofing part of your blog strategy. And do yourself a favor … have it be someone else. We are never good at seeing our own mistakes. We have a proofreader contracted and someone on staff, too, but if you don’t produce enough content for that to make sense, use a freelancing resource or site like Grammarly or ProWritingAid to get your content checked.

 While those are Google’s goals, your goal in writing content should go beyond simply “ranking high.” Writing a blog establishes trust and authority in your niche. You are the expert sharing content, securing you as the leader in your industry. It gives a chance for your prospects to get to know you before being asked to buy anything. And it can introduce them to concepts and frameworks that lead into sales down the road.
 Plus, if you encourage commenting on your blogs, those comments create social proof for others to see folks who agree with your thought leadership. This alone goes a long way in building trust with your tribe.
 So, a blog? Yup, it’s not optional. It is the core foundation of an effective direct-response social media marketing strategy.


-----

###### To turn marketing into revenue, engage your audience in content that is useful before you start to sell. Use your content to build trust, bring attention to a problem, agitate the problem, and then sell your solution. This works much better than agitating first, which more closely describes Thanksgiving dinners with an ex-boyfriend’s family, and not how you want to market on social media. Creating a content plan is not difficult if you first set some goals, stick to a schedule, and commit to it throughout the year.

#### Set Goals

###### With an integrated content plan, setting goals for what is to be sold requires a specific and detailed approach. It is important to begin with a clear vision of your desired outcome, then create content that supports it.
 Do you want to fill a workshop or seminar? Encourage prospects to schedule a sales conversation? Book your catering orders? Decide first your overall goal for your content. In this step, also determine the date the sale request will take place and any incentives you will offer to drive the sale home.
 We use our blog (https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/) to offer value to our audience, establish ourselves as experts and authorities in the marketplace, share case studies to build trust, and to get more leads for our business.
 Our blog and daily emails are both the first and final step of a lot of our prospect requests. They come in through reading the blog, stay on our list for a few weeks, months, or even years, and then make a purchase of one of our courses or join our Coaching.
 Some of my most popular blog topics were all of the how-to variety:

 1. “The Social Media Cash Machine Landing Page Template”:
 https://powerfulprofessionals.com/?s=Cash+machine+ 2. “582,825 Facebook Fans and Counting.” https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/ 3. “One Strategy Snarky Tea Is Using to Close More Sales This
 Weekend”: https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/ 4. “How to Quickly Grow Your Audience & Sales … in Just Four
 Steps”: https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/


-----

###### 5. “How to Create an Endless Supply of Free Leads from Facebook and
 LinkedIn”: https://powerfulprofessionals.com/blog/

 After you develop your goals, create a schedule and stick to it. Whether it’s once a day or once a week, consistency and commitment are key. Create your schedule based on what you can stick to in order to build your audience and generate those all-important raving fans.

#### Creating an Effective Blog

###### To blog in a way that is most effective and will give you the best end result, begin with the end in mind.
 First, think of a blog as the editorial in your media channel. This is your owned media. You control it, and you can use it any way you like, no matter how big or small your audience is.
 This is where you can appropriately express your opinions on a subject matter as they might affect your target audience. Content should focus on your prospects’ interests and pains, to zero in on what they find important. The following are steps to creating an effective blog.

 Create a Blog Brand Voice A blog should have an overall tone or theme, or be presented in one person’s voice. Focus your brand around your Unique Selling Proposition to reinforce why you are different from everyone else and how you can help solve your prospects’ pain.
 Do not spend time trying to be everything to everyone. That will not create raving fans or turn traffic into buyers. Align yourself with a specific message that reaches a specific market.
 All of my blogs are in my voice and true to self … meaning I mention my love of marketing, God, wine, family, and occasionally coffee. It isn’t stuffy or formal. And while the tone may not be for everyone, I am not trying to be for everyone. Just my people—those who get me and are drawn to me.
 Side note … being authentic is not only more effective, but it is easier. When you always tell the truth, you don’t have to try and remember what


-----

###### you said. Be clear who you are marketing to and who your messaging is for, and be yourself while talking to them.
 Create an editorial calendar to plan topics that are complementary to your overall sales goals and communications strategies. Entice the reader of each blog post with a sneak peek into next week’s blog topic. Make sure to stick to your schedule and post consistently.
 After you have established your goal, move to the next step and write your piece.

 Create a Theme Related to Your Sales Topic For example, look at magazines. Many have a monthly theme. A sports magazine might have a preview of March Madness in its February issue. That February issue has lots of other things in it, but it has a whole bunch of material related to college basketball.
 In order to achieve your ultimate goal of a sale (or many sales), your role will shift to one of publisher and content provider while your prospect gets to know you.
 When I wanted to sell tickets to an event focused on customer retention, I developed a monthly theme around this topic: “Why Customer Retention and Growth Marketing Is Important to the Success of Your Business.”

 Create Weekly Subtopics That Fit Each Monthly Theme Your next step is to develop four subtopics that relate back to the overall theme of your monthly topic. Each week will focus on a different aspect of your overall theme, and all will lead toward week four (or day four, if you conduct this for four days in a row) when you will make the offer to your audience with a call to action. This weekly content planning will ensure fresh, relevant content is always being added to keep readers interested and engaged up until the point of sale. Like two of my favorite TV series, Billions and Blacklist, each episode leads into the next. Here, too, each blog will lead to the finale of the item you are going to sell.
 For our series example, the four subtopics I chose were:

 • Your customers are 66% more likely to buy from you than
 noncustomers.
 • There are no costs in selling to your current customers.


-----

###### • Those who currently give you money should not be treated the same
 as those who don’t.
 • How do you thank your customers each year?

 Develop Supporting Content One of the first things to do before writing any content is to make sure you do some research. Take a look at Quora, LinkedIn Answers, Yahoo! Answers, Answerthepublic.com, or other similar Q&A networks where you can find lots of people asking questions that relate to your specific industry. Identify their frustrations, objections, and pain points to address in your content creation. Bonus: You will get the exact copy that people use when describing their pain points. This is usually quite different than the way those in your industry refer to it.
 Researching these questions may create some ideas and directions for content. Also, take a close look at the links to content within the answers to these questions. Follow these links to see what others in your industry are doing with their content online. (Spying can be fun and profitable! Just keep those dang binoculars hidden.)
 You may also want to set up and conduct a survey, or call your existing customers and prospective customers to find out what needs are unmet. When you begin to write your content, keep those unmet needs in mind. Use the information you collect to create a veritable library of remarkable content that is designed to help your customers get what they can’t get anywhere else. Storytelling, testimonials, and providing something of value that meets people’s needs should all be included in your content.
 Each post can be anywhere from 350 to 2,000 words. The length should depend on how long it takes to fully get your point across. I have found my shorter blogs perform better with email list opt-ins and driving calls to action, but the same isn’t true for some of our clients. Test what works best for your specific market, and be very wary of anyone who tries to tell you there is one end-all-be-all for every market.

 Write Social Media Posts Once you have your content written, use this content as the source for your social media posts for the month. Engage your social network in an ongoing


-----

###### conversation focused around your topic theme on LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other networks.
 This way, all of your content is created with your sales strategy in mind. All of your posts and articles are about walking your prospect toward the sale.
 You can use the same three-line post method used to promote your Juicy Carrot (see page 102) for promoting your blog.

 Automate Publication On-time and consistent delivery is an essential part of making the plan work.
 To ensure this, schedule all content in advance. The last thing you want is to have a blog post or social media deadline sneak up on you with no idea of what content you’ll need. You can use a service like TweetDeck or HootSuite to pre-program all your content on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Schedule your blog posts and emails ahead of time in your application as well.
 For blogs, you should post new, relevant content at least once or twice a week. Your readers should also know the day you typically post, and keep to that schedule. Alert readers via email about any new posts on your blog and promote these posts in your social media network.
 We use a project management software called “Basecamp” to manage our blogging process. Our procedure looks like this:

 1. We map out our content a month ahead of time in a set content planning meeting held each month. 2. I write the weekly blog post when I batch our emails and social
 media posts for the month. 3. Our internal and external proofreaders review the piece. 4. It is then given to the designer who formats and places it on the
 website. 5. Then another staff person sends out an email with a link to the blog
 post. 6. I create several social media posts that link back to the blog and
 share it a few times during the week.


-----

###### Whether it is just you on the team—as was my case for a long time—or you have a full team in place, scheduling time and being consistent are key to multiplying the results from your blog.

 Publish Content This is when it starts to become fun. Launch your content and start to analyze the results. A/B test different times of day to send messages and post content, different subject lines to get your emails opened, etc. Tweak your remaining content appropriately.
 Ask yourself if your content is useful to customers before publishing. While your goal is the sale, the process of getting there includes being useful to your audience.

 “Youtility is marketing so useful, people would pay for it. It’s a necessity for all businesses now, forced to compete for attention, not just against other companies selling the same stuff but also against everyone and everything. In this hyper-competitive era, you don’t break through the clutter by shouting the loudest, you get noticed by being truly and inherently useful.”

 —Jay Baer, author of Youtility: Why Smart Marketing Is About Help Not Hype (Portfolio, 2013)

#### How to Run a Micro-Commitment Campaign

###### 1. Develop blog content that would appeal to your target market. 2. Develop a “Juicy Carrot,” giving your target market something of
 value, such as a free report, ebook, video series, etc. (For a step-by- step “how to” on creating a Lead Magnet, visit www.NoBSSocialMediaBook.com.) 3. For at least two weeks, run your blog content and lead magnet to
 your perfect prospects, targeting your list and followers. 4. When you start to run your main offer, focus on the warm leads you
 have created:
 • Followers
 • Website traffic (retargeting using Website Custom Audience)


-----

###### • Email list

 When we went straight to cold traffic, our cost was $3.00 per webinar attendee, and our show-rate was 20%. When we changed this strategy to a micro-commitments plan, our opt-in decreased to $0.87 each and our show- rate jumped to over 50%.
 Even if you add in the $1.23 it takes for us to get someone on our email list, we are ahead of the game by using this formula.


#### #NoBSsm Social Takeaways

###### • Marketers talk too much about themselves. Think about the
 pain points of the end user or the person you’re trying to reach. #NoBSsm

 • Your prospects don’t have time to figure out why they should
 buy from you. After all, that’s not their job. It’s yours. #NoBSsm

 • Before you go for the sale, start from a position of value with
 your target market. #NoBSsm

 • Raise your relevancy by offering great content to identify your
 target market, and only once they have been nurtured should you sell. #NoBSsm

 • Do not spend time trying to be everything to everyone. Focus
 your brand around your Unique Selling Proposition and target market. #NoBSsm

 • Your content should be 85% PBS and 15% QVC, meaning that
 you shouldn’t self-promote or sell more than 15% of the time. #NoBSsm

##### CHAPTER 13

### The Biggest Secret in

## Social Media Is Offline?

#### The Cost of Not Following Up

###### by Dan Kennedy

 “The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.”

—MARK TWAIN

###### Today, the death of “old” media and offline media is wildly and foolishly exaggerated. For a wide variety of businesses, newspapers, print magazines, merge-mail like Val-Pak, the new USPS’ Every Door Direct-Mail, printed catalogs, even the Yellow Pages directories not only continue to work, but provide improved and improving returns on investment.
 A local marketer utilizing FSI’s (Free Standing Inserts) in his city and suburban community newspapers consistently gets an 8:3 to as high as an 11:3 ROI from them. That means he gets $8 to $11 for every $3 spent. He cannot match that ROI from any online or social media, despite being smart about it. While his two chief competitors exited this “dead media,” he stayed and doubled his ROI.
 One of the media most often, and most vociferously, pronounced dead is the printed and mailed customer newsletter. Bloggers and social media experts love to conduct its funeral. They are dead wrong. Their opinions— and that’s all they are—are ignorant and dangerous.


-----

###### Personally, my business empire has not only been built with print newsletters as its foundation and a centerpiece around which everything else orbits, but they continue to be the chief reason my companies enjoy TCV (Total Customer Value) 2X to 20X above all our competitors (and yes, I know their numbers).
 Well over 50% of my high-value private clients rise up out of the newsletter subscriber base. It would cost me a fortune to find them otherwise. You might judge my business “unique;” however, my model has inspired literally thousands of people in a wide range of consumer and B2B categories to aggressively invest in their own print newsletters for their customers, clients, patients, or donors—and all report significant improvements in retention, ascension, frequency of purchase or patronage, and referrals. Many are in their 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 20th year of continuous use of their own print newsletters and wouldn’t stop their use of this “dead media” under any circumstance.
 One of the very best at it is Annette Fisher, founder and operator of Happy Trails Farm Animal Sanctuary, a thriving and growing animal rescue operation. I suggest you go to www.HappyTrailsFarm.org, look around, make a donation to get on the newsletter list, and treat each newsletter you receive by mail as a masterclass in session. The best B2B model is, unhumbly said, the one I created and still contribute to, obtainable at GKIC.com.
 Another demonstration of how very much alive the oft-pronounced dead print newsletter is can be found with Shaun Buck at NewsletterPro.com. Shaun’s company creates and produces semi-custom and custom customer/patient newsletters for dentists and orthodontists, day spas, specialty retailers, and other small businesses, and in total, mails more than 1.5 MILLION of these for his clients every year. It is expensive, in raw terms, for these businesses to print and mail such monthly newsletters. Shaun has a 98% retention rate year to year with these clients, and they can’t all be fools. They must be getting positive results. Shaun eats what he serves, too, and has grown his own businesses by 4,000% in a very short time by mailing newsletters. You’ll hear from him later in this chapter.
 So, in this age of digital media and proliferate social media, with abundant opportunities to post and distribute the same content you’d put into print newsletters or even the exact same newsletters free of


-----

###### cost, why the devil are so many business owners still creating, producing, printing, and mailing real newsletters?
 Didn’t they get that memo from Al Gore? “Hey, look, I invented the internet!”
 Print newsletters arriving by mail, opened, physically handled, read, clipped from, saved, and shared have positive effects that cannot be replicated online.
 First, customers recognize and appreciate the fact that you are investing real money in communicating with them, providing information and entertainment, and expressing appreciation for them. This engages reciprocity, and for in-depth understanding of that, I recommend reading Robert Cialdini’s books.
 Second, consumers place a higher value on printed publications. One 2014 survey conducted by a major newsletter publisher I work with found that over 80% of respondents indicate they always read the print newsletters and magazines they subscribe to or receive free, regularly, from businesses they have relationships with. Those same respondents said they read ezines, blogs, and other digital media included in paid subscriptions only about 20% of the time. That’s a 400% differential. You can’t win if your output never gets read. Frankly, a whole lot of online communication is killed with the delete button and has no value placed on it whatsoever.
 Third, print newsletters have a much longer shelf life. It’s very common for me to hear from somebody just getting around to reading one of my newsletters sent months ago or even after revisiting an issue from years ago, then asking about products or services. How often do you think somebody settles into their comfy chair for an evening and reads email or blog posts from months ago?
 A client of mine who is a financial advisor and wealth manager recently had a new client bring him over $9 million to invest and manage, after being on a prospect list and receiving a client newsletter every month for five years. An article about teaching kids to respect wealth before they inherit it rang his bell. He read it in an issue of the newsletter four months after it had been sent. My client could have gotten nothing else from mailing his print newsletter to his entire list for those five years and still come out ahead financially from just this one client and the several referrals he’ll certainly obtain.


-----

###### Fourth, print newsletters are a great place to profile, feature, showcase, and give recognition to customers, clients, or patients. It’s meaningful to people to see themselves in print. I get a lot of thank yous from the GKIC Members and my clients when I dispense atta-boys and recognition in newsletters. One of the grand masters at doing this, and driving referrals by doing it, is a long, longtime follower of mine, Dr. Gregg Nielsen, a chiropractor. You can find him at: http://thewaterfordchiro.com.
 Of course, none of this works if you commit the ultimate marketing sin —being boring. A great newsletter is never much about your basic deliverables, products, or services. It shouldn’t be technical. Look at what makes popular magazines thrive:

 •  Human interest stories. They can be about your own adventures,
 about your customers, and about celebrities that somehow relate to what you sell. The long-standing giant Reader’s Digest was built on and lives by its human-interest stories.
 •  New, unusual, and fascinating information. Information people are
 motivated to repeat to peers and friends, thereby supporting word-of- mouth advertising for you. It’s called a NEWS-letter for a reason; it’s supposed to contain news. If you want to see the most successful newsletters built of “many short bits” of fascinating and new information, look at the publications by Bottom Line Inc., notably Bottom Line Health (http://bottomlinehealth.com) and Bottom Line Personal (http://bottomlinepersonal.com). My friend, the late Marty Edelston, created this now-giant publishing company from a tabletop in his spare bedroom. The most successful topics that he made his bones with include “Foods Never to Eat on an Airplane” and “What Big Drug Companies Don’t Want You to Know About Cancer.”
 •  Opinion. Yes, care must be taken. But if you have a personal
 relationship with customers, and your personality is linked to your business or you operate in a business where trust and affinity matter, then people are interested in your philosophy, ideas, and opinions, and can be motivated by shared values.
 By the way, the best work on “being fascinating,” as a person, as a marketer, and with content, has been done by my friend and colleague


-----

###### Sally Hogshead. Both her books are important reading. You can learn more at www.howtofascinate.com.
 •  Useful tips. “How to” relieve a sudden headache (from a
 chiropractor), remove pet stains from carpet (from a pet store or a carpet cleaner), ready your car for a long trip (from an auto service shop or an insurance agent), grow giant tomatoes (from a lawn care company), etc.

 You also want to incorporate limited but direct promotion, such as introduction of new products or services, lead generation offers of free information about a different specific product or service each month, and seasonal “preferred customer” offers.
 It is my firmest conviction, based on solid and overwhelming evidence, that nothing can “glue” customers to your business like a good print newsletter mailed to them frequently, on a regular schedule.
 You can, of course, link and integrate it with online and social media in many ways. Extensions of short “teaser” articles, videos, tools, contests, and surveys can be housed online and driven to by the print newsletters. Engagement, comments, and contest participation can occur on Facebook or other social media sites, pushed by the print newsletter and reported in the newsletter. The circular possibilities are endless. Addition, multiplication, and integration are all, as Martha Stewart says, very good things. But subtraction of the proven and reliable print newsletter from your media mix is just dumb.

#### Nurturing Prospects into Sales and Retaining
 Customers Through Newsletters

###### by Shaun Buck

 Side note from Kim: Why include a chapter about print newsletters in a book about social media? Because once you bring in a lead, your job is to do everything you can to nurture them into a customer and to have them keep buying from you for life. Dan shared earlier in this chapter, “So, in this age of digital media and proliferate social media, with abundant opportunities to post and distribute the


-----

###### same content you’d put into print newsletters or even the exact same newsletters free of cost, why the devil are so many business owners still creating, producing, printing, and mailing real newsletters? Print newsletters arriving by mail, opened, physically handled, read, clipped from, saved, and shared have positive effects that cannot be replicated online.” Shaun Buck, president of The Newsletter Pro, www.TheNewsletterPro.com, is my go-to expert for newsletters and the no-brainer choice for this chapter, and on the following pages he does an excellent job of connecting the dots.

 A few months back, I was sitting in the audience of the largest internet marketing conference in the world when one of the main presenters took the stage and told us he was going to reveal the latest and greatest “new” thing in internet marketing during the next presentation. After a short 15-minute break, I, along with 3,000 or more other marketers, anxiously awaited the big reveal.
 The presenter took the stage once more and repeated his promise of letting us in on this big new idea. I opened my laptop, prepared to take notes, and after a few moments of monologuing, he dropped the bomb we had all been waiting for. “The biggest new thing in internet marketing,” he said, “is direct mail.” At first I wasn’t entirely sure I heard him correctly, but then, almost on cue, he repeated it. This time there was no mistake; at the world’s largest internet marketing conference, the main presenter had just told the audience that generating a new lead via social media and immediately taking that lead offline with direct mail was “the new big thing.”
 I couldn’t help but laugh to myself at the thought that offline marketing was considered “new.” After all, the United States Postal Service can trace its roots back to 1775! But for many of the marketers in the room, the new idea wasn’t offline marketing; it was generating a lead online and following up with that lead using offline media.

 The Case for Online Lead Generation with Offline Marketing How could offline marketing be considered a “new” idea? Offline marketing was around for decades, if not centuries, before online marketing


-----

###### was ever invented, so why did it seem like such a novel idea to so many of my fellow audience members?
 When it comes to online marketing, the idea of spending money on offline media after you have acquired a lead from social media can be hard to swallow; it could even feel a bit counterintuitive, but let’s look at the reality of the situation.
 Shortly after waking up each morning, you sit down at your computer and open your inbox—sound familiar? You’re instantly flooded with dozens of new messages ranging from spam to special offers to important memos. (Isn’t it a good thing our computers no longer say “You’ve Got Mail” every time we get a new email?) The first thing you do is search for any and all emails you can instantly delete without ever having to open them, in hopes that you can get your number of emails down to a manageable level.
 As a business owner, here are a few email stats you need to know:

 • The average commercial email deliverability rate is just 67%.
 • 55% of all emails are spam.[1]
 • The average open rate is 9%.
 • The average time spent reading each email is 3 seconds.
 • According to Lifewire, the average person gets 121 emails a day.

 According to the United States Postal Service 2018 fact sheet, the average delivery point (household, business, P.O. box, etc.) only receives 4.24 pieces of mail in their mailbox each day. Compared to the average 121 emails hitting inboxes per day, you are marketing in a vacuum with direct mail.
 Can you imagine 121 pieces of mail showing up in your mailbox each morning? If they were all checks, it would be cause for a celebration! But if they were bills, commercial mailers, or advertisements, you would likely start to dread going out to the mailbox each day.
 I’m not suggesting that you shouldn’t use email in following up with your newly acquired leads or that you shouldn’t continue to optimize them through social media, but I am saying digital marketing alone is leaving a massive amount of money on the table. Let’s look at how complementing your current email efforts with a prospect-nurturing campaign can drastically increase sales.


-----

###### The Path to More Customers How long do you follow up with someone who inquires about your product or service after the initial inquiry? If you’re like most businesses, it’s not long.
 The following stories illustrate the importance of the follow-up.

 FIRST STORY My company, The Newsletter Pro, is a print newsletter company that specializes in custom content and design. Our average clients range from $1 million to $100 million in annual revenue. One of the many ways we generate new leads is by exhibiting at trade shows, but it’s not always easy to find a trade show that fits in with our average client. On the rare occasion that I do come across the perfect show, I usually do anything I can to get us in.
 Most recently, I discovered one of those rare gems and immediately inquired about exhibiting. I had a good conversation with a salesperson and even received a follow-up email, promising more information to come, but that was over six weeks ago. I haven’t heard anything since. If it was like any other trade show, they probably had an exhibiting fee between $5,000 to $10,000—a fee we would have willingly paid. How much is the lack of follow-up costing this company?

 SECOND STORY I recently visited Disneyland with my oldest son, Brandon. I had Brandon when I was 16 years old, but at 18, he’s now the oldest of five boys. We were there for the first leg of a high school graduation trip I had promised him last spring, and in between riding Splash Mountain 20 times and eating a ton of Dole Whip, I convinced him to join me for a timeshare presentation put on by Disney Parks. I had sat in on one years ago and remember being blown away by the presentation. It was a really great learning experience, plus my wife and I had been considering buying a Disney timeshare (with four little guys running around, we spend a lot of time in Disney parks).
 From the moment the salesperson walked in the door, I knew this was not going to be the same presentation I had seen before. At 35 years old and accompanied by an 18-year-old kid, the salesperson immediately judged my


-----

###### ability and willingness to buy. My 90-minute presentation was completed in less than half that time, including a tour of the mock Hawaii property. The salesperson didn’t ask me any qualifying questions, like “Where do you work?” or “How do you plan to pay for the timeshare?”
 If he had, he would have found out that I own the largest custom print newsletter company in the world and mail millions of pieces each year. He would have learned that I have a team of 35 employees, four young kids, and a serious commitment to Disney. In fact, he would have discovered that I was ready to lay down the cash for a timeshare right then and there, but he judged this book by its cover and, in doing so, he lost a huge sale. In the months that followed, that salesperson made one very brief follow-up phone call and promptly marked me as a “bad lead” in the system.
 If you think the above examples are rare, or unlikely to happen to your business, think again. Disney is arguably one of the best marketing companies on the planet, and even they failed at landing the follow-up sale.
 There are many reasons leads don’t turn into customers. Hundreds of books have been written on the subject, but the number-one reason leads don’t turn into sales is due to the lack of follow-up. Just because you are ready to sell a prospect and turn him into a customer doesn’t mean he is ready to buy.

 • 18% of prospects are ready to buy right now.
 • 82% of prospects take greater than three months to make a buying
 decision.
 • 61% of prospects take greater than one year to make a buying
 decision.
 • 44% of salespeople are only making one follow-up call after a
 meeting.

 When you look at those facts, does it make you wonder how many sales you’re leaving on the table? What would happen if you implemented a follow-up process that would continue to nurture your leads until they were ready to buy?
 Here is an example of a near perfect prospect follow-up sequence:


-----

###### Many years ago, when I was in my early 20s, I was looking to buy a franchise. Being the nerd I was (okay, am), I requested UFOCs (now called FDDs, or Franchise Disclosure Documents) from dozens upon dozens of franchisors. At the time, I was 9 to 12 months out from making a purchase, but I wanted to research my options.

 Within six weeks of requesting these UFOCs, all communication had stopped with every franchisor but one. This single franchisor called occasionally, but her primary way of following up was with a monthly print newsletter. Now, as a guy who creates hundreds of newsletters per month, I can tell you it was one of the best newsletters I have ever seen. Each edition featured a cover article either about herself or a fellow franchisee. When it was a franchisee, they most often talked about how excited they were to be a part of the business or how fast their franchise was growing. They talked about their upcoming convention and all the exciting benefits of attending.

 Each time this monthly newsletter hit my mailbox, I immediately opened and devoured it. I even forced my wife to read it so we could chat about it over dinner. This franchisor reminded me each month who it was, what they did, and why I should be excited about its opportunities. I ended up buying a franchise nearly six months earlier than I had originally planned—primarily so I could attend the annual convention.

 The above story lends itself to an important question: Why did I buy early? Was it because she sent a newsletter? Was it the follow-up? Was it something else entirely?
 Because I’m a self-acclaimed newsletter guy, you might assume I’m going to give all the credit to the newsletter, but the newsletter was just the vehicle used to deliver the message. The reason I bought early was because of the relationship I had developed with the franchisor, a person I had yet to meet face to face. After months of receiving her newsletter, I felt I knew and liked the person I was getting into business with. I felt connected to the franchisees and the business model the corporate office was selling. I was


-----

###### excited about the opportunity and truly believed this franchise was going to benefit my life and the lives of my loved ones.
 It all comes down to this: People want to do business with people they know and like. When you take the time to build a relationship with your qualified prospects, and both educate and entertain them through the buying process, you will close more sales at a faster pace. You can accomplish this by inviting your customers over for Sunday dinner each month, but unfortunately that’s not a scalable technique and it could very well lead to a divorce.
 In years past, you could simply send an email, but with the average person receiving 147 emails per day, that’s no longer a viable option. On the other hand, with the average person receiving 2.7% the number of direct mail pieces per day as they do emails, a print newsletter, delivered directly to your prospects and customers, can have a huge impact on conversions, retention, and referrals.
 Now that we have a plan for turning your social media prospects into new customers, let’s look at the single biggest mistake entrepreneurs make after the sale.

 CONGRATULATIONS … YOU MADE IT TO THE FIRST SALE By now you’ve managed to create an ad, get your ad approved by the powers that be, convinced someone to click on your ad, redirected them to a landing or sales page, encouraged them to take a positive action, and ultimately, with some nurturing and follow-up, persuaded this lead to make a purchase. Your job is done, right? Wrong. It has only just begun. Right about now is when most entrepreneurs miss the boat. You have just done an incredible amount of work to make a sale—now is not the time to forget about your new customer. As Dan Kennedy would say, “The purpose of making a new sale is to get a new customer.” If you implement a long-term relationship building a value-adding system, these new sales will turn into repeat sales, long-term customers, and referral sources. But that begs the question, how do you begin to build that relationship?
 The first step is to stop participating in customer neglect. Many businesses are treating their customers all wrong. But in most cases, it is not even the business owner’s fault. They are just copying what they have seen other companies do.


-----

###### There are two very common customer neglect scenarios. The first: The business successfully lands a sale, but never communicates with the new customer again. Can you imagine? Who would do this? Well, as I pointed out earlier in this chapter, businesses and salespeople alike abandon customers and prospects all the time.


###### “We live in the single most difficult time in history to make a first sale, but we live in the single easiest time in history to make a second
 sale.”

 —Perry Belcher, cofounder of Digital Marketer


###### The second and more common type of customer neglect is to land a new customer and then bombard them with nothing but bills and sales material. Like any red-blooded entrepreneur, I’m all for selling, but the “buy or die” strategy some employ is not my cup of tea. When I see a business that’s always selling but never adding value outside of those purchases, it reminds me of that friend or relative—you know who I’m talking about—the one who never calls unless they need a favor or a cash advance. I have one family member I tend to dodge simply because they constantly suck both the money and the life out of me and never add extra value. Most entrepreneurs have at least one of this type of person in their life and work hard to avoid them, but many of us also are this person to our customers. Crazy, right? You don’t want to be known as an annoying pest to the people who have proved they are willing to spend money with you.
 Both of these very common business practices are killers when it comes to overall customer lifetime value and referrals—they even interfere with additional short-term sales.
 Once you get a new customer, you must immediately pivot and start focusing on the long-term retention of that new customer. Remember, people do business with people they know and like. Businesses that live and breathe that phrase thrive:


-----

###### • A 5% increase in customer retention can increase profits 25% to
 125%. (Management consulting company Bain & Company in Harvard Business Review)
 • The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60% to 70%. The
 probability of selling to a new prospect is 5% to 20%. (Marketing Metrics, a think tank)
 • Companies that prioritize the customer experience generate 60%
 higher profits than their competitors. (Leading on the Edge of Chaos by Emmet Murphy and Mark Murphy, Prentice Hall, 2002)

 If you take nothing else from this chapter, make sure you get this point: The real money and long-term growth for your business is in increasing the relationship you have with your existing customers. Nothing can maximize profits faster.
 The single best vehicle I have found for building relationships, increasing lifetime value, and skyrocketing referral rates is a monthly print newsletter. Dan Kennedy himself has said, “My single biggest recommendation is the use of a monthly customer newsletter. Nothing, and I mean nothing, maintains your herd better.”
 If you have tried a newsletter before and determined it didn’t work, it’s probably because you did it wrong. I can confess that my very first newsletter was horrible. To make matters worse, I mailed it for over two years. You can see an example of this awful newsletter in my book, Newsletter Marketing (2013). To help prevent you from making the same mistakes as so many others, let me give you a few guidelines when it comes to “what not to do.”

 Mistake 1: Ineffective Content Every communication you send shouldn’t be about your business. You need to focus on subjects that will interest your customers (even if they don’t interest you). When I look at dental newsletters, most of the time the newsletter is all about dentistry: how implants work, the signs of dry mouth, and what a cavity really looks like. In all honesty, if I was that interested in dentistry, I would have become a dentist! We work with a good number of dentists, but reading about and seeing before-and-after pictures of dental work is frankly scary, boring, and could be a form of cruel and unusual


-----

###### punishment (a clear violation of the 8th Amendment of the Bill of Rights, I might add).
 The same goes for all businesses. Would you want to read a newsletter about newsletters? What about a newsletter from your dry cleaner about getting grass stains out or from your plumber about unclogging clogged toilets? Do you want to know what people really want to read? Just check the second most visited site on the internet: Facebook. People are interested in you and what’s going on in your life. If that wasn’t true, Facebook wouldn’t exist.

 Mistake 2: Sending an Email Newsletter Only People have way too much email, which means way too much competition in their inbox. The USPS found that a print newsletter can linger around a home or office for up to four months. Granted, an email might linger in someone’s inbox for four months, but by then it’s extremely unlikely that it’s going to be read. How many emails do you refer back to from four months ago? Don’t be cheap here, your customers know email is free, and because of that, they’re likely to pay little to no attention to your email newsletter. If a customer is not worth spending $1.00 per month to maintain a relationship with, you might be in the wrong business.

 Mistake 3: Not Mailing Monthly I have a small percentage of people who ask us to mail quarterly newsletters; however, as a company we have decided not to take on those clients. As I write this, we send out over 3 million print newsletters per year. We have offered a quarterly service in the past, but after a lot of data crunching, we determined that quarterly newsletters simply don’t work. When you send a quarterly newsletter, your customers won’t realize it’s a regular publication. A monthly newsletter requires about six months to see best results—on the other hand, a quarterly newsletter might take years.
 Think about it. How many close relationships do you have with people you only talk to four times a year? Even if you consider them a close friend, how close can you really be? Relationships need to be nurtured, and once a quarter just isn’t enough.

##### CHAPTER 14

### Creating the

## Slam Dunk

#### Effective Calls to Action

###### by Dan Kennedy The most common failure of struggling business owners is not product, place, price, or profitability. Their businesses basically work. They just fall down when it comes to selling. This is something of a lost art and a newly disdained activity. People want to send out proposals by email instead of getting face to face to present them. They want an iPad on the wall in their store to do the work of a live, human demonstrator. Sometimes, they hear customers say they prefer such approaches, but it’s vital to realize that the customer is not always right. We must never surrender to expressed preferences that sabotage the most effective selling. For a lot more on selling, I urge getting a copy of another book in this series, No B.S. Guide to Sales Success (Entrepreneur Press, 2004).
 The worst of all selling failures comes when it is time to ask for specific action. Most advertising peters out and meekly ends, without a clear and direct call to action. People are routinely permitted to wander around in stores, look at merchandise, and leave empty-handed without ever being put through an organized, scripted sales presentation that leads to a “close” or even having their names and contact information captured for follow-up. In social media, there is a cultural idea and a fear about moving people too quickly or definitively to an offer and a call to action—only somewhat


-----

###### justified by the interference of the gods of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. The fact is, there’s no money made until somebody sells something, and damn little gets sold without somebody directly asking for the order.
 My famous friend and colleague, the great Zig Ziglar, observed that “timid salespeople have skinny kids,” and said that what separates the poorly paid professional visitor from the kingly compensated professional salesperson is asking for the order. All advertising, all marketing, all media —social and otherwise—must be engineered to get prospect and seller to a time and place where the order can be requested. Anything else is mere professional visiting.
 In advertising, the vital skill is knowing how to ask your prospect to take action. Your experience in effectively closing in-person sales will pay off when you sit down to create effective advertising. The same techniques, words, phrases, and ideas used in personal selling should be used in your marketing.

 A “Slam Dunk” Customer If you’re trying to target the entire world, you’d better be prepared to go head-to-head with big, dumb companies with billions of dollars to waste in the effort. Going after every possible person who could ever use your service is a fool’s errand.
 Instead, you need to figure out who your favorite clients are. Where do they come from? How do they act? What do they read? How much do they earn? What do they like to do for fun? What is it about you that they resonate with?
 Get a grip on who this person is, where to find him, and what he really wants that only you can provide. And then figure out what price you want him to be able to pay. This should be your first step to building a smarter lead-generation system.

 An Easy Layup—Your Lead Generation Magnet Give your leads a clear reason to contact you and get that reason in front of your “slam dunkers.” Narrow down your perfect clients from the unwashed masses. This “thing” you’re creating is an incentive to respond. It’s your Lead Generation Magnet. It can be informational, like a report, guide, book, CD, or webinar, or it might be some other kind of “gift.” Obviously, the


-----

###### more desirable your magnet and its offer, the stronger the pull it will have to your perfect prospect.
 Here are a few Lead Generation Magnets that work very well:

 • My friend Larry Levin, seen often on Fox Business News and heard
 on radio, offers his options trading technique that made him over $1 million—for free. If you’ll just call his 800 number and leave your email address, he’ll send it to you.
 • My client Ted Oakley, a wealth manager seen on CNBC and other
 investor-oriented publications, offers his free book, $20 MILLION AND BROKE (Keysar Publishing, 2013), for business owners selling or who have recently sold their companies.
 • My client ArthroNew offers a free online video about chronic and
 arthritic pain relief featuring Dr. John Frank, M.D. and Super Bowl player, and a free month’s trial package (to move prospects to tele- reps).
 • Doctors with local practices I’ve worked with offer books like The
 Official Consumer Guide to Cosmetic Surgery and How to End Back Pain and Golf As If You Were 10 Years Younger—Without Drugs or Surgery.
 • A B2B consultant offers a “Special Research Report” on expense
 reduction and cost control case histories to hospital CEOs and CFOs.
 • A company of which I was part owner taught people how to start
 homebased information-publishing businesses. It successfully advertised its Lead Generation Magnet in over 50 national magazines for years—its “little yellow book” was titled How to Make $4,000 a Day, Sitting at Home in Your Underwear, with Your Computer.
 • My longtime client Ben Glass, a personal injury attorney in Virginia,
 creates and advertises many different free reports and books and is a master at using Lead Generation Magnets. You can take a look at www.BenGlassLaw.com. Ben is so good at this, thousands of lawyers all across the country use his LGM formats and models, and you can see that at GreatLegalMarketing.com.

 Answer the WHY YOU Question


-----

###### “Why should I do business with you rather than any other option— including doing nothing?” The answer is what I call your Unique Selling Proposition (USP). Your lead magnet should make dead certain that the factors that make you different are clearly spelled out. This provides fuel to your Call to Action (something else you need in your magnet; do not forget that critical piece) that compels them to act without hesitation, knowing that the benefit they want can only be found with your products/services.
 Don’t rely on hope, networking, or prospecting grunt work to get customers through your door or to your website. Create a lead-generation system that includes these key components to get them to raise their hands and ask for you.

 The Seamless System Wins Many big, dumb companies wind up with separate, separately ruled little fiefdoms. Advertising. Marketing. Social Media. Sales. Their princes view each other with suspicion. Often, they compete with each other for budget dollars. They don’t respect each other’s roles or value. The whole thing winds up a patchwork quilt, with big, ugly seams separating each patch. You probably can’t afford this all-too-common level of corporate dysfunction.
 In its place, you want a seamless system—a customer-centric system. It’s entirely about the customer and totally designed and organized to move someone seamlessly from first point of contact along a single, well- paved and fenced-in path to the point of sale. If that point of first contact is in social media, terrific—but then you must move that person from the avenue through your driveway, onto your garden path, and ultimately to the point of sale.

#### Making the Sale

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips “Well, it was a gold bomber jacket. How could people stay away?” said art advisor Stefano Basilico after the sale. “I think we’re going to start seeing a lot of bomber jackets come out at auction from now on.”
 This quote ran as part of a story on www.ArtNews.com after Christie’s Auction House ran a record-breaking auction of contemporary art,


-----

###### including Seth Price’s Vintage Bomber 2006 that sold for $785,000, beating its high estimate by more than ten times.
 That night, Christie’s grossed $852.9 million. The artists included Cy Twombly, Ed Ruscha, Peter Doig, Martin Kippenberger, Elaine Sturtevant, and Seth Price. Seventy-five of the 80 lots on offer found buyers, for an impressive sell-through rate by lot of 94%.
 Warhol’s Triple Elvis [Ferus Type] 1963 sold for $81.9 million and Warhol’s Four Marlons made $69.6 million. An untitled Cy Twombly from 1970 handily surpassed its estimate, $35 million to $55 million, selling for $69.6 million with premium.
 “The evening was primarily made up of people buying for themselves,” Brett Gorvy, Christie’s chairman and international head of postwar and contemporary art, said at the postsale press conference. He pointed out there were 500 bidders from 43 different countries and that new buyers were facilitated by recent “outreach” efforts in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Middle East.
 “This was a collecting-buying pool tonight, rather than dealers,” he said. Christie’s got it right. It wasn’t inviting people to an art opening or gallery event. It was cultivating relationships with qualified art buyers from around the world in order to make a sale.
 And it was record-breaking. Many brands on social media stay in the engagement stage and never move on to the sale. They want “Likes” because it makes them feel good to have people connected to them.
 Likes can’t be deposited in the bank and won’t pay your bills. How you make the sale has to be determined before you create content. Using the famous Covey tactic, begin with the end in mind.

 How to Do It Right Michael Kors, world-renowned, award-winning designer of luxury accessories and ready-to-wear, did a fantastic job of incorporating a sales strategy into Facebook marketing. According to its case study on Facebook:

 Michael Kors launched a new sneaker product line. The launch, the brand’s biggest new product launch, reached the target customers (women, ages 15 to 35) for the shoes—“decked out with luxe


-----

###### textures, metallic accents, and high-shine studs”—so Michael Kors decided it would make Facebook a key focus. The launch kicked off the brand’s move into sneakers and was part of a broader effort to attract new customers to the brand. The campaign primarily aimed to increase awareness and drive purchases of the new sneakers.

 It created an exclusive sneaker line of 500 pairs that sold out in a matter of seconds via Facebook, prior to releasing a full new line in its stores. In many locations, that second release sold out as well, no doubt spurred by the frenzy social media caused.
 The overall results:

 • Reached 36 million people in its target audience (Nielsen Online
 Campaign Ratings)
 • Sellout of many sneaker styles in-store and online
 • A 16-point increase in awareness of the new sneaker (Nielsen Brand
 Effect study), equating to 5.8 million incremental users aware of the sneaker
 • A 16-point increase in association of Michael Kors with “Jet. Set.
 Go” (Nielsen Brand Effect study), equating to 5.8 million incremental users associating the brand with the message
 • 1 million views of the sneaker videos attributed to the ads
 (https://tinyurl.com/rsfxznv)

 We’ve used this same model for something a little less sexy than sneakers: furnaces.
 For McCarthy’s One-Hour Heating and Air Conditioning in Omaha, Nebraska, we wanted to drive direct sales to a profitable offering but one that gave great value to its target market. Here’s how you make a furnace sexy: Make your offer exclusive, special, and time-limited, and watch your audience behave differently. This offer was available for only 57 furnaces at a price of $981 (normally valued at $3,000) with the purchase of an air conditioning system.
 When it’s time to make the sale, if you’ve followed my advice and focused your attention only on your perfect prospects and spent time perfecting the skill of community engagement, your job will now be easy.

###### But how exactly does this happen? Sometimes it’s better not to ask for the sale of what you really want, but rather for the sale of something else entirely.

 The Youngest Influencer to Make It Big Twenty-two-year-old Kylie Jenner has been named the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, snatching the crown from Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg who was 23 at the time he accrued the title. This comes just three years and four months after her company, Kylie Cosmetics, was founded in November 2015.
 As the youngest member of the wealthy, idolized Kardashian/Jenner clan she has had an unquestionable advantage over competition, of which most other business owners can only dream. Prior to setting up Kylie Cosmetics, she starred in the hit reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians for nearly a decade of her childhood and teenage life. Kylie began to build an enviable following of dedicated fans on multiple social platforms alongside the growth of social media. As of the time of writing (December 24, 2019), she has 154M followers on Instagram, ranking her as the most followed person on the channel.
 As a result, Kylie had already established her own brand before creating Kylie Cosmetics. The financial boost that the Kardashians’ publicity provided her, combined with her fame and beauty, has proved a winning marketing formula.

 THE ULTIMATE INFLUENCER Unlike most beauty and cosmetics companies with a presence on social media, Kylie does not need to turn to others for help when promoting her products. She is the ultimate influencer, using her own face to exhibit her makeup range. This likely saves her a lot of money many others would need to budget for third-party endorsement and also eliminates the risk of being caught up in influencer fraud.
 Despite Kylie Cosmetics having its own dedicated social media accounts, it seems Jenner cannot resist plugging the brand on her personal channels too. It is clear why; Kylie Cosmetics’ mere 19.8M Instagram followers pales in comparison to her own personal following. Although this number surpasses many other international cosmetics giants, it is certainly


-----

###### not the most popular among the Instagram community. Rival MAC cosmetics, for example, has 21.2M followers to date.
 It is therefore safe to assume that Kylie’s sales success comes from a mixture of promotion on her personal channel as well as her dedicated business channel. As a result, she increases her chances of conversion by targeting a wide audience. She can appeal to repeat Kylie Cosmetics customers through one channel, whilst attempting to convert fans of her celebrity into consumers of her products on the other.
 In June, it was revealed that Instagram stories now has more than 500M active daily users, a figure that has risen dramatically from 250M since 2017. According to a recent report by Google, 59.6% of Generation Z actively uses Instagram, in contrast to Facebook (52.8%) and Twitter (just 35.4%). Despite Snapchat being the second most popular platform among this generation (56.4%), it attracted just 200M daily active users in the first quarter of this year by comparison.
 It is definitely no coincidence that Kylie has cut back on her frequent Snapchat activity and refocused her efforts on Instagram. She is observing how her core fan base is interacting with her content and adjusting channel usage according to the presence of her young target audience.
 With this rise in the popularity of Instagram stories, Jenner has most recently taken to obsessively updating her Instagram story and feed, rather than focusing on other less popular social channels.
 Nearly all of these stories are used to endorse products from kyliecosmetics.com. Whether in the form of selfies, color swatches, or packaging previews, Kylie likes to inundate her followers with makeup. When she’s not trying to convince her fans to buy her cosmetics, she’s trying to entice them into buying her boyfriend’s latest album.

 A SIMPLE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE Kylie Cosmetics’ website is (as expected) unequivocally girly, although not particularly groundbreaking or original in its design. Instead, it has been created to provide a quick, seamless shopping experience, whilst also affording customers the opportunity to browse at their leisure through simplified menu items like “face” “eyes,” and “lips” (see Figure 14.1 on page 253).


-----

###### The official Kyliecosmetics.com is clearly designed as an extension of her Instagram presence. Powered by the ecommerce platform Shopify, the website includes a long, segmented homepage, which makes it perfect for browsing on mobile. A significant amount of scrolling is required to browse featured products, and this resonates with Instagram’s user interface from which plenty of site traffic originates.

**FIGURE 14.1: Kylie Cosmetics Simple Menu Tab**

###### The design is built to accommodate impulse purchases, with a centrally placed “add to cart” call to action button beneath each product photo, leaving little chance for customers to dither and change their mind (see Figure 14.2).

**FIGURE 14.2: “Add to Cart” CTAs Ask Customers to Buy Now**

###### Priority has also been placed on upselling here, as a sticky shopping cart appears with a handy reminder to spend “$X more for free shipping” once you have added the first item to your cart (see Figure 14.3 on page 255).

 DRIVING DEMAND Driving demand with limited edition stock is something Kylie is no stranger to. Seasonal launches are a hit with her fans, who have come to expect new collections at Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and mid-summer, to name a few.
 Releasing a new range for her August birthday each year has also become a tradition (see Figure 14.4 on page 255), and she even announced an assortment of limited-edition cosmetics to celebrate her daughter, Stormi, just weeks after she was born. In February 2016, Jenner released six limited-edition lip-shade kits inspired by Valentine’s Day, which sold out in

###### If you are old enough to have owned a Walkman, then you probably remember Columbia House’s special introductory offer … eight records (or tapes or CDs or eight-tracks even!) for the price of one. Started as a mail order business in 1955, Columbia House secured over 125,000 members and $1.7 million in net revenue its first year alone. Its model was, and still is with a DVD-only program, to give away its product with a small level of commitment in order to secure a customer.
 Jay McKeever at Seconds & Surplus offered a coupon that gave a 10% discount after a Fan “liked” the Facebook page (see Figure 14.5). Along with that he ran surveys, quizzes, and posted photos to increase engagement.
 The results:

 • $12,000 in sales directly from Facebook with total sales increase of
 over $32,000 in one month
 • Increase in Facebook fan count by 300%

**FIGURE 14.5: Convert Prospects into Customers with a Coupon**

###### The popular Asian restaurant P.F. Chang’s ran a Facebook promotion in celebration of its anniversary. All of its Facebook fans received a coupon for complimentary lettuce wraps with the purchase of any entrée. While of course this attracted a lot of new fans, the real success was that it drove 50,000 people into the restaurant for the offer, 40% of which were first-time customers.
 Or in the B2B space, give a seminar on a topic of interest for your prospects and include one-on-one consultations as part of the event. Your attendees get a sense of what you have to offer in a trial run yet in the most- likely-to-purchase environment. Include a time-sensitive call-to-action introductory offer to your services or product to drive more prospects into your “upsell” marketing funnel.
 Offering a transitional stepping stone is a strategic way to speed up your sales cycle and convert more leads into paying customers. How can you give your prospects a compelling reason to give you a try while ensuring they are committed and serious potential customers? Because if they aren’t, then they aren’t worth pursuing any further.
 Ever hear the saying that an idea is worthless without action? Along those lines, a prospect is worthless without conversion. If you aren’t actively turning your prospects into buyers, then you are missing out on a lot of potential revenue. It would be like closing your flower shop that is overflowing with red roses in inventory the day before Valentine’s Day.

 THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF CONVERTING YOUR LEADS INTO SALES While there are many different ways you can convert a lead into a sale, here are a few to keep in mind:

 • Email follow-up sequence with a call to action. Following up after a
 prospect doesn’t convert means more than just emailing additional sales messages. It requires answering objectives and providing content to further nurture the relationship before making the sale.
 •  Follow-up training event. If you had a training event and your
 prospects did not convert, that does not mean it is a one-and-done deal. When we held our FB Sales Funnel launch in the fall, almost 500 people watched videos 1 through 4, but many did not convert


-----

###### until they attended a follow-up live webinar. Give your audience different ways to learn and buy for the greatest ROI.
 • Direct-mail campaign. If your prospect entered your marketing funnel
 through digital channels, it doesn’t mean your conversation needs to stay there. Test taking your conversation offline to gauge whether or not that increases your conversion rate.
 • Social media advertising. Through Facebook’s ad platform, you can
 target your email list by creating a Facebook Custom Audience. Leverage this by uploading your email list and creating messaging specifically for those you targeted with your sales messages, yet did not convert, with a follow-up offer or piece of content. You can distribute your ads on the web, Facebook, and Instagram using this platform.
 • Follow-up call. This is the most effective, yet least often used method
 of sales conversion—the good ol’ follow-up call. Our clients who utilize telemarketing as part of their sales process achieve a better ROI than those who don’t. Sure, there is a time investment involved (which means more risk), but there’s always risk when you’re making money.

 LOSS LEADERS There are almost as many ways to structure your sale as there are things to sell.
 Some of the most successful businesses start with a loss leader in order to secure a customer. They give an incredible offer upfront that they lose money on, just to get the customer in the door. They do this because they know they will make money on the back end. In fact, back when I had my agency and ran the lead generation for the organization Dan founded— GKIC Insider’s Circle—we sent traffic to a three-month free membership program. Giving three months away made more money for the company than one or two when tracked over a year. They lost more money upfront but made a lot more on the back end.
 Another reason why you always measure, track, and test. This loss leader funnel is only advertised after the prospect has seen blog content, by seeing a content-rich ad, clicking on it, and going to the blog.


-----

###### For some smaller entrepreneurs, loss leaders are not an option, at least at the beginning. Nonetheless, the goal should be to spend the most you can to acquire a high-quality customer so you can obtain them and keep them for life.
 Like Dan Kennedy says, the one who can spend the most going after his target market wins.

#### Monetizing the Message: Ways to Drive in Cash

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips If you haven’t yet launched a product, program, or service to sell, or you are looking for supplemental income, then you are just like me a few years ago.
 I have always been a public speaker, sharing my expertise in (at least my momma tells me it is) an entertaining way to audiences around the world. I have also always written a lot of content and used it to connect with my audience.
 Until I was introduced to the world of information marketing, I didn’t sell anything when I spoke. I would get paid by the event organizer and hope that someone in the crowd would become a client.
 Fast forward to today where we have developed programs that teach people how to monetize their marketing (see examples at www.NoBSSocialMediaBook.com). While we run these programs and promotions readily as part of our overall business structure, I can also call upon them to bring us quick surges of cash.
 Before I took my friends and family on the Disney VIP Tour in celebration of my 40th birthday, I ran a one-hour webinar and made enough money to pay for the entire trip without having to dip into my savings. After I sold my agency and focused on Powerful Professionals solely, we dove even deeper into Information Marketing programs, aka e-learning, and in three years we generated more revenue than I had in the 18 years in which I owned Elite Digital Group.
 Still to this day, we can activate our list when needed to drive them to the sale because we have products waiting that we’ve developed with their needs in mind. This is the hidden money in our business.

 Where Is Your Money Hiding?


-----

###### The easiest place to start is with the hidden money you already have in your business. These are moneymakers that are sitting there, waiting to give you revenue. You’d be surprised how many there are.
 If you had an extra $8,333 a month, what would you spend it on? Buying a new car? Paying off school debt? Hiring that assistant you’ve been dreaming of? Taking that dream vacation? Saving for an early retirement?
 That extra money, over the course of a year, equals six figures in revenue.
 And the good news is, you can use the network and list you’ve created with the strategies in this book to do exactly that.
 If you want to break the chain of worry, free yourself of that J.O.B., skip the monthly frustration of figuring out new ways to get your business to work, and fit in your side hustle with your real job so you won’t have to worry about the bills, these next strategies are for you.
 Even if you’ve got a tiny list and no marketing budget, these strategies will work regardless of where you are starting from.
 And this is not just about making money. This is about growing a raving fan base, a loyal tribe that you serve, love, and for whom you get to do things that you love while you earn money every single month.
 Here’s a breakdown of:

 • How you can grow your list for free
 • How you’re going to monetize your audience
 • How to scale your success with things you can do over and over again

 Now I want you to start by imagining you have this magic ball. Put your hands over it and make your business wishes come true. You can start generating more money every single month and have that proverbial “make money while on vacation” life.
 Before you keep reading, one word of caution. Don’t get overwhelmed by the number of opportunities. Instead pick one or two to start with, monetize those, and then you can move on to others.
 First, I want you to write down how much extra money you want to generate.


-----

###### Let’s say you want to hire a new employee, so you want to fund that position. Or maybe you have a business goal, and in order to achieve it, you want to bring in an extra $20,000 a month. Or on the personal side, perhaps you want to buy a new car, so you’re just looking at an extra $600 a month. Whatever it is, there is no judgment, no questioning. You just figure out the amount and then write down exactly how much more money you want to bring in every single month, okay? You’re going to do that.
 Then as you are reading through these strategies, match up how much money you want to make with strategies that will bring in that much. Simple math, right? This isn’t guessing, this isn’t magic. We’re going to add up as many of these strategies as we need to equal the amount of money you’re trying to earn, right?
 It’s super simple. Frankly, this is how we plan our promotions calendar at Powerful Professionals now each year.
 We look at our revenue goal for the year and our list of growth goals. Then we decide which things we like to do as part of our business. We figure out how many of those we are going to pick in order to reach our revenue goals. We keep it simple and numbers focused.
 This is way different than how I used to do it, right? When I had my agency, I would just kind of hope the money would come in, that we would get a new client who would hire us—and hopefully pay us on time. I did a lot of wishing to generate revenue. It wasn’t until we started monetizing multiple channels that we didn’t have to depend upon wishing anymore.
 These are the actual strategies we use inside my company, and our students use them, and you’re going to be able to implement them as well.
 Let’s dive in …

 1. AMAZON INFLUENCER STORE If you have at least a thousand people on your list already (don’t worry if you don’t have a list yet; the rest of this chapter will still work for you), this is a quick win you should definitely have in place.
 Create an Amazon Influencer store. This isn’t just the Amazon affiliate program. Anybody can sign up as an affiliate. But an iInfluencer store actually gives you your own site within


-----

###### Amazon where you can send your list. And you get paid on all of the items in the Amazon Influencer store.
 To get an Influencer store, Amazon wants you to have a list of at least 1,000 people.
 Now in my Influencer store I have things like my favorite work tools, the books I love, traveling tools, and my own bestsellers. Check it out at https://www.amazon.com/shop/kimwalshphillips.
 The nice thing about the Influencer program is that they give you a ton of promotions. It’s not just like, “Okay, you set it up and forget it.” When Amazon has their Prime Day, they send out promotions you can run as an Influencer. Not only do they pay you commissions—they call them “bounties”—but they also pay a higher commission on certain things you can do all the time.
 For instance, during one Prime Day, if you gave away free trials of Audible that day, you got paid more. If you got people to sign up for a free subscription to Prime, you got paid more.
 If you have a list of a thousand people, and you’re not doing this yet, take advantage of it today to bring in an extra $100 to $1,000 dollars per month.

 2. YOUR BLOG If you don’t currently have a blog, I highly recommend it. I’ve had a blog in place for over 15 years, writing a weekly article. What this does is gives you media that you own. We don’t own Facebook, we don’t own Instagram, we don’t own LinkedIn. If they go away tomorrow, and that’s where all of your content is housed, you’re screwed. But if you have a blog, you will own a piece of valuable real estate where your audience is used to coming. (Get a full blog template at nobssocialmediabook.com/powerpack).
 The other really nice thing about this is it trains your audience to visit your site—before you’re trying to sell a product, program, or service. If they are only used to communicating with you inside Facebook or Instagram, or even just in email, then they’re not used to clicking to a landing page. You should teach them to find valuable content on your site that can help them.
 There are three ways you can monetize your blog:


-----

###### • Ad revenue. There are incredible ad platforms you can use in order to
 automatically get advertising on your site. You don’t even have to sell the ads. They get placed on there, and you just get paid for it.
 • Affiliate links in your content. You can promote products, programs,
 or services you like with affiliate links and get paid when your tribe purchases.
 • Run sponsored posts for somebody else. Brands like Disney, Target,
 and Staples will pay you to write a post featuring them in an article.

 For a blog, you can generate between $100 to $50,000 a month. Huge range, yes, but it all depends upon how much traffic you’re able to bring to your site.

 3. THE ALL AMAZING PODCAST Podcasting is incredible because of the listenership and the lack of expenses in having one.
 It costs you nothing to publish a podcast on iTunes. Nothing. While someday this may change, you can right now reach so many people for free, and you should.
 With podcasting, you don’t need to spend hours doing it. I put out quick daily episodes that take just five minutes to produce— quick tips every single day. You can stay short or go for as long as you’d like. To save time, I batch my episodes, spending an hour once a week, and knock out seven daily episodes.
 Sometimes I can even do it on the fly. One day we were on the way to the airport at 6:00 in the morning. My husband was driving, and I recorded my episodes that would post while we were on vacation.
 I take my iPhone and my headset and record my episode. It’s amazing. Now there’s more to it than that, of course, but you don’t have to have a big, complicated studio. In fact, you don’t have to invest in anything to do it.
 The stats behind podcasting are amazing:

 • 51% of the population listens to a podcast.
 • 22% of the U.S. population listens to a podcast weekly. There is not a
 single other television program or channel in the world that gets 22%


-----

###### of the U.S. population.
 • 80% of listeners reach at least the 80% mark, listening to 80% of the
 episode when listening to a podcast episode.
 • 32% are more likely to have an annual income of $75,000. 45% of
 podcast listeners are more likely to have a $250,000 annual income than the rest of the country.

 Your audience is engaged, and they have money. And you can make money on your podcast, whether you do it through promoting your own stuff or you take an ad revenue. Over $600 million was spent on podcast ads last year. People will pay you to produce content that you use to promote your business.
 It’s phenomenal. And you can sell your own product. On my podcast, Made to Thrive, we offer a free giveaway, and on the thank-you page for the giveaway, we offer our Made to Thrive Planner for sale. This campaign drives in leads and revenue every single month. We’re generating an extra $3,000 a month doing it. It costs me nothing, yet generates sale after sale after sale.

 4. PAID NEWSLETTER OR MAGAZINE Create content for your audience and get paid to do it.
 You can promote your products, your programs, your services, and get paid to put it out. This isn’t paying for lead generation. This is getting paid to grow yourself.
 We have RISE magazine and are able to give value to our market and promote our upcoming events and course launches.
 You can charge a subscription or put affiliate promotions inside. You’re getting a valuable piece of content out to your list every single month, and you’re getting paid to do it. Or you can just put your own offers in there.
 Incredible, right? With a magazine or newsletter, you can expect to generate between $100 to $1,000 per month. We’re at thousands of dollars, but that’s because we’ve been established for a while. If you’re just starting out, you can cover the cost of producing your magazine, and then you’ll profit after that— that’s a win.


-----

###### 5. CREATE A PRODUCT You could have a course, program, or offer services, or create a booklet, workbook, planner, or journal. These are products your audience will buy. Again, they’re paying you to market; they’re paying you to generate leads.
 The good news is, you don’t have to be the one to fulfill the orders. Every time someone orders one of my planners, City Blue Print prints it on- demand and mails it for us. I don’t touch it. We just make money from it. City Blue Print charge us per piece, so I don’t have this big inventory of products that I had to pay for ahead of time or worry about. Nope. As people purchase the planner, City Blue Print prints it and mails it, and we get the profit.
 Huge, right? By doing a printed product, you could generate between $500 to $10,000 a month.

 6. LEVERAGE OTHER PEOPLE’S AUDIENCES If you have a smaller list or just want to grow your own, this is for you—an expert book.
 Tony Robbins’ New York Times bestseller, Money: Master the Game (Simon & Schuster, 2014), wasn’t filled with his expertise. In fact, Tony didn’t come up with any of the content in that book. All he did was interview influencers. And then all of those influencers promoted the book.
 He assembled the content, built in promotions plans, and got a bestseller out of it.
 Guess what? You can do that same exact thing. In fact, we’re doing that right now with a book we offered out to our Powerful Professionals and mastermind members as an expert secrets book. It filled out with 25 authors right away. You can prepay an editor to assemble the whole thing and get a bestselling book while only having to write one chapter.
 From this strategy, you can make between $500 to $2,000 per month ongoing. I have a book from 2015 that still generates sales for me to this day.

 7. HOST AN EVENT OR ONLINE SUMMIT


-----

###### I’ve both been a guest on online summits and hosted them myself with other experts.
 Then guess what? Afterward, you can sell recordings of the livecast. Now you’re generating sales, and you didn’t have to create any content.
 Plus the guests on your show will promote the event to their lists. So, you’re also generating leads and generating income. This type of event could bring in between $1,000 to $20,000 when you launch. Then you can sell the recordings over and over again if you want.

 8. ASK THE EXPERT EXPERTS COURSE In our program, GURU Academy, we gave a bonus of expert content. I simply interviewed industry experts about blogging, YouTube advertising, Twitter, and more, and included them in the program.
 So, if you “don’t want to come up with another course,” or “I’m not sure that I am the expert,” you don’t have to be. You can interview experts, and people will pay for access to that program.
 You could generate between $1,000 to $10,000 a month doing this.

 9. PROMOTE A PRODUCT, PROGRAM, OR SERVICE ON INSTAGRAM There are a gazillion ways (official count) to do it. If you’ve grown your audience inside of Instagram, you can get paid to post. Simply promote the products, programs, and services you’re using anyway, and you’ll get paid between $50 to $500 per post.

 10. DO A FACEBOOK LIVE ABOUT A PRODUCT, PROGRAM, OR SERVICE You can get paid $50 to $500 per post. Or you could do an affiliate promotion, where you’re promoting a product and share your affiliate link and get paid for resulting sales.

 11. YOUTUBE AD REVENUE If YouTube is your jam, then YouTube will pay you to allow ads inside your video. You can pick and choose the type of videos you want to have, excluding certain videos you don’t, and you’ll get paid between $1,000 to $5,000 per month for that ad revenue.

 12. RUN A BOUTIQUE EVENT


-----

###### Invite five to ten people to an event, either in your house, a retreat center, or rented space like WeWork, or Regis, or a hotel or Airbnb. Teach your content in a small setting.
 It’s a great first way to kick off events, and they can be incredibly profitable. For our events, we charge between $2,500 to $5,000 per person, so we generate anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 per event. Plus, I just love them because I get to work in a small setting with great folks, getting a lot of work done for them.

 13. MASTERMIND PROGRAM This is when a group of people sign up to meet on a regular basis, either virtually or in person, or a combination of both. Our Inner Circle meets in person for two days, three times a year, and then we have a monthly online class on the other months. You can generate $10,000 to $100,000 per month with your Mastermind program.

 14. LARGER-SCALE SUMMIT EVENTS This is when you’re charging per person, usually in a hotel venue or somewhere you can have a lot of people come.
 I do not suggest this as your first event. Although it is an expensive strategy, it can be incredibly profitable. But start with a boutique event until you’re ready to grow … unless you already have a huge list.
 At a summit you can, again, generate between $10,000 and $50,000 per event. Of course, there are people who generate millions of dollars of sales at their events—but that’s usually not the first time out.

 15. VIP COACHING DAYS This is how I started my coaching business. Many of those who hired us for VIP Coaching Days ended up joining our Mastermind program. With a VIP Coaching Day, you promise a specific outcome for the day.
 For example, you might work on a marketing campaign, give strategy help, coach a fitness session—whatever it is, you’re spending a day with them doing this.
 VIP days will bring you between $2,500 to $18,000 per day. So, they actually could be a lot more profitable than the summit event, right? And they’re a lot less work. I love these days. Of course, you’re only working


-----

###### with one person, so you can’t do this all the time, but usually huge things come out of them. They’re one of my favorite things to do.

 16. ONLINE LIVE WORKSHOP Inner Circle Mastermind Members Sabrina and Tristan Truscott ran one with their “Happy Back” program, teaching what they discovered over the years in helping to heal Tristan’s back pain. They created a course and taught it live, selling the program, which you can also do from your workshops.
 Two hundred and thirty people enrolled right away. Not only are Sabrina and Tristan saving lives, but they have generated $22,000 in revenue, and they haven’t even officially launched yet. Got to love serving others and getting paid to do what you love.

 17. KINDLE BOOK This strategy is so good because you are getting paid to generate leads. They’re built on a platform that people can click on. You can place any link you want in a Kindle book—any offer you want—and they’re all clickable. Plus, you get paid for people to read your books. So, unlike any other kind of advertising, you’re getting paid to generate leads.
 For example, for a self-published book I published in 2016, I am still getting paid, as well as generating leads still to this day.
 You can generate between $10 to $500 per day having a Kindle book and get leads the entire time.

 18. PAID PUBLISHING DEALS If you create Kindle books and generate good sales, you can leverage other publishing deals. I publish under Entrepreneur Press and receive not only advances and royalties on titles, but I also get amazing readers and leads just like you, oh fabulous reader.
 When you’re just starting, your advances won’t be much, but when you grow your list you can get up to $50,000 in advances. That’s another way to monetize your audience. Publishers care about list size more than writing criteria. They want to know you have a list and engagements.

 19. AFFILIATE PROMOTIONS


-----

###### You are simply sharing with your audience the incredible products, programs, and services of others out there with your list, and you will get paid to do it.
 We did a promotion for Andrew Warner on Chatbot, and we earned around $20,000 to promote him. He later flipped and promoted us, and we earned another $20,000 from that. When you have good partners and a list, you can generate sales while introducing your tribe to products, programs, and services you know they’re going to love.
 Our audience thanks us when we bring them affiliate deals, because they know we have checked it ahead of time. You can earn between $2,000 and $50,000 a month.

 20. LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER This is when you share with your list the things you’re doing to be successful. We’ve promoted our “Best Emails of 2018,” and sold our sales letters of 2018 for between $1 and $7, with the highest level upsell for $27.
 We generated over $4,000 by selling $1, $7, and $27 products, delivering something we already created anyway. If you’re doing something your tribe would like to have a copy of, you can charge them to deliver it. And they will thank you with cash.
 You could generate between $3,000 and $30,000 per month doing that. The thing is to grow your list and monetize it in just a few minutes a day. Pick one or two techniques to start, and then keep adding until you hit your monetary goal.

 21. WRITE AN EBOOK FOR DIGITAL DOWNLOAD The thought of writing a book may seem daunting. I get it. Writing a book is no walk in the park. (I do not drink nearly as much coffee when walking in the park as I have while writing my books.) But writing an ebook does not need to be daunting. If you have a collection of blogs, you could simply hook them together, add in an opening and closing chapter, and—voila!—your ebook is complete. Or if you want to start from scratch, there is a simple process to follow that can get your book done in one day.


-----

###### 1. Come up with a book theme. For example, for an accounting firm,
 the book might be called “How to Increase Your Profit Without Increasing Your Sales.” 2. Write ten questions to answer as part of that theme. Questions might
 include: What are the hidden business deductions I am probably missing? What company structure is most profitable? What employee classifications benefit my bottom line the most? 3. List three bullet points answering each question. 4. Record yourself answering each question, using your bullet points as
 your guide. 5. Send your recording to a transcriber. (We use www.InternetTranscribers.com, but there are many out there that will work for you.) 6. Edit the final transcript. 7. Hire a freelancer on Upwork or HireMyMom.com to design the book
 for you. 8.  Lift your hand, reach over your shoulder, and pat yourself on the
 back because you have your product and you are officially a published author. 9. You can either sell the book directly on your site or sell it through
 Amazon’s Kindle publishing program, KDP. If you want to add in a bonus, include an audio version of the book as well.

 22. OFFER GIFT CERTIFICATES If you sell products or services, a gift certificate can be an effective entry point to help pay for your marketing and get customers in the door. This is really a coupon with a higher perceived value. You are giving a time- sensitive reason for the recipient to act now in order to receive something of value. We used to run a campaign for a bath remodeler using this strategy.

 23. PACKAGE THE HOLIDAYS We all know we should wish our social media fans well on the big holidays, but have you ever thought how you could turn those holidays into a promotion? More creative than a 20% MERRYXMAS20 code, you can use the holidays as an opportunity for a unique offering.


-----

###### A lot of the messaging for The Fertility Center is centered around women because they found that the female partner does the majority of the research in family planning. But that doesn’t mean they couldn’t focus a bit on the dad-to-be as well. For a Father’s Day short-term promotion we developed an exclusive package that none of its competitors were even coming close to. The Quick Start Paternity Planner included a mini- consultation, a semen analysis, and weekly fertility-boosting tips (see Figure 14.6). (It was an email that the company was already doing, so it wasn’t any extra work.) For very minimal effort and costs, we got four couples to sign up and buy the package, equaling about $100,000 in potential revenue for a promotion that cost only $150. As an added community-relations bonus, this promotion also connected with couples who were struggling. Instead of being sad or frustrated on Father’s Day, we wanted to give them an outlet to help reach their goal of starting a family.

**FIGURE 14.6: The Fertility Center Holiday Package Offer**


-----

###### 24. CREATE A BONUS GIFT The founder of DigitalMarketer, Ryan Deiss, has a lot more going on than this online membership organization. Ryan’s holding company, Idea Incubator LP, employs more than 80 people all over the world and owns dozens of companies, both online and offline, ranging from survival blogs to industrial water filter manufacturers. One of the companies he owns is RAW, Really Amazing Women, which describes itself as “A community for women, by women. Our goal is to nurture an environment where we can be the best version of ourselves. Where we can grow, connect, engage, but most of all be free to express ourselves and learn more about embracing our world and loving this life.”


-----

###### In a promotion for RAW, Really Amazing Women, its sales funnel does not start with a promotion about RAW. Instead, it starts with a free gift that pulls the viewer in to a series of micro-commitments. The site www.MakeUpTutorials.com starts the customer relationship by offering one makeup brush for sale. Once the purchasers say yes, they are then taken to another landing page where they are offered the chance to add more brushes and sign up for the makeup tutorial subscription. (See Figure 14.7 and Figure 14.8 on page 276.)
 Not until step three are you asked for credit card information (see Figure 14.9 on page 277).
 When you complete the purchase, you are then invited to get an entire set for free as long as you take the subscription to RAW, which is $19.95 a month (see Figure 14.10 on page 277).
 It is growing subscriptions for an online community of women that focuses on building self-esteem and self-confidence. However, they are leading with makeup brushes, a much easier sell.
 We have used this strategy for other clients as well, from products in front of membership to a book as the starting point in a launch. We are reaching people where they are with what they want and giving them what they actually need later on.

###### Be creative when you are thinking of lead generation and that first sale. It does not need to be directly tied to what you do, but instead aligned with the needs of your target market. Remember, those who buy from you are 70% more likely to buy from you again. Your goal should be to get that first sale in place.

 25. CREATE A DIGITAL COURSE But How Do I Know If I Should Launch a Course? Back in the day, we were not, as you say, “flush with cash.”
 I was trying to grow my public relations firm with no funding. And what I had been doing wasn’t working. I knew I needed to find a way to fund my marketing and operations that would be consistent. Better yet, one that wouldn’t require me to work around the clock.
 I was dreaming of the proverbial “make money while you sleep” concept—and one that could maybe even help attract better paying clients on the back end.
 I had invested in online courses for some time. These programs had helped me improve my operations, increase lead flow, and make my website more effective. I had also purchased programs that helped in other aspects of my life, such as fitness, being a mom, and decorating our home.


-----

###### I knew how much these systems had helped me, and I wanted to be able to help others in the same way. But would people really pay for something I knew?
 I started brainstorming using these questions—the same ones I coach our students through to this day …

 • What topics am I asked for advice on?
 • When someone asks to “pick my brain,” what subject is the meeting
 about?
 • What industry are the people in who are asking?
 • Does this industry have the funds to afford a digital course?
 • Can I promote to this industry?
 • Do I understand this industry?
 • Can my topic help them save time and/or money?

 Going through this list, I realized that I had been answering questions and giving advice on how to generate leads on social media over and over again. I had in fact been giving this advice out for free … so could I really start charging for it?
 I remembered something Dan Kennedy said … “When people pay, they pay attention.” I knew that to be true. If I get a free pass to the gym, I am unlikely to go. But if I pay for a class, I am certainly showing up. The same goes for a free training online vs. a course I purchased … what I invest in, I take much more seriously and utilize.
 So, I started simple, just teaching others how to generate leads using Facebook in a free webinar, and then I offered them a course to learn more.
 I emailed my tiny list and prayed. In total, 97 people registered, 32 showed up for the webcast, and 7 bought. That meant I made $7,000 in sales!
 What?! At that time, making $7,000 would have required me to provide PR Services for 7 different accounts and hours of work.
 But that was just the beginning. I kept selling that same course—FB Profit Power—on auto-pilot for years while I ran my agency. Quickly, it not only paid for all of our marketing, it started producing an extra $5,000 a


-----

###### month in sales. That was enough for us to cover all of our operating expenses for my parttime assistant and our office rent.
 Through that initial course I discovered different topics my audience wanted to cover and was able to create new courses now that I had the formula down. Eventually, these courses brought in more income than the consulting services.
 That’s when I discovered I loved coaching more than anything I had ever done before.
 This eventually led to me selling my agency and having the privilege of growing Powerful Professionals Business Coaching into what it is today.

 It Isn’t Just Me Thankfully, my story isn’t unique. Here are stories from a few of our students:
 Russell Strickland (see Figure 14.11) went through the process of getting his own Doctoral Degree and through that process figured out a quicker way to get it done. He developed a one-on-one coaching program for other Doctoral students and has grown that business over time. But this required his time to make money. Now he’s launched a digital course to sell the process and his first time out, he sold three courses, then five, then seven … and generated over five figures in revenue in the first 90 days. As a bonus, his course has brought him even more one-on-one clients, increasing his company’s revenue in that way as well.

**FIGURE 14.11: Russell Strickland**


-----

###### Mike Ski (see Figure 14.12) was a Private Investigator working for someone else, until he got the gift many of us entrepreneurs get … He got fired. So, he started his own firm working with the brands he loves and developed a way to land work with virtually any company he wants. Time and time again, other PIs were asking him how he grew his business. In order to help more of them at a time, he decided to launch a digital course. Not only has he sold multiple courses (one time he only had four people on the webinar, and sold two of them … this guy can close!), but he just launched his first in-person live event for PIs and sold tickets simply by doing a free Facebook Live!

###### Magda Casteñeda (see Figue 14.13) was a nurse who was tired of seeing patients come in for Kidney Dialysis treatment, a symptom of Type Two Diabetes, that had gone untreated. She wanted to get in front of the problem and help Latina women escape their dependence on sugar. Magda set off on her own health journey, losing 34 pounds and documenting her success. She then invited friends and family to take a free challenge to give up sugar, then invited those in the challenge to join her membership. Right away, she brought nine women into a coaching group, without spending any money on advertising. And that’s just the beginning! Since then, she’s grown her private Facebook Group by hundreds each week, and it just keeps growing and growing. She’s changed her life and gets to see her students’ lives changing every day.
 Donna Crenshaw (see Figure 14.14) started off helping her daughter Melissa get sponsors for a conference. Melissa teaches bloggers how to monetize their sites. Donna was so successful getting Melissa sponsored by big brands for the event that others started asking if she would do it for them. Her book of clients quickly grew to more than what one person could manage, so she figured she could either say “no” to increased business or teach others how they could get paid to garner brand sponsorship for others.

###### She launched a course and sold it right away without having to spend a penny on ads. She now has help for her private clients and is making passive income! Sometimes from our mess, we get our message.

###### After spending years teaching martial arts and self-defense classes, Tristan Truscott’s back could take no more. For close to five years he was barely able to walk and even after trying many alternative therapies and a $90,000 surgery, his back didn’t improve.
 While they had met earlier and become friends, Sabrina and Tristan became closer during this time, as partners in business, life, and love.
 They sought out other ways to bring Tristan healing and discovered mind-body-energy work Tristan could do that would not only bring pain relief but improvement. Tristan calls it his Mind-Body-Magic process (see Figure 14.15). He was able to recover fully and be back to where he was decades ago.


-----

###### As mentioned earlier, they wanted to help others the way he was helped, so Tristan and Sabrina began developing healing programs to teach others how to heal from chronic pain. They started with Qigong courses, joint mobility, and meditations for overall wellness but recently created a program specifically for back pain!

**FIGURE 14.15: Satori Method Happy Back Program**

###### With a heart to serve as many as possible, they launched their new course, Your Happy Healthy Back, for only $97 (Early-bird pre-sale price).
 They sold the program before it was filmed—since people knew the results they got from other programs and were anxious for more.
 They increased the price over time to $127 and then to $297. Two hundred and three people enrolled right away. Not only are Sabrina and Tristan saving lives, but they have generated $22,381 in revenue.
 And they haven’t even really launched it yet! Scott Whitaker (see Figure 14.16) was in charge of growing the membership of one of the largest membership organizations in the world. He helped lead the organization to go from 72 members to over 3,127.


-----

###### He kept track of the questions he was often asked about member growth and retention and created a course to help other membership organizations multiply. Since launching, he has served 4,312 people and generated $501,617. A highlight for him was taking his wife and two daughters on a first-class trip to NYC to celebrate hitting his sales goals.

**FIGURE 14.16: Scott Whitaker**

###### Not only is he helping membership groups grow, he is getting to enjoy the success of his new venture with his family because he finally has the time to do it.

#### From Sales Funnels to Income “At Will”

###### by Dan Kennedy A business that obtained a mailing list of over 100,000 well-chosen potential customers launched a major marketing campaign, with high hopes. The list was targeted to match the demographics of its current, avatar clients. There was significant disposable income to be had. The copy was good. And the open rate and click-through rate were high.
 The campaign was a total bust. A mystery, but not one without clues. To borrow from a Sherlock Holmes tale, it’s about what was missing, not what was there. The dog that didn’t bark.
 The one thing not known and certain about these 100,000 was whether or not they were buyers in this product category who bought by the means through which this marketer was selling. Matched demographics do not equal matched behavior.
 One of my best rules is that buyers are buyers and nonbuyers are nonbuyers. Offline, with direct mail, lists available in the rental marketplace are divided into compiled and response lists. A compiled list contains people chosen by age, gender, geography, household income, and other demographic facts and statistics. A response list, which costs considerably more to rent, has that information but also only assembles people who have responded, that is, they have requested information or purchased.
 An example of the difference is women, age 45 to 60, married, with household income above $100,000 vs. women, age 45 to 60, married, with household income above $100,000 who have purchased a $100 to $200 collection of anti-aging skin-care products within the last 90 days from a direct-mail piece or catalog. The first group has only potential customers eligible to buy; the latter group has buyers. It’s the difference between fishing where we hope there are fish and fishing where we know there are fish.
 For more about mailing lists, I recommend the book The Direct-Mail Solution (Entrepreneur Press, 2014) by Craig Simpson, to which I


-----

###### contributed. Craig is my “go-to guy” for lists, and, beyond that, an expert freelance direct-mail project manager, handling hundreds of campaigns for hundreds of clients, totaling many millions of pieces mailed each year. His clients include Beachbody, which you’ve seen on TV; a “brain doctor” frequently seen on PBS; groups of local financial advisors; a 23-store chain in the pet industry; and many others. You can meet Craig at www.Simpson- Direct.com.
 Online you are more often building your own list, rather than renting lists others have already built. Social media plays a big role in this. That’s the source of the list of 100,000 that so bitterly disappointed its owner.
 So, what went wrong? It’s one thing to attract people and arouse their interest. It’s another thing to extract money from them. In fact, the entire culture of social media (and a lot of other online media) is all about “free” and “cheap.” It acts in conflict with a marketer’s desire to convert visitors and wanderers and freebie-loving citizens into paying customers. These 100,000 were drawn from that population, then this marketer spoiled them rotten by giving them enormous amounts of free content for more than a year before attempting to move them into a sales path or funnel.
 Yes, during that time, the marketer included blog links to other people’s products and services (to earn affiliate commissions) and occasionally showcased some of their products and services, ever so gently. But they never once opened a door and asked the potential buyers in this population, the gold needles in the giant haystack, the ready-to-buy-now folks in the giant herd of casual window shoppers—to come on in and then to sell them something. It put a store in the mall, then kept its doors locked for a year, hoping to build fascination and desire. Too long. Too slow.
 A key strategy you need to put in place is an open door (with more doors opening frequently), through which real buyers can step to separate themselves from all the rest. By doing so, they identify themselves to you as legitimate potential buyers so you can aggressively sell to them. If your media and social media approach lacks this, you are at high risk of winding up with a low-value list that’s damnably difficult to monetize. In fact, the ready-to-buy-now buyers tend to be impatient about not being invited to a good sales presentation and an offer to buy now, so they wander off and are lost forever.


-----

###### You also need to teach people to respond. People need to be told and shown how they are supposed to behave with you, in your world. That’s why specific Lead Generation Magnet offers (see Chapter 6) are so important. They teach people to step forward, raise their hands, ask for, and say yes to something. It’s a very bad idea to push all the information you can share out to everybody. It’s a much better idea to offer some of the best of it only to those who say yes to a specific offer.
 Much of this is contrary to most of what you see in social media or are advised to do by social media promoters who care only about bragging- rights—numbers like likes, views, retweets—but not about money in the bank. Don’t let that bother you. The majority are wrong about everything, particularly money. And the majority are definitely wrong about this. Marketing is mostly made up of monkey seeing, monkey doing, with no real knowledge of direct marketing, split-testing, or harsh accountability. Just money spent. Don’t copy that. So:

 • Do not leave everybody together in one space, free to wander.
 • Do not create spoiled-brat children by overfeeding them for free, for
 very long, without at least asking for some action and indication of responsiveness.
 • Segment your list by areas of expressed interest and by
 responsiveness.
 • Speed up the sales cycle by opening doors for the ready-to-buy-now
 buyers.
 • Create well-structured sales pathways or funnels leading to a buying
 decision.
 • Last, don’t be overly afraid of repelling or alienating non-buyers.
 Don’t be overly sensitive to criticism from non-buyers. The votes that really count belong to the buyers.

##### CHAPTER 15

### Transformation through

## Optimization

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3: The Number-One Way to
 Prevent Wasted Marketing Dollars

###### I have no desire to throw away a single dollar of my hard-earned money. And I am sure the same is true for you.
 Another reason why social media should be a tool in any sophisticated marketer’s arsenal is the ability to test theories and optimize accordingly at a moment’s notice. Unlike direct mail, print advertising, or other media channels, there is no need to invest significant dollars or wait 30, 60, or 90 days to see if version A, B, or C of your ad works. Tracked correctly, in a day or two you will know exactly what the results are of your different ads and can scale up or down accordingly.
 I attended a conference a few years ago and sat in complete disbelief. During an awards program, no one was told why the winners had been selected or how it had anything to do with the dollars-and-sense results of the ad creation that caused them to win.
 Nothing. And this was a major advertising conference. It did not matter one bit how much money was spent on the ad campaign vs. how much was earned. Accolades and pretty crystal statues


-----

###### were served up regardless of ROI.
 Of course it is much easier to operate this way. Fluffy awareness-based campaigns can be based on assumptions, guesses, gut instincts, or even on the artistic whims of a quirky creative director. They are campaigns that are “fun” to put together and stress-free as they don’t have any level of accountability. But they should only be used if you are also willing to light your money on fire.
 Put the match away. Foolish companies allow their money to be spent on whims. Great marketing that produces monetary results is based on facts, not guesses. Optimized results are developed by examining data and changing campaigns accordingly.
 In comes the power of social media. In real time, you can optimize an ad campaign based on an audience’s behaviors, likes, habits, and hobbies. You can instantly scale advertising spend up or down depending on the results you are getting.

 Split Testing The reality is, though, that very few businesses use even 20% of social media’s power. So they are wasting their dollars time and time again in this channel. They guess instead of test. They assume instead of research.
 One rule of marketing that I have found to be true time and time again is assumptions are usually wrong. When I am speaking to an audience or presenting online training, I share some of our top split tests. And 90% of the time, the audience gets it wrong.
 Nine times out of ten, they are wrong. This means that if ads are only created on assumptions as to what will work the best, then ads will never be optimized. Just think how much money is wasted! Just think of all the vacations at the beach with a hot sun, a cool breeze, and an ice-cold drink in your hand could have been taken with this money. Stop assuming and start testing.
 On the following three pages are some split tests to challenge your wits. Guess which one you think won. The answer for Figures 15.1 and 15.2 is on page 297. The answer for Figures 15.3 and 15.4 is on page 297. The answer for Figures 15.5 and 15.6 is on page 298.
 How many did you guess correctly?


-----

###### If you are like my audiences, not many. Do you know the one thing I am 100% sure about in marketing? That is, I don’t know all of the answers (or even most of them). In my career I am blessed to be able to do a lot of professional speaking and am often asked questions about the best ways to execute strategies. I get questions such as how often to post a new Facebook status, the best times to send out an email, or the most effective headlines to generate the biggest response. While I can offer general best practices (post at most once per day, don’t send out your emails on a Monday, and make the headline about the target audience’s pain), I can’t offer specific strategies without one very important step—testing.
 Testing communications strategies to a small segment of the target audience before launching to the entire audience is a way to gather data on the most effective method of communication.

###### Testing small is the number-one way we prevent wasting money in our clients’ marketing campaigns and can show continuous improvement.
 Imagine an ice cream manufacturer releasing a new flavor. It doesn’t just put something together and send it directly to the stores for sales. It creates several versions, tests in-house, tests out-of-house, and then chooses the option that performs best.
 Your marketing should be treated the same way—with no guesses or assumptions.
 We recently split-tested email time-of-day for one of our clients and found that sending email in the evening received double the response rate vs. the same email sent in the morning. We can (and will!) use this data to optimize its future messaging.
 Take the emotion out of your marketing, and execute your strategies based on measurable results from your testing.
 Our motto: Test small and launch big. When testing, keep the following social media ad-testing best practices in mind:


-----

###### • Track conversions, not clicks. You want to optimize your overall ROI,
 not waste dollars on clicks. An ad that gets 100 clicks is not better than an ad than only gets 25, if the second ad gets more conversions.
 • Set up the target market demographics so you are always testing only
 one thing at a time. If you combine too many variables in your ads, it will be difficult to optimize them well. (Was it the moms who did best or those who were recently engaged?)
 •  Start with split-testing the demographic, and then use the best
 performing demographic in the rest of the tests. (Do moms who like rugby do better than moms who like HGTV?)
 •  For the ad image that performs the best, test changing the ad’s
 coloring to see if it performs better. (Does a black background perform better than blue or white? Better than red?)
 • Take the best coloring of the ad, and test different wording to see if
 that makes a difference. (If we tell them to “click here” vs. “download now,” does that do better?)
 •  Test adding a call-to-action button vs. running without a button.
 (Does adding a call to action hurt sales because your social media post now looks like an ad, or does it help sales because there is a clear path the prospect can take for action?)

 When you have run all of your optimization tests, it is time to move on to the landing page.
 Here’s a quick checklist of the items to test for:

  Ad images
  Headline  Text  Target market demographics, interests, and behaviors  Landing page copy  Opt-in form  Text below the photo  When the ad is run (time of day, day of week, week of month, month
 of year)  Daily budget  Type of bid, automated or manual


-----

######  Placement (Newsfeed, right side, mobile app, mobile and/or
 desktop)

 Unfortunately, social media is like any other form of marketing. If you want a continued high ROI, you have to keep testing. Steven Spielberg was rejected by the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts multiple times. He went on to create the first summer blockbuster with Jaws in 1975 and has won three Academy Awards.
 Do not rest on your laurels. Status quo never got anyone Academy Award Success. Continue to test to earn your next blockbuster actually deserving of an award.


#### #NoBSsm Social Takeaways

###### • Social media gives you the ability in a day or two to know
 exactly how a marketing campaign will perform

 • If you only create ads based on assumptions, nine times out of
 ten, you will be wrong.

##### CHAPTER 16

### Up-Leveling Your

## Social Media

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

#### Five Ways to Grow Your List for FREE (Before
 Spending a Dime on Advertising)

###### Vox Research estimates that $58 billion will be spent this year on social media marketing ads. This doesn’t even take into consideration all of the money spent on Google, YouTube, and let’s not forget those waste-of- money-but-entertaining Superbowl commercials.
 Beyond ads though, there are ways to grow your list for free. Yes, without spending a dime on advertising. Some will be new, some will be obvious, but the question is … which of them are you currently doing?

 1. Create a Juicy Carrot featuring others. Put together a Juicy Carrot
 with tips from experts in your niche, like Mastermind member Todd Tramonte did with his video series, “How to Get a Listing a Week” (see Figure 16.1). He simply asked other real estate professionals for their one idea and then once they were in the video, he asked them to promote it to their lists.

**FIGURE 16.1: Todd Tramonte’s Video Series**


-----

###### 2. Put your Juicy Carrot link EVERYWHERE. There should be a link to
 your Juicy Carrot everywhere you can include it. Link your Facebook cover photo, bio on Instagram, bio on LinkedIn, signature line on email, About Us on your website, at the end of every blog post, and anywhere else you have content. Schedule some time to go through all of your assets and make sure links are included everywhere. See Figure 16.2 on page 303 for an example.
 (Side note, if you want more followers on Instagram to see your Juicy Carrot link, make sure to check out your Powerful Professionals Business Coaching Free Guide: 21-Day Instagram Growth Plan inside your portal. [Not a member yet? Join now at Powerfulprofessionals.com/action.]) 3. Launch a quiz. Post a quiz on all social media channels asking, “If
 you had a magic wand, what is one thing you’d change about ___ (your business, the last diet you were on, your marriage … or whatever your niche is)”? Offer a prize to one person who fills it out in the next week and then promise to give everyone who enters a report of the answers. And if you want even more leads, give them a double entry if they share the quiz to their social media following. You can use the free platform Survey Monkey to conduct the survey.

**FIGURE 16.2: Instagram Growth Plan**


-----

###### 4. Be a guest. Check out blogs, podcasts, Facebook Live shows, and
 more from those in your niche, and ask to be a guest contributor. You’ll offer tips from your Juicy Carrot, and give it away for free. 5. Do a Facebook Live weekly. Facebook Live offers the greatest ROI
 when it comes to free distribution and lead generation. But you have to be consistent. Schedule a time you can be on live every week, and stick to it without excuses. To combat my ever-changing schedule, I had to schedule mine for 9:00 P.M. on Wednesday nights. Because in my schedule, that is a time I can control.

 It doesn’t matter when you do it. Just pick a time and stick with it.

#### How to Run a 72-Hour Buzz Campaign

###### It was amazing, but it wasn’t by accident.
 Last year we had a record-breaking launch of my newest podcast, “Made to Thrive,” and it happened because of stacking … (more on that in a second).
 Thanks to our tribe, it was the most successful podcast launch we’ve ever done. Not only did we get massive podcast subscribers, but we grew


-----

###### our list and drove in sales. And the entire campaign took place over only 72 hours.
 The good news is, you can do the same thing for your next podcast, book, or product launch.
 This campaign starts by creating buzz around the mystery of “something is coming.” The build-up is all leading to the big announcement. When the announcement hits, you make the offer so good that you almost want to throw up because you feel like you are giving too much away. (This is the official way to know if it’s a good offer, btw.)
 Here’s how we did it… 72 hours ahead of time.

 1.  Announcement. We scheduled a Facebook Live teasing a big
 announcement. This post created immediate social proof and started to build buzz with our followers (see Figure 16.3 on page 305). 2. Social. We posted on Facebook and Instagram newsfeeds and Insta Stories with a link to the Facebook Live announcement (see Figure 16.4 on page 305). 3. Pre-promotion. Asked friends and family to download episodes and
 post a review to create social proof before launching (see Figure 16.5 on page 306). 4. Day-of promotion. We sent an email out in the morning inviting our
 list to attend the event, and I posted on social media (see Figures 16.6 below, and 16.7 on page 307).

 beverage they were drinking to give the video juice so more of my list would be alerted. I gave the incentive of a free Powerpack of goodies if they subscribed along with a chance to win an iPad mini if they left a review (see Figure 16.9 on page 308).

 and an email with a link to the promotion and posted on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn (see Figure 16.11).

##### CHAPTER 17

### The Big Picture

#### Reaching More People

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that
 fear. —Nelson Mandela

 I recently heard a story that personifies so many entrepreneurs’ journeys.
 A young man’s mother told him something he didn’t want to hear. “You are going to have to go back to being a waiter at Red Lobster.” This was not the answer he was looking for. He hated being a waiter there. The restaurant had just released its free cheddar biscuits. The tips were decreasing, but work was increasing.
 His small company had already tasted success. LL Cool J had promoted him, and others were asking to wear his clothes. Orders were pouring in, and now he was going to go back to being a waiter?
 The reality was that they had already mortgaged his mom’s house, sold everything they owned, and had nothing left. Yet the company couldn’t fund the supplies and production of the orders it received. Not knowing better, it let the retailers order with terms only favorable to the retailers, including 120 days to pay for the clothing they were receiving.
 So, reluctantly he went back to being a waiter. He promised his mother he would earn the $2,000 she asked for. He trusted her. After all, she had


-----

###### mortgaged her house for him. But he was still uneasy about spending $2,000 on one last-ditch effort.
 With enough biscuits served and $2,000 earned, he gave his mom the money, and she finally revealed what she was going to do. She was going to take out a direct-response advertisement seeking funding.
 He fought her at first. He thought that was the craziest idea he ever heard. Did she know how hard it was to earn that money?
 But as smart moms do, she proceeded with faith and courage and placed that ad in the The New York Times.
 It read: “Need partner to help fund 1 million dollars in orders. Serious inquiries only.”
 Most of the respondents were not legitimate businesspeople (folks with names like Rocco, Tony Two Times, and Small Guy Stan), but a few were. Ultimately, they struck a deal with Samsung Textiles, which would underwrite the manufacturing of their orders.
 This entrepreneur, of course, is Daymond John, with a current net worth of $250 million, who founded clothing line FUBU. Today he is on the hit show Shark Tank, risking his own money in deals presented on the show, and he started Shark Branding as a marketing company.
 Daymond John is incredibly successful. Now. But he had a long journey filled with an incredible amount of hard work to get there.
 I have yet to meet a successful person for which this wasn’t the case. Generally before the success came long hours, fear, doubt, sacrifices, struggles, and failures.
 The journey of the entrepreneur is not easy. I struggled for years before my company started to thrive. It was a long time of very little social life, lots of debt, and exhaustion. I almost gave up many times—at least once per year for the first ten years in business. I would apply for a job just dreaming about things getting better. Thankfully I never got called in for an interview. Not once.
 I am just not meant to work for anyone else. I am guessing the same might be true for you. If you have made it this far in the book, you are one of the few.
 According to The Atlantic, The Pew Research Center found nearly a quarter of American adults had not read a single book in 2014. A January


-----

###### 2019 CNBC article by Abby Hess shows the statistic sadly remains the same.[1]
 As in, they hadn’t cracked a paperback, fired up a Kindle, or even hit play on an audiobook while in the car. The number of nonbook readers has nearly tripled since 1978.
 And most who bought a book, didn’t finish it. It’s not just business books, though. Even Fifty Shades of Grey went unfinished by 75% of those who read it.
 The Wall Street Journal reports that the book’s completion is calculated by the passages highlighted in the book. Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James was only finished 25.9% of the way. So, if you read this book through, you are seeking better things for your business and your life. You want a change.
 There are a lot of strategies contained in these pages. It can seem overwhelming and daunting, but the road to success often is.
 How do you eat an elephant? Start small. Get to know your best customers better. Seek more of them. Create great content and distribute it for free. Dabble your dollars in the paid platforms, and keep an eye on your return.
 Most of our clients start with a small testing marketing budget and only scale beyond a few thousand dollars a month after several months of testing —even the very big companies and firms.

#### The Trouble with Trending

###### by Dan Kennedy I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, you should never try to be everything to everyone with your marketing.


-----

###### This is how companies get themselves into trouble when they use social media. It goes something like this: Company sees trending topic, company contributes to trending topic without understanding its context in an effort to appear “relevant” or “hip.” Then, there’s backlash similar to what DiGiorno Pizza encountered in September 2014.
 To provide some backstory, the backlash occurred when #WhyIStayed started trending on Twitter to bring to light the issue of domestic violence. This was (and still is) a serious topic of public discussion after the NFL released the video of the Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice assaulting his then-fiancée in a hotel. DiGiorno Pizza tweeted, “#WhyIStayed You had pizza.”
 So, what was DiGiorno’s reasoning behind this tweet? Did it think it was funny? Did it think Ray Rice should have gotten treatment that was more lenient? No. Its answer was so stupid it makes me nauseous.
 DiGiorno said that it “didn’t know what the hashtag was about.” A tenet comes to mind that relates (if you’ve ever given an excuse when pulled over by a cop, you’ve heard this one): Ignorance of the law excuses no one.
 The alarming revelation here is that this isn’t the first and certainly won’t be the last example of a company that misstepped in the wild, wild world of social media. As of writing this book, there are over 1.36 billion registered Facebook users, and more than 42 million Facebook pages. There is a lot to learn from companies that are getting social media right and those that, quite frankly, are failing miserably.
 So, how do we separate the winners from the losers? Dollar-measured results, that’s how. Everything else is just a waste of time.
 Provided that you are getting a return on your investment, social media can be a valuable asset to add to your marketing plan. That being said, using social media solely is a dangerous (and not recommended) path to follow. All of Kim’s students have a multilayered approach to their marketing, so if Facebook bit the dust tomorrow, they would still soldier on. The value in social media is how it can complement, not replace, your traditional marketing activities like direct mail, email marketing, so on and so forth.
 This is especially important considering that new social media networks are developed almost daily. If you are going to chase every social media

###### network down the “Yellow Brick Road,” you might as well give your paycheck to the flying monkeys. Seriously. How much sense does it make to deliver a watered-down marketing strategy to multiple audiences, instead of hitting a home run with one social media network? I’ll save you the five seconds of contemplation. None.
 There were multiple social media strategies, case studies, and solutions for the everyday marketer presented in this book. Use these examples as a guide for your own journey to social media success. While you may think, “My business is different. These steps can’t be applied in my situation,” I’m here to tell you that you’re wrong. You must, however, follow the foundational rules for a high social media ROI.
 You’ve read many stellar examples in this book that demonstrated a high ROI from social media. Don’t be fooled. These examples are the exception. And they only occur because of a strict adherence to direct response marketing with a hawk’s eye on measurement.
 If you decide to proceed with your social media marketing strategies, keep in mind these foundational rules at all times:
 You can (and should) make yourself a celebrity through social media. Utilize social media to create your celebrity status to your target market. This is a platform you can control, and it should be leveraged for celebrity positioning. Think of the Kardashians. They practically built an empire off of what most thought would be Kim Kardashian’s 15 seconds of fame. The “video-seen-round-the-world” spawned a reality show that’s currently on its 17th season, multiple clothing stores, and an app that earned $43 million in the third quarter of 2014 (Glu Mobile).
 However, as a business owner, you might take a less extreme approach than a sex tape. But to each their own.
 Niches bring riches. There are niches all over the world—some that you may not even be aware of—that come in the form of associations, groups, interests. You name it, and someone will be willing to lay a pretty penny to work with someone they believe speaks directly to them.
 Whether or not you choose to advertise on the platform, Facebook has powerful tools to help you research your list without giving Facebook a dime. At least for now. It’s worth checking out before it starts charging. If you do use the platform to advertise, make sure you are not only targeting


-----

###### your ad but also your audience, too. Too many businesses get a segmented list to market but use the same ad for each audience.
 Don’t copy someone’s social media ad just because it “looks cool.” I can’t tell you how dumb this strategy is, especially on social media, when you have no idea whether or not the ad is even breaking even on the investment.
 Kmart had a “viral” video called “Ship My Pants” that was the talk of the web. Did it increase sales of online purchases? Kmart’s store sales were down 2.2% again the next year, so my guess? Once again, it forgot who its target market is.
 Do not copy what others are doing just because they are doing it. If someone tries to convince you otherwise, slap yourself in the head. Preferably with this book, so through some act of freakish osmosis, it will remind you of the rules.
 Get to know your best customers better, find out their wants and needs, and fill them. Surveying your target audience is a serious exercise that you should use so you can better deliver your product or service. This can be as simple as drafting a survey with only a few questions. It’s what comes back in these surveys that is really exciting.
 With this data, you can identify potential improvements, referrals, and other business opportunities. These questions can also help you to develop a lead magnet offer (free report, ebook) that will answer a question that is burning in the back of your ideal prospect’s mind. Base your marketing strategies on fact, not guessing.
 Well, this is where I leave you. If you decide to continue on in your social media marketing efforts or begin them, do so armed.
 Kim has laid out a thorough, sensible plan for you to establish your presence on social media and, more important to my mind, get measurable return on your investment. This is what works. Personally, I continue to be fed financially through businesses I have interests in, by the social media strategies Kim has described. I’d be the last guy on earth to suggest not using it for all it’s worth. A lot is done on social media in my name, as if it were me. The work I do for many of my clients incorporates and integrates social media.
 But, if you ever find me personally tweeting, you’ll know the world has ended.

##### BONUS CHAPTER

### How to Multiply Your Results

## with One Post

###### by Kim Walsh Phillips

 If you want more out of your marketing (perhaps leads and sales), start by asking this question:

 Anytime you create a piece of content, are you getting the most out of it?

 Over the years, I’ve developed a formula to ensure every piece of content gets us the most leads and sales possible. When we create a blog post, we multiply our results by sharing it in each channel in the way it works best for that channel.
 This doesn’t mean we take the same post and repost it multiple times. It means, we take the same concept and share it in the format that makes the most sense for each platform. Here’s how we do it:

 Day One

 • Write the blog and post it on our website. (Don’t have a blog yet? You
 can start yours in ten minutes by checking out contentpaysbig.com.)
 • Send notification out via push notifications. This alerts anyone who
 signs up for notifications that you have a new piece of content. We use PushCrew (http://pushcrew.com).


-----

###### Day Two

 • Send an email out to our subscribers with a link to the blog.
 • Post an Instagram Story with a link to the blog.

 Day Three

 • Post a link to the blog on Facebook (see Figure B.1).

**FIGURE B.1: Promote and Link to the New Blog on Facebook**

###### • Do a Facebook Live about the blog topic with a link to the blog.
 • Post on Instagram about the blog topic (see Figure B.2). Add in
 hashtags around your topic.

**FIGURE B.2: Post on Instagram About the Blog Topic**


-----

###### Day Four

 • Post a link on LinkedIn to the blog (see Figure B.3 on page 326).
 • Tweet out a link to the blog.
 • Insta-Story with a link to the post mentioning the comments received.

 This distribution method takes one piece of content and multiplies the results. Every. Single. Time.
