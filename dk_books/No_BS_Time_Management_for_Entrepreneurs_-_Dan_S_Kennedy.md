"My name is Sam Beckford. I'm 33 years old. My wife Valerie
and I started our first dance studio from scratch in 1995, with no
money, no investors, no contacts in the teaching business, and
debt. We built our business up to three studio locations with over

2800 students in just eight years. Each of our locations makes a
profit of over $100,000.00 a year. We are able to run our studios at

this level without being slaves to our business. In addition, we
host a large seminar twice a year and provide on-going coaching

to other studio owners. For most of the year we work from our
home office, only go into the studios three to four hours a week,

take great vacations, and things run smoothly without us being
there. Dan Kennedy has been a great mentor and example to me,
not just for his smart marketing, but also for the way in which he
controls his time, business, and life."—Sam

and Willie Lornans—beware/ Tiiis b°°k is not for
the faint of heart, fawningly polite, or desperate to be

Hopefully, you have picked up this book because you are an
entrepreneur, your time is incredibly valuable to you, and you
are constantly "running out of it."

If you know me, then you've also been motivated to get this
book to find out how I manage to do all that I do. I have been
asked so often, by, what seems like everybody who becomes
familiar with my life, how the devil I fit it all in, that I sat down
and wrote out the answer—this book. If you don't know me, then
your curiosity about my methods may be further piqued by the
description of my activities that follow this Preface. If you know
me, skip that section.

As a very busy, sometimes frantic, time-pressured entrepreneur, awash in opportunity, too often surrounded by nitwits and slower-than-molasses-pouring-uphill

folk, I understand your

needs, desires, and frustrations. The multiple demands on an entrepreneur's

time are extraordinary. So I am here to tell you that
you need to take extraordinary measures to match those
demands. Measures so radical and extreme that others may question your sanity. This is no ordinary time management book for
the deskbound or the person doing just one job. This book is
expressly for the wearer of many hats, the inventive, opportunistic entrepreneur who can't resist piling more and more responsibility onto his own shoulders, who has many more great ideas
than time and resources to take advantage of them, who runs
(not walks) through each day. I'm you, and this is our book.

As you have undoubtedly discovered, time is the most precious asset any entrepreneur possesses. Time to solve problems.
Time to invent, create, think, and plan. Time to gather and assimilate information. Time to develop sales, marketing, management, and profit breakthroughs. Time to network. Probably not a
day goes by that you don't shove something aside, sigh, and say
to yourself: "If I could only find an extra hour to work on this, it'd
make a huge difference in our business." Well, I'm going to give
you that extra hour. But what we're about to do here together is
much bigger than just eking out an extra hour here or there. We
are going to drastically re-engineer your entire relationship with
time.

I've had more than 25 plus years of high-pressure, high-wirewithout-a-net entrepreneurial activity—starting, buying, developing, selling, succeeding in and failing in businesses, going
broke, getting profoundly rich, and helping clients in hundreds
of different fields. Here's what I've come to believe to be the single biggest "secret" of extraordinary personal, financial, and
entrepreneurial success combined: the use or misuse (or abuse by

others) of your time—the degree to which you achieve peak pro-ductivity—will
determine your success. So this book is about
everything that can be done to achieve peak personal productivity.

Just thinking about it is a big step in the right direction.
Awareness helps a lot. There's a reason why you can't find a wall
clock in a casino to save your life—those folks stealing your
money do not want you to be aware of the passing of time. And
that tells you something useful right there: you want to be very
aware, all the time, of the passing of time. It is to your advantage
to be very conscious of the passage and usage of minutes and
hours. Put a good, big, easily visible, "nagging" clock in every
work area. If you spend a lot of time on the phone, have and use
a timer.

Beyond simple awareness, there are practical strategies,
methods, procedures, and tools that the busiest, most pressured
person can use to crowbar some breathing room into his schedule, to force others to cooperate with his exceptional needs, to
squeeze just a bit more out of each day. In this book, I give you
mine. You will undoubtedly be interested in some, disinterested
in others, maybe even repulsed by a few. That's OK. Although
it's generally a bad idea to hire an advice-giver and then choose
only the advice you like, in this case, it IS a cafeteria, and you can
pick and choose and still get value.

Now it is time to get to work. —Dan

from an average 20 road-warrior days a month to four or five in
some months, zero in many. To do this, I totally re-engineered my
business and recently sold one of my businesses. In many
respects, I have less responsibility, and by the time you read this,
several hundred of my Inner Circle Members will have gathered
to celebrate my official semi-retirement at age 49. Note the word
"semi." (Glazer-Kennedy Inner Circle is a membership organization providing the author's No B.S. Marketing Letter and other
services, with Silver, Gold, Gold+, Gold/VIP, and Platinum levels of membership. You will see references to a number of the
Members throughout this book. Information is available at
[www.dankennedy.com.) Also since the publication of the first](http://www.dankennedy.com)
edition of this book, I have been diagnosed with diabetes; I lost
45 pounds and have kept it off for three years. To date, I have
held the diabetes in check with nutrition, diet, exercise, and no
prescription drugs. I've dramatically increased the time and
energy given another endeavor of mine—harness racing. I own,
at any given time, parts or all of 16 to 20 racehorses, and I drive
in races most weeks. I am also, of course, eight years closer to the
19th hole. To paraphrase Yogi, it's getting later earlier.

How has all this changed the attitudes and beliefs I express
about time in this book? Not much at all. If anything, the passing
of time has evermore stiffened my resolve about safeguarding it,
wisely investing it, enjoying it, and bringing wrath upon any
who would steal it, waste it, or abuse it.

How has the passing of time changed my personal practices
with regard to time? Only made them even more stringent, me
more militant. I think I may have mellowed, gotten softer in other
ways, but not when it comes to time. So this book accurately
reflects my thoughts, my modus operandi today, is absolutely

when first conceived.

The big thing that has changed since this book's first publication is the large and growing number of my own clients, Inner
Circle Members, and readers of prior editions who've adopted—
many, timidly, even fearfully, and skeptically at first—the advice
in this book and lived to be grateful for doing so. When I first
wrote the book, I was more of a lone wolf but in this edition, I
have added many stories, examples, experiences, and comments
from others who benefited from my strategies.

**For Those Unfamiliar** **with Dan Kennedy, a Brief Description of**
**His Motivations for** **Militant Safeguarding** **and Control of His**
**Time, and a Few of His Most Interesting Procedures**

For more than 25 years, Dan Kennedy traveled extensively, often
exceeding 120 to 130 travel days a year, presenting as many as 70
speaking engagements and seminars annually. In addition, he consulted with numerous clients, ran as many as four businesses simultaneously, and employed as many as 42 people and as few as one.
He also wrote and had published at least one new book a year for
eight consecutive years; wrote and saw published more than 100
other books, audiocassette programs, and home study courses;
wrote and published two monthly newsletters the entire time; got
involved in horseracing, and still took quite a few vacations every
year.

Presently, he maintains a slightly saner schedule, notably with substantially reduced travel. Still, he has 63 clients in four different coaching/peer

advisory groups, three of which meet for six days a
year, and one for eight days a year. In one year, he also spends one
day every month tele-coaching the same groups, works with 15 to
20 ongoing consulting clients and their projects simultaneously,
writes direct-response ad and direct-mail copy for more than 50
clients, 200 projects a year, speaks at seminars ten times, has clients
come to him for more than 30 consulting days, produces several TV
infomercials, writes two monthly newsletters, writes at least one
book, and drives in harness races two or more nights a week almost
every week. And he takes vacations.

He has but one staffperson, in an office distant from his own home
office. He takes no unscheduled incoming calls, does not own a cell
phone, and stubbornly refuses to use e-mail. His office phones are

answered "live" only one afternoon per week. He deals with the
majority of his faxes and mail only once each week.

Entrepreneurs have traveled from England, Australia, New
Zealand, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Canada, and every nook
and cranny of the United States and paid $2,000.00 to $5,000.00 each
to attend his intensive, multi-day seminars on entrepreneurial success, in which the subject of time is always addressed. Kennedy is
legendary within his Inner Circle Membership and clientele of
thousands for his unusual modus operandi concerning time, and in
this book, you get an inside look at the key strategies employed and
the thinking of one of the most dedicated time and productivity
managers to walk the earth!

It is significant that Kennedy is no longer alone in utilizing these methods—in

fact, he has inspired countless business owners and
sales professionals to make radical changes in the way they control
their time, access, and people around them. A few of their comments appear at the beginning of this book.

Starting with the very next chapter, we dive into very specific
how-to strategies, but first I think you'll find it useful to understand how I arrived at my philosophy of valuing time and how I
value time. I'll be the first to tell you: you can't eat philosophy,
but you do need your own philosophy of time valuing.

In time management books and in time management seminars, authors and speakers love to show off charts and graphs
depicting the dollar value of each workday hour, depending on
your income or the income you want to achieve. Maybe you've l

sat through one of these little graph-and-pointer sessions before.
You know, Mr. Lecturer up there, laptop computer wired into the
overhead projector, lights dimmed, even a laser beam pointer in
hand, so he can show off his beautiful five-color bar graph. If you
use his numbers, for example, based on eight-hour workdays,
presuming 220 workdays, earning $200,000.00 a year requires
that each hour be worth $113.64.

And that looks great on the chart. And everybody in the
room busily calculates what their hours have to be worth.
Somebody who wants to make $100,000.00 a year figures $56 an hour—hey,

I can do that. Plumbers, dentists, accountants, salespeople, most businesspeople say: cakewalk.

_Unfortunately, it's all a pile of seminar room B.S._

Here's why: it's all based on eight-hour workdays. Eight
hours a day. But there's not a soul on the planet who gets in eight
_productive hours a day. Not even close. You see, the workday hour_
is one thing, the productive hour—or what I call the billable hour—
is another. Elsewhere in this book, there's a definition of productivity you may want to use to determine which of your hours are
productive.

Now, if you happen to be an attorney, none of this matters. It
seems lawyers bill out hours whether productive or not. Rodney
King, famous for getting beat up by the Los Angeles police, had
attorneys who billed for such things as escorting King to his
birthday party and even thinking about his case while commuting. Here's a joke: 35-year-old lawyer in perfect health suddenly
drops dead. He gets to Saint Peter at The Gate and argues: "You
guys screwed up. You pulled me up here early." Saint Peter
checks his clipboard and says, "No sir. Judging by your total billable hours, you're 113 years old and we're late." Lawyers.

**NO B.S.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs &3**

But the rest of us can only collect on genuinely productive
hours.

###### Can One "Number" Change Your Life?
So let's go back to the math game and assume that $200,000.00 is
your base earnings target. (We'll talk more about what that term
means later.) How many of your hours will be genuinely productive, directly generating revenue? How many will be otherwise
consumed: commuting, filling out government paperwork, dealing with vendors, emptying the trash cans, whatever? Let's say
it's one-third productive, two-thirds other. That's pretty generous, by the way. One study of Fortune 500 CEOs locked in at an
average of 28 productive minutes a day. Lee Iacocca once told me
he figured top CEOs might average 45 productive minutes per day—the

rest of the day fighting off time-wasting B.S. like a frantic fellow futilely waving his arms at a swarm of angry bees on
attack. But we'll say: one-third. Roughly, only one of three hours
counts as "billable." So you've got to multiply the $113.64 times
three, to get $340.92. This becomes your governing number for
$200,000.00 a year.

My personal number is a bit higher, but if the $340.92 were
MY governing number, as it was a couple years ago, here's how
I would have to use it.

First, it'd be on my mind constantly. Is what I'm doing worth
$340.92 an hour to do it?

Second, it puts a meter on others' consumption of your time—that

unnecessary 12-minute phone conversation just cost
$68.18. This exercise is extremely beneficial. This forces you to
think in terms of "investment" and "expense." It helps you quan_tify what is going on in your life._

CHAPTER 1 / HOW TO TURN TIME INTO MONEY

12-minute

4 % **HO** **B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

Third, for me it sets the base cost for hours given to a speaking
engagement, consulting assignment, copywriting assignment, and
other things I do that are directly billable. And if you do anything
but earn a fixed salary, you have to weigh this base cost against
every activity, to set your fee or to decide whether or not to bother.

When I wrote the first edition of this book in 1996,1 was charging about $3,500.00 to write an advertisement or sales letter for a
client. Today, it starts at $15,000.00 to $21,000.00, and runs as high
as twice that, plus royalties. But let's say I still charged a client
$3,500.00 to write an advertisement. The naive would say that I just
made $3,500.00. After all, I didn't have any "hard" cost; I just sat in
a room and thought, then just sat at a computer and wrote. But if
you think that way, you'll never make big money. If it took me six
hours to write that ad, there WAS a "hard" cost of $340.92 times 6,
which equals $2,045.52. If it took me twice that long, I lost money.

If you travel in your business, you've really got to watch this.
As I write this, I live in a couple of different places. If I'm in
Phoenix, a business meeting in Los Angeles will take, at most, two
days: one half day to travel, a day for the meeting, one half day
back. Maybe even less. But if I'm in Cleveland, a meeting in Los
Angeles will take three full days. One full day more. Using the
$340.92 hour number, it costs $2,727.36 MORE to go to the meeting.

I've learned to think about this a lot. For example, as of this
writing, my one-day basic consulting fee is $8,300.00 (plus
expenses) if I travel to the client but only $7,800.00 if the client
comes to me. Why? Because it's worth money to me to stay home!
I'm buying time. I've maintained this sort of fee differential for
years, but beginning in 2002, I started simply refusing to go to
clients and only offering available dates in the cities where I live.

Many of my clients and Inner Circle Members have adopted
some variation of differential pricing in their businesses. An

Mace Yampolsky, charges a higher fee to personally handle your case, a lower fee to supervise the handling of your case
by his staff attorneys, and yet a lower fee to only consult with
your attorney regarding your case. Dr. Charles Martin charges
different fees if he personally performs the dentistry rather than if
you use other dentists also providing Martin Method Dentistry.

Many years ago, when I was in the field, selling, I quickly figured out that you could fit in two, three, four, or five appointments
per day, depending on how you routed yourself. A salesman half
as good at selling as a competitor but twice as good at efficiently
routing himself and clustering prospects makes the same amount
of money. Today, when I get on an airplane, I have "clustered" as
much productive activity as possible into that one trip. We'll talk
about this in greater detail in Chapter 8.

By working at home, as a writer, consultant, and tele-coach, as
opposed to going to an office, I make a lot of money each day just
by not commuting. I have conditioned myself to go directly from
bed to shower to work in 15 minutes. If I were leaving the house
to go to an office, I'd have those 15 minutes plus another half
hour, maybe an hour commute, than another 15 minutes getting
settled in at the office. Not to mention the commute at end of day.

In whatever ways you can, in your business, you need to
seek leverage. In terms of work productivity, leverage is, in
essence, the difference between the base cost for your hour and
the amount of money you get for it or from it. One good way to
evaluate your personal effectiveness is measuring and monitoring this differential, hour by hour, for a week.

Now, let's go back to the term: base earning target. Since you
are your own boss, you write your own paycheck, and you decide
how much that paycheck is going to be. For most entrepreneurs,
that number is—whatever's left! This is a huge mistake, for two

reasons: it indicates zero planning, and it means you pay yourself last, the number one reason entrepreneurs wind up broke.
So, let's reverse all that, and start with the planning. You've got
to decide how much money you're going to take out of your
business or businesses this year, in salary, perks, contributions to
retirement plans, and so on. What is that number?

_I'll tell you this: eight out of ten entrepreneurs I ask can-_
_not come up with this number._

Anyway, if you do not have a base income target, then you
cannot calculate what your time must be worth, which means
you cannot make good decisions about the investment of your
time, which means you are not exercising any real control over
your business or life at all. You are a wandering generality. Is that
what you want to do—just _wander around and settle for whatever_
_you get?_

Now, you may not have a situation that lends itself to clear-cut

billable hours as I do, so how
can this strategy work for you?
It has to. It's even more important to you than to me. Let's
say you own six stores. Each
store has a manager. Hey, this
is complicated. Well, you'll
have to decide how much of
the business' bottom line profit
goal will be provided by the
managers whether you sleep
or work and how much is still
inextricably linked to you. If
you want $500,000.00 at the

bottom line, and you figure half is dependent on you, you've got a
$250,000.00 target.

For me, it's reasonably precise. For you, it may not be such an
exact science. But that's OK. I promise you that coming up with a
number, even if it is arrived at through some pretty questionable
calculations, is still a whole lot better than not having a number at
all. Having a number is going to make such a dramatic change in
so many of the decisions you make, habits you cultivate, and people you associate with, that the benefits will be so extraordinary,
it won't matter if the original method of getting to a number had
a technical flaw or two buried in it. At least for the sake of our
conversation, in this book, get a number: YOUR base earnings target for the next full calendar year. (See Figure 1.1.) Divide it by the
number of workday hours. Multiply it to allow for unproductive
vs. productive hours. If you haven't a better estimate of that, use

FIGURE 1.1: Calculating Your Base Earnings Target

the three time multiple I've used here. Now you have what your
time is supposed to be worth per hour. Divided by 60, per minute.

That little number may just change your life.
It's sort of like a heart attack—or, in my own case, a diabetes diagnosis—being
required to really get somebody to change their
eating and exercise habits.

A lot of your decision-making gets easy with this number
staring you in the face. It's hard to con yourself with this number
staring you in the face. In fact, I suggest having it stare you in the
face a lot until you internalize it. Write your number "$
Per Hour" on a bunch of colorful 4 x 6-inch cards, in bold black
letters, and stick those cards up in places where you work and
will see them often.

Generally speaking, two business life changes probably come
to mind immediately, with this number staring you in the face:

First, you realize that you've got to surround yourself with
people who understand and respect the value of your time and
behave accordingly. This is not easy. And they will forget, over
time. Familiarity breeds contempt. Periodically, you will have to
re-orient them. You also must get people who do not respect the
value of your time out of your business life. If you let people who

do not understand and respect the value of your time hang
around, you won't even have a fighting chance.

Second, you have to eliminate the need for doing or delegate
those tasks and activities that just cannot and do not match up
with the mandated value of your time.

###### How Low Can You Go in Valuing Time?
I grew up in Ohio, where people spend their weekends shoveling snow in the winter, cutting grass in the spring and summer,
and raking leaves in the fall. Used to make me crazy to drive
around and see somebody in my sales organization out shoveling, mowing, or raking. I'd say: if your time isn't worth more
than the $5 an hour you could give some neighborhood kid to do
this, you should be shot. Plus, you're robbing some kid out of the
money. When I moved to Arizona, I envisioned sand, rocks, and
cactus; nothing to shovel or mow. Guess what? A bunch of folks
bring grass with 'em and stick it everywhere, then alternate
between watering it and mowing it. Others, with "desert landscaping" can be found out there raking their gravel—-like cats in
litter boxes! What conclusion did I draw from all that? Most people will find ways to avoid confrontive productivity and will
waste their time, even if they have to work at it!

Well, my "philosophy of time valuing" can be boiled down to
this: every one of my working hours has to be worth a certain
amount of money; I do everything I can to create and protect that
value; and anybody screwing that up had better watch out.

Another, related issue is "project valuing" or "opportunity
valuing" or "account valuing" for salespeople. In short, a "thing"
has to be worth X-dollars, whatever you decide X must be, for
you to even touch it, think about it, or be involved with it. Many

of my best clients have adopted this idea and now have their
own litmus test, helpful in quickly and decisively saying yea or
nay to whatever comes along.

For example, my Platinum Member Matt Furey started in
business only a handful of years ago with a $10,000.00 minimum:
a new product he might develop or a new marketing campaign
he might initiate had to be worth at least $10,000.00 to him or
he'd pass. Today his number is $100,000.00. He has mastered the
wisdom that just because something is a viable opportunity
doesn't mean it's an opportunity for you, just because something
is doable doesn't mean you should do it.

Most sales professionals hang onto clients and accounts that
consume far, far more time than they can ever be worth. Better to
send them to a competitor. Most entrepreneurs perpetuate projects that consume far, far more time—theirs or employees'—than
they're worth. I've done it more times than I care to confess. But
I'm getting much better at NOT doing it with each passing year.

_THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES_ **BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN** **DOYLE rime**

Vampires are needy, thirsty, selfish, vicious creatures who, given an opportunity, will suck up all of your
time and energy, leaving you white, weak, and debilitated.
Once they have found a good meal, they start coming back every day—so,

even though you regenerate yourself with a meal, a
night's sleep, and a vial of vitamins, it's to no avail; they will be
waiting for you tomorrow just where they left you yesterday,
eager to once again suck every ounce of life from your veins.
Being able to recognize these vampires on sight is the first step in
protecting yourself from them. Being willing to deal with them as
you would a vile, evil, blood-sucking creature of the dark is the
first step in freeing yourself from them.

Maybe the most insidious of all the Time Vampires is Mr. Have-You-Got-a-Minute?

He lurks in the shadows in the hall
outside your office, near the elevator, near the cafeteria, in the
bushes next to the parking lot, wherever it is possible to catch
you off guard. If you give in to him a few times, he becomes
emboldened and starts "dropping in" to your office or home. He
disarms you with "Have you got a minute?" or "I just need a
couple minutes of your time" or "I just have one quick question."
He has a unique knack of pulling this stunt right when you are
in the middle of doing something incredibly important—getting
mentally prepared for a most important phone call, or at some
similar moment. If you are in his vicinity all day, he'll also "drop
by" a dozen times a day—each time needing "just a minute."
Each time he drops by, picture him sinking his teeth into your
neck and sucking out a pint or two. That IS the effect he has.

The temptation to give in to this particular vampire is almost
irresistible. First of all, it just seems easier to deal with his "one
quick question" immediately than to put him off and have it
hanging over you for later. Second, it feels rude and unreasonable
to refuse him. But the truth is, he deserves no courtesy whatsoever.
He is telling you that your time is less valuable than his, that
whatever you are doing is unimportant and easily interrupted.
He is, in street jargon, dissing you to the max. So, go ahead and
stick a stake through his heart without a moment's remorse.

Here's the stake.

_I'm busy right now._
_Let's meet at 4:00 P.M. for 15 minutes,_
_and tackle everything on your list at one time._

This stops this bloodthirsty vampire in his tracks. Freezes
him, like a deer in headlights. Next, it "teaches" this vampire a

discipline. Of course, he won't get it the first time. Or the second.

He'll keep trying for a while. But if you whip out this s.ime
stake every time, over and over again, and jam it firmly I
li rough his chest, eventually he will get the message. Someday,
he'll call you and say something like: "I have five things I need
to go over with you. When can we get together?" After you pick yourself

up off the floor, you can congratulate yourself on having defanged

and housebroken a vampire.

###### "They're in a Meeting" The
next most dangerous Time Vampire is Mr. Meeting. Some
people seem to do nothing but attend meetings. Just as I was finishing this book, a client of mine dragged me into a 20-minute,four-person

conference call to discuss when we could have the
next, longer conference call to plan a meeting. Geez.

Being in meetings is seductive. It is a way to feel important.
It's also a great way to hide from making and taking responsibil-ity

for decisions. Meetingitis is a disease that turns businesses into
unproductive, indecisive, slow-moving coffee klatches. (The two
toughest CEO's I know hold only "stand-up meetings." No
chairs.)

According to a study published in Corporate Meetings
_Magazine in the late 1990s when I wrote the first edition of this_
book, people were spending an average of 20 to 40 hours per
month in meetings, an increase over previous years. The average
time spent in meetings by managers was 1.7 hours per day, and
executives spent 50% of their time in meetings. Those surveyed
said that the most productive meetings lasted under an hour, but
most meetings lasted two hours or longer. It is my observation
that this situation has only worsened, year after year. Even

way to handle this? A conference call? A memo circulated
to each person? Heck, a posting on a bulletin board. Or an
Internet site. An e-mail. Hey, anything BUT another meeting.

If you are going to hold a meeting, there are several stakes
you can use to stop the vampires from making it an endless
"blood klatch." (Time Vampires love meetings, because a bunch
of blood-rich victims gather in one place at one time. It's like a
buffet.)

1. Set the meeting for immediately before lunch or at the end
of the day, so the vampires are eager to get it done and
over with, turn into bats, and fly out of there.
2. Don't serve refreshments.
3. Circulate a written agenda in advance.
4. Have and communicate a clear, achievable objective for
the meeting.

This refreshment thing's a big tip, by the way. My friend
Dave Petito, a great TV infomercial producer, and I both used to
get paid to attend meetings for the same company. These took

place at the firm's palatial Beverly Hills office or sometimes its
CEO's home. Either place, the table was laden end to end with a
fabulous array of food. Bagels, five flavors of cream cheese,
salmon, imported cheeses, sandwich meats, croissants, muffins,
cookies. Really good grub. Added at least an hour or more to
every meeting—after all, you can't advise with your mouthful.
This company has long since gone out of business. I wonder why.

If you must attend a meeting, you also have some stakes
available so you can slay Mr. Meeting. 1.

Determine in advance what information you are to contribute,
then do it with a prepared, minimum-time, maximumimpact presentation.
2. Have an exit strategy: someone coming in to get you at a
certain time, a pre-arranged call on your cell phone, whatever. You can then excuse yourself only long enough to
make a call and return if you need to—but you probably
won't.

###### Playing Trivial Pursuit
Another Time Vampire to watch out for is Mr. Trivia. He either
can't or doesn't want to differentiate between the important and
unimportant, minor and major.

This vampire's talent is getting others off track, getting you
to set aside your carefully organized list of priorities in favor of his—and,

more often than not, his agenda will be of minimal
importance. Mr. Trivia will interrupt to tell you just about anything, ranging from the building being on fire to the office supply store having delivered blue pens instead of black pens.
Usually it'll be the latter.

The best way to deal with this one is to drop a big silver cross
around his neck and kick him off the parapet of your castle. But
failing the opportunity of doing that, you need another stake—
this one is to interrupt the interrupter:

_I have an exceptionally busy day, so I am only dealing with_
_9s and 10s on a 1-10 scale. Everything else MUST wait until_
_tomorrow._

_Are you convinced that what you want to talk to me about_
_is a 9 or 10?_

He will say, "No, but—" and then you must again rudely
interrupt him: "No buts. Thanks. We'll get to it tomorrow." Then
physically get away. (If he's in YOUR office, you leave.)

He will be offended. Good. The odds of him holding the trivial matter over until tomorrow and bringing it back to you are
less than 50-50. He'll go sink his teeth into somebody else's
throat. Or maybe even resolve it on his own. But he won't patiently
wait until tomorrow.

###### Oh Boy, It's Soap Opera Time!
Have you ever watched soap opera diva Susan Lucci overact?
Someone can walk into a room and say, "Ronald has just been
murdered and is lying outside on the lawn with a giant metal
pink flamingo stuck through his chest," or walk in and say, "It's
raining outside," and get the same massive reaction: crying, sobbing, pulling hair, chest heaving, body twisting, overacting. Well,
some people are just like Susan in real life. They turn everything
into an emotional crisis. They react to everything emotionally.
They magnify everything's importance. And if you're not careful,

stake—

**they'll pull you right into the drama. When they do,** visualize 1

HEM sticking in the TV and taking out a quart.
The other problem with these particular vampires is that, at
**the very least, they make you give up your time to attempt to put**
**them back together emotionally. They guilt you into giving them**
your shoulder to cry on. And while they're resting their head on
your shoulder, they're sticking their teeth into your neck.

Some people have the amazing ability to turn every molehill Into

a mountain. If you happen to have some of these overreac-live,

emotionally wrought weepers in your organization, get rid
of them if you can. If you can't do that, then, personally, stay .lvvay

from them. There are two ways to drive them away.

1. Cut to the core of their problem (which is usually glaringly
obvious) and tell them what to do. This is not what they
want. They don't want solutions; they want soap opera.
Spoil their fun and they'll go looking for blood elsewhere.
2. Take over the conversation by launching into a long, boring, pointless story; say: "That reminds me of a time when
my Uncle Harold was in the dust bowl during the great
Depression. This story will help you. Here goes!" In other
words, turn into a vampire yourself and start sucking.

###### Are There Other Time Vampires?
There are almost as many different varieties of Time Vampires as
there are birds or butterflies. Your productivity multiplies as you
get better and better skilled at spotting them and driving stakes
through their hearts.

Ask yourself if you're doing something now to invite the
time vampires in for a feast. If so, stop doing it.

of how a brave CEO, in one of his first acts as president of a medical center, yanked his office door from its hinges and suspended
it from the lobby ceiling to demonstrate his commitment to an

giant act of courage and creativity. I chuckled when I read this.

This tactic is nothing new or revolutionary or innovative.

Put a stop to interruptions: multiply your productivity. It
is that simple.

After reading a study claiming that the average business
owner is interrupted once every eight minutes, I had three of my
clients who spend all day on their business premises put a watch
on it for a day. One reported a better average: once per ten. The
other two, six, and the third hollered, "Hey, I need a stopwatch."
When I used to go to my offices in a place where I was under
the same roof with my staff, I found that to be about par—if _I let_

_happen._ And, as a big thumb rule, the more employees or asso-ciates
you've got, the more you get interrupted. Some years back, I
suddenly wound up with a staff of 42 people thrust upon me. I'or

a while, I was interrupted every eight seconds, not every eight minutes.

It was embarrassing to ultimately realize that this was ill
my fault. I permitted, even invited the interruptions. And I learned

to stop them.
There are many reasons for these interruptions, and almost
none of them have to do with necessity! If you're going to
achieve peak personal productivity in such an environment, here,ire

the five self-defense, time-defense tactics you'll have to use:

1. Get lost
2. Don't answer the phone
3. Fix the fax
4. Set the timer on the bomb
5. Be busy and be obvious about it

###### Get Lost

Your first tactic—simple inaccessibility. When I was in the office
I got asked lots of questions that I knew the people figured out
for themselves when I wasn't there, so my being there, and being
accessible, actually diminished their productivity as well as mine.
The answer is not to be there at all. Some entrepreneurs think
they have to set a leadership example by being the first person
there, to turn on the lights, and the last person to leave, to turn
off the lights. I made this mistake, and it IS a huge mistake.
Leadership is not about outworking everybody.

I learned by traveling that my people functioned just as well
or better with me as an absentee leader as they did with me

onsite. When I was on the road and inaccessible, they handled
80% of everything on their own, most of it satisfactorily, some
with excellence, and a little bit unsatisfactorily but almost always
repairable. And they asked me about the other 20% quickly and
efficiently, in brief phone conversations or via fax. Since that
worked okay when it had to, there's no reason it couldn't work
all the time. So, I stopped going in to the office, period. I had a
fax at home and at the office, so when I was in town, I stayed at
home and worked there largely interrupted. When necessary, I
faxed or phoned in; they phoned or faxed me.

Today, I live and work at my Ohio home more than anywhere
else. I have only one staff person, and she is in the office—in
Phoenix. About as far from underfoot as can be. Almost without
exception, we talk by phone once a day, usually for less than 20
minutes; I get truly urgent faxes once a day; and once a week I
get a nicely organized box of other faxes, mail, and a list of questions. She is far better organized in dealing with me than she'd be
were I there or more accessible. I am far better organized in dealing with her. I'm certain it equates to at least two hours of productivity saved per day for both of us, and in my world, that's a
whole pile of money. A lot more than the weekly FedEx bill.

Dozens of my clients have mimicked these practices, with
very good result. In fact, I can name more than 30—some running
small businesses like mine with only one or two staff, others running businesses doing as much as $30 million a year—who have
offices they seldom visit—from no more than once a week to as
seldom as once a month. Chet Rowland, who owns one of the
largest and most profitable pest control companies in Florida, as
well as a marketing, training and coaching company serving the
entire pest control industry, has sales, administrative, technical,

more than twice a month. His right-hand person comes to his
home for a meeting once a week. He gets daily statistics and
information electronically. He works in a home office at his
sprawling lakeside home or at his beachfront condo. He travels
often with no anxiety about being away from the office, because
he's always away from the office. He gets so much more accomplished than he would if in that office eight hours a day, it can't
even be measured.

I have a friend, a CEO of a $4 or $5 million-a-year business,
who can't work at home; he has six kids, two dogs, one spouse.
So he has a small $200-a-month office in town, about halfway
between his home and his manufacturing facility. It has no phone
and no fax. And he spends most of his time there.

He and I agree:

profits are up. He is finding time to invent and work on "special
projects" he's been thinking about for years. And for the first
time ever, he's taking an entire month of vacation, at a rented
beach cottage, several states away from his business. For the first
time in 30 years, he's really becoming a business owner instead
of being owned by a business.

If you are going to be in your office with the rest of your staff,
then, contrary to my dumb open door management experiment,
it is very important that you have a CLOSED DOOR POLICY.
You need some times when everybody knows—because of the
closed door, red light, stuffed purple dragon in the hallway, whatever—that

you are 100% uninterruptible. And if you want
to sit in there and take a nap, you go right ahead. It's none of
their damned business.

###### Don't Answer the Phone

Next, you've got to get control over the telephone. I think the
phone is Peak Productivity Enemy Number One, and your people will be in cahoots with it until you break them of the habit.
People somehow get conditioned that they must respond to the
phone when it rings, and believe you should too. At home, on
their own time, people will run dripping from the bathtub, jump
up from the dinner table, even "coitus interruptus" to answer the
phone. It's incredible how cowed by Mr. Bell's invention most
people are. Ring. Run. Respond. Nuts.

So, first, let me offer a bit of philosophy: you have absolutely
no legal, moral, or other responsibility to answer the phone or
take a call unless you want to. At home, I routinely take the
phone off the hook to take a shower, eat a meal, take a nap, watch

**6.S.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs <g>** _z$_

_a favorite TV program or, well, for other things too. There's noth-ing—and_

I mean nothing—happening on earth that can't or
won't wait an hour. Or two. You should carry that attitude into
your work too. Different people need different levels of control
over telephone interruptions, but I do not believe anybody ought
to be wide open to in-bound calls. This is like walking around
with a "Kick Me" sign tacked to your back. If you take inbound
calls as they come, you are constantly stopping work on a task of
known priority in favor of something or someone of unknown
priority. You are turning control of your day over to the
unknown. And at the end of most days, you'll be worn out, but
you won't have gotten to do most of the things you wanted to do.

Personally, I have very rarely encountered an inbound call
damaged by a day's delay in response. Most of my important
calls are forwarded to me while traveling, and I start trying to
return them the next day. A lot of the calls wait three, four, even
five days before I take time to return them. Guess what?
Occasionally, somebody's aggravated—which is their problem,
not mine—but I have yet to notice this approach costing me any
money. Not a nickel. In fact, ironically, in my business (and in
many), being somewhat difficult to get to actually helps rather
than hinders securing new clients and having those clients
appreciate and respect your time and assistance. Rightly or
wrongly, most folks don't put a lot of value on getting to the wise

Now, the cell phone—an evil invention if there ever was one.
People really feel compelled to answer these things 24/7. It is the

CHAPTER 3 / STOPPING "PRODUCTIVUS INTERRUPTUS" ONCE AND FOR ALL

_ft_ **NO B.s. Time Management** **for Entrepreneurs**

ultimate interruption welcome mat, and it has amazing, mysterious powers over its owner.

As comedian Dennis Miller says, I don't want to get off on a
rant here, but. . . increasingly, I am noticing men standing at urinals in public restrooms taking care of business while talking on
the phone simultaneously. Look, if you can't even pee in peace,
you are not Mr. Super-Important. You are Mr. Super-Stupid.

Personally, I refuse to own or use one at all. I had one for two
weeks once. Wound down the car window one day and threw it
as far as I could. Never been tempted again.

If you insist on carrying one of these miserable things, have
the good sense to turn it off. A lot. Like to walk to lunch with
coworkers or friends, eat, and actually digest what you eat. Or
pee. Or, say, navigate your SUV down the side of a mountain, on
an icy, curvy road. And have the common decency to turn it off
and shut up when you are seated next to me on an airplane
before I ram it down your throat.

In my seminars, by the way, we assess a $100.00 fine anytime
a cell phone erupts. And confiscate the offending phone for the
duration.

Often, the offenders have paid $2,000.00 to $5,000.00 to be in
the room. Many are also very good clients. I don't care. I will not
tolerate it. I warn everybody, I put some big, beefy bruiser in
charge of collecting, and I take the money. If you can't have your
life sufficiently in order to pay uninterrupted attention and be
courteous to others, I'd prefer you stay home and annoy someone else. I think restaurants and theaters ought to collect them
when you come in and give them back when you leave, like civilized saloons did with gunslingers' weapons.
The pay phone in a booth with a folding door on it was a
wonderfully civilized thing.

And a word to business owners, salespeople, and my pathetically desperate and paranoid speaking colleagues who devoutly
believe they must be instantly accessible at any and every
moment to every client and prospective client to prevent that
client from dialing the next number and doing business with
whomever answers instantly: if you are that interchangeable,
that mundane and ordinary a commodity, you've got big, big
problems, far bigger than you can solve by answering your cell
while you're on the can. Turn off the thing long enough to read
my No B.S. Sales Success book. That's urgent.

Maybe this will help: picture the poor fellow walking around
with cell phone in hand or on belt, or worse, with headphones
on, is like a big, dumb dog with collar and leash. Tug, tug, tug.
Yap, yap, yap. Pant, pant, pant.

If you walk upright, you ought to behave better than this.
And resent the leash.

**_Your "Steel_** **_Curtain" Telephone Defense_**
If you buy into this tactic at all, you will obviously need a good
screening system. What will protect you from the telephone? If
you have a live person, a receptionist or secretary or a receptionist plus a secretary, that's probably best. (If not, you'll have to use
voice mail or an answering machine.) Your receptionist or secretary needs a continually updated "VIP list" of people from whom
you will almost always take an incoming call, regardless of what
else you may be doing. This prevents you from missing calls you
really want, and it allows your assistant to screen all the other
calls with great confidence.

Keeping this VIP list up to date helps prevent screening faux
pas, however, even when a faux pas occurs, you must never sacrifice your assistant to the cause. You must support the person

doing your screening 100% of the time. A screener can only do
the job if she has complete confidence in what she's doing.

If you want staff to consistently put up a "Steel Curtain
Defense" comparable in strength and reliability to the famous
Pittsburgh Steelers' steel curtain defense of their glory years, you
have to give them the right tools, equipment, and support. ^ou

might wonder who's on my VIP List. I'll

appease your curiosity. At any one given time, there

are a dozen or so key private clients on that list—peo­

ple paying me sizable sums of money. I have several

very close associates on the list. A few very close

friends. And that's it. I'd say that a VIP list with more

than two dozen people on it is not a VIP list at all. In

my case, even the VIPs can't get through to me imme
diately, because I'm not there, but they will typically

get a return call the same day or the next day. On a

given day, a client might be given a direct line to where

I'm working, under extreme circumstances, but for

one-time use only. Oh, and even at the office, my staff

person only answers "live" one afternoon a week,

which is published and known to clients. Otherwise,

they get my voice mail. I really do have a steel curtain

defense.

You have to decide on the severity of the screening to be *

have a very tough-minded policy. First, all callers ARE asked FOR
their reason FOR calling. People refusing to provide G O O D information about their reason FOR calling NEVER gets a return CALL; in
fact, they never E V E N get entered on my CALL LOG. My staff person
IS asked to throw them into the trash; this eliminates a lot of junk.

Second, prospective clients ARE asked to send information in
writing, by mail or FAX, so that I C A N look at it at my convenience
A N D have the flexibility of responding as I judge best: calling, writI N G, sending information before calling, delegating, or referring

and your clients won't tolerate it. Pfui. It's not like I'm the president or the pope or J-Lo or anybody like that. I'm basically a selfglorified salesman. I've simply done the following three things
anyone can do:

1. Decided.
2. Deliberately positioned and marketed myself in a manner
conducive to controlling and limiting access.
3. Trained clientele. And they are trainable. When I was a
kid, I had litter-box trained pet rabbits that hopped back to
their cage to go to the bathroom. I once had a racehorse
trained to walk down the barn aisle and turn off the light
switches with his mouth. If you can teach a bunny rabbit
to go back to his cage to drop doody or a horse to flip light
switches, you can train humans to respect you and your
time and operate within a few simple rules.

You may or may not want to be as tough as I am. You may
not even want to be as tough as many of my clients and Inner
Circle Members who've adopted modified versions of my
approach. But I will bet you the biggest steak in Texas that you
_can benefit from a tougher screening process than you have now._
Think about it.

###### Fix the Fax
Next, we've got to gain control over and productively use the fax
machine. Now let me start by telling you that I'm not the world's
greatest fan of technology. But I really love the fax machine. I
think the fax machine is terrific. It's just about my favorite "appliance." (I have no earthly idea how the darned thing works, by
the way. It's amazing to me: I stick in a document in Phoenix,

CHAPTER 3 / STOPPING "PRODUCTIVUS INTERRUPTUS" ONCE AND FOR ALL

-----

NO B.s. **Time Management for Entrepreneurs ®-** 3i

push a button, and a fax machine in New Zealand spits it out
minutes later. And I thought the self-stick tab on the FedEx envelope was high tech!) Anyway, there are two really good ways to
use this magic box to enhance your personal productivity. But, before

I tell you about those, let's tackle "the dark side" of this thing—and

yes, the fax machine definitely has a "dark side,"
which I hate.

**_The Dark Side of Instant Communication_**
Here's the problem. People who send you faxes think that they've
instantly communicated with you and that they should get an immediate

response from you. Incredibly, they have this illusion
that faxing a document is exactly the same as plunking it into your
hands. I guess you're supposed to be sitting there, right next to the
fax, watching and waiting. Or that when a fax arrives, everybody's
supposed to drop what they are doing, snatch up that fax, burst into

your office, interrupt your meeting with the president or the
pope, and make you read that fax right now. This attitude was at
its worst when faxes were new, but it's still prevalent.

This was and occasionally still is a big problem for me. On a
typical day, there will be 20 to 30 to 50 "overnight faxes" waiting,
and, during the day, another 20,30, or more will come zipping in.
And remember, I'm not there anyway. So, my beleaguered staff
person takes care of the ones she can. The rest get separated into
those she judges to be urgent, which get forwarded to me by fax,
and those she believes can wait to go in with my week's mail.
Even when I was around, I refused to let people pressure me by
faxing, I refused to have my day's plan disrupted by faxes, I
refused to be controlled by someone else's priorities. So, we have
to educate clients about all this.

CHAPTER 3 / STOPPING "PRODUCTIVUS INTERRUPTUS" ONCE AND FOR ALL

self-stick

20,30,

-----

_ft_ **NO B.s. Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

Since I first penned those above paragraphs about fax, we've
added e-mail. Well, I haven't; I won't use that any more than I'll
use a cell phone. But you've added e-mail. Everything I just said
about faxes goes quadruple for e-mail. Listen up: you are not
obligated to respond to inbound e-mail instantly, quickly, or
ever. I don't need to tell you that if you don't stick a cork in this
widening hole, you'll drown trying to handle e-mail. Get tough
or die.

With each easier, faster means of communicating, the quantity
of dumb, junk communication has multiplied. Because sending
an e-mail is so easy and doesn't even require the labor of walking over to the fax machine, people send e-mails any time they
have a brain fart. One consultant friend of mine was getting 8 to
20 different, separate e-mails each day from one of his clients—
each time the client had a thought or question, zap went the e-mail.

In the corporate environment, the individual e-mails have
become another Time Vampire trick, a less laborious equivalent
of just popping in, standing in the doorway, saying "Got just a
minute?"

Again, you may or may not want or need to mirror me. But
if you're like many people, and you jump up every time the fax
machine beeps, you can't possibly be productive. If somebody
runs in to your office every time a fax arrives for you, you're destined for low productivity. If you're checking your e-mail constantly, compulsively, or worse, if you're responding to messages
as they arrive—you're headed for an early grave.
For somebody in an office, I think a good system is to take the
hour after lunch to look at the morning's faxes, e-mails, and
phone calls, deal ONLY with those that are genuinely urgent, and
set the others aside. Then, take the last hour of the day to look at

CHAPTER 3 / STOPPING " PRODUCTIVE INTERRUPTUS" ONCE AND FOR ALL

-----

**NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs ®** 33

the afternoon's accumulated incoming messages, quickly deal with

these most urgent and integrate all the rest into your next day's

plan. For road warriors, a strategy more like mine may be
appropriate.

For far too many people, the phone, the fax machine, e-mail, FedEx—heck,

for some people, the mail—invokes a Pavlovian, jump
up and instantly respond reaction. If it has never occurred
to you before, you ought to look at this now as weird behavior.
Who's in charge here anyway? Get a grip.

**_Finding Power in the Fax Mow,_**
back to ways to use the fax to enhance your productivity.
First of all, if you can train your clients, customers, associates,
vendors, and others to communicate with you by fax rather
than phone, that's a huge productivity advantage. It stops
phone tag. It reduces your return call burden. It gets information to you in a more organized way. Often, as people jot out
faxes they clarify their own thinking, even answer their own
questions. You can deal with these inbounds at your convenience, after hours, while traveling, whatever. When I come home—or

if traveling, when I arrive at my hotel—I'd much
rather have a stack of faxes than a stack of phone messages.
Have you ever gotten a phone message—"Call Bill as soon as
you can"—then not been able to reach him and had indigestion
after dinner and a sleepless night worrying about what Bill
wanted? If Bill had been trained to communicate with you
properly by fax, that just wouldn't happen.

Forcing faxes rather than e-mail will also be more productive
for you. I've looked at the e-mails people get and compared them
to the faxes I get. More thought goes into the faxes. People tend

to cluster multiple items into one fax vs. a stream of single item
e-mails. They are more inclined to resolve some things themselves when they must put them into a memo to be faxed than
when they can e-mail. The e-mail is more casual, and you really
don't want people feeling too casual about consuming your
time.

Come to your own conclusions about it all—fax, e-mail, cell.
But be the master, not the slave.

###### Set the Timer on the Bomb
If you do take an incoming call, when you get on the phone with
someone, it's a smart idea to set up the exit time first. For example, I'll often say:

_Tom, I have a conference call starting in just 15 minutes,_
_but I wanted to take your call—I_ _hope that will be enough time_
_for our discussion. Do you agree—or_ _should we set up another_
_telephone appointment?_

Tick, tick, tick.
When someone "drops in," and you decide to go ahead and
see them, then, when you bring them into your office, it's a smart
idea to set up the exit time first.

_Bob, it's difficult_ _these days for me to see drop-in visitors,_
_but it's good to see you. We'll only have half an hour, though,_
_but no longer, as I have an important conference call set for_
_4:00 P.M. That's OK, isn't it?_

Tick, tick, tick.
You may not win any awards for being sociable, but you'll
have shorter, more purposeful telephone conversations and
meetings. Drop-ins will gradually get the message. Callers will
gradually learn to call ahead and set up a phone appointment, or
at least, to prepare and be efficient when calling. I call this "setting the timer on the bomb." I even have a clock that looks just
like six sticks of dynamite wired together, with a timer on it, and
the timer has a flashing red light. This gets a lot of attention
plunked down in the center of the conference table. If you're not
going to do this physically, you at least want to do it verbally.

You see, most people will suck up about as much time as you let
_them. Salespeople feel productive and satisfied as long as they're_
talking with customers, and will even extend conversations with
a friendly customer as a means of avoiding the risk of confronting new prospects. Employees will dawdle in conversation;
it beats working! Conversations have a way of stretching to fill
whatever amount of time is available for them.

###### Be Busy and Be Obvious About It
Obviously busy people are interrupted less than unbusy people.
Just like burglars pass up some homes in favor of others, looking
for the easiest, safest targets, those who steal and suck up time by
interrupting others tend to cruise the office looking for the best
opportunity and the easiest target. If you are sitting at your desk,

comfortably, appearing relaxed, you're it. Of course, you might
be contemplating a formula for disarming a nuclear warhead,
but that won't matter, because it's not obvious.

When you are visible to others, it's best to be visibly busy.

_ft_ **NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs "Dan**

I believe this is. But I'll tell you some of the reasons why I believe
in its indescribably great importance.

First of all, being punctual gives you the right—the position-ing—to
expect and demand that others treat your time with
utmost respect. You cannot reasonably hope to have others treat
your time with respect if you show little or no respect for theirs.
So, if you are not punctual, you have no leverage, no moral
authority. But the punctual person gains that advantage over
staff, associates, vendors, clients, everybody.

###### Kennedy's #4 No B.S. Time Trttf li

Punctuality provides personal power.

###### The Tragic Case of the Doctor Who Couldn't Tell Time
Some years back, I had a client, a doctor of chiropractic, with a
million dollar a year practice and a rather large staff. It was particularly vexing to him that he was unable to rely on any of his
staff members to be punctual. Some were habitually late getting
to work on time. Others were habitually late getting back from
lunch. Others habitually fell behind in getting important paperwork done. And so on. He tried everything—punishments and rewards—and
nothing worked. Why? In all the years I knew him,
I can't recall this doctor ever getting anywhere on time himself.

le was even 20 minutes late one morning picking me up at my liotel

so I could go and teach a time management seminar to his
staff! Incredibly, my client never acknowledged the obvious
problem here. Maybe there weren't any mirrors in his house.

###### The Telling Connection Between Punctuality and Integrity It
is my conviction that a person who cannot keep appointments
on time, cannot keep scheduled commitments, or cannot stick to
a schedule cannot be trusted in other ways either.

Fundamental dishonesty expresses itself in many different
ways, but this is definitely one of them. I think it is significant that
the man I consider to be the most frequently and consistently dishonest and disreputable U.S. president of my lifetime, Bill Clinton—famous

for his tortured deconstruction of the word "is"—was
also notorious for being on "Clinton Time"—meaning
anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours late to everything, thus
being disrespectful to everyone.

There is a link between respect for others' time and respect
for others' opinions, property, rights, other kinds of agreements,
and contracts. A person reveals a great deal about himself by his
punctuality or lack of punctuality. So, as a general rule of thumb,
I use this as a means of determining whether or not I want to do
business with someone. And, when I violate this, as I occasionally
foolishly do, I always get burned.

Let me give you one example: a person seeking to do business with me arranged to meet me at an airport, where I had a 90-minute

layover. We agreed, and I confirmed by fax that we
would meet at my arrival gate, at my arrival time, and then go to

that airline's club room right there on the concourse for the meeting. When I arrived, the guy wasn't there. Some ten minutes
later, I'm paged and told to meet him in the main terminal where
he is because he ran late getting to the airport. It takes me ten
minutes on the tram to get to the main terminal, and I have to cut
another ten minutes out of our meeting to allow time to get back
to my gate. I have to go through this to meet with a man so disrespectful of a commitment made and of my time that he cannot
organize his life to arrive at a meeting on time in his own home
city. If he could not be relied on to honor such an easy commitment, why should anybody believe he would honor more important ones?

Still, violating my own rule, I went ahead and accepted this
guy as a client. It was predictably ugly. He lied, he cheated, he
was completely disorganized, dysfunctional, and unreasonable.
He sucked up a pretty good chunk of my time and cost me thousands of dollars to get rid of him. It's not the first time this scenario has taken place in my life. I suppose it won't be the last. But
it IS a very reliable principle:

_People who can't be punctual,_ _can't be trusted._

For ten years, I appeared 25 to 30 times each year on the numberone speaking tour in America, often addressing audiences of
10,000 to 25,000 people at each event. I was privileged to appear
on these programs with many famous speakers, authors, politicians, entertainers, and business leaders, including Paul Harvey,
Larry King, the late Coach Tom Landry, Coach Lou Holtz, former
Presidents Bush and Ford, Rev. Robert Schuller, "cookie queen"
Debbi Fields, Olympians Mary Lou Retton and Bonnie Blair,
speakers Zig Ziglar and Tom Hopkins, and the list goes on and

on. As the last speaker on a long, full day's program, it was very
i mportant to me that the speaker ahead of me stuck to his allotted time and finished on time. It is the professional thing to do. It is

respectful to the audience, respectful to the person hiring the
speaker, and respectful to the speaker who follows. Most of these
speakers understood this and performed accordingly. However, General

Colin Powell, who I followed some 40 times, couldn't
quite get it done for some reason, typically running 5,10, or even 15
minutes long—but at least he graciously urged the audience to
be sure and stay to hear me. Each year, I sent him a gag-gift clock
of one kind or another as a Christmas gift and gentle reminder of "our"

little problem.
One time, I spoke after then New York Governor Mario
Cuomo at one of these events. He was an unbelievable time hog.
He didn't just go 5 or 10 minutes beyond his 45-minute time—he
went an unbelievable 20 minutes over! On stage, facing the governor, was a big, digital, red-lighted timer flashing 00:00 after his
time ran out, flashing 00:00 for 20 minutes! He ignored it. Staff
people signaled him from the side of the stage. He ignored them. I

wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him.

###### A Simple Way to Favorably Impress Others
Now, here's a "success secret" for you: I'm not the only person
to have figured out this punctuality-integrity link. I'm just not
_that smart. I've stumbled on something that a whole lot of_
other smart, successful, and influential people already know
and secretly use to make their determinations about who they
will buy from or not buy from, do business with or not do business with, help or not help, trust or distrust. If you are not a

punctual person, others you wish to positively influence negatively judge you.

If you think that successful people—people you want to deal with—do
not have their own little "systems" for judging people,
you're very naive. Not only do they have such a system, most
successful people make a point of having "instant reject criteria,"
to save time in determining who they want to deal with and who
they don't.

Just recently, the owner of a printing company was referred
to me by a mutual friend. The printing company owner knew we
spent a lot of money on printing and was understandably eager
to try and get a piece of that business. He came to a meeting prepared with a beautiful portfolio of samples, carefully calculated
price proposals, and enthusiastic promises. I sat through it all
politely, but I'd made up my mind not to try him out before he
even got to the meeting—because he was 20 minutes late getting
there. Harsh? Maybe. I'd call it "tough-minded." Getting our
printing on time, as scheduled, as promised is critically important. Printed component parts of my products arrive on

a year late. For a direct-mail campaign, we may have half-a-ilozen

workers showing up on a given day to assemble sales let-lers,
brochures, and order forms; stuff envelopes; and get out a
mailing. If they arrive but the printing doesn't, nothing happens.
So when a printer can't get to the first meeting on time, I make
the "mental leap" to presuming he can't be relied on to get our jobs

done and delivered on time either.
One of my earliest business mentors said that there were only
two good reasons for being late for a meeting with him: one,
you're dead; two, you want to be.

So, to borrow from Dale Carnegie, if you want to win friends
and influence people, be punctual.

And, if you'd like to save yourself a lot of time and trouble,
start using this as a means of judging those who would do business with you.

###### Are Even a Person's Deepest, Darkest Psyche Secrets Revealed by Punctuality?
Punctuality even reveals a lot about an individual's self-esteem.
We all know that kids who vandalize other peoples' property for
sport, abuse their bodies with drugs, engage in promiscuous,
casual, unprotected sex, and otherwise sabotage themselves are,
in part, painfully demonstrating low self-esteem. They do not
feel that they are important; therefore, no one else and nothing
else is very important, and anyone or anything that does seem
important is deeply resented. I'd suggest that the adult who does
not keep such simple commitments as appointments is not only

to you that you and your time are unimportant but is
unwittingly revealing that he does not feel he and his time are
important either. He is, in essence, making a low self-esteem
statement.

Some people are deliberately late as a means of trying to be
and seem important. Their intended message is: I can keep you
waiting because I'm more important than you are. But the message they actually deliver, to those perceptive enough to read
behind the lines is: I don't have much self-respect, so I'm desperately trying to make myself feel more like a big shot by stealing
your time and getting away with it. Pathetic. And a big, fat warning signal. Deal with this person and you are letting yourself in

###### How a "Little Man" Reminds Us of "The Magic Power" 8,000 Times and Counting
Some of you may know that I'm a horse racing aficionado. **Id**
me, a bad day at the track beats a good day at the office. I could
relate when George Burns as God in the movie Oh God! headed
off to the track with a racing form stuck in his back pocket to
watch "the magnificent animals I created. I did very good work
there." The racetrack is one of the most interesting places on
earth. And there, like everywhere we really look, we can find
powerful reminders of what it takes to excel in this world.

At age 46, Laffit Pincay, Jr., had accomplished just about
everything a jockey can hope to accomplish. He had won the
Kentucky Derby, the Belmont, six Breeder's Cups, the Eclipse
Award five times, and he had already been in the Sports Hall of Fame—for

18 years. In 1995, he won his 8,000th race. He has
since retired at age 56.

A decade ago, you wouldn't have found any racing authority
who would have bet that Pincay would still be riding, winning,
and winning more frequently than most, at the old-for-athletes
age of 46, and on to 50. To a man, we would all have bet against

horse racing, you'll quickly see that this is no easy task. Perched
like a bird on top of an elephant, the jockey cannot control the
horse through brute strength. There is that, but there is more. A
horse either respects his jockey or he does not. Most respected
Pincay. A 115-pound embodiment of extraordinary, applied selfdiscipline that commanded respect from beast as well as man.

###### How to Make the World Hand Over Just about Anything You Ask
Having and commanding the respect of others is a tremendous
advantage in life. That edge comes from self-discipline. Having a
(preferably private) sense of superiority over others is another
power-producing edge. That, too, comes from self-discipline.
The highly disciplined individual does not have to point a gun at
anyone to take what he wants; people "sense" his power and
cheerfully give him everything they've got.

Take a look at how little discipline most people have. I admit,
I couldn't match Lafitt Pincay. One of America's greatest humorous speakers, Charlie Jarvis, tells of coming home from a trip and
confessing to his wife that he'd violated his diet and wolfed
down a Snickers bar at the airport snack shop. After she chided
him, he pointed out that he had actually demonstrated enormous
self-discipline: "I wanted to wolf down ALL the Snickers bars."
I'm sorry to say, I was in that category more often than not for

Lafitt

years. Still, compared to most of the people I observe, I was a selfdiscipline master even then. These days, I must control what I eat
much more carefully than ever. I peeled off 45 pounds from my
heaviest peak; I keep that off and my diabetes in check without
prescription medication of any kind. I must pay attention to carb
counts and blood sugar levels, and I take about 50 different vitamin, mineral, and herbal supplements a day. Compare that to the
average "wide-load" American, who can't go a full day resisting
junk food. In 2003, a record number of "million-dollar babies" in
the NFL showed up at camp overweight and out of shape.

I have noticed, since I took off my fat and got my physical
condition under better control, my income has gone up. Is this
coincidental? Maybe. Complex? Maybe. But quite probably it
reflects an unconscious preference on clients' part to have confidence in, to trust, to give money to, to meet the fee demands
without question of someone who appears to have self-esteem,
self-control, self-discipline. Food—pardon the word—for
thought.

As I was writing the first edition of this book, a young lady
named Shannon Faulkner concluded a two-year court battle in
order to gain entrance to the all-male military academy, The
Citadel. Her presence there was bitterly opposed by the administration, faculty, students, and alumni. On her day of arrival,
armed guards escorted her in. One week later, she quit. Setting
all political arguments aside, I believe that she or some woman in
her position could have won the grudging respect of a significant number of the other cadets, won over some, made allies,
and gotten through the academy—but, incredibly, with two
years to prepare, knowing that such a military academy features
tough physical as well as mental activity, knowing she would be
put upon—she showed up more than 20 pounds overweight and

CHAPTER 5 / THE MAGIC POWER THAT MAKES YOU UNSTOPPABLE

###### B.s.

clearly in no condition to withstand the rigors of the physical
training. On the first 100-degree day, Faulkner wound up in the
clinic with heat stroke. To be fair, four male cadets went with her.
But many more didn't. And she couldn't afford to. If she had possessed the self-discipline to thoroughly prepare for what was
obviously going to be a physical and emotional ordeal, she could
have earned the respect of enough people there to, first, survive;
second, gradually thrive; and overall, succeed. But in America
these days, people don't think they should have to earn anything
anymore. They feel entitled.

Take a look at how little self-discipline most people have. The
thousands of business owners I work with tell me more than half
their rank-and-file workers frequently show up late for work. Ask
any employer of size and you'll hear how big the problems of tardiness and absenteeism are. People do not even have enough selfdiscipline to get up in the morning! It seems that the majority of
today's work force cannot cannot be depended on to read, write,
count, or to do anything on their own to improve their skills.
(Which is why they are replaced by automation, relocation of jobs
to foreign lands, and through every other means possible.)

In my business dealings, I find more than half the people cannot seem to get to appointments and meetings on time or keep
preset telephone appointments. Clients miss pre-scheduled
coaching appointments. Vendors miss deadlines as often as they
make them.

Woody Allen once observed half of success seems to be
showing up. Ed Foreman, a popular motivational speaker, very
successful businessman, and, I think, the only man to be elected
to Congress representing two different states at two different
times, says you can be certain of rapid advancement in most
business organizations if you'll just do three things:

CHAPTER 5 / THE MAGIC POWER THAT MAKES YOU UNSTOPPABLE

pre-scheduled

-----

**NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs 0** **si**

1. Show up.
2. Show up on time.
3. Show up on time, ready to work. So few do.
Lafitt Pincay, Jr., never failed to show up, show up on time, 110%

ready to give each ride his very best effort.
In the entrepreneurial environment, it is much the same.
There's a lot to be said just for showing up on time, ready to
work. (Not hung over. Not exhausted. Not distracted.) The
meeting of deadlines and commitments alone causes a person
to stand out from the crowd like an alien space ship parked in
an Iowa cornfield. The ability to get things done and done right
the first time will magnetically attract incredible contacts,
opportunities, and resources to you. All of this is a matter of
self-discipline.

###### Kennedy's #6JTo
 B.S. Time Truth

Self-discipline is MAGNETIC.

And self-discipline aimed and applied at a particular thing,
as I do to writing, as Pincay does to fitness, is quite literally a
magic power. When you focus your self-discipline on a single
purpose, like sunlight through a magnifying glass on a single
object, look out! The whole world will scramble to get out of your
way, hold the doors open for you, and salute as you walk by. E>an

###### The Inextricable Link between Time Management and Self-Discipline

It takes tremendous self-discipline to productively allocate and
invest time and to stick to your intentions. It's said that "the road
to hell is paved with good intentions," and I believe it. Although
some people find it hard to believe, I'm one of the laziest guys on
the planet. There's no internal force that drives me to work.
Every morning, I have a little fight with myself, and I have to
force myself to haul it out of bed and into the office. On the road,
I may sit on the edge of the bed and glare at my laptop and battle with my lazy self to do what I need to do. And I could quite
happily forget it all, go find a hammock on the beach, and sleep
all day long.

I think this is a secret true of a lot of very successful people.
I think they are secretly lazy and become exceptionally selfdisciplined out of necessity.

Because the entrepreneur is his own boss and can do as he
pleases with his time, it is very important to be self-disciplined.
The entrepreneur with a loose, buddy-buddy, easily forgiving
boss will never accomplish much. It is the entrepreneur with the
tough taskmaster as a boss who excels.

###### "Success Leaves Clues"
Tony Robbins says, "Success leaves clues." It seems that the
Creator thought it a good idea to leave clues to success all over
the place, so that—if you have your eyes open—you can't stand
in any one place, turn all the way around, and not find one. You
can go to the racetrack, of all places, and find clues. You can
watch sports on TV and find clues. You can pick up a magazine

find clues. You can drive down a street and look at the busi-nesses

and see clues.
The one thing that seems universal is that self-discipline is I

In business, there are good strategies poorly executed, poor ir.itegies

executed well, but rarely is there a truly new, revolu-tionary
strategy. In this chapter are ten good strategies. Nothing e.irth-shaking,

nothing revolutionary, probably nothing you
don't already know. The issue is execution, not innovation.

The "joke" in the weight-loss industry, where I find myself doing

marketing consulting from time to time, is this: if there
were a diet that worked, there'd only be one diet. Similarly, you l

< >uld reasonably argue that if there was one time management
system that worked perfectly for everybody, there'd be only one
system. The good news is that, in a way, there IS just one time
management "system," and it's all here in this chapter.

If you read every time management book ever written, go to
every time management seminar offered, and, more importantly,
observe and analyze lots of people who get an exceptional quantity of important things accomplished, you will be able to boil
ALL the technique "stuff" down to only ten things worth doing.
So, let me save you all that time and just hand them to you here.
I'll note, too, that all ten might not apply to you and your situations. When it's all said and done, you sort of have to find your
own way.

###### Technique #1: Tame the Phone
As I discussed in detail elsewhere in this book, you've got to free
yourself from the tyranny of the phone. And the fax. And e-mail.
And similar stuff. Take few if any incoming calls. Return your
calls at your convenience. As this is the number-one source of
disruption and distraction for most people, you must get a firm
grip on this technique.

CHAPTER 6 / THE TEN TIME MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES REALLY WORTH USING

<

_ft NO B.s._ **Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

###### Technique #2: Minimize Meetings
Find every way possible to minimize your time spent in formal
meetings. Most meetings end where they begin anyway.

**I deal with one company where literally every time I call,**
anyone I call is always "in a meeting." The company has six conference rooms—a very bad sign. If Noah had convened a meeting of architects, interior decorators, goat and sheep herders, lion
tamers, navigators, we would all have fins. Nothing ever got
done in a meeting. I hate 'em.
For a lot of people, meetings are a place to hide out. Or preen
and be important. But not a place to actually do work or get anything done. You need a strategy to avoid them. If you lead meetings, you need a strategy to abbreviate and focus them. If you
must attend meetings, you need a strategy to escape from them
at will.

O h, and here's a "little tip" that saves me quite

a bit of time: stop meeting people at restaurants for

lunch or drinks, or whatever. Four out of five times,

they'll keep you waiting. For years, when I spent time

at an office, if I was going to lunch with somebody, I

had them first come to my office, then we would go

from there. Then, when they were 20 minutes late, I got

to do 20 minutes of real work. If you must go to such

an "off-site" meeting place, have something to read or

some work to do with you.

###### Technique #3: Practice Absolute Punctuality
See Chapter 4.

###### Technique #4: Make and Use Lists
There is not a single time management discipline or system on
earth that doesn't revolve around making and using lists. You
CANNOT carry it all in your head. For years, I've operated with
four basic lists:

1. My Schedule. This is for the entire year, day by day.
_2. Things to Do List. My basic "Things to Do" list is organized_
by the month, the week, and each day, prioritized as A's,
B's, and C's. Management consultant (and "hustler") Ivy
Lee reportedly sold this idea to billionaire industrialist
Andrew Carnegie's right-hand man, Charles Schwab, for
$25,000.00. It worked for Schwab. It works for just about
everybody who uses it now.
3. People to Call List. My third list is a "People to Call" list,
also prioritized alphabetically.
4. Conference Planner. And finally, I have the "Conference Planner"—just

a page for each person I interact with a lot,
where I jot down things I need to talk to them about as
they occur to me in between meetings or conversations.

To be perfectly honest, I do this with a yellow legal pad and
pages I most often carry folded up in my pocket. And I'll admit
that this is not exactly a shining example for a time management
"leader" to set, but I've found that this works just as well for me
as a number of different, more organized and formal systems I've
tried. Over the years, I've experimented with the Day-Timer and

CHAPTER 6 / THE TEN TIME MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES REALLY WORTH USING

-----

_ft NO B.s._ **Time Management for Entrepreneurs Incidentally,**

if you are a "free spirit," you might

think something like these lists to be intolerably confin
ing, like a pair of jockey shorts mistakenly bought one

size too small. (What?—like I'm the only one to ever

make that mistake.) Actually, once you get used to using

these lists, you'll find them mentally, creatively liberating.

Why? Because the more details you get on paper, the

fewer you must remember and worry about remember
ing. This frees your mind up for more important tasks.

several other systems, even one I designed myself. Anyway, the
"magic" is more in the making and using the lists than in the particular tool, media, or format you use.

I also use a "storyboard" for planning, somewhat like the
storyboard used to plan a TV program or movie. My speaking
colleague Mike Vance, author of Think Outside the Box, teaches
this method. As I've had Mike speak twice to my Inner Circle
Members in past years, quite a few of my Members and clients
have learned this and use it, reporting great results.

I'm usually amused by people dependent on their Palm Pilot
devices and laptops for their schedules, plans, and lists. On more
than one occasion, I've heard them wailing about the machine
gleefully erasing everything and leaving them with a blank
screen. Or watched their batteries go dead. So far, the tri-folded
pages in my jacket pocket and pen have not failed me.

Ultimately, though, whether with crayon and pad or computer, you have got to get some sort of regimented, regularly

CHAPTER 6 / THE TEN TIME MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES REALLY WORTH USING

(What?—like

**B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs ft 59** **lined**

list-making system working for you. If you aren't making
lists, you probably aren't making a lot of money either.

###### Technique #5: Fight to Link Everything to Your Goals

**(The secret reason why there aren't more millionaires) My**
speaking colleague Jim Rohn often says that the only real rea-(in
more people do not become millionaires is that they don't
have enough reasons to. It's certainly not lack of opportunity! 100k

around. You can't pick up a magazine without reading of
people who've taken very ordinary ideas, even weird ideas, and
used them to become rich. You can't pick up a magazine and not
read of someone who has scrambled up out of poor circumstances and gotten rich. So why don't more people become mil-lionaires?

They just don't have enough reasons to.
Similarly, I insist that the only real reason more people aren't much,

much more productive is that they don't have enough reasons to. So, a secret to greater personal productivity is more good
reasons to be more productive. That's why you have to fight to link

everything you do (and choose not to do) to your goals.
Frankly, this is very difficult. You've undoubtedly heard the
adage: when you're up to your neck in alligators, it's difficult to
remember that your original objective was to drain the swamp.
And, having been up to my neck in alligator-filled swamp water
more often than I like to remember, I know just how tough it is to
keep at least one eye fixed firmly on your list of goals. But that's
EVERYTHING. That is what gets goals achieved. And that is
what creates peak productivity, as I'll explain.

In the 1980s, "productivity" was a big, big buzzword. There
were all sorts of folks running around teaching businesses
and businesspeople every conceivable gimmick for improving

CHAPTER 6 / THE TEN TIME MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES REALLY WORTH USING

Rohn

-----

_ft_ NO B **.s. Time Management for Entrepreneurs productivity—without**

ever defining or (I contend) knowing what
the heck productivity was. For corporations, there was regurgitated Demingism, Japanese management styles, MBO, MBV,
and on and on. All in search of an invisible, ill-defined intangible.

If you're going to achieve peak personal productivity, you've
got to define peak personal productivity.

Here's an old joke: the wife prevails upon her husband, an
avid hunter, to take her along on the annual deer hunting trip, so
she can finally see what all the fuss is about. To keep her out of
harm's way, he stations her at the bottom of a hill and instructs
her to shoot her gun into the air as a signal if she spots deer. Then
he and the other guys head off through the woods, toward the
creek, where deer are likely to be found. About ten minutes later,
they hear not one but four quick shots. They race back to the hill,
where the wife is standing, pointing her rifle at a fellow standing
next to a fallen, dead horse. The guy is saying, "OK lady, it's your
deer. But at least let me get my saddle."

If you don't know what peak personal productivity looks
like, how are you gonna hit it?

So, here's my definition:
Note that this definition presupposes the existence of meaningful goals. I don't know of a single successful individual, in productivity

**is the deliberate, strategic investment**
**of your time, talent, intelligence, energy, resources,**
**and opportunities in a manner calculated to move you**
**measurably closer to meaningful goals.**

field, who isn't goal-directed, and who is not involved in measuring,

preferably daily, movement toward those goals. Paul Meyer,
founder of Success Motivation Institute, once stated that, 11
you are not achieving what you feel you should in life, it is because

your goals are not defined well enough. But my defini-tion
of productivity goes beyond that. It says that you cannot be productive

without goals, in fact, without linkage with goals. It says
you cannot be productive without measurement.
This gives you a very simple standard for determining, minute

by minute, task by task, choice by choice, whether you .ire
being productive or unproductive:

Is what I am doing, _this minute, moving me measurably_
_closer to my goals?_

Now, to be reasonable, and to be human, let's cheerfully
acknowledge that nobody can—or should—be able to say "yes"
to that question all of the time. We need, want, and deserve time
for casual conversation, for baseball scores, for political arguments, for reading the comics, for just plain goofing off. But you
want to do those things knowingly, consciously, by choice, not by
random accident or others' direction.

I'd say that anything beyond a 50% "yes rate" qualifies as
peak personal productivity. Incidentally, measurement alone will
enhance your productivity. Just asking the question will enhance
your productivity. Any athlete will tell you that measurement
alone improves performance.

###### Technique #6: Tickle the Memory with Tickler Files
I've got a memory like a steel trap. A rusted steel trap. Seems a
lot seeps out through those rust holes. For example, I seem to

have mental blocks about how old people are (the ONLY person's age I know is mine), birthdays, anniversaries, holidays,
peoples' names. With this in mind, I wrote a country-western
song: I Love My Wife But I Can't Remember Where I Live. Perversely,
**I can perfectly recall the lyrics from 20-year-old songs, obscure**
actors' names, and a collection of other useless trivia. If I could
remember to phrase it as a question, I'd go on Jeopardy! and get
rich. Seriously, I need tools and systems to substitute for memory.
The Tickler File is one of my favorites.

The more I use this technique, the better I like it, although it
does work much better for someone who gets to his desk everyday than for someone as mobile as I. The idea is simple: you have
90 file folders: numbered 1 through 30; blue numbered 1 through
30; and white 1 through 30 representing the current month, next
month and the month after that. This is most commonly used by
accountant-type folks, to keep track of bills to be paid. (We use it
for that purpose in our office.) But it can be used for anything.
Let's assume you agree to follow up with a client on a particular
matter on the tenth of next month. Take either that client's whole
file or just that piece of correspondence or just a handwritten
note and plop it into the Blue file folder numbered 10. And forget it. On the 10th of next month, it'll pop up all by itself and
remind you to do it. Used right, these Tickler Files reduce clutter,
serve as automatic memory, and help organize daily activities.

Yes, I know there are all sorts of "contact management programs" for desktop and laptop computers that do this same
thing, and if you want to go that way, by all means, be my guest.
For me, though, this would be one of those examples of using
technology just because the technology exists, not because it's
better. Running my Tickler Files on my laptop would require me

**to input** or scan in stuff needlessly, and it still wouldn't accom-modate
the "lumpy stuff," like a whole client file or a 56-page mtomercial

proposal or, well, you get the idea. But whether you
choose manual or automated, this is a very good technique.

###### Technique #7: Block Your Time Mere
is one of the real, hidden secrets of people who consistently achieve

peak productivity: make inviolate appointments with
yourself. You know, we all do a pretty good job at keeping the
appointments we make with others. We have this skill down. So,
why not use it to get things done?

I am completing this book in December. As of the writing of
this edition of this book, my calendar for next year has nine days
assigned to doing tele-coaching sessions with 45 Gold /VIP
Members, 22 days to mastermind meetings with VIP and
Platinum groups, eight travel days related to those meetings, five
speaking engagement days, three travel days for those, and ten
days of pre-arranged vacations. That's 57 of 365 blocked. Then
there are holidays, a couple of birthdays, Super Bowl Sunday,
that sort of thing, another ten. Only 298 days remain available.
But that's still a lot of days to wander and meander around in.
The less wandering and meandering the better. The more time
gets blocked, the less room there is to aimlessly meander. So I
also go ahead and block out the times I'll record my monthly
tapes for Gold Members, the days I'll use to write my newsletter,
other reoccurring activities. On a week-to-week basis, I block the
morning hours when I write and the Monday and Wednesday
evenings when I drive in harness races. For the year, for the quarter immediately ahead, for the month ahead, and week ahead, I

try to leave as little "loose" or unassigned time as possible. Then
I treat the blocked times—even those that are work appointments
or play appointments with myself—just as inviolate as I do a
paid speaking gig or consulting day.

One of the things I'm asked most often about my own work
habits is how I manage to do so much writing along with everything else I do. Just to quickly tick these things off, during the
year I speak, spend 30 or 40 single days of consulting with new
clients, service two dozen or so consulting clients at any one
time, attend several major multi-day conventions, run my own
publishing and mail-order business, and attend other business
interests, investments, and my racing activities. Then on top of
all that, I write at least one book a year for trade publishers that
go into the bookstores, edit two monthly newsletters, and do a
tremendous amount of advertising copywriting for my clients.
How do I do all that writing?

There are two answers. First, I write for at least one hour
every morning, virtually no matter what. The first hour of my
morning, sometimes 5:00 to 6:00, often 6:00 to 7:00, occasionally
7:00 to 8:00, I write. At home, on the road, doesn't matter.
Weekdays or weekends, doesn't matter. Tired or not, doesn't matter. Inspired or not, doesn't matter. If I am under a tough copywriting deadline for a client, I'll give the hour to that task. Most
days, that first hour goes to my own books, tapes, and newsletters. Second, I block time often weeks and occasionally months in
advance, as appointments with myself for certain writing projects. If I did not "block time" this way, I assure you, I'd get a fraction of this output done, and I'd be woefully behind all the time.

In short, if you lay your calendar out before you and pre-assign
or block as much of your time as possible, as much in advance as possible—carved

in rock not written lightly in pencil—you will

years back, I was counseling a chiroprac
tor new to practice and advised her to close her office

for one day a week, call that "Marketing Day," and

devote that entire day to calling patients, visiting health
food stores, calling on businesses, giving speeches, and

so on. Left to be "fit in" as time allowed, most of these

very productive things would never have happened.

then leave yourself only a small amount of loose, unassigned
time. Further, by blocking time for important, high-value func-tions

you perform, you prevent demands of others from moving
your highest and best-value activities from number one to num-ber

ten on your list, over and over again.

###### Technique #8: Minimize Unplanned Activity Uy
reducing unscheduled time and unplanned activity, you automatically reduce waste.

If you look around carefully, you'll see that most people just
sort of show up. They arrive at the office and react. If you press
them for their day's plan, you'll find they may have only one or
two scheduled activities—one of which is usually lunch. (That
attitude reminds me of the Peanuts cartoon: what class do you
like best? Recess.) They may also have a few things on a "loose"
things-to-do list. All the unscheduled time somehow gets used
up, but if you again press them at the end of the day, or better yet,
at the end of the week, they cannot tell you where it went.

Just as the person who cannot tell you where his money goes
is forever destined to be poor, the person who cannot tell you
where his time goes is forever destined to be unproductive. And,
often, poor.

Ideally, you should schedule your day by the half-hour, from
beginning to end.

If you do project work as I do, it's important to estimate the
minutes or hours required and work against the clock, against
deadlines. Every task gets completed faster and more efficiently
when you have determined in advance how long it should take
and set a time for its completion. This, too, minimizes unplanned
activity.

###### Technique #9: Profit from "Odd-Lot" Time

Stuck in traffic? Audiocassette tapes and CDs—arguably the
greatest educational inventions since the Gutenberg press—let
you easily and cheaply turn your car into a classroom, a seminar
with America's best speakers, an uplifting literary experience, a
laugh-filled comedy club, or a Shakespearean festival. Just about
every notable self-improvement, sales training, marketing or
business expert, author or speaker has a variety of material
available in audio form. (For a catalog of mine, log onto
[www.dankennedyproducts.com.) But you needn't stop there.](http://www.dankennedyproducts.com)
Information about any and every topic, from experts ranging
from noted college professors to nutrition, health, and fitness
gurus to, well, you name it, is available in audio form. Books on
tape or CD provide great readings and condensations of everything from the greatest literature of all time to the most contemporary novels. If you need some endorphin therapy, pick up

of the great radio comedies of old, or famous comics like Hob
and Ray, or very current stand-up comedians. Or learn a for-eign
language, improve your memory, improve your math skills, ill
by plugging in a cassette tape or CD during otherwise wasted
lime.

Waiting time in offices, airports? Take along a cassette or CD
player and an earplug or a file of magazines and newsletters to go

through at your convenience. Keep handy a notepad, a pen, .ind

a topic to think about and brainstorm. Have mini-projects .ind
throw-away reading with you or Psycho-Cybernetics mental exercises

to do (for more information see Chapter 12). As they
say in Washington, a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon
you're spending real money. Well, five minutes here, ten minutes I

here, and pretty soon you're wasting hours.

###### Technique #10: Live Off Peak
Why make life more difficult than it already is?

There are obvious ways to use this technique. For example,
avoid going to the bank on Fridays, especially after 11:00 A.M., and

especially if it is the 1st or 15th of the month. Avoid going to
the supermarket the day before a holiday weekend. Avoid going
to the post office the day after a rate increase (an unfortunately increasingly

common occurrence).
**I suppose everybody knows these things. But there are many**
similar patterns and instances of "herd behavior" that you can
avoid. In Phoenix, where I lived for 24 years, I could drive from
my home to my office in ten minutes if I did it after 9:00 A.M., but it

took a half hour or more if I tried it between 7:30 and 8:30 A.M.

three right turns and go around a block than to wait in line and
make one left turn.

On the road, I try to avoid having to check out and leave a
hotel between 8:00 and 9:00 A.M. or checking in between 4:00 and
6:00 P.M., because that's when everybody else checks in and out.
When you take note of these things and organize your life to
work around them, you can save a lot of time and avoid a lot of
frustration.

absolutely no apology for striving to be rich and for
teaching and inspiring others to do the same. Furthermore, I
believe you have every right to figure out ways to make maximum money from minimum time. When you can honestly apply
the axiomatic advice of "work smarter, not harder," more power
to you! I do not think any special heroism comes from earning
your money through back-breaking work or long hours.

My Platinum Member Ron LeGrand, who has bought and
"flipped" thousands of properties and teaches his real estate profit
methods to thousands of investors each year, has a pet saying:

_success—to_

_equal_

-----

**®** **NO** **6.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

"The less I do, the more I make." It is obviously open to misinterpretation. Ron works and does so cheerfully. But he has learned
to focus on work that directly produces wealth.

I suspect I am unique in working up close, personal, hands-on
with more than 100 first-generation millionaire and multimillionaire entrepreneurs, most of whom built their wealth by creating
and building new businesses from scratch, many of whom hit the
million-dollar mark in a hurry. I have been in their offices, they
in mine; had hundreds of hours of telephone conversations with
them; worked with them individually and in groups; and had
countless opportunities over years to observe their behavior and
probe their psyches. My Renegade Millionaire System and oncea-year seminar I hold deal exclusively and extensively with
what separates these "renegade millionaires" from the pack.
(For more information about my system and seminars, go to www.renegademillionaire.com.)

One of the key factors in their
success is the way they link time to money, and think in terms of
investing time. Most, like Ron, are always looking for ways to get
more for less, invest fewer minutes of work, extract more dollars.

One way they do this is by making themselves into bona
fide experts in some field, one thing from which wealth can
come. There is the old story about the customer angrily
demanding an itemized bill from the plumber, who submitted a
$250.00 bill for two minutes' work—smacking the clogged pipe
with a hammer. The plumber wrote out the itemized bill as follows: For hitting pipe with hammer: $5.00. For knowing where
to hit pipe with hammer: $245.00. Getting into that position—
when you can be paid not (just) for what you do (physical
labor) but for what you know (intellectual equity)—is a very
worthy objective.

So, let there be no mistake. I think you deserve to be rich. I I
hink you have a right to be rich. I think you provide enormous
service to society by getting and being rich. I think government
should be forbidden from penalizing or attacking you for being
rich.

###### "On the Other Hand ..."
With all that said, though, I have to suggest that money isn't
everything.

It is a lot easier to give the "money isn't everything" and
"money doesn't buy happiness" lecture after you have a considerable amount of money than before. Personally, I always resented
hearing it when I was broke. And believe me, I understand that
a person NEEDS a certain level of financial success before he can
give a great deal of thought to the bigger philosophical issues of
life. And I think in our land of great opportunity, it is disgraceful
not to do well. I don't see any honor in being poor. No shame in it

as a temporary condition but there should be shame if being
poor is accepted as a permanent way of life. But, to be certain,
money is only part, and maybe a small part, of "wealth."

On a surprisingly cool summer morning in Cleveland, Ohio,
I sit in a dirty jog cart (the work-a-day version of a sulky), reins
in hands, bouncing along behind an aging, mildly lame,
Standardbred horse on the Northfield Park backstretch. Damp
dirt, gravel, and bits of manure are kicked up past the mud
screen onto my boots and pants, occasionally hitting my face. I
am in seventh heaven. Of course, I'm just fooling around. But
most of the folks there doing the same thing and taking care of
these horses as work are in seventh heaven too. They couldn't

imagine doing anything else. On this particular day and night, a
70-year-old man, Earl Bowman, and his wife, Joanna, were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. Earl, a retired driver and
still a very good trainer, took his horse to the paddock, took care
of it and worked just as he would any other night. After the race,
Joanna joined him as he led the horse into the winners' circle for
the photo. Then he took the horse back to the barns where he had
another hour's work ahead of him, stripping off the harness,
bathing the horse, walking the horse to cool him out, bandaging
the horse's legs, and so on. And if you asked Earl if he could have
gone anywhere else or done anything else on that night, what
would he wish for, he'd have no answer. This is wealth.

On a Thursday afternoon, General Norman Schwarzkopf
finishes his speech on leadership; the emcee quickly introduces
me; I step to the stage in The Palace in Auburn Hills, Michigan,
where the Detroit Pistons play basketball; I address more than
20,000 people for an hour and then answer questions and sign
autographs. When all the dust settles, I earn about $25,000.00
from the audience's purchases of my books and tapes. A few
weeks later in Phoenix, I have 22 people in a three-day seminar,
each paying $2,500.00 to be there, and I talk to them about my
favorite subject: direct marketing. I and the group "brainstorm"
each attendee's business and project. In these situations, I'm
having a ball. It definitely beats REALLY working for a living!
_This is wealth._

Many days, I get paid handsomely to consult with interesting
people, one on one, and help them figure out the best answers to
their marketing problems. Other days, I sit at my computer and
create powerful sales letters and marketing documents for my
clients or my own products. Or I write newsletters, articles, and
books like this one. I enjoy every minute of it. This is wealth.

that these tilings have different meanings for different people. You
do not necessarily need a million dollars in the bank or a huge
home on the hill or Jay Leno's fleet of expensive cars in order to be
wealthy. Many people manage to get rich, but comparatively few
get wealthy. As long as you're going to put in your time on the
planet, why not invest it in a way that makes you wealthy?
Napoleon Hill, most famous for his classic best-selling book, Think

_and Grow Rich, spent his entire life encouraging people to_
pursue great goals, including financial riches. Hill was originally
set out on his mission by America's first billionaire, Andrew
Carnegie, who believed there were "universal principles of success" that could be taught and learned, just as any other collection of mechanical skills could be learned. Carnegie helped get
Hill in-depth interviews and relationships with hundreds of the
greatest achievers of that era. Hill identified 13 commonalties,
and wrote about them, first in The Laws of Success, then in Think
_and Grow Rich. Following publication of that book in 1937,_
Napoleon Hill lectured, trained large sales organizations, recorded
inspirational messages, and, in various ways, distributed his
"science of success" based on those 13 principles.

Late in his life, Napoleon Hill wrote another book I highly recommend: Grow Rich with Peace of Mind. In this book, after acquiring great riches, losing great riches, and a long career, Napoleon
Hill did his best to reconcile the issues of pursuing great financial
success and achieving total wealth, in the bigger, broader sense.

to be as valuable as possible. That's what I'll talk with you about
in this chapter: how to travel for business with as much productivity as possible. But I do want to be totally honest about this—

Long before 9-11,1 was well on my way to slashing
my business travel, and now travel less than in any of the prior 15

years.

As an aside, I believe a law should be passed requiring every
airline executive, on his birthday, to go out to dinner, to his l.ivorite

restaurant, with family and friends. While the rest of the
party can order anything they choose from the menu, the execu-tive

will get a standard airline dinner. After he gets frisked. And I
ie has to eat every bite. I devoutly wish all the flight attendants
who so obviously hate their jobs, hate their employers, and resent

the passengers would have the integrity to quit and go I
ind something else to do. Every time an airline employee lies,
his nose should grow. And the hotel industry should be prohibi ted by an act of Congress from ever using the term "hospitality industry"

again. Hospitality my eye.
Anyway, travel is agony for me, which makes me a little
obsessive about eking out every ounce of productivity from every
trip. Here, I am telling you what I did to survive my peak travel
years as well as what I still do when I must pack up and go.

###### Jam as Much Business into Each Business Trip as Possible
Planning is everything. Once it's determined that I have to go to
X city for a particular purpose, then the race is on to find other
productive things I can do in that same city or in other cities conveniently located en route. I detest having to get on an airplane,
fly somewhere, and come back, all for just one "event."

I think this discipline can extend to everybody. I'm often

jumping from one end of their territory to another, back and
forth, able to fit in only a few appointments a day when they
could double or triple that if determined to do so. I observe service business owners, such as lawn and garden services, pest control services, etc., using shotgun, scattered marketing and winding
up with customers here, there, and everywhere. Instead, if they
concentrated on dominating a few "tight" geographic areas, they
would likely have lots of customers in one place, giving them
maximum efficiency in delivering services.

Here's an example of the kind of smart scheduling I like to do:
I was booked to speak in Florida on a Thursday, and in the middle of the country the following Tuesday. This allowed me to give
a break on expenses to an East Coast consulting client and sell
him a day, actually two half-days: Thursday afternoon and Friday
morning. I still had time Friday to get to Chicago and get to my
favorite harness racing track by its 7:00 P.M. post time and enjoy
an evening at the races. Saturday I had lunch with an old friend
and a brief, late-afternoon meeting with a prospective client.
Sunday was a "dead day"; I stayed in my hotel room and worked
on writing projects. Monday, at the airport where I had to change
planes, I arranged a two-hour meeting with two business partners, each of whom flew in for the meeting from their homes in
two different cities. Monday evening I did a radio talk show interview over the phone, just as I would have if I had been home.
None of this happened by accident. Once I had the two "bookend" dates locked in, I very deliberately went to work to fill in the
four days in between. My little hierarchical checklist is as follows:

 - What can I try to plug in that is directly revenue positive?

 - Can I plug in meetings with business partners or courtesy
meetings with ongoing, continuing clients or meetings

CHAPTER 8 / ON THE ROAD AGAIN. I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO GET ON THE ROAD AGAIN.

-----

**NO 6.S.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs ft 79**

with my publishers, agents, media contacts, etc., that are
indirectly productive?

 - Finally, should I plug in any goof-off stuff?

I apply this checklist often. For example, a speaking engage-ment

in Las Vegas forced me to leave my Ohio home. As soon as I
hat commitment took its square on the calendar, I booked a
week in a suite at the Paris hotel, then began "fleshing in" the
week. I wound up with the speech the morning of the first day, a lunch

meeting with a continuing client on that same day, a paid
day of consulting the last day (with a client flying there from Los
Angeles) and three days of vacation in between—cheated only
with a two-hour tele-seminar I hosted from my hotel room. Behind

the Vegas week, I wedged in a stop in Phoenix to visit my
own office and for a luncheon speaking engagement. On the
front side of the trip, I first flew to Denver for a speaking engagement there.

Whether you are leaving your home base to go out into your
own city for the day or to distant locales, you ought to work at
making the entire foray as valuable as possible.

###### Where Are those "Friendly Skies," Anyway?
Next, there's the airplane trip itself.

When I first started flying on business, it was civilized.
People waited to be called to board, no elbowing, pushing, trampling. At least in first class, the stewardesses—yes, I used that word—were
actually nice to you. One for every four passengers.
Cheerfully helped you find places for your carry-ons. Other passengers behaved themselves. Wore socks with their shoes. Did
not fill their space and half of yours with an array of gadgetry

stewardesses—yes,

that'd make a Radio Shack window display look inadequate
Shut up and read a book. The food was edible, the air was breathable. All a distant memory.

Personally, I always fly first class. I do too much of it, I'm too
big of a guy, I'm too easily irritated while traveling to tolerate a"
the built-in abuse of coach class travel. Still, even as I'm endurin
the hardships of first class, I'm still able to be productive doin
some work on just about every long flight.

**_Catch Up on Reading and Snoozing_**
I find airports and long flights great places to catch up on read
ing materials that can be discarded afterward. I'll often stuff
pile of catalogs, newsletters, trade journals, and magazines into
the outer pouch of my suitcase. I'll leave with a big, fat bulge bu
return with a thin envelope of torn-out pages or articles, havin
thrown out 90% of it as I finished reading it. Not only is this
good use of airplane time, but there's a significant psychic satis
faction to lightening your load as you go. I recommend this t
anybody who "gets behind" in reading trade and professiona1

journals or similar discardable materials.

Airplane flights are also good for "noodling" a possible solution to a particular problem. The isolation, relative quiet, and
freedom from ordinary interruptions provide an environment
conducive to thinking. Also, the first-class cabin is a good place
to make useful business contacts. But, frankly, I sleep more than
half of all the flight time.

**_Don't Be on the Last Plane Out_**

going, and you should always have information with you about .illernate,

back-up flights. If you travel a lot, you are already .i
ware that the frequency of mechanical delays due mostly to the •iging

of the fleets keeps getting worse, year to year. I may hold the
record, though, for getting nailed by this sort of thing. Several
years ago, I was on the last America West flight from Phoenix to l

both enroute to speaking engagements on the same program. I

hat night, America Worst managed not one, not two, but three (onsecutive

Iter an hour, while we were taxiing toward take-off, another, diflerent problem erupted. We went back to the airport and after
more delay were taken off the plane. After more delay, they brought

a different plane, which, after we had boarded, experienced a mechanical problem! Don't take the last flight!

Making off-peak connections is important; you want to avoid
rush hour at Atlanta or O'Hare or actually, anywhere, if you can.

I'm good at avoiding lengthy connections, and I do not find
the airline "club rooms" very desirable. But many frequent business travelers use these a lot. Actually, I tend to use the
Continental Club in my home city airport pre-departure more
than anywhere else.

**_Consider_** **_Alternatives_**
In the past few years, in part thanks to a post 9-11 boom in
demand, "time share" private jet companies have become more
competitive, more creative in their pricing options, and an
affordable option that a very frequent flyer ought to consider. If I
were flying as much today as I did in 1997, 1998, 1999,1 would
buy into one of these programs without question. In those years,

I spent over $70,000.00 on commercial airfare. As near as I can estimate, about three times that amount would have bought enough
private jet hours with Netjets or FlightOptions to do the same
quantity of travel. The differential would have been a very good
investment, given the value of each of my hours held hostage in
airports at security checkpoint lines or because of flight delays.

If you fly to cities and rent cars a lot, it's well worth joining and
using Hertz Gold Club or Avis's Preferred Customer program to
bypass lines at the counters and avoid filling out the contract from
scratch each time. If you cab it, consider using pre-arranged sedan
services instead, especially at airports known for long taxi waiting
lines, such as Las Vegas, Newark, or National in Washington, DC.
You can usually have a neatly dressed, courteous, Englishspeaking driver waiting for you with a clean, four-door Cadillac
or Lincoln sedan with a car phone. You can instantly be on your
way and spend only an extra $10 to $20 more than cab fare. I'm
amazed at the frequent business travelers I know who are too
cheap to use sedan services, opting instead for standing in line in
the rain and cold to finally go on a thrill ride with Abdul.

**_Be Kind to Your Body_**
I can remember, as can some of my road warrior friends,
when zipping back and forth across time zones had no appreciable effect on me. Not anymore. As you put on some years, travel
takes a greater toll, and you need to schedule time for rest. If I
cross a couple of time zones, I need to allow a little extra time for
rest and recovery. When I was a drinker, I used to have two or
three cocktails and think nothing of it. I don't drink anymore at
all, but friends who drink tell me their metabolism changes have
made drinking booze on flights undesirable. Alcohol has a

heightened effect in the air. On flights I make a point of drinking
quite a bit of water, and I often skip the really junky airplane
meals or eat only the salad. I hit my 49th birthday while finish-ing
this book, but in "travel years," I'm at least 90. Ignoring the damage

done to your body and your psyche by frequent travel is
stupid. You need to devise strategies for eating, exercise, rest, and
work that mitigate the damage as much as possible.

Nothing's worse—or more damaging to productivity—than
getting sick while traveling, or, for that matter, coming down
with something immediately on your return home. I am firmly
convinced that the risk of catching colds and flu are much, much
greater for the frequent traveler, and I think I do a pretty good job
keeping my incidences down to two or three a year. The quality
of the air in the airplanes has gotten worse (!) since the ban on
smoking; the lack of cigarette smoke has allowed the airlines to
save money by switching from fresh-air systems to recirculating
air systems. The "old" planes had two-thirds fresh air, one-third
recirculated; the newest planes use 100% recirculated air, so you
are breathing a mixture of all the other passengers' colds, flus,
viruses, sweat, etc., roughly every seven to nine minutes. Flight
attendant sickness is on the rise, and both employees and passengers are complaining (to no avail). According to the National
Academy of Sciences, measured in cubic feet per minute, fresh
air circulated inside the average airplane ranges from (best) 150
to the pilots in the cockpit, to 50 to first-class passengers, to 7, to
coach passengers. We solved the "secondhand smoke" problem.
Now we're getting sick from secondhand air.

This is why you should never aim the overhead air vents
directly at your face; contagious germs in that air go into your
eyes and—whammo!—you're sick as a dog. I also increase my

vitamin intake while traveling and, during prime cold and flu
seasons, I megadose vitamin C. There's a relatively new, good
product called Airborne, a vitamin-rich and zinc-rich tablet that
dissolves in water and makes a fizzy lemon drink. You belt this
down immediately before heading for the airport. Pros also
advise drinking lots of water during long flights. It seems that
dehydration enlarges the tiny, inside-the-nostril pores, which
increases your chance of catching infections.

**_Pack Light_**
Checking baggage is a giant time-waster, even if your bags don't
get lost. I haven't checked baggage more than once or twice in
ten years, on thousands of flights. Any male should be able to go
for up to two weeks with one large carry-on that fits in the overhead bins plus a briefcase. It's tougher for women, but the smart
ones figure out how to do it. (Hint: everything matching one pair
of shoes helps.) Otherwise, you must get to the airport earlier
every time, you must wait for baggage on arrival—usually 30
minutes or more—and this wait often puts you smack in the middle of a herd waiting in line for cabs or packed like sardines into
the rental car company or hotel shuttle bus.

If you are going to one place for multiple days and cannot
carry everything you need, FedEx it there ahead of you, and
FedEx it back when you leave. It's worth the expense—if your
time has any value.

###### Battling for Productivity in Your Hotel Room

many meetings as possible at my hotel, with people coming to me,
just as I would if at home in my own office, for the same reason. I

Often, the only phones are next to the bed and in the bathroom,
not on the desk or table. Outlets are all hidden, sometimes as far .iway

from the desk or table as you can get. Feel free to rearrange the
room. When I traveled with my laptop computer (which I no
longer do), I always packed an extension cord.

electrical outlets, Internet hookups, and the phone conveniently on a desk. The on-airport Hyatt in Orlando, Florida, l

be Hilton at O'Hare in Chicago, and the Marriott in Detroit,
Michigan, are wonderfully convenient.

desk, outlet within reach, desk phone, bedside phone AND bath­
room phone, and voice mail; plus laundry or dry cleaning pick­
ups and deliveries FOUR times daily; fast room service;
overnight shoe shines; and a staff that jumps.

If costs are a big concern, Marriott Courtyards and Fairfield Inns

have well-designed rooms where you can spread out, work,

Embassy Suites are good values, and every room is a mini-suite,
so you can meet comfortably with as many as three people at a
time in the living room half of the suite.

By the way, if you work in your room during the day, you
will be tempted to hang the "Please Make Up This Room Early"
sign on your door as you leave, to go to a breakfast meeting or
such. I know better but still occasionally do it, because it is so
easy. However, that sign telegraphs to thieves that the room is
unoccupied. It is safer—and more effective—to call "housekeeping," explain that you'll be out only for an hour and ask that the
room be made up during that time period. This seems to work
about 90% of the time.

###### Communicating while Traveling
Personally, I refuse to carry a cell phone, but you probably do. It
is extremely useful, if you can use it for outbound calling to suit
you but not have others using it to reach out and bother you. I
watch businesspeople already worn to a frazzle by traveling, piling on the taking or making of cell phone calls while taking every
step through the airport, eating, standing in lines, boarding the
plane, getting off the plane. They are not doing themselves any
favors. If a call is important to make, it deserves a bit more
thought and a more conducive environment than the boarding
ramp, while you are surrounded by screaming children and
being bumped by the cattle drive. Having a cell phone to make
different airline reservations or handle problems caused by
delays: good. Having it steal all your time: bad.

The routine I've arrived at is to (a) try my best to call into the
office once during the day, (b) have faxes waiting for me on

rival at my hotel, and (c) check in at home once each evening,lite

bigger problem is communicating with clients, returning (tills

from clients, vendors, etc., and being unable to take return
Calls. I train my clients, as best they can be trained, to communicate via fax rather than phone, and that pre-empts a lot of telephone tag. I also try to return calls from my hotel, when I can stay in

the room for a couple of hours, to take bounceback calls. I will
often block two or three hours to sit comfortably in my room and lake

calls, via pre-arranged, back-to-back phone appointments, and
knock them off with maximum efficiency.

Most road warriors now travel with laptops or PDAs, use
e-mail, and do much of their distance communication this way.
My comment is identical to my advice about the cell phone: if
you control and use these tools so they serve you well, fine. Do
not let them control you.

If I'm on the road for an extended period of time, big rubber
tubs of faxes and mail will be waiting for me on my return. The
only way to prevent this daunting mountain from being built is
to have all my mail shoved in a big FedEx sack and sent to me
once or twice while I'm away. I tend to do this with trips of five
days or more. I can get through a few days' mail while watching
an in-room movie or Monday Night Football, throw out a lot, jot
notes on some, and move some back to the office so action can be
taken on it the next morning.

###### The Extinction of the Travel Agent
in the past few years, the Internet and the airlines have, in
unholy alliance, done their level bests to kill off travel agents. The

selling successfully against commoditization (they needed my
book No B.S. Sales Success) stood there and took the beating.
Many have closed their doors.

The airlines' behavior has been reprehensible. By slashing
commissions, blocking agents from assisting clients with mileage
redemptions, and aggressively switching customers to Web sites
and direct, online purchasing, they have engaged in a very deliberate industry conspiracy to destroy the travel agents.

For frequent business travelers, profound dangers abound in
buying air travel direct, online, or through secretarial staff. In a
procedure exposed in several national TV news programs but
still mostly unknown to travelers, discount tickets purchased
online and tickets purchased from independent, nonairline Web
sites often carry "secret codes" that move these passengers to the
very bottom of the pecking order whenever anything goes
wrong. Many of these tickets and Web site ticket sellers have
truly bizarre "weasel clauses" and fine print warnings and
restrictions. I have several clients who have shared true horror
stories with me about being stranded for several days with these
tickets. Conversely, I'm amused by people I know willing to
spend 30 or 60 minutes or more searching the Internet for fare
discounts. I am certainly not willing to trade away a $1,000.00
hour of my time for $87.00 in discounts.

I find a competent travel agent worth his weight in gold. I
use the agent to check different flights, fax me options, check
every possible connection and cost, maximize my frequent flyer
miles, and think for me so I don't always have to remember to
ask the right hotel questions, to arrange for a limo, and so forth.
An agent like this saves untold amounts of time in planning, and
on the trips themselves.

often "learning" several new businesses in connection with my clients,

so I read their trade publications, too. Because of the infomercial

business, I watch a lot of television, and I review .lbout

work with direct-mail, I read ALL of my "junk mail." And I read
at least one book a week. Fortunately, I speed read. But, still....

###### How Do You Handle All This? I'm
sure you are digging out from under your own avalanche of
information everyday, too. Let me offer you some "shovels."

IMPROVE YOUR READING SKILLS
Many people are poor readers and insist that they do not "like"
to read. Sadly, our U.S. universities and high schools alike are
churning out mass numbers of young people who do not read,
get all their news from TV or radio, and, in a shocking number of
cases, are borderline illiterate. Once again, honesty with yourself
is the best policy. Hire a tutor if necessary. If not, then take or get
a good home study speed reading course. Speed reading (and
speed comprehension) is real.

By the way, I think you MUST read, as you can see in the
accompanying article (Figure 9.1), that I originally wrote for one
of my newsletters.

GET ONLY THE INFORMATION YOU REALLY WANT AND NEED
If you are really busy, and time is much more of an issue than
money, you can pay others to read for you. There are "clipping
services," including one run by The Wall Street Journal, that will

**APPARENTLY, YOU ARE NOW AN AMAZING ODDITY AKIN TO A**

**THREE-HEADED COW—IF** **YOU** **READ. The Saturday after**

Christmas, working in my office, I had the weekend Today Show on

the TV, and jerked my head around to watch when I heard this

amazing statement, delivered with breathless excitement:

_"Coming up next—we'll_ _interview the woman who read a_

_book a week for a year and has written her own book_

_about the experience!" What!?!_

With brief lapses here and there, I've read at least a book

a week every year for more than 30 years. What's the big deal

about this? Well, apparently it is a big deal. The last time I went to

Barnes & Noble, I bought a new biography of Ben Franklin, Tom

Peters' new book, a couple of other business books, a book about stroke-free

living, three paperback novels to take on airplanes, and

about 20 magazines. The clerk said: "Lifetime's supply, huh?"

Sheesh.

You MUST read a lot to succeed. Here are the reasons: (1) Varied,

diverse input, ideas, viewpoints, life stories, examples, all the

essential raw material poured into your subconscious mind, for it

to sift, sort, try matching up with other puzzle pieces it already has,

so it can occasionally yell "Eureka!" and hand you something prof-itable—without

daily flow of new stuff, it just sleeps. Wealth secret:

you cannot manufacture anything without raw material. Not even

(2) Without exposure to others' thinking, your own range of ilKnight

shrinks. Soon, you're a mental midget. Your range of iihMight

narrows, like your range of motion shrinks if you don't move

and stretch. (3) You can't stay current. I read a monstrous

amount and I still can't stay current. If you're not reading a book or i

wo, a dozen magazines, a few newspapers, and a few newsletters nvery

week, you must be way, way, way behind. Pretty soon, your

conversation reveals you as a dinosaur. (4) If you have kids, you

want to set a decent example for them. They need to see you read
ing. They need to hear you talking' about what you read. When I

was a kid, the years my family was dead broke, we made a regu
larly scheduled, weekly treks to the public library for an hour or so.

My father, mother, and I each picked out three or four books for the

week, took them home, read them, and talked about them. Now I

prefer going to the bookstore, because I have money, and like

keeping the books. However, I'm grateful for the library-habit years.

It would be a better thing for most families to do than going to the

movies, arcade, or Wal-Mart.

Historical note I had in a book I wrote back in 1985: the town leaders

of Franklin, Massachusetts, once wrote and asked Ben Franklin for a

donation so they could buy a bell for the church steeple. He sent

money with this note: "I'm honored you have named your town Franklin

and a donation is enclosed. However, I suggest you start a library with

it rather than buying a bell. I prefer sense to sound."

ferret through hundreds of daily newspapers, trade magazines,
etc., for the topic you have requested and fax to you just the
articles about your topic. You may have a staff person read and
clip for you. A good project for son, daughter, grandson,
granddaughter is a regular pile of reading, like trade journals,
to clip, highlight, even summarize for you. One of my clients
pays his high-school-age son $75.00 a week to read 14 different
trade journals and newsletters and record summaries and
excerpts on a weekly tape that he can listen to while he drives
to work.

SET ASIDE AND "BULK" MATERIAL THAT IS NOT TIME SENSITIVE,

TO REVIEW AT YOUR LEISURE
Catalogs, interesting-looking junk mail, and popular magazines
fall into this category. You MUST be very selective about what
warrants your attention now, what later, what never.

CONSIDER CONDENSATION
You can subscribe to Executive Book Summaries, for example, and
get brief summaries of a dozen new, "hot" business books every
month. This is sort of a Cliff Notes for adults. There's a similar
service, Newstrack, for news buffs.

USE YOUR V C R, D V D, OR TIVO

at your convenience.

Here are the average to-and-from-the-office commute times for
major cities: New York, 1 hour, 5 minutes; Washington DC, 1 hour;

various fields. Tapes on business, finance, health, sex, self-improvement,

foreign languages, travel, lectures from great col-lege
professors'; classic and contemporary fiction; you name it. If
you average 40 minutes a day x 250 workdays, that's 167 "class­
room hours" a year available to you.

RESIST THE SIREN SONG OF DISTRACTION
A lot of people let "noninformation" consume a lot of their time.
Today's news is tomorrow's fish-wrap, yet we have just about
become consumed with useless news. Twenty-four-hour-a-day
news stations; 60 Minutes beget 60 Minutes II; 20/20, 20/20 I

want to be informed. But do you need to be informed about the
latest celebrity sex or shoplifting scandal, the latest athlete going
to jail, the weather in Bulgaria?

USE TECHNOLOGY, BUT RESIST SEDUCTION BY TECHNOLOGY
Technology is terrific when it really enhances productivity. But all
too often it only gives the illusion of that. People who spend
hours on end roaming the Internet or in e-mail dialogue don't
fool me. This is just another escape into busyness, just like going
to one darned meeting after another.

However, virtually every newspaper is now online, so if
you are traveling to a distant city and would benefit from being
familiar with that city's current news, it's readily available.

interviews with experts, articles, past newsletters, and other reference material.

###### Specialize. But Not too Much.
It is probably better to know a great deal about one, two, or several things than a tiny bit about everything. Specialization
almost always adds value. And it can be used to limit information flow.

In business, I specialize in direct-response advertising and
direct-mail, with a subspecialty in "long form" (copy intensive)
advertising, and another subspecialty in the marketing of information products. As a result, I rarely bother reading Advertising
_Age magazine, a trade journal for traditional advertising profes-_
sionals, but I do read Direct Marketing magazine and DIRECT.
Being able NOT to read something is very useful.

However, too narrow of focus becomes myopia. If you
exclude too much information and input, you rob your brain of
the raw material needed for breakthrough ideas. Most people in
a particular industry are so myopic they start committing what
I call "marketing incest"—with the same result as real incest;
after just a few generations, everybody's stupid. People in "x"
business look at what everybody else in "x" business is doing,
they go to association meetings together, read the same trade
journals, and copy from each other. Getting outside this box is
important.

So, you need a balance. A lot of specialization, but not too
much specialization.

If you actually discipline yourself to get one answer to each
question worth putting down in writing just once a week, after a
year, you'll be 624 big steps ahead of your peers and competitors.
And the odds are excellent you'll have uncovered a few ultra-v.iluable

gems. Keeping these questions in the forefront of your mind
is a way of "electrifying and magnetizing your antenna," so
casual conversations or even an overheard conversation can v
ield something useful you'd otherwise never have noticed.

###### How to Organize and Manage Ideas
The great success educator Earl Nightingale wrote that "a single I

liought can revolutionize your life. A single thought can make
you rich or well-to-do, or it can land you in prison for the rest of
your life. Everything was an idea before it became real in the
world . . . the law of averages begins to swing in your direction
when you begin to produce ideas."

"Ideas," Earl said, "are like slippery fish."

It is up to us to catch every idea—not to let

one slip by us.

For many years, I used a strategy adapted from Michael
Vance, a close associate of Walt Disney, called the storyboard. I
**had a corked wall in my office, with vertical columns, each col-**
umn headed by a business or project title. Then, every time I had
**an idea, I'd jot it down on a small card, about half of a 3 x 5-inch**

CHAPTER 9 / HOW TO HANDLE THE INFORMATION AVALANCHE

Walt

card, and pushpin it up there in the correct column. I carried a little supply of cards with me at all times, so I never lost an idea.
Frankly, for a while, I drifted away from that; now I've returned.
I also maintain different "project notebooks" or even lega
pads dedicated to one project.

I have a pad and pen everywhere. Even in the bathroom.
Some people are very adept at verbalizing their ideas, so they
carry micro-recorders, dictate, have a staff person or service tran
scribe it all, then organize it. My brain engages with pen in han
or fingers on keyboard.

The important thing is for you to choose and use som
method for capturing every idea that comes to you, whereve
and whenever it happens.

Bulk is a problem for many of us. My friend Lee Milteer has
research, reference, and project piles in gigantic clear plastic bags,
so she can see what's in them. My piles have 4 x 6-inch title cards
on them. I have more than 1,000 books on shelves, but if I read a
book with only a few worthwhile pages, I tear out the pages, file
them, then throw out the book. The computer with the CD-ROM
is obviously a major tool in reducing bulk for information storage. From a time standpoint, the trick is to be able to quickly find
what you need when you need it—my own Achilles heel.

###### How the Well-Trained, Conditioned, and Fit Subconscious Mind Helps Handle the Information Avalanche

his classic best-selling book Psycho-Cybernetics and in the recently

)r. Maltz's findings and methods have been of enormous impor-tance

to me my entire life, and I urge you to investigate them for yourself.

Specific to being more productive, and to better managing and utilizing information, you can deliberately make your subconscious

work better as a finder, organizer, and provider of whatever
you need to make a presentation, write a sales letter,
whatever. This is beyond ordinary memory. This is a creative
retrieval process.

For example, I, Like most direct-response ad copywriters,
maintain a room full of what we call "swipe files." These are files of

samples by category. One file contains "Headlines, Weight Loss

Ads," another "Headlines, Income Opportunity Ads." There

are files for opening sentences, guarantees, offers, and on .ind
on. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them. Huge
notebooks. Reference books. It takes a lot of time to go through all

the relevant ones physically, in preparing to write copy for a
client. Sometimes that's unavoidable, but quite often, for me, it is Van

going through its stored "swipe files" to find the right idea,

I wake, the idea spews out through my fingers onto my computer

QUAYLE,

Entrepreneurs make lousy managers and administrators
because too much of that work is routine.

This tells you a lot about what you must do in order to
achieve maximum success, derive maximum value from your
time, and lead the happiest possible life: you must systematically,
aggressively divest yourself of those activities you do not do
well, do not do happily, or find routine, so as to systematically
invest your time (and talent, knowledge, know-how, and other
resources) in those things you do extraordinarily well, enjoy
doing, and find intellectually stimulating.

I have just described for you a formula for peak personal productivity, as a specialist. And you ought to note that, in every
field of enterprise, specialists outearn generalists ten to one.
Heart surgeons vs. M.D.s. Sophisticated database computer program developers vs. programmers. Nuclear waste disposal
experts vs. garbage men. And so on.

But having said that, how do we make that happen? How do
we get there? It certainly is easier said than done. But you can
start moving in this direction today, step by step, just as I have.

###### "We're Overpaying Him, but He's Worth It"
The movie magnate Samuel Goldwyn, famous for butchering the
language, said that. Actually, your business is overpaying you for
some of the jobs you do and grossly underpaying you for others.

**_Step One: Honest Self-Analysis and Self-Understanding_**
The typical entrepreneur—myself included—believes, no, knows,
absolutely knows that he can do anything and everything,
because, at some point in time, we have had to. However, even

CHAPTER 10 / FIRE YOURSELF, REPLACE YOURSELF, MAKE MORE MONEY, AND HAVE MORE FUN

NO B.S. **Time Management for Entrepreneurs** _ft_ 105

though I can do it all, truth is, there are only a few things I do so
extraordinarily well that—even if given all the money in the world—I
wouldn't hire anybody else to do them. There are only
a few things I do better than anybody else on the planet. Truth be
told, you have only a few things in that category too. Then, you
and I have another couple of handfuls of things we do well, better than most, but cannot be considered our "specialties." And
there are any number of things you and I do that we do out of
necessity, don't do very well, but do them anyway.

If you're honest with yourself, you can create these three lists.
(And it's a very productive exercise to sit down alone and make
these three lists.) "Delegate

###### or Stagnate"

**_Step Two: Delegation_**
Of course, delegating is as hard for entrepreneurs as telling the
truth is for politicians. It's downright unnatural. Why? Habit, for
one thing. We create our businesses from scratch, do it all, develop
a way of doing things that we believe in, and find that habit is
hard to break. No one is ever going to do things exactly the same
way we do them.

Jay Van Andel, co-founder of the giant Amway Corporation
impressed me many years ago with a speech titled, "Delegate or
Stagnate." Of course, the entire Amway system is based on multiplication of effort; one person learning a set of skills, then duplicating himself over and over again. And Jay and his partner, Rich DeVos,

had a business that grew like topsy. In order to stay ahead
of it, they constantly delegated and—ultimately—replaced themselves over and over again, which we'll get to in a minute. What

CHAPTER 10 / FIRE YOURSELF, REPLACE YOURSELF, MAKE MORE MONEY, AND HAVE MORE FUN

and—ultimately—replaced

-----

we _ft_ **NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

Jay made very clear to me is that the only way to advance in any
business is to keep delegating.

THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO BE RIGHT
Brendan Suhr, the assistant head coach of the Detroit Pistons during their championship years in the 1980s, said to me: "Do you
know how many head coaches there are in the NBA? Well, there
are at least that many different ways to be right, because every
one of these coaches does things differently, yet they all represent
the top Xo% of the coaching profession. There are 1,000 guys
who'd like every one of these jobs. There are at least 100 guys
who'd be good candidates for every one of these jobs. So these
head coaches all do it "right," yet they all do it differently." His
point is valid.

You cannot delegate if you believe there's only one way to
get things done right.

OFTEN, GOOD ENOUGH IS GOOD ENOUGH
Let me give you an example: I used to have a business associate,
a key person in my company, a $100,000.00 a year guy—whose
time had to be worth more than $250.00 an hour. It so happened
he had a fetish about how boxes were packed. When we were
leaving for a week-long series of seminars, instead of attending
to any number of important responsibilities, he'd be back in the
shipping department for hours, doing the job of the $10.00 an
hour shipping clerk. I've got to admit that he packed a wicked
box. I mean, this guy's boxes were works of art. They were very,
very carefully packed, firm to the top and the corners, so that no
corner crumpled in. The tape was perfectly straight. The bottom
and sides were taped just as perfectly as the top. Every label was

guy—whose

on straight. However, in the many years since he has been gone,
our shipping clerks shipped thousands of cartons to my seminar
sites. Not packed quite as well. Corners crumpled a little bit now
and again. Tape crooked. Labels cockeyed. But every one of these
boxes got there. The product was fine. The result was the same.
Good enough is good enough.

Many, many things can be delegated to people who will not
do them the way you would, won't do them as perfectly as you
would, but will wind up with the same result. Every one of these
things should be delegated. In fact, you MUST delegate. You cannot move ahead without jettisoning some responsibilities and
tasks in order to make room for new, more valuable tasks and
responsibilities.

And I'm not necessarily talking about creating a giant managerial bureaucracy. Today, you can delegate to independent
contractors, freelancers, and vendors, too. Outsourcing is the
buzzword of the day, with good reason. Also, if you have anybody around you with intelligence and talent, you must keep
giving them new, more important responsibilities and getting
them to delegate.

**#** **NO** **B.s. Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

**_Mastering_** **_Delegation_**
You MUST master this difficult skill. To delegate effectively,
here's the seven-step process.

1. Define what is to be done.
2. Be certain the delegatee understands what is to be done.
3. Explain why it is to be done as you are prescribing it to be
done.
4. Teach how it is to be done without micro-micro-managing.
5. Be sure the delegatee understands the how-to process.
6. Set the deadline for completion or progress report.
7. Be sure you have agreement to the date or time and
method.

y the way, resisting the temptation to micro
manage will require plenty of willpower. One of a num
ber of reasons I stayed out of my business offices and

worked at home as much as possible was because

when I went to the office, I was "drawn" to listen in on,

interfere with, or critique every phone call, look at every

fax, poke my nose all the way into everything—to the

extent that I ruined everybody else's productivity as

well as my own. Today, I am never there. In fact, I am

most often in a home office at the opposite end of the

country from the office where my sole staffperson does

everything.

This is not rocket science. But it takes very deliberate
patience. It even takes time. But investing time in getting good at
this and getting people around you who respond to it is the only
way to get time freed up to do more valuable things yourself.

###### Going Beyond Delegation
And, as difficult as all this is, it's just the beginning. The real, big,
blockbuster secret of entrepreneurial success and happiness goes
beyond delegation to replacement.

**_Step Three: Replacing Yourself_**
My Platinum Member Rory Fatt, president of Restaurant
Marketing Systems, exhorts the thousands of restaurant owners
he advises: "Fire yourself! You'll make more money and have
more fun." The disease exists in every industry, but Rory says it's
epidemic and endemic in restaurants—owners terminally inflicted
with the belief that they must be the one making the sauce, greeting the guests at the door, doing the inventory. They are so busy
doing the $10.00-an-hour jobs, they never get to do the $100.00an-hour job: marketing to bring in new customers, and to keep
customers coming back. Rory says you can hire just about anybody to wash glasses, and there are a lot of people you can hire
to make the sauce, but there's hardly anybody you can hire to
effectively market and promote the restaurant.

###### "They Gave Me a Lifetime Contract, Then They Pronounced Me Legally Dead"
I agree with Rory—most business owners need to fire themselves
from a lot of those $10.00-an-hour jobs. The late college basket

ball coach Jim Valvano wrote a book long before his death from
cancer with the above title as a sardonic poke at his field. It's said
there are only three kinds of coaches: those just getting hired,
those just fired, and those soon to be fired. Jimmy Johnson took
the Dallas Cowboys to two Super Bowls in a row, then was fired.
Nobody, and I mean nobody is indispensable. The day Johnny
Carson retired, the entire country wondered if the Tonight Show
would soon die. So did NBC. But we have become loyal to Jay
Leno, and a whole lot of people might not recognize Johnny
Carson if they bumped into him on the street. Jack Paar couldn't
even get onto the studio property without an ID card.

**_Step Four:_** **_Welcoming Your Dispensability_**
Most people do not like the idea of dispensability. The entrepreneur on vacation is schizophrenic: hoping everything's OK at the
office but disappointed when he calls in and finds out everything
**_is OK at the office. How can things be running smoothly without_**
him? I'm going to try and sell you on welcoming your own dispensability.

Entrepreneurs grow in experience and expertise very quickly.
Fast learners. You will probably master entire "chunks" of a business in a matter of months, yet you may continue doing those
same functions for years. This will lead to stagnation and unhappiness. You may even wind up ineffectively doing things you
could do well just out of boredom. The ultimate answer is
replacement. That is, you replace yourself and step up to a new
set of opportunities and responsibilities. You groom someone to
take your place.

Note that this is the opposite of executive behavior in a corporate bureaucracy. In that environment, the executive is desperately

CHAPTER 10 / FIRE YOURSELF, REPLACE YOURSELF, MAKE MORE MONEY, AND HAVE MORE FUN

-----

**B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs** _ft in_

afraid of the up-and-comers who would take over his job. The
executive is determined to protect his turf. Through secrecy,
deliberate confusion, corporate politics, and every other imaginable method, the executive tries to make himself indispensable.
The super-savvy entrepreneur does the opposite and tries to
make himself dispensable.

I have gone through many different scenarios in my business
life. I had 42 employees; then for quite a while five; now only
one. I have delegated a lot, I've delegated almost nothing, and
done everything myself. I confess I am still guilty of doing some
menial tasks myself rather than supervise anyone. Beginning in 1999,1

aggressively switched from delegation to replacement of
a sort. I sold my information products business then. In 2003, I
sold my newsletter business. I've arrived at what I call my "Dan
as Center of Universe Strategy": me in the middle and satellite
businesses owned and managed by others all based on me, my
writings, my other content, all paying me. Right now, there are
four such satellites.

A good question to consider is, what plan you are working
on to reduce your business' and income's dependency on your
own time and effort?

###### What to Do with the Time You Liberate
One thing you can do is enjoy the success you create. Golf, buy
racehorses and hang out at the track (a passion of mine), write,
get involved in community service or politics, whatever.

If you're looking for the answer that turns your time into the
most money and wealth possible, then turn your attention to
marketing. Get free of as many other aspects of your business as

you can, get passionately interested in and good at marketing,
and invest your time there. Why? Because it is infinitely easier to
find or train someone to take care of a business' operations than
it is to get someone to do its marketing. Marketing is the highestpaid profession and most valuable part of a business. The person
who can create systems for acquiring customers, clients, or
patients effectively and profitably is the "money person." He is
the equivalent of a "high impact" or "franchise" player in sports.

Let me give you a quick example: a big publisher of a variety
of different newsletters, on average, hires and pays only four or
five professional copywriters each year to write the sales letters
that acquire new subscribers for those newsletters. The copywriter who can create a successful sales letter for this company
will rarely be paid less than $250,000.00 in a year, in fees and roy-alties—for

writing just one letter! Find me any other kind of
writer who can command $250,000.00 for eight pages. You can't
find a novelist. A screenwriter. A technical writer. A journalist.
No one gets $250,000.00 for eight pages.

things to do to "fix" that product's marketing (described in my
book) received millions of dollars.

Now I have what should be very exciting news: most of the
top-flight, most successful marketing wizards are entrepreneurs
who grew up into marketers, and who are self-taught, many in
very short periods of time. What they have done to become what
they are—people whose time is worth thousands of dollars per hour—you
can do too. Yes, I am here to tell you that you can,
over a two-to-five year term, make your hours each worth
$1,000.00 or more.

So, if you insist on hanging around people with nominal

When you go to Mexico—or for that matter, Nassau, a favorite of mine—you
have to take off your watch and force yourself into
slow motion, because these people have absolutely no sense of
urgency whatsoever. And nothing you might do will alter that. If
you can't put yourself into that mode and enjoy it, stay away. You
might hurt somebody.

Of course, that's fine on vacation. But it is very frustrating
for me to deal with so many people in business who have so little urgency. Most people do take the attitude that whatever we

don't get done today, we'll get to tomorrow, and what's the big
deal?

Instilling a continuing, constant sense of urgency in others is
extremely difficult. A few get it. Most don't. This is one of a collection of reasons that, contrary to all of government's ill-fated,
Robin Hoodesque efforts, 5% of the people get 95% of the money.
We have a sense of urgency the 95%ers don't.

If it really matters to you whether a letter gets out today or
tomorrow, whether a mailing makes it out on Friday so it moves
over the weekend or waits until Monday, or whether a project
gets finished as promised, then you automatically get more done
than just about everybody else because those things matter little
to them.

Most folks work slow. Watch 'em. There is an old time management axiom: work expands to fill the time available to do it.
For most people work expands, period. And very few people
ever complete a project before time runs out and come looking
for something else to do. In my operation, when my mother left
the office, it would have taken three "regular" employees to
replace her if my wife hadn't stepped in. But most people work
slow. I watch them with amazement. Make a phone call, take a
break.

You should learn to work fast(er).

It makes you sharper.

feed bucket cleaned, fresh water in the water bucket, and the next

takes about 13 minutes to do all that if you work fast and non­
stop. That's a time-gun. In many cases today, I know in my head
how much time it should take me to do a certain project, and
that's all the time I allot for it.

###### How to Use the Home Office to Increase Personal Productivity

_You can't have everything. Where would you put it? —COMEDIAN_

**STEVEN WRIGHT**

My client, friend, and, most recently, joint venture partner Jeff
Paul wrote a marvelous little book, How to Make $4,000.00 a Day,
_Sitting at Home, in Your Underwear. More than 300,000 copies have_
been sold. The book is actually about how to succeed in the mail­
order business, but it turns out that the title has struck a chord
with hundreds of thousands of people. Response, when the book
was advertised in national magazines, was incredible. Why?
Because people have just about had it with one-to-two-hour commutes, bumper to bumper, inch by inch, surrounded by toxic
exhaust fumes.

There are now an estimated 65 million people working from
home, some full-time, some part-time. And that number keeps
increasing, thanks to evolving employer flexibility, entrepreneurial growth, new and improved technology, and worsening commutes. Those of us in marketing have coined the name "S0H0

Market" to describe the small or "micro" business and homeoperated business explosion. Most new home builders are putting home office rooms in the model homes.

Back when I wrote the first edition of this book, Home Office
_Computing magazine's surveys indicated that 96% to 98% of the_
people working from home were happier than they were working at an off-site store or office, and would recommend it as a
lifestyle to others. I hear both viewpoints from my clients. Some
find they cannot work at home, mostly because of their own
inability to avoid readily available distractions. Most, however,
prefer it, and believe they are more productive. A telecommuting
consultant quoted in Paul and Sarah Edwards' book Working
_from Home insists that measured productivity increases by 15% to_
25% when working from home.

**I can be from bed and bath to productivity in five minutes.**
If you have a 45-minute commute, that 90-minute daily round
trip takes nine work weeks of possible productivity right out of
your calendar. On January 1, you can cross off two months plus
a week. Making this up, just to get back to even, takes a multiple
of that. Not to mention the attitudinal impact of a smelly, grungy,
aggravating, and often hazardous, daily commute.

When I am able to spend the entire day working at home, I
do not take off for an hour or hour and a half to go to lunch; I
walk over to the kitchen, make myself lunch, (eat healthier more
often than not), and happily munch while I mush on. I get to
make telephone calls while sitting in my massager-recliner, having a back massage, or out on my deck. There are few, if any,
interruptions, so I gain momentum, and get more done. So much
more that I can take an hour-or-so afternoon nap and still be way
ahead of what I would have accomplished in a conventional
office environment. Why wouldn't you want to work this way?

Yes, there are trade-offs. Office invariably expands from its
confined, single room to other places in the house. Maybe the
business is more on your mind (I'm not sure). To me, it's a trade
worth making.

Different people find different settings lead to their best productivity. Thoreau had to go off and sit by a pond, away from
everybody else, to be productive. If that's what you find you
have to do, grab some mosquito repellent, hook up a cell phone
and fax in your car if you want, pack a lunch, and head off into
the sunrise. My friend Jeff Paul cannot stand the sight of a neck­
tie and is at his best in old, grubby sweats, at home. Fine. Some
people need the socialization of being in an office or office building with other people. If that's you, then the whole idea of working from home may be wrong although there are ways to inject
socialization: taking a coffee break and calling a friend, for example. You ought to experiment a bit, figure out what works best for
you, and do that.

Most entrepreneurs go through long periods of struggle and suffering before achieving what often looks to the outside observer
like "overnight success." I spent years laboring in oblivion, even
ignominy. I have had cars repossessed, been hounded by creditors, gone bankrupt, been so broke that I've had to scrounge
change from under the couch cushions to get something to eat,
driven old "beater" cars. I have been ridiculed, ignored, and
abused. I have had enough of all this to be very, very appreciative of opportunity and good fortune. And to worry that it could

all dry up tomorrow morning, too. In some respects, this paranoia is healthy. I have seen the opposite many times: the person
on a roll who starts buying into his own PR, believing it will
never end, spending like a drunken sailor, piling up overhead,
and treating people arrogantly. Then it does dry up. The crash is
brutal.

On the other hand, this paranoia makes it difficult to say "no."
Yet, the biggest single job of the time-conscious, productivityoriented entrepreneur is saying no.

Saying "no" to opportunity is painful. But necessary. Because
the more successful you get, the more opportunities flow your
way. People line up. But if you say "yes" to everybody and
everything, you will soon drown in your own success.

Determining what not to do today is also important. There
will always be more things to do than time available to do them.
More calls to make, more people to talk to, more places to go,
more details to check up on than there is time available to do
them. And this doesn't diminish with success; it becomes more so.

For the person eager to do things right, who aspires to "excellence," it is emotionally difficult to leave things undone, to know
that there are things that should have been attended to that
weren't. But you have to make that adjustment or age rapidly
before your time. You can only do what you can do; you cannot
do anymore. There's never a day that goes by without a phone
call or two I would like to have returned that are never made, letters I would like to have written that are undone, projects I'd love
to have completed that are never even looked at. All I can do
every day is start out with a plan, a list of priorities, make as few
reactive adjustments as possible during the day, and deal first
with the life-or-death priorities, and then on down the list. Have

_a powerful sense of urgency and do all that you can do, but then,_
when the clock runs out on your workday, relax.

When you make your "to-do lists," by the way, it's important
not to hopelessly overload the list. The tendency to pile on more
than can be done is understandable. I catch myself taking more
work with me on a road trip than I could possibly handle in three
trips. It's the same thing. But done consistently, it becomes
depressing. It decreases productivity. Again, deciding what not to
do is very important.

###### Short-Term, Medium-Term, and Long-Term Thinking

_If you don't know where you are going,_
_you might end up somewhere else. —YOGI_

**BERRA**
Early in my speaking career, a speaker and friend of mine, Keith
DeGreen suggested that a speaker should have a short-term market, where you work a lot early, to get experience, make money,
and pay the bills; a medium-term market, where you want to
become known and successful over a two-to-five-year term; and
a long-term market, where you want to sustain a career over 5 to
15 years. And you must devote some time to all 3 at once.

I used this idea specific to speaking, but I also apply it on a
broader basis. In fact, I think every entrepreneur ought to use it.
Right now, your short-term thinking has to be applied to the
exact business you're in today, as it is today: what can we do to
increase sales, attract new customers, better retain and do more
business with past customers, boost profits, solve management
problems, improve employees' performance, improve vendor
responsiveness, find capital?

**CHAPTER 11** **/ A BAKER'S DOZEN OF PRODUCTIVITY-BUILDER TIPS AND IDEAS**

But, at the same time, you must devote some time to mediumterm thinking: what do I want this business to be like two years,
three years, four years from now? What changes are happening
in my industry, in my community, with my customers that I must
keep pace with? The great speaker, the late Ira Hayes, called this
kind of thinking "keeping pace with tomorrow."

And, at the same time, you should devote some time to longterm thinking, integrating business with lifestyle: what do you
want your life to be like five to ten years down the road? I think
you need to be investing some time (and some money) in longterm plays, designed to start yielding benefits years down the
road.

###### Get Rid of Nuisances

_Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal nagging_
_on of an uncompleted task. —WILLIAM_

**JAMES**
From time to time, a "chore" will land in your lap that is repugnant. It may be an accounting matter, a problem employee, a government report, whatever. You'll catch yourself taking this off the
top of the pile, moving it to the bottom of the pile, over and over
again. Don't. The best thing to do with such a nuisance is do it
and get rid of it as quickly as possible. It ain't wine; it won't get
better with age. The longer you let one of these things hang
around, the more reluctance to deal with it you build up.

By the way, the best management advice I ever got was: hire
slow, fire fast. If you've got a problem employee hanging around,
you know it, he knows it, and, believe me, everybody else knows
it. The less decisive you are in dealing with it, the more problems

you'll have later with the other employees. Cut out the cancer
early and quick.

If you have clients, as I do, you'll want to get tough and quick
about ridding yourself of nuisance clients, too. Skip Ross, a very
successful distributor in a direct sales organization, impressed on
me that vacuums fill. Skip said: nature abhors a vacuum. Nature
will do just about anything to fill a vacuum. If you'd like some
nice, new clothes, go through your closet and take all the stuff
you don't wear to a charity. Leave two-thirds of that closet starkly
empty. You'll be amazed at how fast that thing will fill back up.
This "principle of vacuum" has served me very well over the
years. Just about every time I say no to or fire a troublesome,
high-maintenance client, that vacuum quickly fills with better
business. I know you'll find this to be true, too.

Montana do it. Even journeymen quarterbacks like Dave Krieg
have done it. We watched more contemporary quarterbacks pull
one of these off. We've seen entire teams play poorly for three
quarters, then suddenly seem to emerge from lethargy and ineptitude to score more points in four minutes than in the previous
40. And, if you're with a group of people watching one of these
fantastic finishes, some will always, logically ask, "Hey, why didn't
he play like that during the game? Where was all this talent an
hour ago?"

These guys suddenly get into "a place" where there's magic.
They can do no wrong. They can't fail.

Earl Nightingale once observed "that a time can come for
each of us when more will happen to us in six months than transpired in the previous five years. Compound events in our lives
can be compressed into remarkably short periods." This is a phenomenon. It is often the payoff an entrepreneur gets from years
of hard work, struggle, and sacrifice. It is peak productivity time.
Everything works. Opportunities abound. Doors swing open
easily. Recognition, even celebrity, occurs. Income soars.

When The Phenomenon occurs, everything speeds up. If
you're accustomed to a few new client prospects developing in a
week, you'll be flooded with a big multiple of that. The worthwhile demands on your time multiply like rabbits. Here's what
you do. Say "Thank You." Sleep less, gulp more vitamins, and go
with the flow. Be alert for this happening, then fan the fire. For a
brief time, you will want to loosen up your cautions about taking
on more than you can handle and embrace it all.

When The Phenomenon occurs, it's doubly important to be on
guard against anybody or anything that may snuff out the fire. Do
not let yourself be distracted by any time- and energy-sucking,

Some people just can't stand prosperity. Their own emotional
and psychological inner mess causes them to start setting up
roadblocks to slow things down if good things start happening
too quickly. If this is a business partner, friend, or—gulp—
spouse, guess what you've got to do? I have an acquaintance I'll
not name who is married to one of these people who just cannot
stomach success. She's a great mate, right up until his career
shifts into high gear. Then she gets physically ill with mysterious
diseases. She starts picking fights. She wrecks the car. I've
watched him slammed to a stop by this roadblock-builder several
times. Watch out for such a person in your life.

Now, back to The Phenomenon itself. I cannot tell you how
to turn it on. But I can tell you about a few of the factors and conditions that seem to be present when it occurs. First, it seems to
happen to already hyper-productive people. Second, it comes to
people already in hot pursuit of worthwhile, well-defined goals.
Third, it seems to occur to people who have "stepped up" in
associating with other high-performance people. Fourth, it often
starts out with a single "big break"—which you've got to be
astute enough to recognize and massively exploit.

You can create the conditions in your life most likely to spark

several different audiocassette adaptations have been sold via
the famous Nightingale-Conant catalog, the Sybervision catalog,
and a television program, and published and distributed through
bookstores by Audio Renaissance. The mental training techniques
created by Dr. Maxwell Maltz that make up Psycho-Cybernetics
have been endorsed and used by famous pro athletes and coaches,
leading corporate executives, star salespeople, entertainment
personalities, and by me. Salvador Dali gave Dr. Maltz an original painting as thanks for Psycho-Cybernetics' influence on his
career.

When Dr. Maltz first began putting his techniques down on
paper in the 1960s, he was far ahead of his time, so far ahead that
people first discovering his material right now are amazed by
and profit enormously from them.

What does all that have to do with you and peak productivity?
_There is a certain state of mind that best facilitates achieving peak_
_productivity. You can best create that state of mind as needed,_
when needed, at will, by mastering certain Psycho-Cybernetics
techniques.

For example, Dr. Maltz talked about "clearing the calculator."
If you have a simple calculator laying around, get it, and take a
look at it. You'll find that you have to hit the "clear" button and
either store in memory or completely clear away one problem
before you employ the calculator to solve another. In his studies
of human behavior, Dr. Maltz observed that all too often we're
trying to use our minds to work on several problems at once,
without ever stopping to hit the "clear" button.

Achieving maximum personal productivity requires that you
become extraordinarily facile at stopping, storing, and clearing,
so as to direct 100% of your mental powers to one matter at a
time, to the matter at hand. One client of mine, the CEO of a $20

He admittedly lets a dozen worries loose to run around in his
mind at the same time, while he is trying to do something else
and says he is constantly interrupted by his own thoughts. He
marvels at me and tells others that "it is amazing how Kennedy
can just box up a problem, put it away on a shelf in his mind,
focus totally on some task, and only go back to work on the problem when he wants to." This is because I have practiced and
practiced and practiced the technique of "clearing the calculator"
until it is second nature to me.

A big reason for my prolific output as a writer is that I never
have to "get in the mood' to write. Many people go through great
physical and mental gyrations just getting ready to get ready to
write. I don't. I can sit down, put my fingers on the keys, clear my
calculator in 60 seconds or less, and write.

This is just one of a number of simple but very powerful
Psycho-Cybernetic techniques, but it illustrates a very important
point: if you can't control your thoughts and manage your mind, you
_can't control or manage your time._

###### Creating a Peak Productivity Environment
You can do a number of things to make certain that your environment works for you instead of against you. The following are
some key ideas to consider and experiment with.

 - Psychological triggers

 - Organization vs. clutter

 - Feng shui

**CHAPTER 12 / THE INNER GAME OF PEAK PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY million-a-year**

###### B.s. Time Management for Entrepreneurs # 129 "A

As I said, I am a big believer in populating my work environment with "psychological triggers"—objects that remind me to
think a certain way. I work at mentally attracting wealth, for
example, so my primary work environment is full of things that
represent wealth; at last count, 27 such pictures, objects, and artifacts were within view. Because I am very concerned with time, I
have eight clocks around me. I have a wooden hangman's noose
to remind me of deadlines. A painting on my wall of a black tiger
devouring a man in the jungle reminds me of the quote "Tigers
starve last in the jungle," and reminds me to be tough and
aggressive.

A good friend of mine who is very successful at his endeavors has a little plaque on his car dashboard that says: "People Are
Good, Business Is Great, Life Is Terrific!" He wants to see it every
time he makes or takes a call on his car phone or gets out of the
car to go on an appointment.

I think you can "surround yourself" three possible ways: 1.

By accident and happenstance, with no purpose in mind
and no purpose served
2. Consciously or unconsciously, with things that trigger
negative responses, frustration, anger, resentment, depression
3. Deliberately with things selected to reinforce positive—productive—responses.

###### Clean Desk Is a Sign of a Sick Mind"
Let's not be dogmatic about this. I suspect that a person with a
constantly, pristinely clean and neat desk and work environ-ment—a
"Felix"—may very well be neurotic. Certainly I prefer to

believe that. On the other hand, the person immersed in clutti'i
and a chaotic environment—an "Oscar"—MUST waste time by
hunting and searching, must be distracted. There is a broad band
of acceptable style between the two extremes.

Personally, fortunately, largely by "clearing the calculator," I
can sit down and work effectively surrounded by clutter or in
chaos. However, I will tell you that I am most productive in what
I have come to call a "semi-organized environment." As a writer,
for example, I think it's unavoidable to have stacks of papers, reference materials, and other documents around, but I find it very
helpful to have those piles organized by topic or project.

Really creative, innovative thinking seems to come out of
chaos more often than out of neatnik organization. But the successful implementation of innovative ideas seems to come about
in a most organized, disciplined way.

It's worth noting, to paraphrase management guru Peter Drucker,

that what we are after is effectiveness, not necessarily effi_ciency. Put a time-and-motion_ analyst on the typical entrepreneur
and he will come up empty; how do you analyze the guy who sits
on the floor of his office watching daytime TV talk shows and
thumbing through magazines for hours on end, then suddenly hits
upon the right "pitch" for his company's new fitness product?

The most important thing here is to be honest with yourself.
Is the level of clutter and disorganization around you helping or
hindering? Out of control or just about right?

One big time-saving tip I can give you is:

when in doubt, throw it out.

Many people are compulsive keepers. I find a bit of ruthless-ness

toward paper is beneficial. If you seriously doubt you will
need or use it again, go ahead and throw it out immediately. If it
becomes really important, it will be provided to you again. At

of my correspondence files, client records, desk drawers, etc., <ind

office, files, records, and library from one home to

another. More than 100 boxes. Because I'm busy,

some of those boxes have yet to be opened, two years

later, and that's because no need has sent me into

them, looking for anything. Undoubtedly, by the time I

get around to opening them, I'll be able to throw out

what's in them. Which probably means it didn't need to

be kept in the first place. I'm making a note to myself:

be even MORE ruthless.

It's also important for your "workspace" to make it easy for
you to work. My own, in my home office, is not unlike a pilot's
cockpit; without getting out of my swivel chair, I can operate my
computers, my word processor, my TV and VCR, my audiocassette recorder, and my calculator. I can reach my most important
reference books, and I have two "surfaces" for paperwork. Once
you get to work, you ought to be able to stay at work without

having to jump up and down every minute or two to fetch something or put something else away.

The cordless phone is a marvelous invention. If you talk on
the phone a lot, as I do, this enables you to roam, stretch, relax in
a recliner, go find a file, even go outdoors while talking.

###### Now What the Heck Is Feng Shui?
Never let it be said that I don't bring my readers the new and different. Feng shui is the latest Eastern philosophy to be grabbed by
businesses and individuals in the West. Literally translated, it
means "wind and water," and more broadly translated, it is the
art of improving your productivity, creativity, and good fortune
by making the relationships between objects in your environment and yourself more harmonious. You might think of it as
acupuncture for the office—blocked energy can be made to move
more freely.

Just for example, rearranging furniture or replacing a solid
wall with a see-through fish tank might create good feng shui.
William Spear, the author of a book on this subject, Feng Shui
_Made Easy: Designing Your Life with the Ancient Art of Placement,_
likes to tell of being called in to consult with the owners of a failing hotel, the Kings Cross Hyatt in Sydney. By relocating an escalator in the main lobby, money was "attracted" instead of
"repelled," and the hotel zoomed to a high occupancy rate with
no other changes made.

Feng shui experts believe that you can create a "wealth corner" in a room and that you can create a "feeling" in a room conducive to exceptionally productive work. They also believe, as in
the case of hotels and restaurants, that feng shui can make a
property more inviting and comfortable to visitors and guests.

Maybe you find all this a bit "woo-woo-ey." But IORII VifJ
serious business leaders don't. In Hong Kong, big, blue i hip
companies such as Jardines and The Hong Kong B.mk spend,i
fortune on feng shui. Architects routinely consult wilh feng ihul
experts. And it's reported that gambling casino designers uso
feng shui to create "bad luck areas" for the customers.
Short of hiring your own feng shui consultant, how can all
this help you? Well, when I first read about it, I was struck by its
conceptual compatibility with my long-held belief that environment matters and matters differently to different people. This
means that, just like you have a time of day when you are at your
best (and a time of day when you are at your worst), you probably have an "environment" that helps you be your best, too. You
may feel different when surrounded by one color scheme vs.
another, one style of furniture vs. another, in a room with or without a big window, with living things like plants or birds in the
room, and so on. I don't think most people give this much
thought at all but probably should.

If you feel like getting very specific with feng shui, here's one
application: assume that the door to your office is always at 7
o'clock. Look at 11 o'clock; that area represents wealth; 12 o'clock
represents fame; 1 o'clock represents relationships. Let's say there's
an old, maybe chipped or broken bookend holding up a dusty pile
of books and magazines in "wealth." Cleaning that up, dusting off
the books, keeping only some magazines, getting a new bookend,
could release "wealth energy" and improve your fortunes.

Here, I think, is the bottom-line: the space we work in, the
way that space is organized, the tools we use, the objects and
colors we see, the noises we hear, the smells we smell all combine to have an impact on our productivity, and on our ability to
be productive. Much of this is common sense. Some is just slowing

like feng shui, you can. Why not give yourself the advantage of
a high productivity, success environment? Finally—the

###### Militant Attitude
I have come to really, deeply, vehemently, violently resent having
my time wasted. I place a very, very high value on my time, and
I believe that the value you really, honestly place on your time
will control the way others value it and you.

I have talked about this elsewhere in this book and do not
want to redundantly beat up on any one single point, yet this
self-determination is so important. You set your own price. And
you determine whether or not people "get it" and respect it.
When I was in direct sales, managing, motivating, and trying
to help others build their businesses, I was constantly amazed
and often depressed at how little value people placed on their
time and how pitifully unwilling they were to protect it and
wisely invest it. I heard "I didn't because . . . my mother-in-law
decided to surprise us with a visit... my buddy Bob dropped by
and took up the whole evening . .. the roof started to leak and I
had to work on that. . . ." Etc. Etc. But if you already had something very important to do, that you were committed to doing,
mother-in-law would have to sit home alone and watch TV,
buddy Bob would be bounced out, a bucket would be put under
the leak, and you'd stay focused.

How tough are you on those who would undervalue your
time? How tough are you on yourself?

I suppose the biggest problem with all that is the word
"should." It implies "entitlement." And our entire nation is being
rotted out by the viral spread of "entitlement thinking."

Everybody seems to think they are somehow entitled to
something. The Indians think they are entitled to become taxexempt multimillionaires through gambling because of wrongs
done to their ancestors. Minorities believe they are entitled to college admission and jobs based on quotas, regardless of their
qualifications. Women believe they are entitled to all sorts of special treatment from employers so they can have children, raise a
family, and develop a career; "have their cake and eat it too."
Senior citizens believe they are entitled to government benefits
far in excess of whatever they paid in, to free medical care for life,
regardless of how long they live or who has to pay. We even have
a nutcase congressman who has suggested that every American
is entitled to a home and a job, and that our government should
guarantee them these things. The so-called "Gen Xers" seem to
think they are entitled to everything, right now, for doing nothing. And I could keep going. (Have I offended everybody yet?)

Here's the real deal: nobody's entitled to

anything but opportunity. Not even to a

level playing field. Nothing. Nada.

Just opportunity.

as Eric Hoffer, author of The True Believer: Thoughts _on_ _I lie_
_Nature of Mass Movements, wrote: "There are many who find a good_
_alibi far more attractive than an achievement, for an achievement does_
not settle anything permanently. We still have to prove that we are
as good today as we were yesterday. But when we have a valid
alibi for not achieving anything, we are fixed, so to speak, for life.
Moreover, when we have an alibi for not writing a book and not
painting a picture and so on, we have an alibi for not writing the
greatest book and not painting the greatest picture. Small wonder
that the effort expended and the punishment endured in obtaining a good alibi often exceed the effort and grief requisite for the
attainment of a most marked achievement." Hoffer's
observation is one of the finest, most accurate, and
profound I have ever encountered. I

say: no one who is good at making excuses

is also good at making money. The skills are

mutually exclusive. Alibi-itis.

commuting to and from the offices of his law practice. My friends
Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield wrote and had published
or self-published God knows how many books, audiocassettes,

rejection notes from ALL the major publishers for their "ultimate

###### in Minor Matters
It never ceases to amaze me how people can manage to focus
their time, energy, and resources on everything but the few vital
things in their business that really have to do with directly making money.

Just recently, a fellow heard me speak at a seminar, rushed to
the back of the room and bought my "Magnetic Marketing
System," came back to me and enthusiastically told me how
much he learned from my talk and how excited he was about
implementing my ideas, pumped my hand like Jack LaLanne,
and tore out of there like the Tasmanian devil. About a week
later, his copy of my System came into my office with the mail­
man, with a note sheepishly asking for a refund. On arriving

home, the man discovered he already had my System, sitting on
a shelf, still shrink-wrapped in plastic, purchased at a seminar
over a year earlier. Now, it's not the fact that it was my System,
but what on earth had he been doing every hour of every day for
a year that was more important than enhancing his business'
ability to attract and acquire new customers?

Not long ago, I did a bit of consulting for a guy with a small
chain of retail stores. He just about begged for my help. Said he
wasn't making it and had no money to do any advertising or
marketing with. I gave him a simple, easy-to-implement idea—a
change in the way incoming calls were handled—that would easily double his sales. I know it would. It's proven. After a few
months passed, I asked him how that strategy was working. He
explained that he'd been too busy to try it. Too busy doing what?
He couldn't tell me. Just too busy.

Well, here's how to get focused, if you're having trouble in
that department: identify and write down the three most important, most significant, most productive, most valuable things you
can do to foster success in your particular enterprise. Just three.
Write them down. From there, translate them into three actions
you can take each and everyday. Write them down.

For example, one of the most important things to me is a continuous stream of new requests for my services. As long as this
demand for "me" exceeds the available supply of "me," I can
demand and get premium fees, insist on first-class travel, choose
clients I like and blow off those I don't, choose projects that interest me and reject those I don't, confidently turn away business
knowing the temporary vacuum will fill, and generally do as I
darned well please. But if I let the demand diminish so that supply exceeds demand, I have to start compromising all over the

place. So this is very important to me. What can I do every day to
be certain this demand-supply ratio stays weighted in my favor?

I do not let a day go by that I do not send out a letter or a
package, make or return a phone call, get an article published, do
something to keep my books on bookstore shelves, secure a highprofile speaking engagement, or do something else to create and
stimulate "deal flow." It doesn't matter how busy I am. Or how
tired I am. Or if it's the Friday before a holiday weekend.
Whatever. Before sunset, at least ONE thing will be done intended
to stimulate demand.

Nothing and no one can steal the time required to make certain that happens. Every single day. No exceptions. No excuses.

As a direct result, "demand" for me has steadily grown, even
as the "supply" I am willing to offer has diminished, which has
allowed me to very substantially raise my fees, keep raising them
every year, fire troublesome clients without remorse, and do
business entirely on my terms, to suit me. This one single, simple
discipline has been worth millions.

But I'll bet if you followed the typical entrepreneur around

"never got around to" doing any one of those three things at all.

###### Breaking the Code of Extraordinarily Successful People
Early in my career, I was very fortunate to be exposed to some of
the greatest "success educators," such as Earl Nightingale, Dr.
Maxwell Maltz, Napoleon Hill, and, the more contemporary Zig

Ziglar and Jim Rohn. More recently, for ten years, I got to appear
frequently as a speaker on programs with Rohn, Zig, Brian Tracy,
Tom Hopkins, and others like them.

Jim Rohn is a very interesting fellow. You've undoubtedly
seen Tony Robbins on television. Did you know that Jim Rohn
was one of Tony's earliest coaches, mentors, and employers? If
you want real, well-grounded "meat" from someone in the personal development area, it's hard to beat Jim Rohn. Anyway,
there's a point Jim makes that stuck with me when I first heard
him say it, when I was a kid, and that still has impact when I hear
him talk about it today. It breaks the code of the highly successful person. It takes all the mystery and mystique away. When you
very closely examine the highly successful person, in any field,
you walk away saying to yourself:

_Well, it's no wonder he's doing so well. Look at everything_
_he does._

You see, success isn't much of a mystery. In that respect, it's
actually disappointing to a lot of people who want it to be very
complicated, who, as we discussed earlier, prefer a good alibi.
But it's just a reflection of what you are doing with your time.

I would now add to Rohn's statement, "... and look very
closely at the one thing or two or three things he gets done without fail, every single day."

I can do a good job of predicting what your bank balance will
be a year from now, if you'll give me the following information:

 - What's in the account today

 - A list of the books you read and tapes you listened to last
month

 - Some information about the five people you hang out with
most

**CHAPTER 13 / REASONS WHY A YEAR PASSES AND NO MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IS MADE**

_%_ **NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

 - A little analysis of how you spend your time during an
average week

For 90% of all people, by the way, making this prediction is a
no-brainer. The correct guess is: same as it was last year.

If you happen to be "stuck," then just taking some action to
change isn't even enough. Jim Rohn calls this "The _principle_ _of_
_massive action." And when you look at highly successful people,_
you'll find they are massive action takers. They don't just try one
solution to a problem, they implement 20 all at the same time.

I once had a dentist call me, after having gone home from my
weekend seminar, and tell me: "I've made a list of 300 things to
change in the practice." Every week, he did ten of them. After 30
weeks, he had done everything on that list, big and small. And,
without a penny increase in advertising, without a dollar's difference in marketing, in the same office, with (almost) the same
staff, his practice had more than quadrupled in volume. He took
massive action. When I tell the story, the usual, predictable reaction is astonishment and dismay—"Three _hundred changes? I'd_
never get 300 things done."

I've had the interesting experience of spending just a little bit of
time personally with Lee Iacocca, and I have studied him a lot from
afar. Iacocca did not rescue Chrysler by doing one thing. Or
one thing at a time. He took massive action. He pursued the
government-backed bailout, he slashed operating costs, he rushed
the design and release of exciting new cars, he went on TV personally in Chrysler's commercials and took his case to the public, he
boldly put forth the strongest warranty in the history of the auto
industry, he negotiated with the unions and the employees. And
it's no wonder he saved that company. Look at everything he did.

###### >nly Asi tions and Answers About Peak Persona! Productivity Although,

_it lias_ been sorne years since I've conducted _tiraz_
management seminars, the questions my clients, subscribers, and friends asked these days about being more
productive are not very different from questions asked by workshop participants years ago. In this chapter, I answer the most
frequently asked questions. Hopefully, these include the questions you've been wanting to ask.

**Q: I just read a book titled Don't Set Goals, yet you insist that**

**at it myself. Is it really necessary?**

144 ® _HO B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs_

A: The subject of "goals" or "goal-setting" is a very big umbrell.i.
What most people mean by goal-setting is writing down, usi i
ally in some detail, lists or collections of long-term, mediuir
term, and short-term goals. Most time management system
include weekly and daily to-do lists, which are really
another way of listing goals. And most goal-setting teaching
breaks down goals by category: business or career, financial,
personal, social, family, love relationship, self-improvement,
spiritual, and so forth. And J would say that there are a lot more
_successful entrepreneurs who follow this approach than there are_
_who don't._

Also, for many people, the disciplined act of focusing on
questions such as What do I really want? What do I want my
_business to be like in three years? and writing down answers is_
very productive in and of itself. _I've never known or met a suc-_
_cessful entrepreneur who wasn't a list maker. So I think it's diffi_
cult to mount a good argument against goal-setting. As you
get really good at goal-setting, get more in control of your
mind, and get more successful, you may do less of it and may
be a bit sketchier or broader in your view, but you'll still benefit
from the process. Personally, I have a bank of short-, medium-,
and long-term goals, some very clear and well-defined,
some fuzzy and evolving. I tend to work on them and check
my actions against them at least once a month.

As I understand it some lecturers contend that most people
just won't set goals, so why teach what people won't do? Not
much of a case, I think when you understand that highly successful people do what most folks aren't willing to do in all
aspects of behavior. Actually, the fact that 90% or 95% of the

i

-----

**g** **p**

people randomly surveyed have never written down
detailed goals and have no intention of doing so is the best
argument of all for doing it. When I did a lot of speaking on
this topic (I now specialize in seminars on marketing), I used
to spring this on audiences: I'd pull out a big wad of $100
bills and offer one to each person with some kind of written
goals on them in pockets, purses, or briefcases. Typically,
with 100 salespeople or entrepreneurs in a room, I'd only
have to give away a few bills. But here's what's instructive:
when I would later quiz those people, I'd routinely discover
that the ones who got the $100 bills needed them least
because they were the most successful individuals there.

**Q: What do you do when you fail to hit a goal? Or, more mun-**
danely, find that you can't meet a deadline?

A: Let's take the second one first. Business is all about the setting and meeting of deadlines. Meeting them is usually a
combination of being adept at estimating or forecasting the
amount of time you'll need, then blocking out that time, as
we discussed in this book, delegating or obtaining help if
possible, and having the self-discipline to do what proves
necessary to get the job done.

_If you are going to miss a deadline, and you wonder what to do,_ _just_
_do the right thing. Doing the right thing is magic. I've spoken_
a number of times at events where General Norman
Schwarzkopf has also been a speaker. His topic, appropriately,
is leadership—although every point he covers applies equally
well to peak personal productivity, because we are our own
leaders. Anyway, one of his keys is simply "Do the Right
Thing." And, you know, we almost always know what the

**CHAPTER 14** **/ COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT PEAK PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY**

leadership—although

_do,_

-----

0 _iJO_ B **.s. Time Management** **for Entrepreneurs**

right thing to do is. We may not like it. We may not want lo
do it. But we know what it is. And when we do it, we gain
stature in the eyes of others, we gain self-esteem, and we gain
personal power.

As to a missed goal, I think "failure" is too harsh of a word,
in most cases. If every coach, coaching staff, and team who
set out to win the Super Bowl quit trying the first time they
missed getting there, we'd watch the same two teams in the
Super Bowl year after year, forever. Actually, a high achiever's secret that was taught to me very early in my career
defies logic, but it works. Here it is: don't reset the same goal.
Don't back off to a less ambitious goal. Instead, create a similar but bigger and more exciting goal with a new, appropriate time line.

Failure is a part of success. The most commonly used illustration is Babe Ruth, "The Home Run King," famous for his 714
home runs. But he also struck out 1,330 times. R.H. Macy
failed in seven businesses before hitting a home run with the
now-famous Macy's Department Store. The batteries we use
in our cars, in flashlights, in toys, and in electronics all exist
as a result of Thomas Edison striking out with five years of
experiments. You have to learn to master failure in order to
have success.

**Q: When you delegate, when you turn things over to other**
**people, aren't you inevitably going to have a lot of prob-**
**lems, foul-ups, even outright theft?**

A: Different businesses have different kinds of problems in this
area. But there are two overriding supervisory rules that
you'll want to remember. One: expect the best. Expectations

**Management**

lo

have enormous impact on results. And conveyed expectations
have great impact on most people. Most folks are smarter and
more capable than we give them credit for. Some never get
challenged. But rule number two is: know that you only have the
_right to expect what you inspect. If you want to know what hap-_
pens with zero accountability and zero supervision, read the
novel Lord of the Flies. The fact that performance improves
with measurement and accountability to someone else has
been proven everywhere from sports to weight loss to business. So, you have to walk a fine line between empowering
and encouraging but not turning loose; between inspecting
and critiquing but not micro-managing.

**Q: What's the biggest single problem with delegating? And**
what do you do about it?

A: The biggest problem is with the little things. Let's say you
ask someone a question; says he has to check records or
otherwise get the answer for you, but he never does that
unless you remember to ask him again. What do you do
about it? Suffer. Make notes and remember to ask again. Of
course, you can insist that your employees jot these things
down. Or you can do everything by memo; you create a
paper blizzard, but you have total accountability. For me,
this area is the most frustrating part of dealing with
employees or associates.

Here is the best insurance policy against things falling
through the cracks: for each person you delegate to, have a
list of everything, big or small, that you turn over to that person. As each one responds, you can mark off the items. Every
so often, check the list for the lagging items. Frankly, this is a

**CHAPTER 14 / COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT PEAK PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY**

-----

**<gf** **NO B.s. Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

bit cumbersome. However, I've used it off and on over the
years, and it's the only reliable control method I've found.

When I was office-bound for a few years, I used a storyboard.
One whole wall in my office was cork-covered, and in one
section there was a vertical section for each person I worked
with. I always had a little stack of VA x 2M-inch square cards
with me. Whenever I gave someone a question, task, project,
whatever, I wrote it on a card, dated the card, and stuck it up
on the wall. When they came back to me with the completed
task, I took the card off. In an instant, at a glance, I—or anybody else—could see who was working on what. And this
worked pretty darned well.

**Q: What about the idea of only doing things you really like to**
**do? Some people teach that as a success strategy.**

A: Well, I've never advocated that. I just saw an article in our
local newspaper with a photo of a homeless man sitting
under a tree reading a book, and the caption said that this
man passed his time doing only what he wanted to do: reading great literature and playing cards with friends. But he's
_homeless. I think doing only what you want to do is a prescription_
_for poverty. But diverting as much of your time as you can to_
those few things you do extraordinarily well, that's a prescription for peak productivity. You can never eliminate
doing some things you dislike and some things you may not
even do well. I like speaking, especially to large audiences,
and I like being highly paid for doing so. I hate travel, but I
found out they won't bring those really big audiences to my
house. So I got good at traveling. I still don't like it, but I'm
a savvy, efficient, comfort-and-convenience trick-laden road

I—or

warrior. I don't particularly like pitching my books and
tapes from the platform either; I'd rather just speak, get a
standing ovation, and get back in the limo. But if I want to
appear at certain events, and if I want to make $20,000.00 to
$50,000.00 or more per speech, I've got to sell my stuff—and
do a damned good job of it. So I've gotten quite good at it.
So good that other speakers pay me sizable fees to help them
do it better.

I've read a few really airy-fairy, way-way out there metaphysical authors who insist they'd rather do only what they
enjoy, without exception, and be poor than do things they
don't like doing in order to have material things. Some of
these guys are outright phonies: telling large numbers of
lazy people what they want to hear in order to separate
them from what little money they have. Others really
believe what they are saying but are, privately, insanely
jealous of others who do well. I know one such sackclothand-ashes lecturer and author who, although pretty well
known, barely scrapes together a living each year, who
insists that he is happy and that happiness counts more
than material wealth. But mention Tony Robbins to him and
he goes on a 20-minute tirade. He is violently jealous of
Tony's phenomenal financial success and his fame. And that
reveals what he really wants. I've concluded that, one way
or another, these folks are full of B.S.

Highly successful people do what they need to do, whether
they like it or not, in order to get the results they want. This
is objective orientation versus activity orientation. BUT don't
miss the point that you should redirect energies to the few
things you do best at every opportunity.

stuff—and

**®** **NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

**Q:** **H o w do you conquer procrastination?**

A: Heck if I know. I procrastinate. And I believe everybody
does. Fortunately the things I do it with most are relatively
trivial. For example, I hate shopping, so anything I can't buy
out of a catalog, I usually don't buy until it's a blatant, urgent
necessity. Most of the successful entrepreneurs I know tend
to be most productive under deadline pressure and often
need imposed or self-imposed pressure to get into a difficult
task. The often taught advice is: first, do what you want to do
least. Sometimes that works for me, sometimes it doesn't. I
also think there are areas where you SHOULD procrastinate.
For example, if I have an idea, question, decision, or whatever,
and I can't make a decision quickly, I'll deliberately set it side
for a period of time before revisiting it. I have a procrastination place" for reading material that can wait and a "procrastination pile" for correspondence or other work that has no
particular urgency. I'm always amazed at how much of that
stuff takes care of itself when it is left alone for a few weeks
or months. 1

_think the important thing is to be honest with yourself. If you are_
putting something off, don't pretend otherwise. And it's also
important to keep controlling, setting, and addressing your
own priorities rather than reacting to those of other people.
Too many overloaded entrepreneurs still operate on the
"squeaky wheel gets the grease" basis. Although that is understandable and although it can provide survival, that philosophy cannot produce peak productivity. You want to be the one
making very deliberate decisions about how you invest your time—then

stick to those decisions as much as possible.

Lisa Kanarek, author of the fine book Organizing Your Home
_Office for Success,_ uses the term "selective neglect." See,
"selective" means you are in control, doing the selecting and
doing it for the right reasons.

**Q: I'm a salesperson, and I wonder: how can I sell effectively**
**to super-busy people like you? Entrepreneurs and CEOs**
who do not have a minute to spare.

A: The way to get through to us is the same way you get
through to anybody; it's just that the need to hit it right on
the mark is magnified with us. The key is speaking to our self_interest. If you can perfectly match your message, your prom-_
ise to MY fears that haunt me at night, MY concerns that are
foremost in my mind right now, and MY desires that I would
kill to fulfill, then, believe me, you'll get as much of my time
as you want. Most salespeople are much too product- and
process-oriented, not sufficiently prospect-oriented.

You have to come to grips, totally, with the unhappy fact that
these busy prospects do not have one whit of interest in your
product, your company, your company's credibility, your prices—none

of that. You've just got to let loose of all those
concepts. You must put together what I call a "Magnetic
Marketing Message" that focuses on things of prime, overriding interest to the people you want to reach.

For example, a few years ago I did a little pro bono consulting with the Arizona Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation
about securing more, new corporate sponsors for their
telethon. The Foundation couldn't get the key CEOs it wanted
to talk with to give them the time of day. That's because

**CHAPTER 14 / COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT PEAK PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY**

-----

**^** **NO B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs**

Foundation representatives were talking about the Arthritis
Foundation. I created a new message aimed at these CEOs—
telling them about new, creative, very-low cost opportunities
to get massive, prestigious public recognition for their companies featuring prime TV advertising at about 25 cents on
the dollar vs. what they would normally pay. I created a letter that played to their egos, presented a logical case, had
something new to offer, and hit the fear button—that their
competitors might beat them out for an exclusive. Some of
these busy CEOs called the very same day they got my letter.
Companies such as Federal Express and Domino's Pizza
raced to get involved.

If you're going to sell to me, for example, there are six, maybe
seven, things of such enormous interest to me that would
force me to drop whatever I was doing, suspend my skepticism, and give you my undivided, enthusiastic attention. If
you can figure out what one, or some, of those things are and
link yourself and what you offer to those interests, you break
through. If you don't, odds are excellent that the busyness of
my schedule will shut you out.

Q: How do you handle all of your communication? You must
get a zillion letters, faxes, and phone calls.

A: You're not kidding. I get a lot of correspondence. I try to
make instant decisions and move the paper immediately and
quickly whenever I can. With people I work with frequently,
I'll often type my response right on the bottom or even up the
side of the letter or fax they sent me. I also try to throw out
everything I can. Even though I need to read my "junk mail,"
as a practitioner of direct mail, I keep only a few pieces for

**CHAPTER 14 / COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT PEAK PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY**

-----

**B.s.** **Time Management for Entrepreneurs ®** 153

my files. I save only the documents I need, and throw out the
envelopes and enclosures. If I can't act on something immediately, my next preference is to get it into my Tickler Files. If
I can pick up the phone and deal with something quickly and
easily, I do it. Oh, and my incoming mail is screened, so a few
things get handled without me even seeing them. And I'm
able to delegate some stuff immediately. The big goal is to
avoid having piles of paper that you haven't acted on,
haven't filed, don't know where to file, but aren't willing to
throw out.

As an aside, when asked what one, single quality he looked
for in his top associates, Lee Iacocca said "Decisiveness." I
look around today in business—and government—and I'm
dismayed at the inability and unwillingness of the so-called
leaders to make a decision, clearly enunciate it, and stand up
for it. The more decisions you make and the faster you make
them, the more productive you are.

Q: What's the worst mistake you can make related to productivity?

A: Losing control. To anything or anybody. Control and productivity are inextricably intertwined. How can you be productive
if you are not in control? It follows, then, that the more control you exert, the more productive you are.

The minute you get diverted to dealing with somebody else's
priorities at the expense of your own, you're headed down a
very slippery slope. Doesn't matter if that happens because
somebody is hovering in your doorway, sending a fax, calling, whatever. You can't let it happen. When I had a fairly
large staff, I had people hang in my doorway for 20 minutes

while I refused to visually or verbally acknowledge them
before they finally gave up and left. My own habit, when I'm
in town, is often to do a little bit of reading, easy paperwork,
and organizing in the evening while watching television. I
prefer to regroup in the evening for the next day But if I
don't, the first thing I do the next morning—after my writing time—is
to regroup, reorganize, and establish my priorities
for the day. As each day goes along, people spring things on
you, unexpected good things as well as unexpected bad
things happen, and the firm grip you have on your time is
forcibly loosened. At the end of the day, you've got to put
things back together so you can begin the next day with a
firm grip.

**V** no holds barred, no-nonsense, no B.S. book you have
ever read on succeeding as an entrepreneur.

I wrote the first edition of this book back in 1993, and since
then, I've personally heard from thousands of readers from all
over the world. You saw a few of their comments on the opening
pages of this book. It struck a chord with entrepreneurs; the
chord of authenticity. No college classroom theory, no baloney.
Real world truths from somebody who succeeds day in, day out,
as an entrepreneur, working without a net. Since then, a lot has
happened in my life, business and personal. For example, I've
sold two businesses I built up; walked away from a very important and lucrative nine-year business relationship; made wellplanned, continual, evolutionary changes in my other businesses;
gone through a divorce after 22 years of marriage; been diagnosed
diabetic; and more. I'm pleased to report I'm happier than I've
been in many years and am living the life I set out to live. 162

Anyway, all these changes, new experiences, and lessons I've
learned from my clients certainly warranted a complete updating
of this book.

It is a personal book, me talking straight with you, as if I was
consulting with you and as if we were sitting around at the end
of the day on my deck, watching the sunset, enjoying adult beverages, and just hanging out. Because it is personal, along the
way I'll be telling you quite a bit about me and about my business life—past, present, and future. None of this is about bragging. I have no need for that or interest in doing it. What I share,
I tell you so that you understand the basis for the advice and
opinions I dispense.

I have occasionally been introduced as The Professor of
Harsh Reality. This does NOT mean I'm negative. If anything,
I'm one of the most optimistic, positive-minded people you'll
ever meet. However, I do not believe in confusing positive thinking with fantasy. And the word optimism, like many words in our
perplexing English language, has more than one meaning.
There's a mammoth difference between earned, deserved, justified optimism and wild-eyed, blue-sky, stubborn optimism.

I've discovered that I'm most successful when I have a firm
grip on what is and least successful when caught wrestling with
what ought to be.

In this book, I've tried to share, from my 25-plus years of
entrepreneurial adventure, what is. Not what should he or what is
only in theoretical books, classrooms, or seminar rooms.

**_If You Are Already in Business for Yourself_**
This book will help you go forward more astutely, efficiently,
productively, and confidently. I think you'll also catch yourself

nodding as you go along, saying to yourself, "This guy has been
where I live." Sometimes there is value in just finding out you're
not alone! The very first "success education" that I was ever
exposed to was a set of recordings by Earl Nightingale titled Lead
_the Field, that I listened to when I was in my early teens. In those_
tapes, Nightingale gave me badly needed permission to violate
the norms I saw around me, with his dramatic statement:

_If you have no successful example to follow in whatever_
_endeavor you choose, you may simply look at what everyone_
_else around you is doing and do the opposite,_ _because—THE_
_MAJORITY IS ALWAYS WRONG._

That may not be a precise, verbatim quote; but it is what I
recall and have stored in my subconscious as a primary guiding
principle. This leads to my strategy of deliberately questioning all
industry norms, deliberately violating most of them, and encouraging my clients to do the same. It also led to my coining of the
term "Mediocre Majority" to succinctly describe the vast undistinguished middle of any industry or profession. Anyway, Earl said a
lot of things I had been thinking but had never heard anyone validate, and that gave me a great boost of confidence and conviction.
Maybe some of my words, here, will do the same for you.

Most entrepreneurs tell me that the feeling they get from this
book make them instantly eager to share it with other entrepreneurs. Please do so! If you want some place to send them, refer

is no place for the timid, nervous, or easily worried to come and
play.

If it doesn't scare you off, it will help you avoid many pitfalls
and problems and help you cope with those that can't be avoided.
It will not cover the basics. There are plenty of books out there on
the basics, and we're not going to cover the same ground all over
again. This is not a how-to-start-a-small-business book. This is a go-for-the-jugular
success book.
As I said earlier, I am not a fuzzy-headed academic, pocketprotector-and-wingtip-shoes accountant, or other theorist,
although plenty of these pretenders write business books. I'm
also not a retired authority who runs a business in my memory.
I've been on the firing line meeting a payroll, battling the bankers
and bureaucrats, struggling to satisfy customers, and solving real
business problems. Over years, I've arrived at a point where my
own business is engineered to meet all my lifestyle preferences—
for example, only one employee, in a distant office, not underfoot; no set hours; no unscheduled phone calls. But still, I deal
with clients and vendors and real business life just like you do. I
also work very hands-on with clients in a wide variety of businesses, as well as being "the consultant to the consultants"—I
advise more than 50 different leading marketing and business
consultants, each exclusively serving a different business or professional niche, in direct, hands-on relationships with more than
one million small business owners. I want you to know this
because I think it makes this book more valuable to you.

I'll never forget taking over a company with 43 employees,
never having managed more than two people in my life. I
grabbed every management book I could get my paws on and
sucked up all the experts' advice. Then, after a couple of months

of getting my brains beat in every day by my employees, I started
to look critically at the credentials of those "expert" authors.
Most of them had never—I repeat, never—managed a workforce.
These geniuses spewing out creative management, nonmanipulative management, Japanese management, open-door management, and everything-else management wouldn't have survived
a week in the real world. I resent those authors to this day. And
it's a shame that a lot of college kids get that management theory,
that is, fantasy sold to them as reality. So, I chucked all their
books, rolled up my sleeves, used my common sense, and started
finding out what really works and what doesn't.

Ever since then, I look at every new business book with suspicion. Most won't pass muster because most can't pass the realexperience test. I was originally motivated to write this book
largely because reading most of the other books written for and
sold to entrepreneurs turned my stomach.

I also want you to know that there are a lot more things I
haven't got a clue about than there are things I understand; in
this book, I have not dealt with any of the many things I'm in the
dark about. Everything in here is based on my own expensive
experience. It may not be right. You may not agree with it. But at
least you should know that I didn't swipe it out of somebody
else's book, give it a jazzy new psychobabble name, and pass it
off as a new miracle tonic.

**_It's about Getting Rich_**
I also know you can't eat philosophy. So, although there is a lot
of my own philosophy in this book, its primary job is to show
you how to make more money then you ever imagined possible,
faster than you can believe possible. This is a book about getting

rich. If that offends you, please put this book back on the shelf or
take it back to the store and get a refund. Spend your money on
milk and cookies instead. You'll be happier. In fact, I'd like to
quickly clear up a big misconception about what being an entrepreneur and owning and building a business is all about. The
purpose is not to employ people, not to do social good, not to pay
taxes. A lot of liberals think those are the purposes of business.
Nuts to them. The purpose of being an entrepreneur is to get really, really rich, and reward yourself for taking on all the risk and
responsibility with exactly the kind of life and lifestyle you want.
Facilitating that is the sole aim of this book.

Before getting into the "meat," on the next few pages, you'll
find a brief description of my business activities past and present
and my current business in the back of the book beginning on
page 247.1 think you'll benefit more from the book if you understand where I'm coming from; however, you can choose to skip
these pages if you like and jump right to Chapter 1. Your choice.

I'd like to explain the Mary Poppins quote at the top of this
Preface. Mary Poppins was one of the first movies I was taken to
see in a theater as a child. I watched it just the other night on
cable TV and enjoyed it thoroughly. If you've seen it, you can
probably call up the scene of Julie Andrews and the children
singing the "just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go
down" song. It's a lovely thought. (Or as she would say, "loverly")
In real business life, however, the emotional need for spoonfuls
of sugar is very dangerous. How well you can take medicine—
deal with reality—has a great deal to do with how successful
you are as an entrepreneur.

There's a legendary book by Napoleon Hill I hope you've
read, titled Think and Grow Rich. In that book, he enumerates 17

success principles adhered to in common by the hundreds of history's greatest entrepreneurial achievers he studied, interviewed
and worked with, such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford,
Thomas Edison, and so on. Of the 17 principles, the one everybody seems to like the least and ignore the most is "accurate
thinking." I believe it to be the most important one. So this book,
my book, is heavy on that principle. It is medicine without the
accompaniment of sugar.

Finally, let me say that, when I graduated high school, my
parents were flat broke. I started with no family money. I didn't
step into a family business. No one handed me anything on a silver platter. At age 49,1 am semi-retiring, a multimillionaire, free
to live precisely as I choose, indulging my interest in horse racing. It was all made possible through the kind of thinking, attitudes, habits, and strategies I've laid out in this book. I have been
blunt, forthright, and held nothing back.

With that said, I still hope you not only profit from this book,
but enjoy reading it. And I welcome your comments, thoughts, or
questions. You can communicate with me directly by fax, 602269-3113. —Dan

are basically four types of salespeople: sales professionals with strong ambition who are eager to strengthen
and fine-tune their skills; sales professionals who are
jaded, close-minded, cynical, and stuck; nonsalespeople who
realize they need to be, such as doctors, auto repair shop owners,
carpet cleaners; and nonsalespeople who either do not recognize
they need to be or are resistant to the idea.

This book will resonate with those in the first and third quadrant. It will be wasted on the others. I've spent more than onefourth of an entire lifetime, more than 25 years, working with
people in both the first and third quadrant—and doing my level
best to avoid the folks in the second and fourth. This book liter­
ally summarizes the most important strategies I've developed
over those 25 years—some originating from my own experience,
others originating from my observation of super-successful sales
pros' behaviors that I have converted to replicatable strategy.

_There are_ _a great many things this book is NOT. It is NOT, for_
example, a textbook approach to selling. It is not about moral or
spiritual philosophy (those matters are left to you). It is only
slightly about the psychology of selling. It is noticeably free of
trendy new terminology, buzzwords, and psycho-babble so
many sales trainers and authors seem to be fond of. And it is not
a motivational book either. If you need someone else to motivate
you, you have far bigger problems than this book might tackle.
Or any hundred books, for that matter.

_This is simply a straightforward, relentlessly pragmatic, "no b.s."_
_presentation of what REALLY works in selling. Not what should_
work. Not the academic theories about selling. What REALLY
works.

_You may not thoroughly enjoy this book. It may make you_
uncomfortable. Confronting, challenging, and rethinking longheld beliefs and habits is provocative and often profitable but
rarely comfortable or enjoyable.

_My aim is very simple: after reading this book, I intend for you_
to implement behavioral and procedural changes that will immediately and dramatically increase the income you earn from selling. This book is all about putting more money in your pocket,

nothing loftier than that, nothing less than that. And if we have to
break a few eggs to make that omelet, then that's what we'll do.

You might want to know that this book has had a long former
life. It was first published in 1994, has been in print continuously
through 1996, a 2nd edition was published in 1999, which was in
print through 2001, and now this thoroughly updated and substantially expanded in this new edition. Why is it important for
you to know you've wound up with "the sales book that will not
die" in your hands? Two reasons. First, as evidence you've gotten your paws on strategies that ARE really valuable and that DO
really work. Successful salespeople recommend this book to each
other, they stream to the bookstores and demand it. Even when a
publisher has lost interest in it, the marketplace has insisted this
book be put back onto the store shelves. (By the way, now you can
[tell others about this book by sending them to www.nobsbooks.](http://www.nobsbooks)
com, to get free excerpts.) Second, you will see references in the
book that are obviously dated, or references to my writing of its
first edition, and I didn't want you to be confused by that; thus,
this explanation.

Now, to the important stuff: quick, practical actions you can
take to make selling easier, less stressful, more fun, and much,
much more lucrative and rewarding.

###### About the Structure of This Book
This book is divided into six parts. In Part 1, I describe the 15
strategies I use most in selling. Each is a stand-alone application,
and any one of them alone could significantly improve your
results in selling. But they can also be linked together differently
for different situations for increased value and power.

PREFACE TO NO B.S. SALES SUCCESS

-----

###### ® NO B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs

In Part 2, I deal with what goes on before selling can even
begin: finding, attracting, and getting into a selling situation with
a prospect. As you'll see, I'm no fan of the way most salespeople
carry out this job. Here you'll discover some rather radical ideas.

In Part 3, I provide a framework for selling. The various
pieces described in Parts 1 and 2 can be plugged in and out of
this structure.

In Part 4,1 share with you the dumbest things salespeople do
to sabotage themselves.

In Part 5, I reveal my personal, best, most valued, contrary
approach to selling. It may not be for everybody; it may not be
for you. Frankly, I argued with myself about putting it in or leaving it out. I ultimately decided I would not be playing fair with
you if I sold you a book about selling and held back the information most responsible for my own success. Use it as you will, and
good luck.

In the last decade, the sales world has been flooded with new
technology, and Part 6 of this edition contains an updated section
on my "no b.s." observations of this. —Dan
