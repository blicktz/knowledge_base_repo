###### INTRODUCTION
#### LEARN THE SECRETS OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO
 HAVE CREATED A FLOOD OF NEW CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS, OR PATIENTS

-----

###### You have finally found it!

 The one place created for entrepreneurs and business owners BY entrepreneurs and business owners seeking to finally answer that common, nagging question:

#### “Why am I working harder and not
 seeing more money?”

###### All business owners, regardless of their current success or

 lack of success, are stuck—either you are growing or you’re dying. There is no middle ground. Which leaves you with

 great opportunity.

 You have worked hard, created a good business with a steady revenue, a somewhat reliable customer base, and

 profit margins that at least keep you above water.
 Yet, you feel like the proverbial hamster on the wheel. You

 keep running faster and faster and yet you can’t seem to

 break that cycle. Every day feels like a struggle just to keep your head above water. You’re wondering what happened to

 that dream of owning a business—a dream where you didn’t have to worry about money, where you could take an

 afternoon off care free to watch your child’s school play. What

 happened to that dream?
 You’ve tried marketing: you’ve spent serious money on ads

 that didn’t work, direct mail that under-delivered, Pay-Per- Click advertising that has drained your bank account dry, and

 probably a host of other approaches, none of which have

 delivered the results promised or expected.
 Like most business owners, you sometimes feel confused

 and overwhelmed; getting hammered on all sides with

-----

###### “advisors” saying do one thing or another after another; and feeling like you have to press harder, to do more and more—

 just to get the same results. Or less.

 I’m here to help you—to mute all that noise and provide you with a set of principles (not tactics) and the resources to

 magnetically attract clients who are ready, willing and able to move forward with you.

 And by resources, I mean my duplicatable machine for not

 only attracting clients, but converting clients and multiplying one client into two.

 Marketing is an ever-changing world, as new media seems

 to pop up every day, but if you learn the principles that allow you to magnetically attract clients, you can make any media

 at any time work. When you develop a system that feeds you new clients on a daily basis, you will never feel the anxiety of

 wondering when or where your next client will come from! In

 fact, you can finally take a vacation without checking your phone every hour.

 If you’re at least open to the notion that maybe, just maybe there’s a better way forward than the one you’ve traveled

 thus far— and if you’re reading this now with an open mind

 willing to cautiously believe in that possibility...
 Then this book is for you.

 WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK

 I’m here to offer a radical and challenging idea that just about everything you think you know and have been conditioned to

 believe about growing your business is wrong.

-----

###### I am here to mute the noise and guide you to clarity about a relatively short list of fundamental principles and strategies

 that can prevent you from being lost in a dense forest of

 media demanding your attention, time, and money.
 If you get it, you’ll smack yourself in the head for not

 seeing it all sooner, on your own. You’ll be in awe of how

 much sense it makes. You’ll never look at an ad, sales letter or website the same again. Traditional advertising and

 marketing will be ruined for you.
 But let me warn you—when you do get it, you’ll also be

 criticized by employees, argued with by everyone, and

 ridiculed by even family and friends. You will need your results and a steel spine to stay strong. The outstanding

 results you’ll see when shifting from ordinary marketing to response-driven marketing will convince you. You will need

 courage and discipline to stay your new course.

 I promise you that being thought a “fool” or “misguided renegade” and having millions of dollars trumps being

 thought of as “normal” and “correct” and “proper” and barely making a living.

 WHERE DID THESE IDEAS ORIGINATE?

 These ideas began with a discovery—or more accurately, a

 series of discoveries—that could well form the most important realization you w
ill ever arrive at as a business person. It’s

 disappointing and frustrating at first
, but empowering if embraced and acted upon.

 I discovered:

-----

###### You can have the most wonderful product or greatest

 service ever invented and still starve.

 You can be a spectacular sales person and still starve.

 You can have a positive attitude that Norman Vincent

 Peale would envy and be as motivated as a participant at a Tony Robbins seminar and still

 starve.

 You can be a master closer, closing sales at will left

 and right, and still starve.

 You can provide great value, great service, great expertise and still starve.

 Your business can literally be a paragon of virtues,

 with the world seemingly singing your praises 24/7, and even as you bask in their applause, you can still starve.

 The realization you must come to is this: you could very well

 starve, you won’t get rich, and you certainly won’t have peace of mind…
 Unless and until you have an affordable, efficient,

 dependable means of attracting a sufficient flow of qualified LEADS and BUYERS.
 Most business owners sort of know this but they still focus on everything but the one thing that will make all the

 difference in the world to their success: Marketing.
 All the frustrations and internal problems you’re experiencing with your business today are because you

-----

###### DON’T have a good Marketing System
.
 Many businesses have good products, good services—all

 that and more—but they fail because they can’t give themselves enough sales opportunities. To paraphrase Thoreau, most business owners lead lives of desperation

 because they don’t know how to create a steady and sufficient supply of qualified customers.

 IT’S TIME FOR A DIFFERENT VISION

 I’ve been teaching these principles in various forms since the mid-1970s—due to the dire economic conditions at that time, I referred to them as “The Small Business Emergency Survival

 Kit.” They have gradually grown into the system I call “Magnetic Marketing
 ” today, which has quickly spread throughout the United States and all over the world.
 The principles in this book have been tested over and over

 again, not just by myself, but by entrepreneurs and business owners of all shapes, sizes, locations, and industries. Today, we have students in 167 different countries using these

 principles to create a steady flow of new customers, clients, or patients in their businesses. They use these strategies to scale, grow, and differentiate their businesses—to rise above

 price competition and to quickly demand (and receive) top dollar for their services.
 As you read through this book, you may feel as if you have

 heard pieces of this before. I hope you have. I have been sharing these principles since the 1970’s. Hundreds of thousands heard my message when I was on the SUCCESS Tour, have purchased my training programs, have

-----

###### participated in my coaching groups, or have been private clients. Thanks to Magnetic Marketing|No B.S. Inner Circle,

 this message, these principles and their influence continue to grow. There are many out there teaching these ideas, some give me credit, some don’t.

 Today, you are hearing the entire story, straight from the horse’s mouth.
 Today, I am here to give you the entire vision plus the architecture that will allow you to make this vision a reality.

 The vision of being the prosperous owner of a real business —not of random or episodic income events, not of endless need for the next new promotion, not of frequent worry where

 the next sale might come from.
 The vision of certainty and security and stability. Of a continuous and steady inflow of desired customers, clients,

 patients, subscribers, or members. Even of creating equity and wealth, not just day to day income.
 The vision based on two specific promises I’ll make

 concerning what you’ll discover as you go through this book:

 1. I promise to take you beyond just another trick or
 two that might
increase conversion on a website temporarily or that everybody is excited about

 momentarily and instead, show you a SYSTEM for marketing that you can quickly begin using to make significantly more money across ALL your

 communication channels and media choices.

 2. I will—in this book—reveal the powerful, proven
 secrets to attracting opportunity, customers and

-----

###### clients in abundance, and creating sustainable businesses. You’ll realize what you must
build for

 yourself
to create true freedom, stability, and scalability in your business

 You do NOT need any special background, education, or skills to use this—other than commitment to use it. You can apply it

 to any kind of business serving any kind of market. I have students using what I’ll share here with businesses in health, retail, fitness, finance, coaching, trades—you name it. You’ll

 meet people later who’ll demonstrate exactly how this SYSTEM worked for them.
 For now, know that YOU CAN turbo-charge your ability to

 magnetically attract and achieve with what you’ll discover on the following pages.
 Let’s begin.

# FOUNDATIONS OF MAGNETIC MARKETING

-----

###### CHAPTER 1
#### WHAT IF EVERYTHING YOU’VE EVER
 BEEN TOLD ABOUT GROWING A
 BUSINESS WAS WRONG?

-----

###### I am sorry to tell you that you have been lied to for a very long time!
 Note that I didn’t use softer words like “misled,” “mis- informed,” “offered less than optimal advice.” Nope. I laid it out straight and plain.
 You’ve been lied to
.

 It’s critical to your success that I open your eyes to this fact. And I hope you’re interested in the blunt, unvarnished truth about what entrepreneurs and business owners actually do to create top income, wealth, independence, and sustainability. Frankly, not everyone is ready for such a conversation. Many prefer excuses to achievement. Others prefer fantasy to reality.

 What I’m about to teach you will radically alter how you acquire customers, clients and patients, and boost your sales and profits. I have a track record of forty-five-plus years creating multi-millionaires and seven-figure income earners. I am a made-from-scratch multi-millionaire, serial entrepreneur and I’m doing real work in the trenches right now, working

 with real clients and solving real issues. In fact, in one recent year alone, the combined revenues of my small cadre of private clients exceeded $1 billion.
 And every marketing plan I’ve ever devised for any client— and they now number in the hundreds and hundreds, commanding fees exceeding $100,000 plus royalties—has been based on the SYSTEM I’m going to reveal in this book.

 This book is for entrepreneurs, business owners, professional services practices, coaches and consultants. It pulls back the curtain on real world strategies I’ve revealed to

-----

###### the thousands of entrepreneurs just like you who have subscribed to my No B.S. Marketing Letter
, and use my systems to transform “ordinary” businesses into extraordinary money machines that far outperform their industry norms, peers, competitors and the wildest imagination of the owners.
 How do they do it?

 By making the strategic switch from traditional advertising to a response-driven advertising
strategy we call “Magnetic Marketing
.”
 Magnetic Marketing
was created to help entrepreneurs and business owners—with NO marketing knowledge or expertise —and empower them to create compelling marketing on their own without hiring outside help.

 Magnetic Marketing
has impacted thousands of businesses, professions, industries, product and service categories, literally changing the way their customers are obtained. (Indeed, today they form what could well be called a “secret society” of people who have figured it out.)
 Its roots go back decades, if not centuries. Its core

 foundational principle is that every advertisement, promotion, email, flyer, TV commercial, etc. focuses ALL energy on:

 identifying exactly who you want to be your customer,
client, or patient, and

 getting them to respond in a specific way—not

 wasting any effort on branding, image, humor, style or anything else.

-----

###### THIS is the kind of marketing we’ll discuss in this book— marketing designed to “magnetically attract” in a specific, repeatable, measurable way. And this is the ONLY model of marketing that you as a entrepreneur and business owner should model and use.
 When you embrace this, you become part of a movement

 that I started over two decades ago and that’s now carried on by the company I founded thirty-eight years ago, Magnetic Marketing|No B.S. Inner Circle
, which continues to provide powerful marketing and business growth strategies to maximize the success of entrepreneurs and business owners all over the world—a rare feat considering how many companies have come and gone over that period of time.

 LET’S DISPEL THE MYTHS…

 Personally, early on I went through a painful phase of thinking where I believed that I should be successful by my
willingness to work hard and by offering products and services that were truly valuable.
 As logical as this may sound, it’s merely a painful myth. I

 still struggled.
 And so I immersed myself in self-help, personal improvement, and motivational materials. I said affirmations. I thought only positive thoughts. I believed. And still I struggled—even with great products and what I believed was a great mindset to go with them.

 My life only changed when it dawned on me that great
was no better than lousy
if I had no able, willing, ready buyers to present great
to.

-----

###### This is the key realization. Without a sufficient and steady stream of people with whom you can exchange value for money, nothing else about your business matters. Not your most excellent website. Not your high visibility location. Not your credentials, degrees, certifications, education, etc. Not your hard-working “nose-to
 the-grindstone” ethic.
 Being more talented or skilled than others in your area of expertise has ZERO value if you cannot harness the principles and power of magnetic attraction
in a practical way.
 Having the very best, most innovative, most beneficial products or services has ZERO value if you cannot harness

 the principles and power of magnetic attraction
in a practical way.
 Many harm themselves by denying or decrying this reality. They desperately want to believe that better is better... having better credentials... having gone to a better school... having more and better experience... having more and better integrity... better work ethic, better at paying your dues… etc.

 BETTER SHOULD
BE ENOUGH.
 Maybe in an idyllic and just world that would be so. But not in THIS world. In this world, you are not automatically awarded what you deserve or think you deserve. It’s not a pure meritocracy. If that were the case, there’d probably be no rich porn stars and no poor pastors and preachers. I have learned and taught

 that money moves about for its own reasons, and neither need nor deservingness are magnetic to it.

-----

###### It depends on powerful, well-crafted, measurable strategies —a tried and true system—rooted in common sense and that works across all kinds of media. The strategies that we’ll talk about have been applied in 136 different business categories, by over 93,417 entrepreneurs in 167 different countries—they deliver.

 In other words, Magnetic Marketing
is as proven as the law of gravity. I tell you this because it may require some patience from you for you to really get it and use it, but like gravity, you cannot defy its facts.
 This switch is critical because…

 YOU’VE BEEN SET UP TO FAIL

 If you’ve managed to survive even a year or two in business, it’s obvious that you’ve gone well beyond the limited framework provided by our
 “educational system
 ” when it comes to grasping the core principles of marketing.
 But even with the scant marketing education business owners may have acquired from school, mentors, and self
 schooling, the fact is that most of them are like the blind leading the blind. Even the highly vaunted MBA accreditations typically fail to deliver serious
 “real-world,
 ” bottom-line results when put to the test of facing the dog-eat-dog frenzy of the marketplace.
 I set before you as proof—and
is a law much like gravity is, you can not fix it, you can only know it and change your

 actions to fit into the section you want to. The financial reality is that in every profession, every category of business, every sales team, every population, these figures hold true:

-----

###### 1% create tremendous incomes and wealth

 4% do very well

 15% earn good livings

 60% struggle endlessly

 20% fail

 In a nutshell, 80 percent do poorly / 20 percent succeed.
 Why then would you want to copy the marketing done by

 the majority when facts show it FAILS THEM? Why should you follow that same path to frustration and failure?
 Most
“ordinary
” businesses believe they have to advertise and market like much bigger brand-name companies, so they invest (waste) lots of money in many different kinds of media to promote image, brand, and presence.

 You CANNOT make the mistake of jumping into media because
“everyone else is using it.
” Big name brands have all sorts of reasons for the way they advertise and market that have ZERO to do with getting a customer or making sales. Your agenda is much simpler—in fact, there’s a huge difference between how BIG
corporations consider marketing and how you as a
entrepreneur and business owner sees it.

 Big Corporation Agenda for Advertising and Marketing

Please/appease its board of directors (most of whom know zip about
advertising and marketing but have lots of opinions)

Please/appease its stockholders.

Look good and appropriate to Wall Street.

Look good and appropriate to the media.

Build brand identity.

Win awards for advertising.

Sell something.

-----

###### YOUR Agenda

Sell something. NOW!

###### I realized a long time ago that big dumb c
orporations were

 using sloppy, wasteful
“mass advertising
” practices that had them hemorrhaging money left and right.
 But that didn’t stop
entrepreneurs and businesses owners from
 “modeling
 ” what they saw-read-heard every day, wrongly thinking that “if it works for them, it’s gotta work for us too.”

**Here’s the No B.S. Truth:
The typical entrepreneur and business owner is**
essentially clueless when it comes to advertising and marketing. This makes
them highly vulnerable to becoming what I call “Advertising Victims”—easy
prey for media salespeople and ad agencies and anyone else who doesn’t
know how to actually close the deal and make a sale.

###### Think I’m wrong?
 If you ever manage to corner a business owner, try to get him to tell you with confidence WHERE his customers and sales come from, what it costs to get a customer, what kind of results does one ad get versus another. Try. He can’t. He’s guessing. And that’s what the industry vultures rely on, they know that when their customer (i.e., YOU) can only guess how

 well their marketing works, they have a credit card they can ding regularly and without fail.
 I realized something different had to be done, because entr epreneurs and business owners need a saner, more productive path to business growth that makes their business life more pleasant, lucrative, and certain.

 AND IT’S NOT ABOUT WORKING HARDER

-----

###### You’ve been told over and over again that the answer to all your troubles is to:

 Work Harder

 Work Smarter

 Work Harder and Smarter

 Sorry, but none of those will fly or even come close to hitting the mark.
 It’s not about working harder and being smarter about how

 you do so. I’m willing to wager you’ve already gone down that road and have done all you can do and the results just weren’t there.
 You don’t need more hard work… not from yourself, your spouse, your staff—nobody. Instead, you need a NEW strategy. You need a SYSTEM—one that works for you, 24/7/365 doing all this for you:

 A system that generates a predictable flow of new customers, clients,
and patients

 A system that turns every customer into two customers

 A system that creates repeatable business

 A system that allows you freedom (financial and

 time)

 A system focused on marketing

 The more productive answer is to develop a SYSTEM that attracts new customers, clients, or patients to you in an

-----

###### organized way.

 WHY NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR THIS NEW SYSTEM

 The system I’m about to reveal to you in this book will radically change your thinking about what you invest your time in, what’s truly important when it comes to making

 money, and the way you communicate your ideas, products, services and worth to the world.
 It’s a much more sophisticated way of creating power for yourself in a cluttered marketplace. A systematic way to magnetically attract your ideal customers, clients or patients
.
 A system that gives you reliable and predictable results so

 you finally know when you invest X dollars, you can expect Y number of leads, then Z number of appointments or selling opportunities.
 You want a system that enables you to better target the most appropriate and valuable customers for your business, so you’re not wasting time, energy, resources scurrying down rabbit holes chasing “would-be” customers who in fact will

 “never-be.”
 Most importantly, you need a system you can comprehend and control.
 It’s just too complicated to wing it on your own anymore. Way back when, I managed my own mailings with a printout of the prospect list, a stack of envelopes, and an occasionally

 amenable cat to lick the stamps. It worked great for me then, but today’s barrage of media options makes such a simple operation not only outdated, but terribly self-limiting. Media choices abound and multi-channel marketing funnels that

-----

###### best leverage the unique strengths of each is the proper path. You can’t succeed with a haphazard approach.
 You MUST follow a well-conceived, testable, scalable, practical system—and you’ve come to the right person to reveal just such a system to you.

 THEY CALL ME “THE PROFESSOR OF HARSH REALITY”

 It’s a title I proudly embrace. Reality and life have always been harsh. As Hollywood legend John Wayne once said:

#### “Life is hard. And it’s harder if you’re
 stupid.”

###### In forty-five years of helping all kinds of entrepreneurs and businesses achieve their dreams, I’ve realized that business owners aren’t actually “stupid” when it comes to raw cerebral horsepower. The problem lies in the “stupid” things they do that they’ve been led to believe are true.
 That may seem a bit blunt, or even a bit uncomfortable.

 Good.
 I unapologetically wrote this book to offer the blunt, unvarnished truth
 about how entrepreneurs and business owners really CAN create a flood of new customers, clients, and patients while building wealth, independence and sustainability.
 There are a lot of numbers bandied about in marketing—

 response percentages, circulation, pass-along effect, visitors, dedicated visitors, likes, friends, fans, and on and on. I’m here to tell you it’s all B.S. It’s all about leads that convert to income. Period.

-----

###### And the very worst number in business is ONE. If you are over-dependent on any ONE thing in your business, you will— at some point—be punished for this vulnerability. You can bank on that. One key person, one key account or client, one product, one service, one skill, one technology—all woefully

 insecure and unstable. This is particularly true of MEDIA.
 It’s about attracting more customers who respect and value what you do so much so that they are willing to pay for it. It’s not about just bringing in more (quantity), it’s about bringing in more of the right people (quality).
 And the foundational key to making this happen…

 YOU MUST SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM THE COMPETITION

 I want you to understand, whatever your deliverables are, they are not your business.
 You must make yourself the go-to person, place, or entity for some audience that can be interested in you and your

 deliverables. And the primary way to accomplish this is by crafting an answer to this question:

#### “Why should I choose you versus any and every other provider of the same product or service that you provide?”

###### Resolved with what legendary ad man Rosser Reeves called a

 USP
, a Unique Selling Proposition.
 Tremendous turnarounds in business have taken place as the result of great USPs. Domino’s Pizza was originally driven by a marketing message which everybody came to know,

-----

###### “Fresh hot pizza delivered in thirty minutes or less, guaranteed.”
 If you dissect it, you’ll see some interesting things. First of all, it doesn’t claim to be all things to all people. There’s no mention of mama’s recipe from the old country. No mention

 of a special sauce. In fact, there’s not even any mention of good
pizza. All it says is that it is going to get to you while it’s still hot and it’s still fresh and that they guarantee to do that.
 What is your USP? This is going to take a little bit of work. Somewhere in your business, there is a good answer. If not, you need to make one.

 Unfortunately, the first thing one does when we start to talk about Unique Selling Proposition is to jump to the conclusion that there is nothing special about their business. Sometimes in rare instances, that’s true. That’s when you have to do some creative thinking about your business to make it into something unique.
 Here are three questions you can ask yourself to help kick
 start the process of finding or creating your USP.

 1. What specifically do you do that’s truly different
 compared to competitors?

 For Domino’s, it was originally being there in thirty minutes or less. More recently, they revolutionized the company against badly sagging sales by taking the worst ranked pizza to the best ranked for taste and quality. But

 that’s actually the ante to already being in the game.

 2. How do you uniquely benefit your target market?

-----

###### J.K. Rowling of the Harry Potter
books and her publisher made each new book’s release of exceptional benefit to independent bookstores with a devised plan for big events, books held back to release at midnight, drawing huge numbers of kids and parents into these stores

 milling about at a party, in costume, snacking and browsing and buying other books for an hour or more before the clock struck midnight.
 The target market, the bookstore owner, was uniquely

 benefited in reciprocity. Rowling got far more promotional work out of the store owners than hundreds of other

 authors of other children’s fantasy books.

 3. Can you niche your target market in a way nobody

 else can or will?

 One of my students, a lawyer named Bill Hammond, created

 Alzheimer’s Law, a subset of elder law essentially wrapping traditional estate planning, Medicare and Medicaid planning,

 and other family legal matters inside a differently described package, positioned for families with a senior showing signs

 of or having been diagnosed with dementia. This enabled Bill to use the exact lead generation strategies laid out in this

 system.

 Take the time to create your own USP—it’s one of the greatest marketing weapons you can ever have for your

 product(s) or your business.

-----

###### CHAPTER 2
#### WHY MARKETING FAILS

-----

###### Over the course of this book, you’re going to discover

 a totally new and different way to market your

 products and services.
 In fact, you could consider this “an alternative universe” of

 marketing, where all the fundamentals you thought were true have been turned on their head. Kind of like that episode in

 Star Trek where Captain Kirk was a bad guy and Spock sported an eminently logical goatee.

 It’s important that you set aside any preconceptions you

 might have about changing gears with your marketing, because the fact of the matter is clear and has been for

 years. Indeed, way back in 2006, long before the explosion of social media like Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, and

 much more, I wrote something that remains as true today as

 ever:

#### Most small business advertising and
 marketing STINKS.

###### I stand by this still. Monstrous sums are wasted and opportunities lost. Even amid all the change in technology

 and practically limitless options available to get your

 message out, nothing has changed for the better. In fact, if anything, it’s gotten worse.

 Businesspeople are really confused and overwhelmed—told they must do this, that, the other thing, more and more—just

 to get the same results.
 I’m here to guide you to clarity about a relatively short list

 of mistakes that, when understood and addressed, can

-----

###### safeguard your sanity from the assault of a thousand points

 of media options demanding your attention, time, and money.

 MISTAKE #1: MARKETING TO THE WRONG PEOPLE

 Most businesses market to the wrong people. When their

 marketing fails to deliver, they blame it on something else, as in it’s not pretty enough, it’s not big enough, we didn’t get

 the messaging right, the billboard’s stuck in the wrong

 location, we didn’t advertise in the right magazine or on the right cable channel or whatever.

 I’m not saying that any of these factors AREN’T a problem. They very well could play a role in any ad’s success or lack

 thereof.
 But the bigger problem
 is the simple fact that in most

 cases, most advertising is not directed at any one person.

 Instead, it’s directed at EVERYONE.
 The marketing lacks a clear understanding of WHO they are

 trying to target.
 And here’s the rub. Unless you have extremely deep

 pockets like one of the giant multinational corporations, you CAN’T market to everyone. You have to discriminate. It’s not a

 bad word, in fact it’s your safe passage to focus and

 prosperity.
 When you focus on a specific WHO, you’re able to hone in

 on exactly what makes that person tick. You’re able to adjust your offers and your messaging in a way that perfectly

 matches their desires and abilities to fulfill those desires. Knowing that WHO inside and out enables you to craft a

-----

###### compelling, emotional message that reaches deep into their

 hopes, dreams, fears, and pain.

 At any given moment in time, only 5 percent at best, are intellectually, emotionally, practicably and financially ready to

 act on or make a buying decision about your product, service or proposition. Inevitably, 95 percent of most advertising falls

 on “deaf ears.” This makes it imperative to “hit the bullseye” with the 5 percent, by narrowing your focus. However, you

 can and should also scheme to get those who aren’t ready

 but will be to raise their hands early, and we’ll get to this later in this book.

 MISTAKE #2: SAYING THE WRONG THINGS

 Not only does your marketing have to talk to the right person, it has to say the right things to that person. When you say

 something that fails to connect with your target customer, we

 call that a failed “Message to Market Match.”
 Going back to my example of Domino’s USP, they

 understood their initial market perfectly—ravenously hungry college students desperate for something, anything, to ease

 the munchies. Their message was “fresh hot pizza in thirty

 minutes or less”—the perfect solution delivered to your doorstep in record time. THAT is a perfect “Message to Market

 Match.”
 What makes it even more powerful is that they entered the

 conversation going on inside their customer’s head—which in simple terms could be boiled down to “Hungry. Food. Now.”

 Had they instead focused on “delicious sauce, mama’s old

 country recipe, ingredients sourced from the finest, all

-----

###### organic farms, delivered in style by a man in a tuxedo…” it

 would have tanked. Because that’s NOT what the market was looking for and it certainly didn’t match the dialogue taking

 place in that college kid’s mind as he was watching the TV or studying for finals.

 Another key mistake many make involves the language used in the marketing. When you focus on a specific group of

 people, you’re able to tap into the vocabulary they use every

 day. Doing so is critical—for example, with musicians (and magicians) you would want to promise them “more gigs” not

 “more jobs.” Golfers have a vernacular all their own as well, with “bunkers,” “buried lies,” “shanks,” and “skulled shots

 a.k.a. wormburners.” Just like you wouldn’t attempt to communicate with a Frenchman in Mandarin Chinese, you

 don’t want to use “outsider” language and terminology when

 communicating a sales message to your prospective customer.

 To our 1970s pizza-eating college student now approaching seasoned citizen status, it’s not about hearing a little better—

 that’s not worth spending the money on. He can crank up sound system and The Rolling Stones will sound as good as

 ever. The real problem, which IS worth investing in, is not

 hearing what my kids are saying, them thinking I’m losing my mind because I’m not responding, and them then sending me

 off to the old folks’ home because of that.
 You only know this when you truly know your WHO. You

 need to know more than just their demographics, you need to

 know their hopes, dreams, fears, and most importantly, the

-----

###### conversations that are going on in their heads—the things

 they will never tell you.

##### MISTAKE #3: ASKING THEM TO DO THE WRONG THINGS

###### This boils down to asking for the sale too quickly without first

 narrowing down our universe of potential buyers.
 We live in an extremely skeptical age. Once-respected

 professions and institutions now have practically zero

 credibility, including journalists, clergy, education providers, and so many more. And even lower than politicians rank the

 oily, slimy salesman who’s all-too-eager to shake your hand and pluck your purse.

 Making a sale—especially for something that’s largely

 intangible as a service—requires asking a person to take a leap of faith. Without first establishing a significant level of

 trust in your credibility, responsibility, and authority right from the get-go, you face a significant uphill battle enticing

 anyone to do anything, let alone sign on the dotted line.
 Therefore, instead of going right for the sale out the gate to

 everyone on the planet, a more effective marketing strategy

 is to first narrow down your focus by getting a subset of your potential market to qualify themselves by “raising their hand”

 in response to an offer that’s much easier to say “yes” to—a free gift of some sort, possibly a video or a report. This

 enables you to begin that process of gathering a group of people who have a problem you can solve. It enables you to

 begin establishing credibility, authority, and trust, turning an

-----

###### unknown, potential customer into a self-acknowledged “lead”

 with whom you can follow up more intensely and personally.
 We call this concept “lead generation” and we’ll discuss it

 in much greater detail in just a bit.

 MISTAKE #4: THINKING YOU CAN ADVERTISE ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE

 Marketing used to be relatively simple when it came to

 choosing which media platform to use. CBS. NBC. ABC. PBS. Local radio. Local newspapers. Yellow Pages. A limited number

 of high profile magazines. Billboards. And the few other outlying options of varying effectiveness, such as skywriting,

 smoke signals, and a strange new technology that was called

 “the world wide web.”
 As the giant reptiles vanished from our planet, so too has

 disappeared this once-simple media menu. Today, you as a marketer face a far more complicated, diverse, and

 challenging array of options from which to choose. New media channels and technologies seem to appear daily.

 This constantly changing media landscape challenges even

 the most tech-savvy marketer. Not only do you have to keep up with the latest and greatest, you face disruptions caused

 by shifting public opinion, government intervention, and even changes to corporate strategy. Google adjusts its search

 algorithms continuously, potentially rendering an easily found, SEO-optimized website practically invisible. In regards

 to Pay-Per Click (PPC) ads, whole businesses were destroyed

 when the infamous “Google Slap” completely shut down lead

-----

###### generation ads and systems that previously delivered

 handsome returns.

 Because of this overwhelming complexity, many business owners simply throw up their hands and hand this task over

 to a so-called expert or ad salesman and then write the checks based on them saying “you have to be on xxxx.”

 The only way to avoid this mistake is to nail down exactly

 the WHO to whom you are selling. Once you know that, it’s actually quite simple to choose which media channels to

 advertise in—you go where they go.
 If they’re on Facebook, you go on Facebook. If they read

 Model Railroading
, you advertise in Model Railroading
 (and note—what you sell inside Model Railroading
 doesn’t even

 have to relate in the slightest to trains, it just needs to appeal

 to the kind of person who reads that magazine).
 And even though many consider them outdated, the Yellow

 Pages can still offer huge benefits to marketers if they’re targeting an older demographic who relies on their use.

 You want to only be where your who is and then you want to EVERYWHERE they are.

 It’s a huge mistake to try to sort out all the different options

 for media without first having a plan for what you intend to use that media for. The worst thing you can do is a series of

 random, disconnected marketing attempts across various media channels. Instead, you want to create a true system

 that attracts new customers in an organized way. Because it’s only with this kind of system that you can achieve reliable,

 predictable results—so you know when you invest X you will

 get Y in return.

-----

###### MISTAKE #5: NO MARKETING SYSTEM

 This is probably one of the biggest, most widespread

 mistakes made: Marketing without a system.

 Without a system, you are flying blind, literally throwing jello against a wall, seeing if any of it sticks, and if, by

 happenstance, something does work, you have no way of leveraging that data because anything that did produce a

 positive result is now a oozing green puddle on the office floor.

 Without a system you’re forced to pray for and then rely on

 one-hit wonders (e.g., remember the “Macarena”?) which offer you a brief moment in the sunshine of success, but then

 vanish like dust in the wind. It worked, but you don’t know why, you can’t repeat the process, and once it’s gone, it’s

 gone.

 This goes hand in hand with what I call “Rollercoaster Marketing”—where, when times get tough and customers are

 scarce, you throw everything plus the kitchen sink into your marketing efforts. If you’re lucky and manage to catch a bit of

 traction, your funnel gets filled up and your business starts the ascent. So you drop everything and get to work, because

 you’re now too busy to market and the inevitable perception

 is that you don’t need to because everything’s fat and happy. But this only delays the inevitable, because when you stop

 marketing, your funnel will eventually dry up—new customers stop coming in, existing clients move on—so you start the

 descent, howling all the way to the bottom. And you’re back to where you started.

-----

###### Having a reliable, scientific, and predictable marketing

 system is what you must put in place instead. You want a system where marketing works like a faucet that you can turn

 on or off depending on the needs of your business and where you want to go with it.

 At a minimum, you want your Marketing System to focus on

 three key areas:

 1. Lead generation—the ongoing acquisition of leads for
 your business

 2. Conversion—taking those leads and converting them

 into paying customers

 3. Retention/Referral—keeping that customer base

 intact and generating new leads based on referrals.

 Once you have this system set up, you simply put it in motion and let ‘er run. I have clients who have magnetic marketing

-----

###### systems that have been running untouched for seven to ten

 years.

 MISTAKE #6: CHASING CLIENTS

 Almost as big a mistake as not having a system is the wrong
 headed perception by business owners of all stripes that it’s your job to CHASE customers, clients, and patients. While it

 may seem logical to do so, ponder the implications on a

 personal level for a moment…

 Q:
What’s your natural impulse when you see someone following you in hot pursuit?

 A:
You skedaddle.

 And that’s what your prospective customers, clients, and

 patients will do once they see you chasing after them—and no matter what kind of shape you’re in, they can outrun and

 outlast you. You will wind up left in their dust… undoubtedly

 along with the rest of your fellow competitors, because it’s almost certain they don’t know any better either.

 I recommend a different approach. Stop chasing. Start magnetically attracting. Lay out something they would value

 as “bait” to magnetically attract them and that will cause them to take notice and request information from you. This

 “bait” could be as simple as a two-page report promising to

 solve a specific problem they face or a free consumer report guide. (You do this based on your research and how well you

 understand them.)

-----

###### This idea of having “them come to you” flips everything around and changes the game. Using this kind of approach,

 where you offer something of value for free in exchange for getting someone to step forward, raise his/her hand, and say

 “I’m interested in learning more” gives you the opportunity to separate yourself from the competition and it completely

 reverses the power position of who’s chasing whom.

 When you stop chasing, you no longer have to resort to gimmicks to set yourself apart from the pack of hungry

 competitors running alongside you—like slashing your prices, or grouponing specials—they are magnetically attracted to

 you.
 When you use attraction, this allows you to charge and

 collect premium fees. People pay more for a solution that

 they’ve already at least partially embraced, or better yet— asked for.

 Attraction brings to you clients who are more committed and likely to remain with you over the long term. Another

 benefit is that customers who come to you through attraction are naturally inclined to remain with you and do business with

 you over and again.

 Attraction also builds trust, which is a key to making sales in our exceedingly skeptical age. The customer attraction

 system in Magnetic Marketing
establishes your credibility and authority by delivering the results—initially on a small scale—

 exactly as promised, laying the foundation for even bigger

 sales and greater trust as you continue to deliver real value.
 Attraction enables you to sell exactly what they want to

 buy because it ONLY draws in prospects who fit your criteria

-----

###### and mindset. You know them inside out, you know what they

 want, you attract them with something that you know works, and they’ll buy and keep buying.

 So what kind of marketer do you want to be? Constantly chasing after people who may or may not want you? Or

 calmly waiting and watching as eager, new prospects knock

 on your door and ask for the help only you can provide.

 MISTAKE #7: THINKING YOU HAVE THE AD BUDGET OF COCA-COLA

 It’s only natural to think the advertising you should emulate is what you see every day on TV. Because that’s where the big

 ad dollars get spent and by the biggest, most respected

 brands in business like GE, GM, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Kellogg’s, Anheuser-Busch, and Coca-Cola.

 Millions pour into the coffers of ad agencies to produce high-definition, high-dollar commercials for the itching

 eyeballs of the nation. With these ads, they hope to move us emotionally, to make us laugh, and to make us associate their

 brands with happy feelings so that when the time comes to

 make a relevant buying decision, we choose them.
 That’s the game they’re playing. And the cost to join them

 at the table is enormous. Most small businesses have nothing even remotely close to the ad budgets of these companies. In

 2017, Coca-Cola’s advertising expenses were $3.96 Billion.
 Do you really want to play that game too? You’re not Coca
 Cola. You’re not going after every parched throat on the

 planet. You don’t need to copy what they do with your advertising.

-----

###### You need to do what works for you.

 MISTAKE #8: RACE TO THE BOTTOM IN LOW PRICE

 When you don’t have a real system in place to market your

 products or services, you tend to look at what your competitors are doing to build up their businesses and nine

 times out of ten it’s lower prices.

 This occurs in practically every industry, every marketplace from ice cream to IT. A mad dash to the bottom in the hopes

 that lower prices will give you the edge you need.
 The only problem with this is the simple fact that there can

 only be ONE lowest-priced offering. Someone’s got to take the hit to be number one in that race. But pole position is

 easy to come by, especially if you have deep pockets and you

 don’t care if you lose money over the short term. You can afford to drive the competitors out of business.

 Then congratulations, you’re King. Until you’re not.

 Bottom dwelling is NOT the path to long term success.

 MISTAKE #9: THERE’S NO FOLLOW UP

 I see this all the time and—even though I know better than to invest any emotional energy into the exercise—it still drives

 me crazy.
 The wife and I decide to go out to eat. We always eat at a

 few tried and true establishments, but what the heck, let’s try someplace different.

 So we head into town and see a new restaurant has just

 opened up. It looks okay from the outside, the parking lot

-----

###### isn’t full, but it isn’t empty either, so we decide to give it a try.

 We go in, get seated, the waiter arrives and asks for drinks and then our order. Food arrives, it’s actually better than

 expected. There’s a nice dessert menu, followed by some coffee (equally good), and then the check, a tip, and out the

 door.

 Overall, a relatively pleasant, enjoyable experience from start to finish.

 That was our perception. But we’ll probably NEVER return.

 Why? Because they didn’t seem to even notice we even existed.

 Sure, all the basic functions of a restaurant were executed

 properly—wait staff, food service, cooking, accounting, and so forth.

 But they missed the ONE thing that could make or break their business.

 They put zero effort into doing everything they could to make sure of our return.

 There was no capture of name, address, even email.

 There was no offer of a bounce-back coupon to entice us to come back.

 They didn’t ask about our anniversary, our birthdays, children, friends, none of that.

 ZERO effort went into knowing us as anything but an ephemeral visitor out of the blue who showed up one night

 and then passed like a ship out to sea, never to been heard

 from or seen again.
 Tragic.

-----

###### THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE

 When you truly know your WHO, you can magnetically attract

 all the clients, customers, and patients you can handle. And you don’t have to do this by slashing your prices, chasing

 after everyone in hopes of catching someone, or spending yourself into oblivion trying to imitate massive multinationals

 with marketing budgets greater than half the world’s GDP.
 You can’t afford to make any of these mistakes and you

 don’t have to—because it’s not about you, it’s about them.

 Knowing them and their needs inside and out and then meeting them exactly where they live with just what they’ve

 been looking for.
 Getting the right Message—via the right Media—to the right

 Market—it all starts with knowing your WHO.

###### CHAPTER 3
#### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ATTRACT
 INSTEAD OF CHASE?

-----

###### If you run a business, whether it’s behind the counter at a walk-in location or you’re sitting in your home

 office beside the phone, the worst feeling in the world is the same:

#### Silence.

###### Without a constant flow of leads and customers coming to

 your business, you’re doomed to fail.
 It doesn’t matter how good you are, how motivated you

 are, how wonderful your products / services are, none of that matters. The lifeblood of every business is LEADS and

 CUSTOMERS and the beauty of Magnetic Marketing
 is that

 you don’t have to suffer in silence any longer—nor do you have to experience the pain of chasing them down via the

 painful path of “cold calling.”
 Instead, you allow your SYSTEM to magnetically attract

 them to you—prequalified, prescreened, already interested in you and what you have to offer.

 And don’t let the word “SYSTEM” scare you. What you’ll

 discover in this book is simple to understand and straightforward to implement, even if you don’t have any kind

 of technology background.
 It’s all about NOT chasing customers anymore, it’s about

 ATTRACTING them instead by:

 Abandoning strategies that everyone else is using

 that just don’t work.

 Making MARKETING your business and your message

 your #1 priority.

-----

###### Focusing your marketing on the needs and dreams of

 the customers you want to magnetically attract.

 The difference can be dramatic, as you’ll see in these stories

 of business owners like you who switched from marketing like everyone else and instead took that first step to

 implementing Magnetic Marketing
principles for themselves.

#### “CHANGING MY MESSAGE CHANGED MY BUSINESS.”

###### Derek Emery
owns one of the largest independent used car buying services in the state of California, but it took him ten

 years to discover the secret that would exponentially grow his business. After embracing the principles of Magnetic

 Marketing
, Derek realized that people selling their cars were

 not just looking for a professional used car buying service, they were really looking for a bank.

 When he understood this, he completely revamped his USP accordingly: “Not only will we buy someone’s used car, but

 we will guarantee cash in hand in twenty minutes or less.”
 That small little USP tripled his business overnight. People

 started seeing his company as a quick way to acquire cash
—

 not just sell a car.
 With this knowledge, he was able to position his company

 as not just a source of power in the marketplace; he became the ONLY source of power in the marketplace. He was able to

 develop the right message to the right market, using the right

 multiple sources of media.

-----

###### Before Magnetic Marketing
, his company was buying and selling two hundred to three hundred cars a month. With the

 Magnetic Marketing
 changes, he is constantly buying and selling over one thousand cars a month. Most of the cars he is

 now buying now are the profitable cars. He no longer has to buy the “traditional junk car.”

 He was able to get the right customer, the right car, and

 the most amount of profit by implementing the principles of Magnetic Marketing
.

#### “BEING GREAT WAS NO BETTER THAN LOUSY WITHOUT PATIENTS
 TO PRESENT GREAT TO.”

###### Dr. Dustin Burleson
opened his dental practice in 2006 with the thinking that “you get your degree, do good work, and

 like the Field of Dreams, the patients will come
.”
 As he quickly discovered, that’s not how the real world

 works. For the first three years he grew his business through

 blood, sweat, and tears. But he soon felt stuck.
 Looking for ways to escape the hamster wheel and build a

 better business, Dr. Burleson stumbled upon a book I wrote that opened his eyes to the power of Magnetic Marketing
 .

 After consuming that book, he had a key revelation … he

 wasn’t in the business of being an orthodontist, he was actually in the business of MARKETING orthodontic services. If

 he didn’t devote dedicated time to creating a system to magnetically attract patients to his practice—he would never

 achieve the practice he had dreamed of.

-----

###### The cold hard truth is that it doesn’t matter how good you

 are. You could be the best lawyer, the best dentist, or the best orthodontist in the world. But if you can’t get the

 message out to the public, no one will ever get a chance to experience how wonderful you are.

 His practice has gone from four chairs in one small clinic to

 four locations with five doctors, and from one employee to thirty-five employees. He spends time with the local college

 giving real world entrepreneurial advice, and has even created his own coaching programs to help other

 orthodontists!

#### “MY BUSINESS CHANGED WHEN I STOPPED DOING WHAT EVERYONE
 ELSE WAS DOING.”

###### Dave Dee
was stuck in a job he hated, working long hours

 scraping by to support his family, while all the while he had

 dreams of becoming a professional magician. Like many small business owners working to create a career on the side, he

 was really good at what he did, but he knew nothing about marketing other than doing the same thing other magicians

 were doing
and hoping for referrals.
 His fledgling side business was working out as well as you

 might expect—he was only doing about three shows a month

 and these weren’t big corporate extravaganzas with big corporate checks. These were children’s birthday parties and

 even though he excelled in this, the inability to create any kind of regular, predictable stream of business meant he

-----

###### couldn’t generate anywhere near enough money to go off on his own with any assurance he could still pay the bills.

 Then without warning—he was fired from his day job. Already deep in debt, he grew frustrated and angry, knowing

 that something had to change and fast.

 Almost by chance, he attended a SUCCESS event of ten thousand people and encountered a message he’d never

 heard of before from the very last speaker of the day, me.
 The message was simple:

 STOP doing what everyone else is doing, trying to chase business using the same ads, the same tactics as all

 your competitors. Instead, leverage proven principles to magnetically attract the very best clients to you.

 Dave realized that this was the answer to finally living his dream of becoming a professional magician—he knew is his

 gut that Magnetic Marketing
was the key to the vault.
 On the very same day my program arrived, he literally

 locked himself in a room over Friday, Saturday and Sunday and went through the entire Magnetic Marketing System and

 Toolkit.

 Then, on Monday, he started implementing the customer attraction strategies.

 It was like a miracle. In less than ninety days, Dave went from doing three shows a month to averaging more than

 thirty shows a month! In his fourth month, he did fifty-seven

 shows!
 He was living the dream. Everything changed!

###### His wife was able to quit both of her jobs and he paid off all

 his credit card debt. He bought a new home, a new car, and finally had financial freedom for the first time in his entire life.

#### “WENT FROM STRUGGLING TO
 MASSIVE SUCCESS WITH LEAD
 GENERATION.”

###### Ben Glass
 is a personal injury attorney who (twenty years ago) had just left the comforts of a law firm to start his own

 practice. So he does what seems natural—look around at

 what other lawyers are doing and copy what they do. But nothing seemed to make the phone ring.

 He came across my best-selling training The Magnetic Marketing System and Toolkit (
I didn’t have a book like this at

 that time). The concept of lead generation marketing jumped out at him. He then understood that there was a simple

 process to get people interested in his business and a system

 for marketing directly to those people.
 He didn’t fully understand the power of magnetic marketing

 when he started, he just started following the system. But boy, did it pay off in spades.

 He now has one of the most successful practices in his area, where he went from struggling to get clients to a

 predictable system that delivers clients on a daily basis.

 Today, he is a father of nine, grandfather of two, an active soccer referee, and respected thought leader who continues

 to break the molds in his highly regulated industry.

 THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING...

-----

###### I’ll acknowledge, there’re so many people running around touting the next big thing that it’s become harder to know

 who to listen to and who to trust.
 As they say, the proof lies in the pudding.

 These stories represent just the tip of the iceberg

 representing literally thousands of lives changed for entrepreneurs and business owners of all shapes and sizes

 since the first version of
 Magnetic Marketing
 was released over twenty-five years ago.

 The difference to their businesses was dramatic—all because they made the shift from “Chasing Customers” to

 “Attracting Customers.”

 Even though some of the specific examples used have changed due to new forms of media emerging, the

 foundational principles remain solidly in place and continue to run like clockwork—attracting slam-dunk customers, patients,

 or clients to your business
.
 And the good news is that with the ever-expanding number

 of media options now available, it’s never been easier to put

 together a Magnetic Marketing
 system customized perfectly for YOU.

**Note:
 Now you might be saying to yourself, “But wait, my business is**
different … what if I am in the commodity business? I HAVE to price my
services lower than anyone else in order to get the business I need.”

First off, your business is NOT different. Every industry faces the pressure to
lower prices, as one of the easiest ways to differentiate yourself in the
marketplace is to announce yourself as the lowest priced option.

If this is the route you choose to follow, I wish you the best. But understand,
it’s only a matter of time before someone else emerges to go after your
customers with an even lower priced option. Then you’ll be forced to either

-----

lose those customers or instead compete in a downward spiral to oblivion. It’s
a race very few can win and almost never for long.

The beauty of Magnetic Marketing
lies in the way it sets YOU apart from the
competition in a way that’s focused on features/benefits you control—and
that make you a UNIQUE solution to the challenges your perfect customer
faces. In essence, you eliminate price as the key component in the buying...

...decision and in reality, most buyers place price lower than other factors to
be considered, such as convenience, quality, guarantee, and so on.

Magnetic Marketing
frees you from the danger of relying on pricing alone to
make the sale. Even in industries where there’s significant price pressure, it’s
almost dead certain that customers exist to pay you what your worth.

All you have to do is identify and magnetically attract them.

-----

###### C
HAPTER 4
#### WHAT THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE

-----

###### Marketing is often viewed as a mysterious but

 necessary evil, as in “it’s definitely not the business,

 it’s something I have to soil myself with in order to make my business work.”

 You are here because you are willing to reconsider that

 entire paradigm. It makes you a rare bird soon to take flight

 way above all others.

 The need for more leads and more customers for lifeblood exists in businesses of all shapes and sizes, but few business

 owners ever develop formal, organized marketing systems to

 meet this need.

 Instead, they constantly seek out the one magic bullet that

 will solve this problem… SEO, pay-per-click, social media, TV, billboards, radio, print ads. They hope that someone will

 provide the answer.

 The biggest mistake made is they immediately focus on the

 media without having a plan or a system in mind first. They are often sold media and pour money into redoing all their

 websites or making new videos for them, into buying online

 traffic, into some “one thing” to change everything.

 I call these random and erratic acts of and disconnected

 investments in attempted marketing.
 You need to realize that most ad agencies and most media

 representatives have a great understanding and reliance

 upon of what’s called “image” or “institutional” advertising.

 It’s what I call Goodyear blimp advertising.

 When Goodyear flies a blimp over a stadium, they don’t have any illusion that at half-time of the football game, thirty
 five thousand people are going to jump up out of their seats

-----

###### and run out and buy snow tires. They don’t expect that to

 happen and it’s a good thing they don’t because obviously it doesn’t.

 What they’re hoping for and what they’re buying is that,

 over a long period of time, by these sports fans seeing the

 Goodyear blimp over and again, they connect it with this

 happy pleasant event and they have warm, nice, fuzzy feelings for Goodyear. Then, someday when they have to go

 buy a tire, all of that comes together in their mind and causes

 them to buy a Goodyear tire.

 I call that high-risk marketing. It just seems to me that

 there’s a straighter line to get from a person who needs tires to buying Goodyear tires than going through all of that

 rigmarole of building a blimp and hiring a pilot and finding a

 football game and flying a blimp over it.

 There is—and it’s called “Direct Marketing” or “Response- Driven Marketing” or—when integrated into a complete

 system of attracting and converting leads—“Magnetic

 Marketing
.”

 This approach is derived from what used to be called mail

 order.
 The discipline of the entire mail order industry—now the

 direct marketing industry—is that for every dollar invested

 there is a direct, typically fast and always measurable return

 of that dollar plus presumably some profit. You can boil it

 down to two very basic ideas:

 1. Spend $1.00 on marketing, get back $2.00 or

 $20.00, fast, that can be accurately tracked back to

-----

###### the initial $1.00 invested.

 2. Do NOT spend $1.00 on any marketing or advertising

 that does not directly and quickly bring back $2.00 or $20.00.

 Go back and reread these two steps. Make sure you fully

 grasp this life-changing principle. They should affect EVERY

 action you take from this point forward when it comes to marketing your business.

 It’s not new and it’s almost certain that you’ve seen, heard,

 read examples of it on television, radio, letters, and so forth

 for most if not all of your life. Maybe you have even

 participated in it, without knowing it.
 Most media people and most ad agency people have little

 or no understanding of that kind of advertising and

 marketing. Most even fear it because it is so accountable.

 To make this system work, however, the first thing you

 must understand in depth is WHO your customer is. Because even the best possible offer made to someone who is wholly

 unqualified, or wholly disinterested in it is not going to work.

 It will fall on deaf ears.

 Therefore, you’ve got to match your offers with precisely the right people.

 KNOWING THE WHO IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU’LL DO

 There’s a story about legendary copywriter Gary Halbert, who

 once asked a room of aspiring writers, “Imagine you’re

 opening a hamburger stand on the beach—what do you need

-----

###### most to succeed?” Answers included, “secret sauce,” and

 “great location” and “quality meat.” Halbert replied, “You

 missed the most important thing—A STARVING CROWD.”

 Your job is to find that “starving crowd” who can’t live

 without what it is you have to offer.
 What we want to do in terms of targeting is to find good,

 prospective customers for our business that can be reached

 affordably, that are likely to buy, that are able to buy, and

 preferably who already know of us, or are likely to trust us.
 Once you get this down, and you nail exactly who your

 slam-dunk customer truly is—the person you absolutely want

 to do business with over and again—then you’ll be able to

 make your marketing “magnetic” because you’ll be using

 words and phrases that’ll attract your target audience. This makes your job much easier, because you can talk to them

 using language they relate to about what it is they really

 want.

##### WHAT YOUR WHO REALLY WANTS

###### Knowing exactly what your perfect customer wants to buy is

 NOT as simple as it might seem. For example, there’s the old

 story of the guy walking into the hardware store looking for a

 3/4” drill bit. The mistake that’s easily made is thinking the customer wants a 3/4” inch drill bit.

 Wrong. He wants a 3/4” inch hole
. The drill bit is just the

 hoop he has to jump through to get it.

 Let’s take it a step further than recognizing the “want” for a

 3/4” inch hole… what’s the underlying need driving THAT desire? Is it simply to hang a picture? Or does our homeowner

-----

###### crave a lifestyle surrounded by elegance that makes their

 home the envy of family, friends, and coworkers? So it’s not

 just about merely needing a hole, it’s about Pride and an increased sense of Self-Worth.

 That’s a much deeper longing and tapping into THAT is

 where you want to connect with your WHO. You want to solve

 their problem, not just sell them something.

 It’s very easy to get this wrong in your messaging. For example, you’ll see financial planners competing with

 one another offering “estate plans.” Not that there’s anything

 wrong with estate planning, it’s a definite need in the minds

 of many fifty-plus year olds. But compare the phrasing

 “Looking for an estate plan?” to “Interested in a solution to take care of your family when you’re gone?”

 That’s a much stronger, more emotional way of connecting

 to the prospective customer using terms and phrasing that

 resonates to what’s going on inside their heads.

 Another example might concern a simple service like a children’s magician, whose primary market is selling birthday

 party magic shows to moms. A headline that reads “Joe Blow

 the Magician” followed by text all about Joe is appealing if

 “Joe” is world-renowned (not likely). Better messaging would be “Imagine: A Birthday Party Your Child Will Remember and

 Treasure Forever—Guaranteed!”

 That’s what Mom really wants. Sorry Joe.

 To help you better understand this concept, and how it

 might affect you and your business, here are fifteen different industries and what their WHO really wants.

-----

###### 1. Financial Services: Financial services can mean a lot of things.

Maybe you sell insurance, annuities, or stocks. Or maybe you have the

ability to sell a mix of products to serve the needs of your clients.

Whatever your particular specialty, in this industry, the name of the

game is “ **peace** .” What you’re really doing is helping people avoid

the 3 a.m. sweats.

No one wants to worry about whether they can put their kids through

college or becoming a burden to their family when they’re old. The

idea of running out of money with life left to live is downright

frightening.

If you’re at the higher end of service in this niche and serving the ultra
wealthy, you too are providing peace. It’s a different kind of peace, of

course. It’s the kind that results in knowing that all of their work and

investments won’t be washed away by a few bad economic cycles.

Those folks would like to know that they’ve provided true generational

wealth for their grandkids. In addition to selling your own expertise and

trustworthiness, your target market needs to believe that YOU have

the ultimate solution to their 3 a.m. sweats problem … that their

PEACE is what your business is all about.

###### 2. Insurance: There are variables in this industry depending on the type

of insurance you sell. But in all cases, as the name suggests, you are

selling **peace of mind** . Don’t think this is a luxury people won’t

invest in. They want to sleep well at night knowing that the worst-case

scenario will NOT happen to them because they have you. **They want**

**peace** and aside from talking about the particulars of great rates,

service, etc., people are yearning for you to show them that with you,

they can finally stop worrying.

-----

###### 3. Legal: In the legal industry, no matter what particular niche you

serve, the number one thing you’re selling is **advocacy** . People need

to know that someone they can trust is in THEIR corner. They need

someone on their side.

So, if you represent men in divorce and custody battles, oftentimes

you may be the ONLY person who is on their side that they can trust.

And this holds true in every legal niche … taxes, personal injury, estate

law, family, bankruptcy.

People might say they want to pay less in taxes (of course they do),

that they want custody of their kids (hopefully, they do), etc. But what

they really want is to know that they’ve got someone in their corner,

fighting for the best possible outcome for them .

It’s a lonely world out there. People need an expert like you to be on

their team when they’re going through tough times or preparing for

the future.

###### 4. Health & Wellness: There’s a lot to sell in the health and wellness

industry and so much of it can be surface level stuff that’s obvious.

Focusing on the obvious won’t get you the deep connection you need

to solidify your relationship with your market. Yes, we all want a sexy

body, a longer life, energy, a healthier heart, body, and mind. And

some of those things are really deep and personal.

But if you go deeper, you’ll see that what people really want as it

relates to health and wellness is **confidence** . So in this industry,

confidence is the REAL thing you’re selling. Sometimes we’re talking

about deep down confidence and the comfort in your own skin that

comes from being fit and strong.

Sometimes it’s the confidence you feel from knowing that you’re

fueling your body with the best nutrition available. And sometimes the

-----

confidence you’re selling is about having the confidence to know that

you’re fit enough to walk around an amusement park with your

children.

With the internet at our fingertips and a constantly changing narrative

from health experts, people are easily confused. What they need most

from you is confidence that if they buy from you or work with you to

achieve their goal, they’re doing the right thing for themselves or for

their families and that they will be able to achieve that goal.

###### 5. Chiropractic: There are obviously a lot of different niches you could

serve in this industry. But, let’s say for a moment that you serve the

elderly demographic. You might think that they just want to be able to

play a little more golf or keep up with their grandkids. Those things

might be true and they’ll certainly admit to them.

But if you go deeper, you’ll find that **they want to be the envy of all**

**of their friends who are falling apart** . That’s the secret ego

motivation that inspires them to find you. And further, they do NOT

want to be put into a nursing home. That’s the secret fear that has

them searching for you. Sell them abilities their friends don’t have and

you’ll have them eating out of your hand.

###### 6. Dentistry: There are two big things people REALLY want from their

dentist. They will usually tell you about the first thing but not the

second. First, they don’t want to feel a thing. Even people who don’t

have a dramatic fear of the dentist share this desire. Dentists are

associated with pain for good reason and mouth pain is the worst. This

fear of pain is deep and real for just about everyone on planet Earth so

it needs your attention. But what they really come to you for is

**confidence** . This is the thing that they usually won’t say out loud.

Men and women alike just want to feel attractive. They want to feel

-----

confident when they speak and smile. So while you must address the

pain issue, what people are willing to put their fears aside for is the

possibility that you can give them a smile they can be proud of. Sell

that deep down confidence.

###### 7. Fitness: Much the same as the health and wellness industry, in

fitness, you’re selling much more than a sexy body or healthy heart.

What **people really want is to believe that they can be a**

**version of themselves that has only ever been imaginary up**

**until this point.** They want to believe that it’s possible to be that

person … the person who feels incredibly confident about the way he

or she looks and rightfully so. That’s who you can help them be. Keep

in mind that mentioning the work involved with this achievement is a

turnoff. People want to believe that they can easily, magically,

transform into their best self. Sell that transformation.

###### 8. Service Business: Why choose one plumber over another? Or, why

choose one landscaper, babysitter, tutor, contractor, or mechanic over

another one out there? Again, this will vary depending on the service

you provide. But a lot of this comes down to consistently showing

people that you want the business and backing up that demonstration

with consistently excellent service, **the kind of treatment that**

**you’d give your own mother.**

###### No one wants to hire the guy who wants the work. We all want to hire the guy who would be glad to fit

 us in and take a look and then takes us under his

 wing and tells us that we’ve been spending too much

 and he has a cheaper solution or that our tires will

 actually last another eighteen months. We want someone to show us that we can count on them to

 take good care of us.

-----

###### 9. Sales: Sales is a broad industry and what people REALLY want

depends on what you sell. But if you’re up against three other suits

and you’re all making the same offer, always remember that the

winner is usually the person who puts extra time and effort into the

relationship. What does that tell us about what people really want?

They want to feel like you care about helping them. They want to feel

like you are excited about earning their business. **They REALLY want**

**to feel important.**

###### 10. Real Estate: A lot like the legal profession, people want an advocate.

So they need to know that YOU are in THEIR corner. Real estate is one

of those fields where the laws are different everywhere and always

changing. The confusion makes it such that the average citizen cannot

properly advocate for himself or herself. They need an expert. And

while they may say that they want to get a great price, **what they**

**REALLY want is an expert in their corner fighting for them.** You

are really selling that hero.

###### 11. Retail: Assuming you sell clothes, people want much more than deep

discounts, great service, and a great selection. These are the things

they’ll tell you they want. But what they won’t say is that they want to

walk out of your store feeling like the most fashionable, attractive,

“together” version of themselves. If you sell suits to men, they want to

walk out feeling “like a man” who commands respect! If you sell casual

clothes to women, they want to walk out feeling like they can take on

the world looking amazing, no matter what life throws at them. **It’s**

**about transformation.** Your marketing needs to address the

transformation, not just the discounts or other details.

###### 12. Automotive: If you own a repair shop, what your customers really

want will be different than if you sell detailing services. So it’s

important to know your market. But assuming you’re in the repair

-----

business-people will outright tell you that they don’t want to be ripped

off and they want to preserve the investment they’ve made in their

vehicle.

But what they secretly want is to never have to come into your shop

for service. And when they do, **they don’t want it to disturb their**

**lives at all** . They don’t want to feel it. Obviously this is something

you can’t actually give them. But you can address all of this in your

sales copy. You should be using language that talks about how you’re

in the business of keeping the people in your town in motion for longer

because no one wants to slow down to take care of their vehicle.

###### 13. Restaurant: There will always be people who come for a free meal or

because the fridge is empty, they’re short on time, or just didn’t plan

dinner. But at the end of the day, people choose a restaurant for a

bigger reason than all of these reasons. What they really want is a

**positive or memorable experience.** When they imagine where

they’ll eat tonight, their brains are processing what the experience will

be like. Will everyone be in a good mood? Will they have a good time?

Yes, some of those things hinge on quality, price, service, and speed.

But what you’re really selling is a “good time.”

###### 14. Coaching & Consulting: If you’re in the coaching and consulting

field, you might think you’re selling support, guidance, camaraderie, or

a helping hand. But people typically want much more than all of this

from their coach or consultant. In fact, they really want to **believe**

**that they already have the ability** within themselves to achieve

their goals.

So while what they say they want is success in your area of expertise,

what they really want is someone to show them how to bring out the

best of themselves and the power already within to achieve their

goals. This is true whether you teach yoga, piano, or business success.

-----

The key for you to focus on is that whatever they want to achieve in

this area, they already are quite capable. Your role is to first show

them that they actually do have this power and then to show them

how to use it.

###### 15. Info-marketing: You may think you’re selling specialized knowledge

in a particular field, but what you’re really selling here is

**transformation** .

Let’s say you help financial advisors make more money with your info
marketing business … you may have coaching groups, products to help

them succeed at certain aspects of the business, and maybe even

some done-for-you elements. At the end of the day, it’s not information

that they want from you (yes, the name of this industry is deceiving).

What you’re really marketing is the life they want for themselves. They

want to know that you can help them achieve the transformation

they’re looking for. That you can help them go from where they are

now (a) to where they want to be (b).

If your info-business provides parenting solutions to people with

troubled, adopted teens (point a—this is where they are now), you’re

selling a happy, well-adjusted kid that grows into a loving, productive

adult (point b—the transformation they want to achieve).

People want the “dream” and your job is to show them that your

products and/or services will be the catalyst for that transformation.

And in the case of this parenting info-biz, those parents also have their

own selfish, internal motives. They want to know that they are the best

parent they can be … that they’re doing everything they possibly can

for their child. So in this case, it’s transformation plus pride.

As you can tell, there’s a lot to truly understanding your WHO and

what matters most to them. It requires a lot of careful thought and

-----

analysis, but the rewards are well worth it.

Having a solid understanding is only the first step though. Now you

need to connect what THEY want with what YOU have to offer. And it all

takes shape with a simple triangle...

-----

-----

-----

-----

# PRINCIPLES OF MAGNETIC
 MARKETING

-----

###### CHAPTER 5
#### THE MAGNETIC MARKETING TRIANGLE

-----

###### Now let’s get to building your Magnetic Marketing system.
It has three big building blocks, each of which you

 can imagine as one side of a triangle:

 Message
: A truly compelling,
preferably irresistible,

 marketing message.

 Market:
High-probability target marketing that

 identifies only those most likely to respond.

 Media:
The most appropriate, effective combination

 of media used to deliver your message to your

 market.

 These three can’t be placed in any kind of sequential order,

 because no single one is more important than the other and

 none of them can function without the others. It is a closed

 triangle. Each feeds the others and when they work together it gives you enormous marketing power.

 BUT
you can render the triangle powerless if you get any

 one or more of them wrong.

 For example, you can deliver the right message to the right

 market, but if you use the wrong media, they will never get

-----

###### the message nor have a chance to act on it.

 Or, if you get the media and market right, but fall down

 when it comes to message—the right people will get what

 you have to say, it’s just not going to connect in the way it

 should.
 Finally, the right message via the right media goes out to

 the world loud and clear—but there’s nobody out there to

 listen.

 You must get ALL three right.

 This is why it’s so important that you really understand each and how they must work.

 MARKET

 In the previous chapter, I talked about the need to find your “starving crowd” of slam-dunk customers. The idea of NOT

 going after every human who still has a pulse is probably a

 somewhat newer concept for many small businesses. In fact,

 most are probably guilty of “throw mud against the wall”

 marketing where you are just putting a marketing message out there and hoping that somehow the right people are

 going to see it or hear it.

 With Magnetic Marketing
, we use a very different

 approach. Our approach is designed to do one very important

 thing, and that is eliminate waste to the greatest degree possible. And to eliminate waste, we must narrow our

 marketing focus to only the people most likely to buy what we

 have to offer.

 The basic way that most people choose their target market is GEOGRAPHIC. If you have a local business, you may say

-----

###### your customers, patients or clients come from a ten-mile

 radius around your business. Some people don’t get any more

 sophisticated in targeting than that.

 Targeting with only geographic information is like getting in a plane and dropping flyers and hoping one hits the right

 person. That may be an exaggeration, but the truth is that,

 with just some simple tweaks, you can make your geographic

 target marketing much more effective.
 DEMOGRAPHIC information is about how old people are,

 how much money they have, whether they are married or

 single, liberal or conservative, what religion they are and so

 forth.

 That’s another way to define further who your ideal customer is—and you need to do this—but again it’s very

 surface level. Geographic and demographic information is

 important, but we want to go even deeper than that.

 PSYCHOGRAPHICS delves even deeper because it explains

 “why” people buy. It includes information like habits, hobbies, spending habits and values.

 Demographics and psychographics will allow you to create

 your ideal customer profile—a detailed picture of people you

 would like to work with now and in the future. So how do you

 determine psychographics of your target market? Here are some questions to ask yourself:

 What keeps them awake at night, staring at the

 ceiling, unable to fall asleep as it relates to your

 product or service?

 What are they frustrated about?

-----

###### What is causing them pain, right now, as it relates to

 your product or service?

 What is the single biggest problem that you can

 solve for them?

 What do they secretly, privately desire most?

 The last question is very important. For example, most people who sell marketing courses always talk about making more

 money and getting more customers, clients, and patients—

 they think THAT is the core desire for many people. But

 there’s a deeper reason—for them and for everyone.

 How do you determine your market’s secret and private desires? If you’ve been in your business for a while and you

 think about it, you are going to come up with what it is,

 because you know them. It helps if you think about a current

 or past customer, client or patient you would love to “clone”

 if possible.
 If not, if you are just getting into a target market, one of the

 easiest things that you can do is go to online discussion

 groups and forums. Start reading what people are posting.

 You will be able to figure out what pain they have just by going. You will be able to see what they secretly, privately

 desire most.

 Immerse yourself in their world. Get their trade magazines

 and read them. Go to their trade shows. Talk with them. Ask

 questions. Watch, listen, and read what they say to their peers, how they talk about their lives and what brings

 meaning and what causes pain. Do what you can to get inside

-----

###### their heads until their deepest needs and dreams become evident to you.

 If you’ve been in their business, walked in their shoes,

 laughed and cried with them, then you’ll begin to understand

 what they secretly, privately desire most.

 And once you’ve done all this, you’ll know your WHO.

##### MESSAGE

###### The
next building block then is the right message, as in:

 What do you say to your marketplace, to your past, present

 and future prospects, clients and customers that is compelling, that is magnetic, that cannot be ignored, that

 must be responded to, that draws them to you like a bright

 porch light on a dark night draws moths?

 Do you have a great marketing message? Most businesses don’t. A person opens a restaurant, a flower shop, a dental or

 law practice, a service business, etc. and the message is,

 “We’re open for business.”

 A marketing message is a way of concisely and clearly

 saying to the right market, “Here’s what I’m all about and here’s why you should choose me.”

 So you need to ask yourself, “What am I going to say to the

 marketplace and why is what I say going to be interesting and

 appealing to the marketplace?”

 Back in Chapter 1, we talked about the need to identify and create your business’s
Unique Selling Proposition
or
USP
. The

 example I gave was Domino’s Pizza, who built their empire

 based on this USP:
“Fresh hot pizza delivered in thirty minutes

 or less, guaranteed.”

-----

###### You can go out to the market with a USP like this and you’ll

 almost certainly do far better than most of your competitors,

 who are probably relying on clichés stating “the best” or

 “number one” or something equally meaningless.

 But I’m going to take you a step deeper regarding promotional messaging—into the creation of special
, highly

 appealing offers that I call “
Widgets
.”

 WHAT’S A WIDGET?

 We call these very special offers
“Widgets
” and
the best way to think of it is an offer on steroids.

 Let’s say, you own a hotel. A common offer might be: “Get

 10 percent off your hotel room rate.”

 A widget
, however, ups the ante by tossing in extra elements to make it even more attractive, hard to resist, and

 impossible to compare against competitors. You can think of

 widgets as packages of services and goods and premiums

 and experiences bundled together, given a clever name, and

 promoted as a special, one-of-a-kind buying opportunity. So now, instead of creating an offer like:

 “Get 10 percent off your hotel room rate.”

 Which is frankly pretty boring and easy to ignore, you’ll see:

 Your Ultimate Weekend of Food and Fun for only $xxx!

**10 percent savings on regular two-night room rate**
**Free gourmet dinner for two, both nights**
**Complimentary bottle of champagne when you arrive**
**Limo Service from and to the airport—no charge**
**Eighteen holes of golf for two plus cart**
**Movie tickets for two, plus popcorn to boot**

-----

**Limited availability, reserve your spot before midnight**
**tomorrow**

###### Now that’s hard to ignore, especially when presented to the

 right person at the right time with the right media.
 Widget-making
is an important marketing skill. Once you’ve

 got it, you’ll use it regularly and every day in your business. T

 hat’s why it’s so critical to understand the concept.

 On a simple level, if we go back to the pizza business as an example, their widget of the week may be themed for the

 NBA Playoffs. It could include two pizzas plus a liter of Coke

 and four side salads—all for a special, one-time only low

 price.

 They’re not just saying, “Come and buy pizza from us.” They’re saying,
 “Come in now to get the
 NBA Playoffs

 Party Dinner Deal
.”

 THAT special deal is their widget
, which so long as the

 playoffs continue they can promote via email, flyers, TV ads,

 newspapers, phone scripts, on and on.
 One of the best examples that I’ve seen and that I know

 quite a bit about, comes from Las Vegas in the hotel and

 casino business, where pretty much everybody offers the

 same thing, a place to come and lose a lot of money and

 have a good time doing it with a lot of lights and pretty girls. For decades, that was the business in Las Vegas.

 Years ago, an amazing entrepreneur, Bob Stupak, took over

 the worst and last hotel on the strip. He had to find a very

 different way to get people to come and stay at that hotel and gamble in that casino.

-----

###### He didn’t have a tremendous amount of money at the time

 to do advertising and marketing with, so the conventional

 ways that Las Vegas hotels market themselves was pretty much out for him.

 Bob sat down and he turned the hotel business and the

 casino business in Las Vegas into a very specific widget that

 he could hold up and people could see and get a grip on and understand and be attracted by and buy in advance of use.

 Let me describe his widget. Ask yourself if you would

 respond to it presuming you were convinced it was real.

“Give me $396 and I’ll give you two nights, three days in my hotel in one of
the deluxe suites. There will be a bottle of champagne waiting for you when
you arrive. You can have unlimited drinks the entire time you’re here whether
you’re gambling or not. Even if you’re sitting in one of the lounges and
enjoying the entertainment, you pay nothing more for your drinks. More
importantly, for your $396, I’m going to give you $600 of my dollars to
gamble with in my casino.”

###### His widget included the room, it included the drinks, it

 included some extras like the champagne and souvenir dice

 and show tickets. It included $600 to gamble with while you

 were at his casino.

 This widget turned that little hotel, which at the time that this started was on a Motel 6 level, into one of the largest and

 fastest-growing hotels on the Las Vegas Strip in its time called

 Bob Stupak’s Vegas World
 . It eventually became
 The

 Stratosphere
.

 If you’re old enough, you may recall seeing Bob’s full-page ads for this widget in
Parade
,
Sports Illustrated
,
 Playboy
,

 and in dozens and dozens of magazines and newspapers all

 across the country.

-----

###### Bob filled his rooms by selling that widget and that was really the business that he was in, the business of selling that

 widget. He didn’t advertise any other type of

 accommodations. He didn’t bother advertising his hotel as a

 hotel. He concentrated all his efforts and all his energy and all

 his resources on
selling that widget
.
 These packages were prepaid. You bought your $396

 package today but you might not actually make reservations

 and go to the hotel until a month later, six months later, even

 a year later. In the interim, Bob exchanged your $396 for a

 certificate, a piece of paper which entitled you to all the benefits that I described. He had your $396 in a bank account

 earning interest or funding construction and remodeling

 during that time that it was not redeemed.

 If you study that example closely, you see that a fairly

 mundane and ordinary business, the hotel business and the hotel casino business was turned into a totally different

 business.

 A different business was invented within the business and

 that new and different business became the widget that was sold to the public.

 That’s exactly the thinking process that you need to go

 through.

##### CREATING IRRESISTIBLE OFFERS

###### Bob Stupak’s “widget” created an empire for him because at

 the time, it was irresistible and original.

 With this widget, he managed to create a Godfather-level

 kind of offer—the kind of offer you simply cannot refuse.

-----

###### Think about it—this offer, this deal
, it just sounded too

 good to be true—room, champagne, unlimited booze, even

 $600 in gambling money (which had to played at the casino,

 it couldn’t be redeemed for cash). The total package just

 seemed amazing.
 THAT is the kind of thinking you need to put into place

 when creating your offers. Too many business owners come

 up with an offer that’s practically invisible—“Save 5 percent!”

 or something else that involved zero imagination and barely

 moves the needle.
 An irresistible offer (again, think “widget” because that’s

 what you’ll be promoting) bundles together a variety of

 elements—price, bonuses, guarantee, speed, security, etc.—

 into something unique and compelling. Frankly, if the widget you create doesn’t cause you to pause and reflect to yourself

 “Am I giving away the farm here?” for at least a moment,

 then the offer isn’t good enough.

 To be truly irresistible, it should literally overwhelm the

 customer with value.
 Now, that doesn’t mean you have to take a bath on the

 deals you make. Quite the opposite. Stupak watched his

 numbers and he knew exactly what kind of ROI he got from

 every room key handed out. He also factored into the mix

 things like food, house winnings, return visits, referrals, and much more.

 So the widget didn’t stand alone—it was just one piece of a

 much larger play he had going involving his business and how

 he could maximize the lifetime value of every customer.

-----

###### When creating your offer widgets, in the Magnetic

 Marketing System
there are basically three types of offers.

 Lead Generation Offers

 Consultation Offers

 Direct Purchase or Final Offers

 Each type of offer serves a specific purpose in building a

 positive relationship with your prospective customer, client, or patient—establishing credibility and trust—all leading to

 the end goal of making the sale. Let’s talk about each in a bit

 more detail.

 LEAD GENERATION OFFERS

 This is an offer whose only purpose is to, in effect, entice a

 prospect to raise their hand to identify and register

 themselves as having interest in certain subject matter, and

 information or goods or services, and to invite further communication with you. Often, although not always, the lead

 generation offer is free.

 You see lead generation done by direct marketers routinely

 and regularly. You may not have given them much thought

 before, but now that you’re aware of this kind of offer, you will.

 For example, a national company may offer walk-in

 bathtubs for the elderly, advertising on cable and in national

 print, offering their “lead gen widget,” which is a free

 information kit and DVD. Once someone raises their hand and requests this “kit,” the company now recognizes them as “
a

-----

###### lead” and they can follow up with focused marketing looking

 to make the sale.

 This model is widespread across all kinds of industries, including pharmaceuticals, finance, home improvements, and

 many more.

 Oddly enough, you rarely find a local company doing this

 same strategy. Instead, they immediately try to get the prospect to commit to a “free in
 -home estimate” or “free

 consultation.”

 This can quite often
be a mistake, as it’s asking too much

 too soon.

 “Why?” you wonder… well, Arnold Taubman, one of America’s most successful mall developers, coined the term

 “Threshold Resistance” in regards to the entrances to retail

 stores. I find it applies even more broadly to direct marketing.

 Again, remember that your prospect doesn’t want to pull

 out their credit card. They don’t want to get off the couch. They don’t want to even pick up their cell phone and punch in

 a number. At a mall, it’s hard enough to get them to enter a

 retail store where God forbid they face the very real

 possibility of some stranger walking up and trying to sell

 them something.
 So jumping right into “Sign up for a free consultation”—

 whether from chiropractor, financial advisor, remodeler, or

 what-have-you is a BIG threshold to get them to cross.

 That’s why starting with something that has a very low barrier to entry—like “call this number and get my free report

 and DVD”—is much easier
to convert and provides a higher

 response. There’s less perceived risk. So
those interested are

-----

###### more likely to respond. And by getting them to agree to that

 first step, albeit tiny, you increase the chances that further down the road
they will become a customer, client or patient.

 This is a key to magnetically attracting customers.
The

 addition of lead generation to your marketing system allows

 you to create a pool of ideal customers to directly market to.
 Therefore, if your business DOES in fact require some sort

 of consultative-based sale (e.g., look over the home to be

 remodeled or assess their current financial situation), it’s wise

 to get the ball rolling with an appropriate lead generation

 offer of a free report or DVD or audio.
 Don’t ignore this strategy if your business does NOT require

 a consultation. Remember, you have skepticism to overcome

 with almost every kind of sale, whether it’s for something

 relatively simple like a garden shed for the backyard or a

 standard service like a plumber or carpenter may offer. Just about EVERY kind of business can do lead generation with this

 approach.

 For example, if you sell garden sheds, you could offer a free

 DVD showing the many different ways a simple garden shed can be used to make your life more practical or fun. If you

 offer carpentry services, you could offer a report laying out

 “Seven Easy Ways to Save Serious Money When You Have to

 Fix Your Deck.”

 We call th
is report or DVD or whatever a Lead Generation Magnet and I’ll go into more detail in an upcoming chapter.

 CONSULTATION OFFERS

-----

###### It’s important to understand the lead generation offer as it

 could very well be a foreign concept to you. However, the

 consultation offer is probably already familiar. Indeed, it could

 be the basic kind of offer you’re making right now in your

 business, especially if you’re in some kind of professional service industry like dentistry,
 legal services, financial

 planning, and yes, even copywriting.

 The point of a consultation offer is to compel the prospect

 to meet—either face to face in person or over the phone or

 the internet—to discuss their specific situation as it relates to your business.

 Again, do not underestimate how hard it can be to get

 someone—who may or may not know you—to drop

 everything and commit to this kind of meeting. You can couch

 this in all kinds of friendly terms like “free” and “no obligation” and what have you, but the bottom line is, they

 know deep down there’s going to be a sales pitch in there

 somewhere. The
 y are deciding whether they want to give

 you an hour in their day to find out IF you are everything you say you will be. They need to trade an hour that could be

 spent making dinner, meeting with a new client, watching

 their child’s soccer game, or even just the hour that they

 planned to spend reading a book to meet with you.

 So you need to p
 rovide compelling copy that clearly explains the benefits (to them—not you), clearly articulates

 how easy
and low-impact this meeting will be.
Talking about

 the transformation that will take place AFTER they finish the

 meeting with you. Here’s where my earlier points about

 “emotional copywriting” come into play. You’re painting a

-----

###### picture of how their life is lacking something now, but when

 they finish with you, all will be right with the world.

 And at the end of your meeting—or at any other point in

 the marketing process, it depends on your business model and how you close the deal on your goods and services—you

 present the offer to purchase what it is you have to sell.

 DIRECT PURCHASE OR FINAL OFFER

 Here’s where you present the widget and ask for the sale.
 The direct purchase offer you’re likely most familiar with is

 a straight coupon offer—either from a Valpak mailing or

 online from Groupon or the like. Now, I’m not a champion of

 simply offering discounts as a strategy, but this is definitely one option.

 Another common direct purchase offer, in place of or in

 combination with discounting, is gift with purchase where you

 toss in one or more bonuses.

 And as we discussed earlier, when describing how to create widgets, there’s other things you could integrate to make this

 more appealing and to drive urgency.

 It’s important to note that the direct purchase offer is the

 model used by most businesses—they go right for the sale,

 because they don’t do any of the lead generation and—even worse—fail to follow up if the initial offer doesn’t get

 accepted.

 In the
Magnetic Marketing System
, you can go directly for

 the sale—and in many cases it’s the right thing to do. But we

 don’t leave that as your only option. You can, instead, work your way through the sales process with multiple steps,

-----

###### starting with lead generation, moving on to consultation, and

 then finally closing the deal with your final offer.

 MEDIA

 So we’ve got a great message, we’ve got a great market.

 Here’s the next challenge.

 How do you take the message you so lovingly crafted and birthed, and deliver it
 via the right MEDIA to these people

 you’ve carefully selected, in a way that’s effective, efficient,

 and
affordable? How will it magnetically attract back to you

 the perfect prospects who are ready, able and eager to buy

 and buy only from you, so you get to sell in a competitive vacuum?

 How do you do that?

 It’s incredibly challenging, even for business owners who are

 far more technologically astute than
 I. The laundry list of

 media options available changes practically with every breath

 you take. There’s no possible way anyone could keep up.

 So how do you choose? Once you know your WHO, it’s easy.

 Where they live is where you target.

 I know—you’ve been told to be EVERYWHERE for EVERYBODY.

 Instead, you go everywhere ONLY where your WHO is.

 If they’re on Facebook (and Facebook has amazing

 capabilities to segment, divide, and conquer) then you go to Facebook.

-----

###### If they’re subscribers to a highly focused, niche

 magazine that’s eagerly awaited every month by a dedicated fan base, then you go there.

 If they’re hard-core conservatives who plan their day around talk radio, then you go there.

 You do NOT go where they’re NOT. It’s not only unnecessary,

 it’s a waste of time, energy, and money. You go where they

 ARE instead.
 If you make a list, and if you stop to think about it,

 whatever business you’re in, whatever sales career you’re in,

 you can make a long list of media—things that you can spend

 money on to deliver marketing messages.

 These days, everyone is infatuated with the Internet—and the systems that we teach work brilliantly online. But the

 Internet is not a business. It is a media, and it is not the only

 media.

 So, while going online is one option, another option is to use traditional print advertising. This could mean direct mail,

 Valpak, Free Standing Inserts, Yellow Pages or displaying ads

 in newspapers or local periodicals.

 You can go exhibit at home and consumer shows or trade

 shows. You can go on radio and television. You can put telemarketers on the phone. On and on and on and on.

 The reality is, you should use a combination of all of the

 different media—in fact, a combination of online and offline.

 Here’s a couple things you need to know.

 First of all, all that stuff works, and it all can be made to work better with good, direct response methods.

-----

###### But only a handful of all those things that you can do can be converted into a system. And SYSTEM’s one of my favorite

 words. System means reliable, consistent, and predictable

 results.

 You get it working once and then it keeps working on its own for a long, long, long, long, long time before you have to

 tweak it again.

 We need marketing systems.

 And over the next few chapters, I’m going to lay out for you

 a marketing system that is so predictable, so reliable, and so consistent, that when this is working for you, you go to bed at

 night knowing—not hoping, wishing, or praying, but knowing

 —within a small, acceptable range of variance, how many

 good prospects, customers or clients are going to come to

 you by noon the next day, every single day, for as long as you use the system.

 It’s like a thermometer. You can turn it up or down to get

 more or less any time of the week, month or year that you

 want them. It’s that scientific.
 But there are some rules you must follow…

### CHAPTER 6
#### THE 10 FOUNDATIONAL RULES

-----

###### I spend a good portion of my book,
The No B.S. Guide to

 Direct Marketing,
 laying out the ironclad rules that will

 transform any business into an infinitely more powerful direct

 marketing business. These also are the foundational rules that govern Magnetic Marketing
.

 Note that these are NOT “recommendations”—consider

 them mandates. Gospel. Etchings in stone brought down at

 great peril from the mountain. Please copy them down and

 post them anywhere and everywhere you work so that they will remain front and center of all marketing efforts from this

 day forward.

 Resolve now that every ad you run, every flyer you

 distribute, every postcard or letter you mail, every website

 you put up, everything and anything you do to market your business MUST adhere to these rules.

 Yes, they are simplistic, dogmatic, and you will undoubtedly

 encounter specific situations where you find there truly is a

 rational reason to violate one or more.
 But for now, sticking to them rigidly is the right approach,

 the best approach, and the approach that you can be sure of

 that will work. You can experiment later after you have gained

 practical experience in their use and have fully exorcised the

 demons of “brand advertising” from your mindset and your business.

#### RULE #1—THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
 AN OFFER OR OFFERS

-----

###### Number one, there will always be an offer or offers. On the

 internet especially, there’s a popular idea that content is king.

 I would disagree. The sale is king.
 All your marketing needs to have is an offer telling your

 ideal prospects exactly what to do and why they want to do it

 right now. It should be irresistible and time sensitive and give

 them some kind of transformative value if they take action.

 This is not just an implied offer like a store running ads, “We’re here, come on in.” This should not be a common

 offer like, “The Sale of the Century. This Weekend

 Only.”
Instead, ideally, yours is a Godfather’s offer—an offer

 so big, so bold, so perfectly targeted to the WHO you’ve identified as your slam-dunk customer that it is impossible to

 refuse.

 Now, this offer could be to generate a lead (with some sort

 of “lead generation magnet” like a free report, video, etc.) or

 to actually make the sale at that time. Needless to say, a great deal of thought needs to go into your offer as we

 explained in the previous chapter.

 Regardless of the nature of the offer itself, the point is to

 make certain that every communication actually asks

 somebody to do something. Focusing on this injects a new level of discipline into all of your communications with

 prospects, customers, and the marketplace at large.

 This rule should open your eyes to the sad reality that the

 vast majority of advertising presented merely shows up and

 talks about the marketplace, the advertiser, the wind, sun, and the rain, social values, what have you without any kind of

 reference to something specific to be had by immediately

-----

###### responding. In essence, the blimp passes by once again,

 fading into the sunset, leaving no trace behind. Nothing to track, nothing to measure, nothing to score. Money flies off

 with the wind.

 When you take this kind of undisciplined approach to your

 marketing and simply spend and hope and guess, you’re at

 the mercy of relying on opinion as to its effect—do you like it? Did your mother-in-law think it was humorous and expel a

 chuckle? Do your customers say nice things about it? Try

 paying your bills with that kind of feedback.

#### RULE #2—THERE WILL BE A REASON TO RESPOND RIGHT NOW

###### The hidden cost and failure in all advertising and marketing

 are in the “almost persuaded.”

 They were tempted to respond. They nearly responded.

 They got right up to the edge of response, but they set it

 aside to do it later or to mull over or to check out other options.

 When they get to that edge, we must reach across and

 drag them past it. There must be a good reason for them not

 to stop short or delay or ponder, there must be urgency.
 Remember, hesitation and procrastination are among the

 most common of human behaviors. Your prospect doesn’t

 want to move, period. Just like Homer Simpson, the last thing

 he wants is put down the donut, get off the couch, and

 actually do something. Hence, you must provide a compelling reason to act and NOW.

-----

###### There are plenty of ways to add URGENCY:

 tie the offer to a hard and fast deadline

 restrict the offer to a limited number of customers

 remove the bonus or gift from the deal if they don’t act right away

 add an element of “bidding” to the deal, a la eBay

 Those are just a few ideas; open your eyes to the world of

 experienced direct marketers out there and I’m confident

 you’ll discover many more. Regardless, make sure to give a

 reason to act NOW.

#### RULE #3—YOU WILL GIVE CLEAR
 INSTRUCTIONS

###### Most people do a reasonably good job at following directions.

 For the most part, they stop on red and go on green; stand

 in the lines they’re told to stand in; fill out the forms they’re

 given to fill out and applaud when the applause sign comes on.

 Most people are conditioned from infancy in every

 environment to do as they are told. Marketers’ failures and

 disappointments often result from giving confusing directions,

 or no directions at all and confused or uncertain consumers do nothing.

 People rarely buy anything of consequence without being

 asked. You must walk your prospect through the steps you

 want them to take in order to make the sale.

-----

###### This is far more important than you might imagine. Take to

 heart the old rule: “A confused buyer—WON’T buy!” Anxiety

 rises anytime you ask someone to do something that they’re

 unsure of what to expect or how to carry out.
 Therefore, whenever you put together any kind of

 marketing tool, ad, flyer, sales letter, website, phone script,

 etc. make sure to examine it from the perspective of an

 unsuspecting customer/prospect encountering it for the very

 first time.
 Consumers like, are reassured by, and respond to clarity. Be

 sure
you provide it.

#### RULE #4—THERE WILL BE TRACKING, MEASUREMENT, AND
 ACCOUNTABILITY

###### If you want real profits from your marketing, you are no

 longer going to permit any advertising, marketing or selling

 investments to be made without directing accurate tracking, measurement and accountability.

 Forget about likes, links, opens, shares, reach, visibility,

 views, and engagement—they can’t be deposited in your

 bank account. All of that may be interesting, even indicative, but what matters is that for every dollar you spend, you can

 clearly identify how much comes back as a result.

 This is for two reasons,

 1. Business management by objectives is the only kind
 of management that actually works.

-----

###### 2. You need real, hard facts and data to make good,

 intelligent marketing decisions.

 If you loop back and connect this to Rule #1, you’ll find an

 important key in tracking—offers. Different offers can be

 made in different media, to different lists, and at different

 times. You can include and assign promotion codes to

 coupons, reply cards, websites, order forms, phone numbers, and so forth. With this data, you can determine which offers

 and variations of offers work best to which lists under what

 conditions.

 Tough-minded management of marketing requires knowing

 things and then acting wisely upon what you know.

#### RULE #5—ONLY NO-COST BRAND
 BUILDING

###### I am not opposed to brand-building.

 I am opposed to paying
for brand-building

 Most small business owners cannot afford to properly invest in brand-building. I do not believe it is a wise investment for

 small business owners and entrepreneurs, nor do I believe it

 is even necessary. You can acquire all the brand power you

 need as a no-cost byproduct of profitable direct response

 advertising and marketing as described in this book.
 My preferred strategy is simple: buy response, gratefully

 accept brand-building as a bonus. NEVER buy brand-building

 and hope for response as a bonus, unless you simply want to

 spend Daddy’s fortune out of spite.

-----

###### Paying for traditional brand-building may be fine, even

 essential for giant companies with giant budgets engaged in a fierce combat over shelf space and consumer recognition.

 So if you’re Coors or Heinz or some other company like that,

 feel free to play with the shareholders’ money to buy name

 recognition. But if you’re an entrepreneur playing with your

 own marbles, beware because copying what the big companies do to build their brands can bankrupt you.

 Even though held in high regard by media companies and

 advertising agencies alike, “brand” is not the holy grail

 magically able to cure all your business woes. Brand-building is best left to very patient marketers with very deep pockets

 filled with other people’s money. You are far better served by

 focusing on leads, customers, sales, and profits directly

 driven by your marketing system.

#### RULE #6—THERE WILL BE FOLLOW
 UP

###### People read your ad, get your letter, see your sign, find you

 online, etc.

 They call or visit your website or place of business.

 They ask your receptionist or staff questions. And sadly, in far too many cases, that’s it.

 There’s not even the slightest attempt to capture the

 prospect’s name, physical address, or email address. There’s

 no offer to immediately send an information package, free

 report, or coupons.

-----

###### This is criminal waste. I’ve been poor and I abhor and detest and condemn waste.

 When you fail to follow up, you are simply shrugging your

 shoulders and accepting waste as yet another cost of doing

 business. This is madness.

 When you invest in advertising and marketing, you’re not just paying for the customers you get. You are paying for each

 lead you generate, every call, every walk-in, every email,

 every reaction and response of any kind.

 If an ad costs you $1000 and you get fifty calls, every call you fail to follow up on is exactly like pulling a $20 bill from

 your wallet, taking a match to it, and watching it go up in

 flames. So unless you truly do have money to burn, you need

 to make sure to follow up with every lead that comes through

 your door.
 There are hundreds of variations for follow up campaigns

 and strategies, blending offline with online. Here are just few

 ways you can follow up:

 1. Restate, ReSell, and Extend the Same Offer
—
 present what they didn’t do or buy again in the best

 way possible. You can do this
in a straightforward

 manner with letters
or emails.
You can also use

 “retargeting” online technology to keep the offer in

 front of someone long after they’ve seen it the first time—they’ll see it on other websites they visit, their

 Facebook feed, and so on.

 2. Provide a Stern or Humorous “Second Notice”

 Tied to an Onrushing Deadline
—present the offer

-----

###### again, reemphasizing the approaching deadline.

 3. “Third and Final Notice”
—Tie this communication
 to the deadline and the disappearance of the offer.

 4. Change the Offer
—Sometimes you can change the
 offer relatively easily, by offering new or extended

 installment payment terms, by swapping out a bonus

 for something different, etc.

 Doing nothing with even one lead is like flushing money down the toilet. It is a serious lapse in judgment and waste of

 precious resources every time you fail to follow-up with every

 lead or every customer.

#### RULE #7—THERE WILL BE STRONG
 COPY

###### The fact is, there is enormous, ever-growing, almost

 overwhelming competition for attention and interest—a daily

 tsunami of clutter that must be cut through or circumvented.

 In this environment, where literally tens of thousands of

 messages bombard your prospects every day, the ordinary and the normal are ignored, the cautious and calm messages

 unnoticed.

 You can’t send a shy, timid Casper Milktoast to knock on a

 door of a home or walk into a business and beg in barely a

 whisper for a few moments of the prospect’s time. So you can’t do that with a postcard, letter, flyer, newsletter, email,

 web video, etc. either.

-----

###### You want to send the Incredible Hulk instead—huge,

 glowing neon green, stomping, impossible to ignore. He

 shows up and the guy drops whatever he’s been doing, and pays attention.

 But the copy can’t just shout. Loud but irrelevant isn’t much

 better than quiet yet relevant. Loudness can grab attention, but you can’t convert it to interest. The Incredible Hulk

 stomping into your office would get your attention, but he’d still have trouble bridging to interest and having you engage

 in a conversation with about just any new product.
 Strong copy can be sensational and attention-commanding, but does so in a way that establishes relevance and credible

 authority—creating proactive interest in our information, goods, and services. Here’s a good example of a strong

 headline making a real benefit-oriented promise:

##### Find Out Why Seven Out of Ten Homes Don’t Sell

Special report reveals the four most common mistakes that can cost you

thousands

###### Most strong copy gets written backwards, starting from the customer’s interests, desires, frustrations, fears, thoughts,

 feelings, and experiences (remember the emphasis earlier on nailing down the WHO?)—and then journeys forward to reveal

 a solution tied to your business.
 Most ineffective copy takes the reverse path: starting instead with the company, product or service and its features,

 benefits, comparative superiority, and price. This is the common default approach the overwhelming majority of

-----

###### advertisers, copywriters, and salespeople fall back to, rather than developing a more creative, customer-focused approach.

 Here are two major mistakes your copy can’t afford to make:

 1. Writing factually and “professionally” rather

 than emotionally
. Great copy communicates conversationally, one-on-one, just like you would

 sitting across the table from a friend you can’t wait to let in on something wonderful you’ve just discovered. And it makes no difference whether

 you’re selling to Fortune 1000 CEOs or Al Bundy in his trailer—your best approach is to write like you

 talk, speaking passionately from the heart with deeply emotional appeals.

 2. Being timid or bland in your claims and
 promises.
Many believe their customers, clients, or

 patients are smarter and more sophisticated than others, at least immune to sensationalism and

 hyperbole, perhaps offended by it, and they discredit themselves by engaging in it. Wrong. These beliefs are in contradiction to facts and experience, for in

 every category of product or service, in media directed at presumably educated, sophisticated

 people, I can find examples of ads making grandiose and extraordinary claims that succeed mightily. Zig Ziglar was right: “Timid salesmen have skinny

 kids”—no matter who they’re selling to.

-----

###### The fact you must embrace about strong sales copy is that you need it and you may have to learn to write it for yourself.

 If this concept happens to be brand new to you, start with my Magnetic Marketing System and Toolkit
 available at www.MagneticMarketing.com
or consider the option of having

 our team write this for you.

##### RULE #8—IT WILL LOOK LIKE MAIL-ORDER
 ADVERTISING

###### This rule is a great simplifier, because it ends your paying attention to—and trying to emulate—the overwhelming

 majority of all the advertising you see on TV, in magazines, in newspapers, online; by your peers and competitors. You are

 to go blind to anything except pure
 mail-order advertising. Anything else, shut the door, ignore.
 I am specifically speaking of their formats, layout, and

 appearance of advertising—whether print ad or a webpage or any other item.

 Here’s exactly the type of ad I’m talking about:

-----

###### Classic mail-order ads are typically broken up into one

 quarter, one-half, and one quarter of the page, give or take. The top quarter is for headline and subheads; the middle half

 for presentation of product or proposition, sometimes aided by testimonials; the bottom quarter for the offer and clear response instructions, often with a coupon.

 The most frequently used alternative is the advertorial, which mimics an article.

 The other reliable format is that of a letter, from you to the reader, at whatever length is necessary to do the job. I have clients mailing 4, 8,16, 24 and in one case, 64-page sales

 letters. One of these, a 16-page one, literally tacked up online as a website, having traffic driven to it, has produced $1

 million a year for nine years running.
 To see real mail-order advertising, you need to assemble a diverse assortment of magazines in which highly successful

 mail-order companies consistently run full-page

-----

###### advertisements. These include Reader’s Digest Large Print Edition
, tabloids like the National Enquirer
, and business publications like Investors Business Daily
and Entrepreneur
.

 Also check out special interest magazines for model railroad hobbyists, gun enthusiasts, horse lovers, etc. as you’ll find

 fractional and full-page mail-order ads.
 Tear out and keep these ads as research; discard all others
. Let these ads be your only models. If you respond to some,

 your mailbox will soon be full of direct mail that also follows classic formats and architecture.
 You’ll eventually have a collection of advertisements that—

 if studied and modeled for your own use—represents money in the bank.

 If you’re looking for a shortcut, I have compiled a few along the way, with templates in my Magnetic Marketing System and Toolkit (
available at www.NoBSInnerCircle.com
.)

##### RULE #9—RESULTS RULE. PERIOD.

###### Results rule. Period.
 Do not let anyone confuse, bamboozle or convince you that

 anything else is of any importance. Nobody’s opinion counts —even yours.

 And there’s no excuse for not assessing results any more. With today’s technology, it’s easier than ever to link and track specific promotions to quantifiable results. You can even do

 what’s called “split-testing” or “A-B” testing, where you match one headline against another to see which produces the best

 results, and then continue the process over and again. Test.

-----

###### Monitor. Adjust. The goal is to gradually achieve the very best

 results possible.
 The only thing that matters is the answer to the question,

 “What results did I get?” When you implement this into your marketing approach and marketing messages, you change the way you communicate with your prospects and customers

 dramatically and forever.

**NOTE
 : A lot of what you have just read in the previous rules may seem**
weird, sound funny, or feel wrong to you. Too bold. Too aggressive. Too hypey. Too unprofessional. Too far outside the box of what’s deemed “correct” for
your profession or field. That’s understandable. But it doesn’t matter because
remember,
your opinions NEVER COUNT
. You don’t get a vote, neither does
your wife, your mother, your golfing buddy, neighbor, competitor, employee,
nobody gets a vote. The only vote that counts is the customer’s and the only
legal, valid ballots are cash, checks, and credit cards.

#### RULE #10—YOU WILL BE A TOUGH-MINDED DISCIPLINARIAN
 AND PUT YOUR BUSINESS ON A STRICT DIRECT MARKETING DIET

###### Many business owners who perennially struggle and suffer

 are very much aware of things that need doing but simply lack the will to do them.
 Maybe it’s a longtime vendor or employee or client, now a

 “friend,” who you know is toxic and needs to be replaced, but you can’t muster the will to fire them.
 Maybe there’s an ad that you keep spending money on that

 you know is failing to deliver results, but you lack the will to fix it or shut it down.

-----

###### Maybe there’s a website you know isn’t producing either,

 but the very thought of getting it remade is painful, so it stays as is.
 From this point forward, with ALL advertising and

 marketing, you have to be thick-skinned about criticism, tough-minded about money invested, extremely disciplined in

 thought and action, and dedicated to carrying out your game plan, all fueled by a resolute will to win.

 IMPORTANT:

 Anything
that doesn’t conform to the 10 Rules discussed in this chapter, do not let in at all. Just say no. And bar the door.

 When you DO implement all these into your marketing approach and marketing messages, you change—for the better—the way you communicate with your prospects and

 customers dramatically and forever.

# BUILDING YOUR
MAGNETIC
 MARKETING SYSTEM

-----

###### CHAPTER 7
#### YOUR MAGNETIC ATTRACTION SYSTEM

-----

###### What I’m going to describe to you over the next three chapters represents the foundational components of

 the complete Magnetic Marketing System
.
In over four decades, I’ve never met a single person who couldn’t take

 this foundation and apply it for use in their business.
 When you put this system in place, you’ll have a repeatable, reliable machine working for you 24/7/365 to

 attract-convert-retain customers. No more guesswork. No more “feast or famine.” No more random acts of marketing.
 In this chapter, we’ll cover your
 Magnetic Attraction

 System
 —built to attract prospects who you know fit your targeted WHO and allowing them to raise their hand

 indicating th
at they have a problem you can solve thanks to what you have to offer, be it product, service, or some mix of both.

 The diagram below shows how the Attraction System works:

-----

###### The Attraction System uses a variety of MEDIA channels where your target prospects hang out to let them know about

 your Lead Generation Magnet.
 These can include magazine ads, banner ads on websites, Pay-Per-Click ads, emails sent to lists they’ve subscribed to,

 direct mail, business cards you hand out when meeting someone, display ads in newspapers, ValPak coupons, and so

 on.
 The Lead G
eneration Magnet is the special “Widget” you are offering to get individuals—from the greater population of

 prospects—to indicate interest and thereby transform themselves from a prospect into a “LEAD.”

 Once a lead raises their hand, you now have permission (and the responsibility) to follow up with them regarding the information they requested. For example:

 If they asked about ideas for staging and selling their house, you can follow up with them on this.

 If they asked about ensuring their children are

 protected in an estate plan, you can follow up with them on this.

 If they asked about learning how to hit the golf ball ten yards farther without new clubs, you can follow

 up with them on this.

 Everyone who raises their hand gets put into a “bucket” or

 database or list from which you then follow up with messaging aimed at converting them from a lead to a paying customer.

-----

###### This approach transforms your advertising from a “hope but can’t tell if it works” model to a “know if it works” system. Now you’re investing in reaching out directly to people you

 KNOW you can help and who have indicated they have a problem you can solve. You can run the numbers based on

 the results you’re getting from your lead generation ads— calculate to see that for every $1 you invest you get $2-$4 or more back. This is a huge improvement over Goodyear blimp

 advertising where there’s no way to accurately measure and you have no idea whether the ads have any effect at all.

 CREATING YOUR LEAD GENERATION REPORT / GUIDE / MAGNET

 Typically, your L
 ead Generation Magnet is information that has real value to the prospect.
 It can be simple, brief, delivered via offline or online media,

 and crafted to attract exactly the prospect, customer, client, or patient you want.

 It can be a free report, or a checklist, or even a cheat sheet on a subject of prime interest to your preferred customer.
 The purpose for all of these is to position you and your

 company as reliable, knowledgeable, experts in your field.
 Your L
ead Generation Magnet has four main jobs:

 1. First, to generate and enhance response to

 advertising.

 2. Second, to reinforce and strengthen the prospect’s
 unhappiness with the current circumstances and

 problems he has that you can provide the solution to.

-----

###### 3. Third, to establish both your expertise and empathy.

 4. Fourth, positioning so that the prospect is
 predisposed to accept your recommendations favorably.

 In many cases, the free report is nothing more or less than a disguised, persuasive long copy sales letter, but if you called

 it that, no one would want it.
 Instead, it’s best to include legitimately valuable information. When you include such information, the prospect

 will see that you are a good source for answers to his problems, needs, and desires.

 A lot of people balk at giving away valuable information, but that’s a huge mistake. You give to get. If you don’t reveal anything of value in your L
 ead Generation Magnet, the

 prospect can assume there’s no value in your products or services either.

 Here are some examples of information-based
 Lead Generation Magnets.
 If I were a chiropractor my report might be, “Six Ways to

 Have a Pain-Free Back in Six Weeks
.” Obviously one of the six ways would involve coming into my office for an exam, and possibly treatment. The other five ways would be useful

 things the person can do on their own to relieve pain.
 If I were in real estate, my report might be, “Fourteen Little

 Known Ways to Get Top Dollar for Your Home, Even in a Tight Market
.” One of those ways would be to list the home with me, and in that section of the report I’d thoroughly describe

 all the benefits of listing with me. The other thirteen ways

-----

###### would be information about inexpensively cleaning up the

 house and yard, staging a house, writing Craigslist ads, and so on. Through these thirteen ways, I’d show off my expertise

 and know-how, and convey the difficulty of doing everything without me.

 If I were in multi-level marketing recruiting, my report

 might be titled, “Ten Best Ways to Create a Half-Million-Dollar Retirement Nest Egg, Even if Starting Late, Even with Little or

 No Money to Invest
.” The report could include information on buying real estate with no money down, on tax-sheltered savings vehicles like IRAs, on mutual funds. One of the ten

 ways would be developing a network marketing business in your spare time.

 Here are a few important writing tips.

 Avoid “me, me, me, we, we, we” speak.

 Some L
 ead Generation Magnets talk too much about the company and not enough about the prospect. He does not

 care about you, or your company per se, he only cares about the wonderful things that will happen to him as a result of

 doing business with your company. Translate every fact and feature listed in your report into a benefit. Be you-oriented, not me-oriented. Use all the data you gathered about your

 who, and talk to them in their
language and about their real probl
ems.

 Don’t overeducate.

 You want to inform and impress, but not tell everything you know. Tell people what to do, but not how to do it. Let them

 take the next step to get the exact how-tos. (In
fact
, one of

-----

###### the best responses you can get from your Lead Generation

 Magnet is “can you help me do this?”)

 Don’t forget the call to action.

 If you don’t have a call to action (CTA), you’ve wasted your

 time and money. To paraphrase Zig Ziglar, “Is your free report a sales professional, or a professional visitor?”
 Tell the prospect exactly what to do, when, why, and what

 will happen once he does. It’s helpful to offer an immediate gratification incentive for that requested action, such as a

 special bonus, or a discount. The CTA could be a number of things, depending on how complex your sales funnel needs to be.

 You could go directly for the sale of a product or service, including pricing, features, bonuses, guarantee, even a deadline.

 You could instead offer some type of consultation, with an invitation to set up an in-person call or face- to-face meeting.

 Or you could send them to a website or some other additional information resource.

 Create and use powerful titles.

 The title of your L
ead Generation Magnet is very important. Like a headline, it has to interest people enough to want it, and then motivate them to consume it when they get it.

 Take the time to create a really powerful title. Where do you get great titles? Model the attention-getting headlines you

 can find on supermarket tabloids, like
The Enquirer
, and on

-----

###### the covers of magazines like
Cosmopolitan
,
Readers Digest
,

 and others.
 These headlines have to sell those magazines off the rack. Of course, the subject matter probably won’t fit your

 business, but the structures of these headlines will.

 Making the Lead Gen offer

 Making the offer for the Lead Generation Magnet involves

 two steps:

 Step 1: Sell the prospect on getting the Lead Generation Magnet.

 Step 2: Collect contact information for use in follow up.

 (After you finish step 2, you deliver the Lead Generation

 Magnet, which leads right into the Conversion System, which I’ll discuss in the next chapter.)
 Let’s talk about step 1, which involves making a strong

 sales pitch to convince them to request the Lead Generation Magnet.

 Do NOT underestimate the difficulty in doing this, even though it’s probably something you’ll be giving away for FREE. People remain reluctant to share contact information,

 especially given the amount of unwanted SPAM they suspect will come their way, as well as privacy concerns.

 So you need to very clearly make the case why your Lead Generation Magnet will solve a specific problem, heal a burning pain point, or address a real heart-felt concern

 they’re dealing with.

-----

###### Your options for your Lead Generation Magnet are many and varied:

 Business card

 Postcard

 Phone script

 Website

 Facebook/YouTube/Social Media

 Banner ad

 Valpak insert

 TV or Radio commercial

 Email

 Speaking

 You can (and should) offer your Lead Generation Magnet

 anywhere and everywhere.
 If you do so in person, it’s easy—just get the prospect’s business card or contact info. Then send them the Lead

 Generation Magnet. Over the phone, just write it down. You can also drive people to an 800 number with a recorded

 message and have them leave their info there. While this may sound old school, it remains quite effective, especially when dealing with target markets that skew older.

 A client of mine with one of the most productive lead generation ad campaigns on radio nationwide instructs

 listeners to call a voicemail number and leave their email address. Then he’ll send them his free report, which has a

-----

###### sexy, exciting title, and promise of interest to his target market.

 Don’t miss that point—your Lead Generation Magnet needs to sound sexy, exciting, informative—the magic pill to cure

 whatever ails you. The ad copy used to promote it likewise has to frame its benefits and value with powerful, emotional language. The Lead Generation Magnet offers transformation,

 pure and simple, and anyone would be a fool not to take advantage of it and now.
 One of the primary mechanisms today for collecting

 contact information is online with a dedicated, simple webpage called a landing page or squeeze page.

 You probably already have a big, fat, catchall site that has a mountain of content on it.
 If you’re going to do lead generation, you should not send

 prospects into that. Instead, send them to a very simple landing page that works just like a clerk answering the phone.

 The landing page or squeeze page is very, very simple. This is where you’re going to capture the person’s contact information who has come to your website from one of your

 lead generation pieces.
 The website is simple because the only reason they’re

 coming to it is to give you their contact information in exchange for your Lead Generation Magnet, so that’s all you want to show them. It doesn’t include any kind of navigation

 options or a menu bar with “Home,” “About,” etc. so they can’t get lost someplace else on your website. The only

 purpose of this page is to collect contact information so you

-----

###### can send them your Lead Generation Magnet, and then follow up.

 You’re not trying to build a brand. Not trying to entertain or inform. You’re not trying to get likes, or anything like that— although those are not inherently bad. What you are trying to

 do, and what you want to measure, is to get the people who do show up to give you their contact information. That is the

 one and only goal of your landing page.
 Once you have their information, you send them your Lead Generation Magnet and then put them into your Magnetic

 Conversion System.

 IT’S ALL ABOUT MAGNETIC ATTRACTION

 This chapter should make 100 percent clear what I mean by

 Magnetically Attracting leads as opposed to chasing them.
 Yes, you lay out the offer of a Lead Generation Magnet—the

 free report, the information kit, DVD, audio, checklist, etc.—to everyone in your WHO that you can. But it’s not chasing, it’s simply laying it out there to see if anyone’s interested enough

 to step out of the pack and raise their hand.
 By doing so, you’ve enticed them to take that very first

 step on their own. They’ve crossed the first threshold barrier. It’s a tiny step to be sure, but it’s an important one. They’ve said YES for the first time about something you have to offer.

 Now it’s up to you to build upon that momentum in your Magnetic Conversion System.

-----

###### CHAPTER 8
#### YOUR MAGNETIC CONVERSION SYSTEM

-----

###### Now that you have gotten your prospect to raise their hand,
 it’s time to fire up your Magnetic Conversion System
—the goal of which is to turn them from someone

 who is merely interested into a paying customer.
 The diagram below shows the different elements of the

 Conversion System:

 It’s important to note that it’s up to YOU to define exactly how configure this system. The different components, each of

 which I’ll describe on the following pages, can be mixed and matched and sequenced in different ways.
 The key, however, is to implement SOMETHING. Far too

 many businesses totally drop the ball when it comes to following up with leads who have already made it clear, either

 through action or communication, that they’re interested in what you have to offer. It boggles the mind—you’ve paid good money for inventory, rent, power, licensing, website hosting,

 advertising and more, yet you’re willing to watch all that go down the drain by failing to follow up.

 Indeed, this should inspire you because by putting this Conversion System in place in your business, you will literally create an unfair advantage over your competition, who

-----

###### almost certainly won’t do anything anywhere close to
, or as

 detailed, or as systematic.
 All the components of the system are based on one

 overriding principle:

#### “Show Up Like No One Else.”

###### For just a second, let’s go back to that question I said you should ask yourself when creating your Unique Selling

 Proposition (USP). Do you recall? It goes like this:
 “Why should I choose to do business with you versus any and every other option available to me in your category?”

 This is such a powerful question and you HAVE to be able to answer it in every communication you make with future and

 even current clients. Because as they say, every horse eventually goes lame— you can’t simply assume that just because you’ve convinced someone to buy from you once

 they’ll continue along that path forever. You constantly have to provide a good answer to that question throughout the

 entire customer life cycle.
 Therefore, your goal in your Conversion System, is to show up like nobody else. Stick out like a sore thumb among the

 tens of thousands of sales messages bombarding your prospects every day. And when you show up at the door—

 standing out from the semi-washed competitive masses—you arrive not only looking like something truly special, but you bring heightened value that’s clearly different.

 It’s important to understand that the higher up the income ladder you go, people will pay more for WHO you are rather

 than WHAT you do. The WHAT of what you do can easily be

-----

###### turned into a commodity. But WHO you are is unique—there’s

 only one, and therefore the value is established accordingly.
 Showing up like no one else reinforces that fact, which is

 why it must stay top of mind through all your communications as a Magnetic Marketer.
 Let’s talk about a few ways to do just that.

 MULTISTEP CAMPAIGN

 Most people’s marketing is not very sophisticated at all. Here’s what it looks like. Print up a brochure. A lot of them.

 Put them in a burlap sack. Rent a plane. Fly low. Shake sack. Hope.

 We can do better. What we want to do is identify a small, carefully selected, manageable target market and set out to become the

 dominant presence in that target market in as short a period of time as possible.

 Why small? The biggest marketing mistake most businesses make is marketing too big. I’ll ask, “What’s your target market?” “Detroit.” “Well, if we send one postcard to

 every adult who lives in the greater Detroit area once a year, which can hardly be called an intensive campaign, what’s our budget got to be?” The guy says, “$300,000.” “How much

 you got to spend?” “$600.”
 How’s that going to work out?

 Point being, you instead need to shrink the size of your target market to whatever resources you’re willing and able to commit to allow you to have big impact. And here’s the

 secret to that: if you want impact and you want response
,

-----

###### then you must have repetition. They are inextricably linked.

 But you can’t afford to do what Madison Avenue wants you to do—spend huge dollars on TV ads that play 24/7—and maybe someday respond. That’s not the answer.

 The answer is
a series of communications
—they could be letters, they could be emails, they could be postcards, they

 could be a blend—that take place over a short period of time, each one
re-iterating your offer and call-to-action.
 There’s magic in the multi-step structure. I’d like to claim

 credit for its invention, but the truth of the matter is I modeled it nearly fifty years ago. In one year, I managed to

 have two cars repossessed and I went personally and corporately bankrupt. I got it all over in one year.
 During that year, I became intimately familiar with the

 collection industry and I had a lot of time on my hands. I noticed a pattern, which I’ll describe to you. It’s first notice,

 second notice, third notice. They’re typically fifteen days apart, although you don’t have to adhere to that timing. Each one clearly refers to the previous one they sent you. We call

 that linkage. There’s no mystery in that they’re writing to you frequently. They get a little tougher as they go along. And the last one generally has copies of everything else they sent

 previously, rubber-stamped “Final Notice.”
 I said to myself, “If that will get money from people who

 haven’t got any, offering them nothing, I wonder what would happen if we tried it on people who do have some
money and offered them something of value.”

 This has turned out to be one of my most reliable
Magnetic Marketing
structures, which is why
it has become the staple

-----

###### of the Magnetic Conversion system.

 ADDING MORE CREDIBILITY WITH CONTENT

 A simple three-step sequence works great for many products and markets. But there are times when you need to extend

 the sales timeline to increase your authority and credibility. In cases like these, you probably want to consider bolstering your positioning by following up on the initial
Lead Generation

 Magnet with additional, related content.
 This strategy is done quite often when launching a brand
 new product or service. The initial L
ead Generation Mag
net might be a video training, which is then followed up by a series of additional videos on that same topic. But you don’t

 have to limit yourself to videos, you can follow up with any number of things, such as emails, reports, online assessments, even books.

 When doing this kind of extended campaign, it’s typical to hold off on asking for the sale up until the very end. Up to

 that point, you continue to provide valuable insights and each new piece of content ends with a “stay tuned for coming attractions” message.

 The final piece of content is where you would make your real call to action—laying out all the critical elements of your

 offer, features, benefits, pricing, guarantee, etc.

 BLOWING THEM AWAY WITH “SHOCK AND AWE”

 A related idea is to bundle a bunch of perceived “high value”

 content items into a single package and then deliver them all at once in what’s been called a “Shock and Awe” package.

-----

###### The name is derived from the 1992 Gulf War, when US forces overwhelmed Saddam Hussein’s military with

 overwhelming force. The objective with your Marketing “Shock and Awe” is likewise to overwhelm the prospect with

 overwhelming
 evidence that you are indeed head-and- shoulders above any other competitor.
 Your Shock and Awe package could include:

 Consumer Report Guide(s): Reports written by you to position you as the expert that you are.

 CD/DVD
’s: Audio and/or video
of interviews, guest

 appearances, podcasts, presentations, case studies, testimonials, etc. (anything showcasing authority and expertise).

 Printed Special Report(s):
Reports that are relevant

 to your message and/or the prospects challenges.

 Newsletters: Back copies of your monthly newsletter.

 Articles or press releases: Anything you have written

 or has been written about you.

 Self-Assessment and Score Analysis Tool

 Testimonials: Anything and everything anyone as ever said about you, showing overwhelming proof

 that you are the only choice they should be going with.

 Lead Generation Book (authored by you)

 And don’t limit your thinking to just serious “information”—

 you can include cookies, candy, toys, t-shirts, and so on. One

-----

###### previous client in the electronics industry, sent as a step in his conversion funnel, a briefcase with a video player built in,

 as well as a fresh King Cake from New Orleans. A cover letter inside recommended that the prospect watch the video (which
 offered the service quite nicely) while enjoying a

 delicious piece of cake.
 Now THAT made an impact. That is how you show up like

 nobody else.
 You’ll definitely want to include at least some item with your
Call To Action
, which could lead to either a direct sale

 or to an in-person meeting.

 SELLING A CONSULTATION VERSUS A DIRECT SALE OFFER

 Most of what we’ve discussed so far in the Conversion System

 is based on the idea of using all these components to lead up to a direct sale for your product or service. The power of building this out into a sequential step-by-step process, with

 the
Lead Generation Magnet at the very beginning leading to one after the other, is that it creates a foundation for the prospect saying “YES” through an ongoing series of micro
 agreements.

 Prospect says YES to the L
ead Generation Magnet.

 Then says YES to opening a follow up email and

 watching an online video.

 Then says YES to taking an assessment sent in the mail.

 Then says YES to reading a book sent to his home.

-----

###### And so on and so on.

 All these YES agreements build on one another, leading the prospect to feel more and more in agreement with what you

 have to say and offer. So when the final call-to-action appears, they have established the habit of saying YES to

 what you put before them. Of course, this doesn’t guarantee the sale, but it absolutely makes it much more likely. People want to believe they behave with consistency. If you can get

 them to consistently say YES, you have started the ball rolling in the right direction.

 However, in many industries, the actual sale can’t be closed without first “selling” the prospect on agreeing to attend some kind of in-person consultation or meeting.

 Typical examples could include financial advisors, insurance agents, realtors, cosmetic dentists, copywriters, IT

 consultants, and so forth.
 In these kinds of scenarios, you’re using components of your Conversion System to lead directly to accepting that

 Consultation Meeting—and this could involve the multistep campaign, shock and awe box, ongoing content, etc.

 The Consultation is where you—one-on-one—work with the prospect through their specific situation and craft the appropriate solution to meet their needs. The Call To Action at

 the end would be to sign the contract, the check, and close the deal.

 If the deal does NOT close, you do NOT give up. Instead, you continue moving forward with whatever components of the Conversion System you deem necessary,

-----

###### which again, can include MORE content, MORE shock and awe, and MORE multistep campaigns of email/direct mail/postcards/etc.

 How long should you keep this up? As the old saying goes, “until they buy or die.”
Now, once

 someone does become a customer, client or patient, we don’t want our magnetic attraction to fade. For this reason, we continue with the Magnetic Retention System.

-----

Reprinted from the No B.S. Marketing Letter September 2015

###### CHAPTER 9
#### YOUR MAGNETIC RETENTION SYSTEM

-----

###### This is the part of the puzzle that no one does.
The part

 that can quickly and easily turn one client into two, thus doubling the value of every new client. And the best part is it’s the easiest system to implement in your business.

 One of the most important keys to maximum customer value is in retention and repeat business. That is not

 something you’re “entitled to” as a result of your excellent products and quality service—although that doesn’t hurt in the least.

 Instead, it’s a result of careful, strategic marketing, which includes continuing to market to them in a systematic way,

 not taking them for granted and communicating again and again in a magnetically attractive manner.

 This requires frequently having and presenting a good answer to the question that is so important to us that it’s become part of our vernacular. It’s how we greet each other. That

 question is,
 “What’s new?”

 I don’t say, “Tell me everything that’s the same as it was the last time I saw you three months ago.” I’m not interested in that. I’m interested in “What’s new.”

 If you don’t have a good answer to “What’s new?” they go looking for it somewhere else. A bored customer goes

 elsewhere. They forget about you. They don’t talk about you. They don’t buy from you and they are easily wooed by some

-----

###### competitor who comes along with something that’s new and

 exciting.
 How do you answer this question that is always on their minds? And how do you do it consistently and repetitively, so

 they are always intrigued by you?
 The answer to this question is by frequently and continually reinventing your business inside your business, by inventing

 new widgets and offering those new widgets through constant communication with your past and present customers.

 At least once a month, if not more often, they are hearing from you and they are getting a new widget offered to them.
 That will keep customers interested and engaged, allowing

 you to sell to them more frequently, and having more customers refer more often.

 Point is, your complete Magnetic Marketing System
should incorporate what, in direct marketing lingo, is called “Front- end and back-end”

 Front-end
refers to outreach to attract and acquire new leads, new potential customers and new

 customers.

 Back-end
means developing and retaining those customers, increasing the frequency of repeat business you do with them, cross selling different

 products and services, putting fresh offers in front of them frequently, staying interesting to them so they

 stay with you and tell others about you.

-----

###### How do you do that? There are two ways to include in every magnetic retention system:

#### 1. CUSTOMER NEWSLETTERS

###### Every business should have some kind of customer newsletter that—at a minimum—hits their doorstep once a

 month. Preferably it would be a real, printed newsletter.
 Why?

 First off, it has a higher perceived value—a physical newsletter looks like it has more value than an email. Secondly, it’s more likely to get consumed. An email—maybe

 it’ll get opened, maybe not. But if you get something in the mail that you have to open up and look at, and it’s at least

 minimally fun and interesting, then it’s far more likely to get read and possibly even retained.
 And that brings up the third reason a real life, honest to

 gosh print newsletter has value—if they keep it around, it lingers as an ongoing reminder of your existence. You’re no

 longer a memory of some service once rendered, a product once acquired. You’re there on the file cabinet letting me know that you cared enough to take the effort to send me

 something new rather than discard all memory of me to the dustbin of history.
 Your monthly client newsletter should include:

 Content that re-affirms your uniqueness (remember that USP?) and authority in your business area of

 expertise. But keep this minimal, as little as absolutely necessary. (For heaven’s sake, do NOT

-----

###### make your entire newsletter about your industry. Nobody wants to hear about “the latest oil filter

 interface to the internet of things” from their local Qwik Lube oil change place.) Instead, you want to continue the conversation that you know they are

 having in their heads—continue to talk about problems you know that they have. For instance, I

 know that business owners who are looking to solve marketing problems are intrigued by time management strategies, ways to outsource

 successfully, and are looking for reassurance that they are not strange and different for their beliefs

 about money and capitalism. All of those have very little to do with marketing solutions, but everything to do with the people that I am talking to.

 Content that’s fun for the sake of being fun—puzzles, brainteasers, jokes, recipes, cartoons, funny “memes,” light hearted fodder that offers some

 entertainment value—you want your customers to look forward to this every month. Puzzles and brainteaser are also what we call enticement

 devices. Meaning that your newsletter will have staying power while they are engaged with it.

 In line with “what’s new?” some kind of call to action

 for your latest widget. You are in business after all and you want to constantly remind customers that

 you offer valuable goods and services that will make their lives better. This is a great place to offer your

-----

###### newest consumer report or special report on a newsworthy topic that is plaguing them.

 And finally, personality. When you create a bond with

 your customers, they are less likely to choose another provider over you, because you have become a friend. Your newsletter allows you to

 continue your relationships. By telling stories and sharing what is happening in your life, you let your

 customers bond with you.

 And one the best reasons for doing all you can to retain customers, clients, or patients is to get them to refer you to

 their friends, family, and colleagues.

#### 2. REFERRALS / WORD OF MOUTH

###### Word-of-mouth marketing is the most powerful and beneficial

 kind of advertising or marketing that you could ever have for a business for the very simple reason of what others say

 about you is ten times more believable than what you say about yourself.
 Way back when Anaheim, California was still a swamp, Walt

 Disney wrote a marketing principle that was taught to everybody involved with Disney and it is a wonderful

 principle. It says:

#### “The way to be very successful in marketing is to do what you do so well

 that people can’t resist telling others
 about you.”

-----

###### So one of the things you have to be continually asking yourself about your own business is:

#### How can we do what it is that we do
 here so well that people can’t resist
 telling others about us?

###### For example, when a patient comes in the door, do you teach

 your staff not to sit behind the desk and kind of look up at them and grunt and hand them paperwork to fill out?

 Instead, your staff should stand up, come out from around the counter, shake the patient’s hand, and say: “Hi, Mr. Patient, welcome to X, Y, Z, clinic,” or “Hi, Mr. Patient, good to

 see you today. How are you feeling?”
 Then walk that patient through a greeting process unlike

 any other doctor’s office he’s ever gone to—in fact, it’s unlike how he’s treated anywhere else he goes to.
 And a lot of those little things added together now result in

 what we call the wow experience. This person leaves your office and thinks to himself:

 “Wow, I’ve got to tell somebody. This is the most interesting, amazing, best thing that’s happened to me all day!”

 (This relates to the “show up like no one else” principle, only it’s embraced throughout your entire business, not just

 during conversion.)
 And when you can create that for your customers, you know when they leave your place of business they’re

 thinking: “Gee, I was feeling kind of down when I came in

-----

###### here, but this is the best thing that’s happened to me all day.

 This is just wonderful.”
 And they run into their next door neighbor when they’re

 now at home and they’re going to tell them about you.
 If you do that, they’re going to spread the word without you even having to ask, and that has immense power.

 When we earn this level of enthusiasm from our customers —by blowing them away with service, quality, the whole

 shebang, way beyond what they ever expected—we do indeed earn the right to ask. And it’s amazing to me how many business people just never, in any way, shape or form,

 ask their customers or clients for referrals.
 I grew up in direct sales, selling in the home, face-to-face

 with moms and dads. I was taught and beat over the head with a very simple mechanism: as soon as you make a sale, you put a card or a form and a pen in front of your customer

 and you said something to the effect of:
 “You know, most of my customers come to me as referrals

 from satisfied customers like you. And I’ll bet you know five or six people probably who live right here in the neighborhood who would love to have whatever it was that I was selling just

 like you got. And I would be eternally grateful if you would let me use your name when I gave them a call to set up an

 appointment. And if you would take time right now to get your Christmas card book out or you know your personal phone book and just give me those five names and

 addresses, I’d really appreciate it.”
 And nine times out of ten, I’d walk out of that house maybe

 not with five, but with three or four good solid names,

-----

###### addresses and telephone numbers and most of them would

 turn into appointments and some of them would turn into sales.

 Now, I learned that discipline when I was a pup and I am always amazed at how many salespeople don’t use it and how many business owners don’t use it. A print shop owner

 should be asking for referrals. A dress shop owner should be asking for referrals. A hair salon/stylist should be asking for

 referrals.
 When do you ask for referrals? Right after you’ve done something praiseworthy for your customer. Like when

 somebody comes in to pick up their job at the print shop and says:
 “Boy, this is great,” or “I really appreciate you bailing me

 out and getting this done overnight!”
 That’s the time for you to say something like: “Hey, you

 know, we’re trying to grow the business here, we’re taking on some new equipment and you know we really depend on clients like you for referrals. I wonder if you would just take a

 few of your business cards and jot down on the back of each one the name and the phone numbers of a few people that I

 can call and talk to.”
 And when you ask, you get. Here’s perfect proof of this. One of the most challenging

 groups I’ve found to convince to do referrals are chiropractors. For some reason, they seemed to have a hang

 up about this. Even so, we devised a plan.
 They offered a back care class in their clinic that all the patients come to in a group and then they teach them about

-----

###### their back and how to take care of themselves. We came up

 with a very simple mechanism where at the end of the class the doctor essentially says:
 “Oh, by the way, many of you got here as a result of being

 referred by somebody who cared enough about you to refer you, and that’s how we get most of our new patients. We

 would really appreciate it if you would refer others, too. And for that reason, I am passing out these forms.”
 They passed out these little forms which have places for

 ten names, addresses and telephone numbers. And they asked them to fill them out and they’re going to send them

 some introductory information about chiropractic.
 Now, they did that very fast and it’s a very soft request. It is very painless. It’s done at the end of the class, so if

 somebody doesn’t want to do it, it is easy for them to just leave the form on their chair and sneak out of the office.

 Guess what happens? Seven out of ten patients fill out the form, turn in the form with somewhere between three and ten names and addresses and telephone numbers. Costs nothing

 to get those names, addresses and telephone numbers.
 Of course, then those names, addresses and telephone

 numbers get plugged into the three-step campaign system and one-third of them become new patients.
 All from the power of simply asking for referrals.

###### CHAPTER 10
#### APPLYING THE MAGNETIC MARKETING
 SYSTEMS

-----

###### I want to share with you a story that illustrates how a very common business owner could take everything we have discussed so far and put it into their own

 Magnetic Marketing System.
It’s really important that you go through it carefully. Here’s why:

 First of all, it takes everything we talked about so far and a few things we didn’t, and stitches them together in chronological application order, so you

 see how they work.

 Secondly, it does it in a real-life business. This is a true-life example.

 Third, it does it in a business where most of you

 would never expect to find good marketing, thereby demonstrating if this guy can do it, you can do it too.

 Fourth, it gives you a complete marketing strategy, a

 step-by-step system, that you can use exactly as it is described to you in this story and see results in your bank account in twenty-one days or less.

 And there’s a bonus. It gives you a new market, a farm, a group of prospects perfect for you, which you already have access to but are not currently

 harvesting.

 For it to do all of those things, every little nuance is important, you will want to pay close attention.

 One day, in the mail, I get an envelope. The envelope is addressed to me, Mr. Dan Kennedy. It has a real live stamp on

 it. And in the return address corner is the name of someone I

-----

###### know, a colleague in business who also lived in my hometown.

The takeaway for you is the envelope is from someone whose name I
recognize. It’s addressed to me. And it’s got a real postage stamp on it. Not
“bulk rate”—a stamp. What I’ve just described to you is one almost certain
way to get an envelope opened. It’s not the only way. Sometimes it’s not the
best way in a given situation, but it is a very good way.

###### So I open it. The letter headline says, “I suppose you’re

 wondering why I’m writing to you about a plumber.” I say to myself, “Yup, what’s is this all about?”

Second takeaway. If you want to make your marketing work, write down, “Got
to get them to open it, got to get them to read it.” And you’ve got about ten
seconds from flap to trash to compel readership. Curiosity is one way to do it.
Not necessarily the best, but it’s the way that was used here. (By the way, it’s
exactly the same with email. You need have a great subject line if you want
people to open and read your emails.)

###### The letter goes on to tell a story about how my colleague was having a party at his home on a Friday evening to which I had not been invited, and at about nine o’clock at night, a pipe in

 the den under the bar began to spew water everywhere.
 A horrible mess.

 He had to find a plumber who would come out on a Friday night at nine. Made calls out of the phone book, finally found this guy, Al the plumber, who rushed out, gooped this,

 tightened that, didn’t have to sell him any parts. He had the whole mess cleaned up in under twenty minutes and only

 charged him a small amount of money.
 And in order to say thank you to this plumber for this extraordinary service he decided to send this letter to all of

-----

###### us, his colleagues who live in town, and let us all know that if

 we ever need a plumber, Al’s the guy we’ve got to call.

There’s more you have to know about the Al story. But a major money-making
thing just happened. It’s called a champion circle of influence
. Everybody has
a circle of influence in which you could do business if you were properly
introduced, but you haven’t been.

###### The plumber goes back to the customer and says, “You know, when I was here the other night, you were very grateful and I

 appreciate that. What you probably don’t know is we get very little of our new business the way we got you, from advertising. We get most of our new customers through

 people like you, because you probably belong to something. You belong to Rotary?” “No.”

 “Country Club?” “No.” “Homeowners association?” “No.” “Well, everybody belongs to something.”

 The guy confesses. He says, “Well, there is this speakers’ association I belong to.”
 “Great! How many of those are there in Phoenix?” “Three

 hundred.” The plumber says, “Terrific. Here’s what I’d like to do.” Here’s the second thing. The plumber says, “Here’s what

 I’d like to do. I wrote up what you said to me as I left, now as a letter from you to those three hundred people. We can change anything you want to change. But then I want to take

 it and I want to put it on your stationery. Again, not mine, yours. I want to put it in your envelopes. Not mine, yours. And

 I want to send it to those three hundred people who know you by name but do not yet know me. I pay for everything. May I do that?”

-----

That’s called an endorsed mailing to a champion circle of influence. It’s the
only piece of mail on the planet that will 100 percent get opened and 100
percent get read.

###### So I got the envelope, opened the envelope, and read the whole letter.

 And when I got all done with it, I didn’t call Al the plumber. Why didn’t I call Al the plumber? Right, because I didn’t

 need a plumber, sure. So all that’s wasted, isn’t it?
 Wrong. If he stops there, it’s a giant epic waste.

 Think of what has to happen now for it to turn into business for the plumber. I got the letter and read it. Al sounds like a

 pretty good guy. But I don’t need a plumber.
 But for this to work for Al, I’d have to make eighteen copies of this letter, then get eighteen zip-lock sandwich bags and

 eighteen pieces of duct tape, because he’s got eighteen pipes. I’d have to put a letter in each bag, then I’d have to go around and stick one to every pipe so someday when I DO

 need a plumber, I can find this guy.
 This is no way to get a flood of business.

 That’s why, about ten days later, I get what I would call letter number one from Al the plumber.
 “Hi, I’m Al the plumber. You remember me? I’m the guy

 your friend wrote to you about, who had the party you weren’t invited to, who had the leak I rushed out and took

 care of. Now the reason I’m writing you now is we have this very important free thing we do only for people referred to us for our VIP customers. That free thing is a free home

 plumbing problem-prevention audit. And the reason why it’s

-----

###### so important for you to have a free home plumbing

 prevention audit is every home ten years old or older has at least one hundred horrible plumbing problems that could occur at a moment’s notice. And we come out and make sure

 none of those things are about to happen to you, for free.”

Notice what Al’s just done—he’s using his “Free Home Plumbing ProblemPrevention Audit” as a Lead Generation Magnet to get me to raise my hand
and invite him to provide further information. Yes, it’s a consultation, but
because he’s already established credibility through the endorsed mailing
from my buddy, the threshold barrier’s been lowered enough to go with this
as a first step. Of course, Al could’ve offered instead a more standard LGM
like a report, “100 Horrible Plumbing Disasters Just Waiting to Destroy Your
Home and How to Prevent Them—Guaranteed!” in his system. Again, in this
situation the audit works just fine.

###### I still don’t call Al the plumber.
 Now I’m hearing drips in the night I wasn’t hearing before,

 but I still don’t call Al.
 That’s why ten days later, Al the plumber, sends me a second notice.

 “Hi, I’m Al the plumber. You remember me? I’m the guy your friend wrote to you about, had the party you weren’t

 invited to, had the leak. I wrote to you about our free home plumbing problem-prevention audit. I haven’t heard from you and I’m very concerned. If you’ll take a look at the enclosed

 article reprint, you’ll see why.”
 And I take this article reprint out of the envelope. It’s from a

 small community newspaper. Everybody knows everybody. They only publish once a week. Here’s a front-page story about this couple, elderly couple. They went away just for the

 weekend to visit the grandkids, a little drip under the sink

-----

###### when they left. They put a little Tupperware bowl under there to catch it.

 They come back on Monday. And in the article, there’s a photograph of the house in five parts floating in a pond.

 There’s another photograph of the family dog clinging to a piece of wood, waiting to be rescued.
 I go back to the letter and it says,

 “As you can see, even small plumbing problems can become big plumbing problems at a moment’s notice.”

 I still don’t call Al the plumber. But now I’m going through the basement looking at pipes and thinking, “They look okay to me.”

 Ten days later, Al the plumber sends the his third “final notice” letter:

 “Dan, we’ve twice offered you our free home plumbing problem-prevention audit. We haven’t heard from you, but we sure have heard from a whole lot of other smart folks. That’s

 why if you want the free home plumbing problem-prevention audit, it’s very important you call within the next seventy-two

 hours. Otherwise, we may have to put you on a waiting list of up to one hundred days. And enclosed is a list of some of the horrible plumbing problems that may occur during…”

 I call Al the plumber.

Now, I’m going to tell you the rest of the Al story in a second, but first let’s do
some quick analysis. Al the plumber did everything we’ve talked about
brilliantly. Let’s analyze his marketing campaign.

Al the plumber, our marketing genius, goes and he gets himself a small,
carefully-selected, manageable target market. His is his champions circle of
influence
, one of the most productive farms you’ll ever own.

-----

The first seed he plants in his farm is the endorsed mailing, the only piece of
mail that 100 percent gets delivered, 100 percent gets opened, 100 percent
gets read.

He then kicks off his campaign with a sequence of communications.

He creates a Lead Generation Magnet, which is the offer of a free in-home
plumbing audit.

He continues to pound this offer, referencing prior mailings, adding urgency
with a final notice.

He did everything we talked about brilliantly.

And if a plumber can do it, you can do it too.

Now let’s talk about showing up like no one else.

###### Al arrives at my home, virtually no resemblance to what I expect when I think “plumber.” He’s not wearing work
 clothes, he’s not carrying a tool box.
 Al the plumber is in a three-piece suit, freshly pressed white

 shirt, quality tie, and shined shoes. He’s carrying a brown calf- skin attaché case.
 The only resemblance between this business executive and

 a plumber is on the breast pocket of his suit coat, there’s a cloth patch sewn on that says, “Al.”

 He comes into the house, he opens up his attaché case, takes out a matching clipboard.
 “Mr. Kennedy, as you can see, this is the form I’m going to

 use to check the one hundred possible plumbing problems. It takes me about twenty minutes to do that. While I do that, do

 you have a DVD player? You need to watch this DVD.”
 I watch the DVD which talks about one of the greatest health care crises in America today.

-----

###### Seems an alarming number of us seasoned citizens are falling and slipping in our bathtubs. Serious injuries, breaking

 hips. It turns out they’ve got this invisible glop that replaces bathmats forever, one-time application. Nothing to clean, and you’ll never slip and fall. A lifetime warranty.

 The video clicks off in nineteen minutes. And as it does, Al is standing there.

 Obviously, Al has done this before. “Mr. Kennedy, I have very good news for you. You do not have ninety-six of the most common household plumbing

 problems. The ones you do have are very trivial. I have everything with me to take care of them today. I just need to

 go out and get some work clothes and get some tools. While I do that, did you watch the DVD?”
 Yep, I watched it.

 “I noticed you have five baths. You have one in the master suite, then you have these other four. While I’m here today, shall we just protect the one in the master suite or shall we

 protect all of them?”
 $389 later, Al the plumber gets in his new Lexus and drives

 away.
 I was intrigued so I called him a few days later, “Look, I didn’t want to bother you when you were out at the house

 working. I know that’s rude. But I teach Magnetic Marketing systems and you used one of them brilliantly. I wonder if

 you’d mind sharing the numbers?”
 Al says, “Not at all, I’ll just have to put you on hold and get the project file.”

-----

###### I’m now on hold, listening to a recorded commercial for his brother’s pool cleaning service. When that’s over, he’s back.
 “What would you like to know?”

 “How many homes did you mail to?” “About three hundred.”

 “How many of those home problem-prevention audit things have you done so far?”
 “Seventy-two.”

 Do the math, if you wish. Assume no one but me gave him money immediately. A poor assumption on your part, but

 make it if you wish.
 For the price of three hundred letters times three, he’s been in seventy-two homes where he’s put on a show and a

 half.
 When they need a plumber, who are they going to call?

 To make sure, at every place there’s a pipe, there’s a sticker.
 Of course Al’s newsletter “Plumber’s Helper” arrives within

 the week.
 Again… who are they going to call?

 You get the picture. THAT is how you work the Magnetic Marketing System
, soup to nuts. And if a business like a plumber could do it, it’s

 a pretty sure bet your business can do so as well.

 NOW IT’S UP TO YOU

##### — Yogi Berra

###### There are three steps to positive change:

 1. Awareness

 2. Decision

 3. Action

 With this book, I have provided Awareness .
There is a better, more productive, more differentiated approach to growing a business by applied attraction rather than by pursuit; by focused targeted marketing rather than mud- against-wall and hope; and by and organized system rather than random and erratic acts.

 Now you face a Decision that is entirely yours to make. The legendary attorney Gerry Spence almost always closed his ending speech to juries by telling an old, old parable about the wise man and the smart-aleck boy. The wise elder made himself available every Saturday for the villagers to line up and ask for his advice. The boy resented his authority, and developed a plan to humiliate “Mr. Know It All.” The boy captured a small bird and concealed it in his hands, and stood before the wise man and asked if the bird in his hands was alive? Or was it dead? If the wise man said “Alive,” the boy intended to quickly crush it to death and let it fall to the ground. If the wise man said “Dead,” the boy would open his hands and let it fly free. But the wise man proved truly wise with his answer: “Son, that bird is in
your
hands.”

 Whether you end with having read this book, nodded in places, wished you could remake your business to be

 “magnetic” but default to continuing to conduct business just as you do now and as your competitors do—or
you can take

 the next steps to a road less traveled with great potential—is

###### entirely in your
 hands. Frankly, the person who reads but

 does act is no better off than the illiterate dunce who cannot read. The person who endlessly procrastinates and excuses

 himself from decisive action is no better than the somnambulant sloth.
 The road to ruin is paved with good intentions. And, as an

 old saying goes, “if wishes were horses, every man afoot would ride.
 ” Creative, constructive Action is what actually

 brings about positive change.

 There is good news about Action.
 Business today is complicated. It is easy to feel overwhelmed. Are you too busy just making a living to make any real money? Or a better life? That is understandable but should be unacceptable. So, that is where the organization built around The Magnetic Marketing System® can step in, step up, and work right alongside you in implementing a series of dramatic breakthroughs. Those next steps are offered on the very next page.

 You can soon own a fully functional business and profit

 building SYSTEM of your own… or

hands.
