Find new, different, and better ways to be of service to your customers. More and more, people want things done for them. Home Depot went through an evolutionary metamorphosis from being all about do-it-yourself to promoting a wide range of done-for-you services, from carpet installation to kitchen remodeling. A concierge approach is taking hold in many businesses—if we don’t do it, we’ll get it done for you. The auto repair shop that takes care of my three classic cars as well as my regular automobile not only picks them up and brings them back and provides a loaner when needed, but they take care of required emission checks, get my license plates renewed, provide required photos and information to insurers, and arrange for rental of winter storage space in heated garages. Whatever my need related to things with four wheels, they are my go-to guys. In my book No B.S. Business Success in the New Economy, I expound on this as entrepreneurial, miniconglomerate strategy, and as a pathway to synergistic alliances and joint ventures with other noncompeting and complementary business owners.

 4. Tie into Trends and News Events

 Get involved with what people are thinking and talking about. One of the great direct-response copywriters of all time, Robert Collier, talked about “entering the conversation already taking place in the prospect’s mind.” This is a powerful strategy, requiring considerable insight and understanding of your market, awareness of what’s going on in their lives and in the news, and opportunistic action.

 When Bill Gates came under attack by the government for monopolistic, unfair business practices, and every day’s news was reporting on that, one of my clients alertly added copy to his ads, sales letters, and faxes talking about how using his product would give your business such an unfair advantage you’d destroy and dominate your competitors just like Bill Gates, but without having to testify or pay huge fines. Response to his advertising went up by nearly 50 percent.

##### This Vioxx ad was furnished to pharmacies all across America by our long-time Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Member Lester Nathan immediately after the prescription drug for arthritis Vioxx was withdrawn from the market. To his credit, he acted fast. The ad was running in newspapers nationwide within thirty-six hours of the drug recall, selling his alternative health product as a substitute. Had he chosen to, he could have used this as a basis for news releases sent and free advertising obtained, putting himself forward to talk about the dangers of drugs and the virtues of natural and homeopathic remedies.

 You undoubtedly communicate with your customers and, hopefully, prospects by e-mail and via social media, but to keep regrabbing their interest, the trick is to have “breaking” news. One of the great ad men of all time, David Ogilvy, said that all great advertising has, at its core, news. This is a pathway to breaking news day by day, daily if need be, to keep the heat on.

 5. Tie into Seasons and Holidays

 Again, get involved with what people are thinking and talking about. Nothing is more frequently, consistently, and reliably on the minds of more people than the next upcoming holiday. Some of the basic holidays and seasons are listed here, but this is barely scratching the surface. There are thousands of official holidays and special weeks: Nurses’ Week, National Celebration of Squirrels Day, Ice Cream Sundae Week, and on and on and on. Virtually every industry has one or many. Our Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Members do such an outstanding job at this, we publish a complete Holiday Promotions Manual featuring their actual marketing campaigns from a diverse variety of businesses.

 As you can see, there’s hardly a week that goes by that you can’t be starting, in the throes of, or winding up a seasonal or holiday-related promotion for your business.

 6. Tie into Movies and Entertainment Events

 An awful lot of water cooler and coffee klatch conversation has to do with the TV shows of the night before, the movies seen over the weekend, and gossip about celebrities.

-----

##### For clients of mine, we’ve tied ad campaigns, marketing, and publicity efforts to a wide variety of TV and movie properties, from Desperate Housewives to the latest James Bond movie. NAPMA, the National Association of Professional Martial Artists, coordinates brilliant promotional campaigns for its member academies and schools with virtually every kid- and family-oriented martial arts movie that gets to theaters. Kung Fu Panda provided an enormous opportunity, and as I’m writing this, they are gearing up for the sequel to Kung Fu Panda. They will have ads, mailings, online content, games and contests, and group movie nights, and the local school owners will be encouraged to use the movie as a reason for contacting their local media and offering themselves to be interviewed about how martial arts builds character and self-esteem as well as physical fitness in kids.

 There are, of course, copyright and trademark issues to be cautious about when tying to such things as TV shows and movies, and this book is not a source of legal advice. You are solely responsible for the legality of your business activity.

 7. Piggyback on Others’ Fads, Even If Unrelated

 I don’t know about you, but if someone had come to me and invited me to invest in a movie about giant turtles who lived in the sewers, ate pizza, sang rock music, and were martial arts experts, I would have whipped my checkbook right out. Sure. Nevertheless, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were big, big, big! And Pizza Hut astutely latched onto their coat-tails, uh, shells. But Pizza Hut didn’t own this opportunity. A dentist I know went out and bought some stuffed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, displayed them in his office, and mailed all his patients this offer: bring in any child for a special $9.95 exam and he or she can take home the turtle of his or her choice—while supplies last—free! If I had owned a pet store, a record store, a toy store, or a kids’ shoe store—I can guarantee you that I would have run some kind of green promotion the year the turtles got hot.

 Fortunately, there’s some kind of comparable fad every few months or so. Before the ink is dry on the pages of this book, whatever examples I might mention could be a distant memory, but another opportunity will have presented itself for astute marketers to capitalize on.

 8. Write, Publish, or Get Published and Promote a Book

 If you can’t write a grocery list competently, hire a ghostwriter or use a turn-key, everything-done-for-you service like my friend Adam Witty at Advantage Publishing provides (www.advantagepublishing.com). But by some means, put out a book—no matter what your business is. There are many reasons—here are three:

 One, it gives you authority, which can aid in creating trust and provide competitive differentiation. In the work that I do with financial advisors, with another consultant, Matt Zagula, and the national sales organization, Advisors Excel, we guide every advisor we coach into

-----

##### authorship of at least one book. Matt’s own book, Invasion of the Money-Snatchers, provided a basis for evening-with-author seminar events that brought in hundreds of good potential clients. (Note: If you happen to be a financial advisor and would like to see some of the marketing Matt and I are doing in that industry, visit www.CreatingTrustBook.com. We are also coauthors of a book for financial advisors, Creating Trust in an Understandably Un-Trusting World, which is both a how-to book and a positioning tool for us with the industry.)

 Two, it is, in many ways, easier to advertise and much easier to get free advertising for your book than for your product, service, or business. As the author of a book about the opportunities in our field, The Official Get Rich Guide to Information Marketing, my colleague Robert Skrob, president of the Information Marketing Association (www.info-marketing.org), can get just about as many talk radio interviews as he cares to do, can get mentions for the book or reviews of the book in magazines, and can generate a lot of online media coverage for the book. Without the book, trying to get the same access and quantity of media exposure for the association itself would be infinitely more difficult. Suzanne Somers, best known as the air-headed blonde on the old TV comedy Three’s Company, has, with zero credentials, made herself into an accepted expert on women’s health issues and alternative health remedies—by writing books. She is invited on all sorts of major TV shows and networks—from Oprah to CNN to FOX—and is treated as an authority on these subjects because she’s an author. Being a celebrity helps, yet it would hurt were it not for the books.

 Years ago, I solved the problem of slumping ad results and competitive clutter for a Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon by having him write a book then switch all his advertising from promoting the practice to promoting the book. Recently, at my urging, Clate Mask and Scott Martineau, clients of mine and the top guys at a marketing software company, InfusionSoft, wrote a terrific book, Conquer the Chaos: How to Grow a Successful Small Business Without Going Crazy, and did such a great job promoting it they drove it onto the big daddy of all bestseller lists, the New York Times’ list. This is a business-to-business company, not a consumer products or services business. With no disrespect intended, its authors are self-appointed experts. (I’m a huge believer in self-appointment.) Theirs is still a small albeit fast-growing company; they are not yet famous CEOs. If they can put together a good, valuable book and promote it so successfully, who says you can’t? And be assured: They have many doors open to them as authors that would be closed if they wanted to get free advertising for their software company. Authorship gives you unique status.

 Get Publicity and Motivate Customers by Doing Good

 Business tie-ins with charities occur all around you, all the time. But you don’t need to be a big company or deal with a major national charity

-----

##### to get in this game, and for the local small business, working with a local charity can be a better opportunity, better appreciated by the community and your customers, and better embraced by local media.

 Dr. Gregg Nielsen, a small-town chiropractor discussed earlier in this book, consistently does a good job with promotions for his practice that benefit his community and garner favorable media coverage. Following are two simple sales letters Dr. Nielsen used in the months of October and November, mailed to past “lost” patients, patients, and others who had expressed interest in his services. Each letter includes a brief mention of a donation to the community’s fire department. Also shown is the photograph and caption that appeared in the local newspaper— free advertising! This promotion brought 110 patients in the door from a very small mailing and the media attention.

 Another great example comes from Bill Glazer, who linked his stores’ fiftieth anniversary promotions to Habitat for Humanity via a unique celebrity-autographed tie auction. This used both a celebrity and charity tie-in.

 Dr. Barry Lycka, a business and marketing consultant to cosmetic surgeons, frequently relies on publicity to promote his own practice. He received coverage in over 100 newspapers nationwide when he initiated a program providing free cosmetic surgery to victims of domestic abuse.

##### The Basic Tools for Getting Free Advertising: The Press Kit and the News Release

 A press kit is a folder or booklet of basic information about you, your business, product, or service; your qualifications as an expert; and your background that can be universally used with any media contact as well as bankers, lenders, investors, vendors, even clients or customers. You will also want its online brother in place: a website or section of your website specifically for the media that delivers the same basic items as a traditional offline press kit. The online version offers advantages, of course: you can appear in video and talk to the media; you can have samples of your best, prior interviews there to hear or view; and you can drive media contacts to it by clicking on a link. Both offline and online versions need to include these required items:

 1. A biographical sketch and/or resume.

 2. A chronological history of your industry and your business,
 product, or service.

 3. Photos of the business, product, or service.

 4. Photos of you in action with your product or service, you with
 famous people, you being interviewed on TV or other media.

 5. Copies of any articles or excerpts from books you’ve written.

 6. Copies of articles about you and your business, product, or
 service.

 7. Position statements or press releases—such as those about
 studies, surveys, polls, new products, nonprofit affiliations, awards received, etc.

-----

##### 8. A list of subjects on which you can be called to comment as a
 qualified expert.

 In addition to the basics, you need some “wow factor” additions, and you need to make the basic items interesting and persuasive, yet still easy for a busy, impatient talk show booker, producer or host, journalist, or other media person to use.

 Your press kit can be sent with a cover letter to every radio station producer or manager, every TV station producer or manager, every newspaper editor, every magazine editor, individual show hosts and producers, and individual columnists. Your cover letter may suggest a particular reason to schedule you as a guest now or, more generally, suggest that your press kit be kept on file and that you be called on when they need an expert from your field. Then, periodically, you can mail and e-mail new information to this same list of targets.

 This is usually your first contact with a list you’ve compiled of media targets who might be interested in you and who could be useful to you. If you become known to these contacts as an interesting, knowledgeable source of information, you will get opportunities.

 The other basic tool is a good press release. You can create one press release after another, linking yourself or your business to timely events. Best of all, press releases can be sent via broadcast fax and e-mail to radio stations and other media at nominal cost.

 The media is increasingly looking to YouTube and social media such as Facebook and LinkedIn for sources and news and human interest stories, so you want presence and activity there if in pursuit of publicity.

 A renowned expert in using press releases successfully is my speaking colleague, Dr. Paul Hartunian. Paul is the man who actually did sell the Brooklyn Bridge—well, little hunks of it anyway, to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, all via free advertising, i.e. radio interviews, all created by press releases. For that and other products and businesses, he has been on The Tonight Show, Oprah, Sally Jesse Raphael, on CNN, even profiled in Forbes magazine. He has generated millions of dollars of free yet valuable advertising via simple press releases. One of the biggest points Paul hammers home is that the media is not interested in giving you free advertising, but the media is eager for information and stories that will intrigue, interest, or entertain their readers, listeners, and viewers.

 You can find publicity resources by Paul at www.hartunian.com.

 I have a little personal experience with Paul’s point. I got my three NO B.S. books featured on the prime-time evening news on one of the three networks in Cleveland, one of my home cities, but the station had no interest whatsoever in giving my books free advertising or directly promoting business books. They were intrigued by the “oddity” of a

##### local resident who raced harness horses, actually drove in the races, and wrote business books. So I was interviewed by the sports reporter, not the business reporter. I was in my racing colors, standing next to a horse. But the books were nicely displayed on bales of straw and shown in the segment, which aired twice. Mission accomplished.
