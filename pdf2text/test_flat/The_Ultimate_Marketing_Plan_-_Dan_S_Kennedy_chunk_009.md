 How to Prove Your Case Without Testimonials

 Having made a major case for relying on testimonials to tell your story for you and to prove every part of your case, I must also advise you to not stop there. Also, sometimes you may be strictly limited in your use of testimonials, due to FTC regulations (see sidebar) or other reasons. So how else can you show that your product or service is great?

 The FTC and Testimonials

 The use of customer and celebrity testimonials is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, and in 2010, new, toughened restrictions on many uses and users were imposed. Information can be obtained at www.FTC.gov. This book, incidentally, talks about best marketing strategies without acting as legal adviser, and neither author or publisher accepts any liability whatsoever for any individual reader’s marketing decisions. It is your responsibility to ascertain the legality of your actions.

 Association

 One of the simplest, easiest things you can do to prove your case is using “by their company, ye shall know them.”

 The Allen Brothers mail-order catalog (for ultra-high-priced, steakhouse-quality meats delivered to your door) routinely features a list of steakhouses from all over the country who buy from Allen Brothers. This emphasizes the basic Allen Brothers’ promise: You can have the same exceptional quality steaks the finest restaurants serve their

##### We think the eye doesn’t lie, so offering visual evidence of “safety in numbers” can be compelling.

 The aforementioned Allen Brothers could, for example, show a map with every city where they have fine-restaurant clients marked with red dots, and every place where they have repeat customers who’ve been getting home deliveries for five years or longer marked with blue dots. For Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™, we often use photos like the following one of our events’ audiences, taken as wide shots, to give a sense of the size of the audiences, while most, if they use such photos at all, take ordinary (nonwide) shots. Everybody knows about before-and- after photos, but most use only static shots (e.g., an overweight woman standing in baggy, “fat” clothes; now-skinny woman in bikini). That second photo would be more interesting and dramatic if she was in a bikini playing volleyball on the beach, or standing in front of a convertible with a hot “Ken-doll” guy in the driver’s seat. IT’S UP TO YOU to come up with many different, interesting ways to use photographs.

 Math

 In raising money for disease research, homeless people, abused animals, and so on, you’ll often find statements like “every minute of every day, 14 people die of Disease X. Fourteen every minute.” This may be more alarming than saying “every year, 7.3 million people die of Disease X.” Seven million is a lot, but there are 300 million or so people in the United States, and a lot more worldwide. Seven million in that context is not that many, and 7 million is a number you can’t really wrap your head around. And in today’s discourse, billions or trillions are tossed about as comic books and candy money. But fourteen every minute—that sounds like a lot, and it’s a more dramatic idea. If you were watching them, stopwatch in hand, someone would be keeling over every 4.2 seconds.

 Statistical evidence of “safety in numbers” can be very persuasive.

##### Same idea, turned around: Every minute of every day, 24-7-365, a new member joins the Whatsis Society! That’s about 520,000 new members. And that’s a lot. But what if it’s every hour—that still sounds impressive, maybe more impressive than 8,760 new members. Obviously, how you present numbers matters. IT’S UP TO YOU to identify every stat you’ve got and to present them in interesting ways that demonstrate something meaningful and reassuring.

### Ultimate Marketing Plan Success
 Factor #5

## Perception

##### Years back, on many occasions, I was paid as a consultant to visit a chiropractor’s office, tour it, check out the office’s new-patient procedures, and evaluate what might be done better in order to make patients comfortable, confident, satisfied, and likely to refer. Frankly, an amazing number of times my best advice has had to do with some 75- watt light bulbs and a bottle of Mr. Clean. Which brings us to a discussion of customer perception.

 If you visit the dictionary and thesaurus, you’ll find that “perception” is defined as the ability to see, hear, and become aware of something … form an opinion of something … through the five senses. And: a way of understanding or regarding something. And: an impression of something. This means that your customer’s understanding of you and your business is affected by input brought in through all five senses, consciously and subconsciously, thoughtfully and intuitively. You cannot define yourself for your customers merely by what you assert— no matter how eloquently, persuasively, or aggressively you assert it.

 The reigning expert in designing the most effective customer experiences that create the most favorable customer perceptions is my coauthor of the book Uncensored Sales Strategies, Sydney Biddle Barrows. She comes from a very unusual background for a business and marketing advisor. She is knowledgeable, smart, intuitive, and exceptionally perception sensitive. Her approach to Sales Choreography is brilliant. I recommend reading the book as well as visiting her website, www.SydneyBarrows.com. Free resources are available there. Here, I will give an abbreviated overview of the concept of deliberately controlling customer perception.

 Let’s begin inside your business, at its premises. This is relevant to the degree that your customers, vendors, investors, or community members visit your business location. If no one ever visits, there’s nominal damage done by a pigsty location. If even one person visits, the damage begins.

##### Consider types of businesses where what goes on inside the business’ premises has changed dramatically. Perhaps you’ve taken your car to a service station and waited while getting an oil change. The waiting area had old, peeling linoleum covered with grease and two plastic chairs to sit on, a stack of hot-rod magazines, and a coffeemaker surrounded by Styrofoam cups and utensils. Today, chains of “quick lube” centers feature not only speed but usually neat, clean reception rooms with comfortable seating and beverage centers and plasma TVs on the wall. Auto dealerships followed this lead in giving their service departments major makeovers. Some have play areas for children, Internet cafés, business centers, and more.

 Or think about dental practices. For a long time they were cold, sterile, functional, often blindingly white. Hospital-ish. Unfriendly, intimidating, anxiety inducing. Today? Many feature elaborate reception areas with gigantic aquariums, entertainment centers, and latte and biscotti bars. In the operatories, you’ll now find heated massage chairs, plasma TVs, and stereo headphones. In some offices there might even be spas and massage therapists—friendly, relaxing.

 Many businesses have been Disney-fied. Yours probably should be.

 If you get a copy of my book No B.S. Wealth Attraction in the New Economy, you’ll find a chapter about High Point University, where my friend Nido Qubein has worked amazing magic—to such extent that I urge you to visit with notepad and pen in hand if traveling anywhere near High Point, North Carolina. Or next best thing, visit www.highpoint.edu. You’ll also find a chapter about Kennedy’s All- American Barber Clubs and its reinvention of the barber shop as upscale men’s club.

 This is creative innovation entirely focused on customer perception. Arguably, all this does not speak to or affect the core deliverables—the academic education at High Point, the haircuts and shaves at the Barber Clubs, the oil change, the auto repair, the dentistry. These leaders in “experience marketing” understand that, as the saying goes, for the customer, perception is reality.

 Here’s a very simple two-question test to apply to your own business premises and everything that is seen, heard, touched, smelled, tasted, or experienced there:

 Question #1: Describe the perception of your business that you
 want your prospect and your customer to form, have, hold, and convey to others.

 It’ll be useful to be able to summarize this perception goal in a single sentence. But you should probably start out mulling it over and describing it in much more comprehensive terms.

-----

##### Question #2: Does everything contribute to projecting that image?

 Let me give you a great example of incongruity. For most of my life, I’ve owned and driven Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles. Currently I have a big, fat, gas-guzzling SUV and I’m proud of it. It was a “lifetime thank-you gift” from a client, Joe Polish of Pirhana Marketing—who was I to refuse? But one time, I had a Cadillac. When I had my Caddy, I had it serviced at the best, most successful, most respected Cadillac dealership in Phoenix. As you might guess, their new-car showroom was immaculate: windows sparkling clean, floor buffed to a high gloss, lighting just so, unobtrusive music playing softly in the background.

 Their service department was also smartly run. During morning rush hour, when many people dropped off their cars, neatly dressed young women greeted the customers and offered them coffee. The service technicians were also nicely dressed, with shirts and neckties. The area was kept pretty much free of grease and grime. There was also an air of efficiency that was reassuring. The service technicians each had computer terminals and could pull up your car’s service records. From the screen, they knew and didn’t have to ask for your name, address, phone number, etc.

 So far, so good.

 The first incongruity was, I suppose, relatively minor, yet it certainly made a major, lasting impression on my mind: The courtesy cars they used to drop customers off at their offices were Buicks, not Cadillacs. Kind of like being picked up and brought to the spa in a limo and sent home in a cab.

 The second incongruity looms larger: The place where you settled your account was sandwiched into a narrow hallway; you stood not in a line, for which there was no room, but rather in an intimate, pushing, annoying cluster of people. You conversed with the clerks through tiny little windows, and the clerk I dealt with on two occasions chewed and popped bubblegum and was devoid of personality.

 What’s wrong with that picture? A lot. First, it is, in fact, a picture that sticks. To be consistent with the perception being conveyed by all other areas of the operation, there should have been a nicely appointed living-room type of area where the customers sat comfortably and the clerks came to them, got the invoices signed, took the credit cards back to the accounting area, processed them there, and brought the finished paperwork back to the customer with a smile and a thank you.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #8:
 Perception Congruency

##### Every piece of your marketing “puzzle” should be strategically crafted to reinforce a single, central perception.

 I’d suggest, incidentally, that “successful” be part of the image you choose to convey. I find that, in most businesses, customers prefer dealing with successful businesses and businesspeople. I can recall going with a consulting client of mine when he was interviewing and choosing a new attorney for his firm—his company was in considerable difficulty with the Federal Trade Commission at the time, so he was going to be a fat catch for whichever law firm he selected. I thought the conversation with the two lawyers at the first firm went well, but he was skeptical about them when we left. He admitted that he couldn’t put his finger on why he was uncomfortable with them; he just was. It was several hours later that the impression maneuvered from his subconscious to his conscious and he was able to enunciate his reason for discomfort: “Nothing,” he said, “was going on.” The phones weren’t ringing, the receptionist was reading a magazine, there were empty work areas, there was no busyness noise. In his mind he translated that, rightly or wrongly—but perception is reality—to the law firm being unsuccessful. And he wanted to place his trust in a very successful firm.

 Once I was counseling a chiropractor, brand new in practice, located in a brand-new shopping center at a busy intersection but too new to be fully occupied with tenants. He was suffering from an inordinately high number of no-shows: people who would respond to his advertising, schedule exam appointments, then not show up. His parking lot was nude.

 He and his staff parked their own cars behind the center. His practice was so new there were rarely patients’ cars parked there. And there were no adjacent tenants creating traffic. “How would you feel,” I asked him, “if you started to drive up here for your first appointment?” We parked his car, his staff’s cars, and a couple of rented-by-the-week Cadillacs in front of that office; his no-show rate dropped like a rock.

 Creating a Marketing-Oriented Store Environment

 If you don’t have a store, you’re welcome to skip this brief section.

 Coincidentally and fortunately, I was at a major shopping mall recently and, in a national chain store I won’t name here, overheard one well-dressed woman, I’d guess rather affluent, say to her shopping

-----

##### companion, “Let’s go—this place is too confusing. I can’t find what I want here.”

 I can’t count how many times I’ve seen a store environment or at least part of a store environment designed for the convenience of the staff— not the customer. The smart store environment quite simply facilitates buying. That should be the primary consideration in every design and display decision: Does it make it easier and more likely that the customer will buy?

 Last week, I was in a men’s clothing store and was struck by these oddities:

 1. The casual slacks, like jeans and twill slacks, were intermingled
 with the dress slacks.

 2. The necktie display was closer to the sport shirts than to the
 dress shirts.

 3. Shoes were displayed only in the window, then all the way at the
 rear of the store.

 4. The walls in the dressing rooms were blank.

 What would you do differently?

 I think I’d group my sports clothes together in one area and display casual slacks, shirts, jackets, and shoes there. I’d similarly group my dress slacks, dress shirts, ties, jackets, suits, and dress shoes together. I’d put framed photos of my newest fashions and framed testimonial letters up on the walls of the dressing rooms.

 Here’s my Five-Point Criteria for smart store design:

 1. Convey a congruent perception.

 2. Present goods in a logical, organized way.

 3. Help the customer think with creative idea displays.

 I was in a pet store recently, and—lo and behold—in the fish section they had a display featuring everything you’d need to set up your first tropical fish aquarium: the aquarium itself, the underground filter, a bag of gravel, a stand, a light and hood, and so on, each neatly labeled with what it was and what it did. Over by the cute puppies was a similar display titled “The Family’s First Dog,” and it displayed a bowl, bag of food, box of vitamins, a couple of chew toys, a brush, a collar, a leash, and so on.

 4. Educate the customer when appropriate—by display, by
 continuous loop video, by live demonstrator.

-----

##### 5. Utilize every possibility—such as wall space—to promote,
 advertise, and educate.

 Some store environment principles apply to nonstore locations, too, even including professional offices. I teach chiropractors, for example, that there are only three reasons for the patient being in the office:

 1. to get well

 2. to learn how to stay well

 3. to get inspired to refer

 and that every minute spent there, and everything seen or heard while there, should be related to one, two, or all three of those reasons. That means: out with the magazines, in with interesting, educational literature; out with the background music, in with continuous-loop video; out with the mass-produced paintings of farmhouses and snowcapped mountains, in with charts and posters.
