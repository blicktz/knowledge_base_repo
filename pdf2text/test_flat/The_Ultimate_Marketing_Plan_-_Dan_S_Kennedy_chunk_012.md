This circuitous path to publicity is something I’ve personally used often. For the past year or so, I’ve been writing a weekly political opinion column published online by BusinessAndMedia.org, affiliated with the prestigious Media Research Center in Washington, D.C. Every so often one of these columns really hits a nerve, and I get a flurry of invitations to appear as a guest on radio talk shows to be interviewed about that particular column. When I do, I promote BusinessAndMedia.org, but I also work in mention of my business books, Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ and its websites, and often even direct offer of membership. The listeners to conservative political talk radio include a great many small-business owners, entrepreneurs, and sales professionals, so my “message to market” match is perfect. But I would find it difficult and arduous to secure these free advertising opportunities with this media if I were trying to get on these shows to promote books or a business rather than being invited on as a columnist. However, direct advertising of yourself for any purpose to all radio and TV show producers and hosts is viable and is best accomplished via a service called Radio/TV Interview Report and a form of speed dating with media, the National Publicity Summit, both provided by my clients Bill and Stephen Harrison, publicity mavens extraordinaire!

 One of two things is happening with every business, minute by minute, hour by hour, daily, weekly, monthly—either the business is hot, generating lots of heat and getting hot, or it is quickly cooling off and in danger of going cold.

### Ultimate Marketing Plan Success
 Factor #7

## Action

##### My friend Robert Ringer, best known as the author of the legendary bestselling book Winning Through Intimidation, wrote another book that need not have its covers opened for you to get the thrust of its message. It is titled: Action: Nothing Happens Until Something Moves. In my book, No B.S. Wealth Attraction in the New Economy, one of my Wealth Magnets presented is simply Do Something.

 Far too many business owners sit and wait. If they invest in advertising and marketing, they may feel that is enough, and such investment entitles them to success. Others are resource strapped and may feel they are handicapped and unable to effectively promote their businesses. Both are wrong. My motto is: There is always something that can be done—now. And regardless of how much or how little monetary investment is being made in marketing, there are things that can be done personally or by direct delegation, using manual labor and “shoe leather” in place of money, improving process.

 Getting Customers Without Going Broke

 Early in my business career, I was wisely advised, “Boy, the first thing you got to do is avoid going broke while you’re getting rich and famous.” Had I paid closer attention, I might very well have saved myself from considerable financial strife. Observing others, I’ve noticed how frequently entrepreneurs bankrupt themselves with expensive advertising and marketing schemes when their interests would be better served by low-cost methods. When you stop to think about it, it’s easy to buy
 customers—given enough money (or credit), any idiot can build up a business, and many idiots have, using up millions of dollars of stockholders’ equity in the process. The genius is in getting customers and making sales without having to use up a huge chunk of capital to do it. The ideas in this chapter are dedicated to that objective.

 It’s Opportunity Calling!

-----

##### The phone rang persistently in the little shoe store where I was buying a pair of shoes. Finally, after six rings, the clerk at the counter said, “Dammit—I’m busy,” but grudgingly answered the phone. Guess how he sounded to the caller?

 This attitudinal error must occur a million times a day in every imaginable type of business, as the incoming call “interrupts” the important work. Fix this and you’ve taken a giant step forward in attracting new customers as well as retaining the ones you have.

 An inbound call can be many things: the tax collector, your mother- in-law announcing a surprise two-week visit, or the merchant next door reporting that your roof is on fire. These calls have varying degrees of importance. But the call can be and often is from a prospective customer, present customer, or past customer, and that is Opportunity calling! These calls must not be thought of as interruptions.

 If the call is from a prospective customer, the job of the person handling the call must be clearly defined, understood, and enthusiastically pursued: to get the customer into the store or to get her name, address, and phone number, or to set up an appointment. It is not just to dispense information. This inbound call is a sales event, and it must be put in the hands of a person who is or is trained to be a salesperson, with a positive attitude about being in this role. A great resource for small-business owners who need to get their folks answering their phones doing a much better job, and then mystery- shopping them on an ongoing basis, is Chris Mullins, an expert coach in this area. Visit her website at www.mullinsmediagroup.com.

 These same inbound calls are also opportunities to capture good leads for subsequent follow-up. Let me tell you one of the most instructive true marketing stories I have ever encountered:

 The owner of a large auto-parts store was extraordinarily frustrated with his advertising, complaining about weekly expenditures of tens of thousands of dollars in the newspaper, on radio, and on television, all yielding few customers. But a conversation with his employees revealed their frustration with the constant ringing of the phone—calls from people asking questions, constantly interrupting them. A Saturday in his store provided a count of over 200 incoming calls. Here’s how everyone was handled, with varying levels of courtesy and friendliness:

 “XYZ Auto Parts—how can we help you?” The caller would then state his business. Most often, his inquiry sounded like this: “I saw (heard) your ad—how much is a flibittygibbet for a ’68 Ford?”

 The answer then went like this: “Lemme look it up—hold on … still there? It’s sixty-two fifty.” Click.

##### As you can immediately detect, there was no problem at all with this guy’s advertising. And, to be fair, his people really weren’t at fault, either. He was the problem. He was the one who had no earthly idea what was going on inside his own business. He was the one who had failed to educate his people about the importance of these calls. He was the one who had failed to train his people in effective handling of the calls. He was the one who had failed to motivate his people. He was the one who had failed to monitor their performance.

 Here’s what we did:

 1. We devised a new phone script to capture the caller’s name,
 address, and number. This made every call valuable, even if it was not immediately converted to a sale or a customer rushing down to the store. Without this, many calls had zero value. More value with no more cost!

 2. We taught the script to all the employees who took calls.

 3. We instituted a reward pool of fifty cents per captured name,
 address, and phone number, divided at day’s end by everybody working that day.

 4. We added a “telephone up-sell” to the script: an immediate offer
 of a $100.00-value coupon book with discount coupons for a variety of auto care products sold at the store plus a free car wash coupon from a local car wash—for $19.95.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #10:
 Capture Callers’ Identity and Market to Them

##### Immediately, with this strategy, the number of callers converted, ones who came into the store that same day, increased significantly. But much more importantly, a lot of callers who did not quickly come to the store did provide their contact information. With a series of follow-up mailings over six weeks, the store captured more than 50 percent of the callers as customers! Further, one employee who refused to get with the program was exposed as a toxic influence and fired. The other employees had an opportunity to pocket some extra spending cash just for collecting information, which improved their morale.

 Make Sure Your Employees
 Are Helping Your Cause

 The entire issue of employees getting with your program or refusing to get with it and what to do about it, and broader, how to make your team perform profitably, is addressed in detail in my book, No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits. The sabotage of advertising and marketing by poorly performing, poorly managed staff is more common than dirt on the ground. This book, No B.S. Ruthless Management, is a vitally important companion to any Ultimate Marketing Plan. Get it from any online bookseller or bookstore or, for information, visit www.NoBSBooks.com.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #11:
 The Telephone Up-Sell

##### In addition, we added revenue and profit with the telephone up-sell. I suppose $19.95 may not sound like much, but this store was getting 200 calls during a weekend. Soon, about twenty of these callers were buying the $19.95 coupon book: $399.00 × 52 Saturdays = $20,748.00 per year. More importantly, 20 people × 52 = 1,040 new customers just about guaranteed to come into the store because they’ve paid for the privilege of buying things there!

 You’re familiar with the phone up-sell if you’ve ever ordered by phone from a well-run catalog company. After the operator has taken your order, she’ll usually do a Columbo: Oh, just one more thing … we have a special offer just for today’s callers—may I tell you about it?

 This is a great illustration of a broader marketing principle, not restricted to making the inbound calls more valuable: digging into the little intricacies of your business, into every interaction with prospects or customers, into every activity, to find opportunities to squeeze out more income juice. If you want to increase income without increasing financial investments in advertising or marketing, this is the path.

 Reach Out and Grab a Customer

 Fact: the telephone lines run in both directions, in and out. According to Bernie Goldberg, author of the book How to Manage and Execute Telephone Selling, someone making outbound telemarketing calls to homes can average twenty-five to thirty-five dialings per hour and ten to fifteen completed calls per hour; someone calling businesses can make twenty to thirty dialings and five to ten completed calls per hour. If a person costs you $5.00 per hour and completes just five calls, that’s a cost of $1.00 per presentation; if the person gets ten done, you’re down to a cost of fifty cents per presentation. This is comparable to or less than other advertising and marketing methods and much faster to get done.

 Why the telephone? Well, just about everybody’s got one. And just about everybody answers it when it rings. They may skip your ad in the newspaper. They may throw out your mail or leave your e-mail unopened. But when the phone rings, they answer.

 Sadly, “cold” telephone prospecting to consumers is now outlawed for all who’ve put themselves on the Do Not Call Registry, dicey with others, and less welcome by many than ever before. However, telephone follow-up to people who have expressed interest in your business and

##### given you permission to follow up with them is still viable, and telephone conversation with interested prospects remains one of the most direct, cost-effective marketing tools available to us. Also, Do- Not-Call laws do not affect true B-to-B situations, so telephone prospecting to business owners is still open frontier.

 For a printing company, I had a list compiled of small businesses and phone numbers from the area immediately surrounding the shop, created a simple phone script, and made a competition out of it for the five employees, none of whom were salespeople or telemarketers. They each found the time to make one call per hour, eight calls a day. The one who got the most new customers during the week got $100.00. The shop made forty calls a day, 200 calls a week, for $100.00—fifty cents each. The shop also gained an average of ten new customers each week. ANY business could copy this idea.

 Quite a few years ago, Fran Tarkenton, former NFL superstar turned businessman, with whom I had the pleasure of coauthoring The Be Your Own Boss System for Entrepreneur magazine and with whom I’ve worked on two TV infomercials, got the idea of selling advertising space on airline ticket jackets. He struck a deal with an airline, then faced a question: How best to get the advertisers under contract? Fran chose the simplest, cheapest, fastest way he could think of. He locked himself in a New York City hotel room for several days and called prospects on the phone. The strength of his name was enough to get through to decision-makers; other marketers have to find other ways to get that done. In less than a week, Fran sold millions of dollars of advertising contracts for his newly invented medium to major national corporations and made himself a lot of money.

 There is one overwhelmingly superior way most businesses should use telemarketing, if they use it only one way:

-----

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #12:
 Telemarketing after Direct Mail

##### Almost without exception, a telemarketing campaign linked to direct mail increases the initial direct-mail results by 500 percent to 1,000 percent! And, this is even truer when marketing to present or past customers with whom you have a relationship. Most business owners do not do this, but they could and should. If mailing to established customers about, say, a sale or special event, having someone call each one several days after the mailing and several days before the event, to make sure they received the announcement, extend a personal invitation, and tell them about a gift or promotion not mentioned in the printed literature, can dramatically boost overall response.

 In cold prospecting, B to B, the script can be as simple as this proven template:

 1. Identify Yourself
 This is John Smith from ABC Widgets calling.

 2. Reason for Calling
 I’m calling to arrange for delivery of a useful free gift, <identify gift>, for the person in your company responsible for purchasing widgets.

 OR

 I’m calling to follow up on my letter to the person in charge of purchasing widgets, to arrange for delivery of his free gift.

 3. Identify Decision-Maker
 Who in your company handles widget purchasing?

 4. Get to the Decision-Maker
 May I speak to Mr. Widget Buyer for just three minutes, please?

 5. Get Past Screening
 Rather than leaving my name and number, I’d very much appreciate setting a time that I should call back—I need to arrange for delivery of his gift with him personally within two days. (ALTERNATIVE CLOSE) Would it be better if I called

-----

##### back at (insert time) or (insert time)?

 6. Repeat 1 and 2 with Decision-Maker
 Mr. Widget Buyer, I’m John Smith from ABC Widgets. As part of our (insert month) new-customer promotion, your company has been selected to receive, as a free gift, (inset whatever the gift is) just for (insert desired result: coming in to store this week, setting up an appointment, whatever), and I’m calling to arrange for you to receive this gift.

 7. Ask for the Desired Action
 I’d like to personally bring your gift in and give you a brief demonstration of the ABC Widget in action. Would tomorrow morning or afternoon be better for you?

 OR

 I’d like to set your gift aside with your name on it, but I have to know when you’ll be coming in. Will tomorrow morning or afternoon be better for you?

 YCDBSOYA

 My father had a pair of cufflinks when I was a kid that were black squares with raised gold letters: YCDBSOYA. The letters stand for:

 You Can’t Do Business Sitting On Your Ass

 I own the cufflinks and wear them often. I believe in the principle and have lived it for thirty-plus years. Hustle. Even big business leaders hustle. Pay attention to Donald Trump, who I’ve appeared on programs with as a speaker. He hustles every single day. When I have a book to promote, I hustle: I do radio interviews, teleseminars, book signings and seminar tours (four cities in four days once), news releases, send out promotional copies to centers of influence, make personal calls to ask others to publicize my book, and more. Usually, I invest money in advertising and promotion. But I also invest hustle. You have a business to promote, not a book. But each month you could think of your business as a new book coming out, with you as its author, in a desperate and urgent race to make sure it doesn’t die on arrival and sells a respectable enough number of copies to stay on bookstore shelves for months to come.

 A few years ago, a favorite restaurant of mine failed during its summer slump. But at no time did its owners get up off their butts and go out into the community door to door to hand out coupons or flyers. Or go to the phone and make telemarketing calls. Or do anything else that was proactive. They didn’t hustle. They just sat there and died.
