The environment is much more like an upscale spa salon than a tanning salon with its big, open reception area, natural wood and pastel colors, and reception desk. The booths themselves are arranged in a big circle around the reception desk, each with privacy rooms. His order of arrangement (and presentation) is the polar opposite of most in his industry; his booths are arranged with the best/most expensive in front and presented first. Significantly, each room has photographs outside, in case it is in use during a tour. The entire environment is upscale, several levels above industry norms and most new customers’ expectations.

 As an interesting aside, this business began as an experiment, adding a few low-end, basic tanning booths to the video stores Grant owned before he developed this company. When deciding to exit the video business and commit to this industry, he decided he wanted to be able to attract and keep affluent clientele and deliver an experience vastly superior to the typical tanning salon—which is usually sterile and ordinary, typically with booths stuck in a strip center location with little improvement of the environment. Grant’s salon could be installed inside a top-flight resort hotel and be right at home.

 Comprehensive Internal Controls. Everything is scripted,
 supported by checklists, and quality control is made visible to customers to impose pressure for compliance on staff; for example, the cleanliness and sanitization form that must be completed by staff after preparing a room for a customer is on a clipboard in the room, visible to the customer.

 area where staff interacts with customers and sales activity

##### occurs is under constant A/V surveillance so that Grant can eavesdrop via his laptop on any of the five locations live or after the fact. A/V surveillance is also used for noncompliance in coaching (or firing) staff. See Chapter 13 in my book No BS Ruthless Management of People & Profits for more. And know: What you won’t enforce, you won’t get.

 Expansion

 Entrepreneurs operate in realms of GROWTH and EXPANSION; most business owners only in growth. In addition to growing the core business via multiple locations, additional tanning booths/equipment, and evermore aggressive marketing to bring in customers and (targeted) to smooth over seasonal highs and lows, Grant has also expanded into nontanning products and services at the salons, opened a second business that can be cross-marketed to the same customers, and is now readying an infomarketing/coaching business for his industry. There is no standing still here.

 The ability to stay in a mode of continuous growth and expansion is only possible for a small or even midsized company owner who has a (continuously updated) Ultimate Marketing Plan in place. Business owners who fly by the seat of their pants are so consumed by the here and now, by random acts of marketing, sales, and fire extinguishing, that they can never focus on business development.

 There is in Grant’s approach, as I advocate, both macro- and micromanagement. In our discussions, he knew his numbers, and is constantly working at measurable improvement in many, many “little things” that, in aggregate, make the difference between ordinary and exceptional profits. The customer experience is choreographed and scripted, the sales process (for membership) scripted and supported with good sales aids, and these processes monitored and enforced. Overall, he is definitely in the marketing business, not the tanning business, and devotes the majority of his work time to driving the advertising and marketing. It features frequency, constancy, the creation/rotation of different offers, and the use of multiple media (although direct mail is the chief media). He has taken an ordinary business and made it upscale, able to attract and retain affluent clientele but still able to attract a teen to young adult clientele.

 For just a moment of self-aggrandizement: Grant told me that he built his entire business—externally, that is, its marketing, and internally, that is, its product/price presentation, sales processes, and so on—based

##### largely on what he gleaned from studying with me, and he has dog- eared, well-worn Kennedy resources going back quite a few years as well as the most recent releases. However, to be fair about it, this is much more about him than me. He has trained himself to be a strong marketer, copywriter, manager, and entrepreneur, and built a multimillion-dollar, premium-price business dominating its local market yet still growing and expanding, and steadily increasing in value. It’s a strong testament to what somebody can do if he or she has the will to do it.

### The Power of Premiumization

##### One of our most impressive Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Members is Diana Coutu, co-owner with her husband of Diana’s Gourmet Pizzeria, where prices for large pizzas run to $42.99 and her most expensive pizza is $51.99. And no, she’s not in Beverly Hills or Manhattan. She’s in Winnipeg, Canada. Within a stone’s throw, a name- brand discount pizza chain sells pizzas for as little as “2 for $9.99.” How can she prosper?

 Again, you’ll see much of the Ultimate Marketing Plan baked into her business (yes, a pun!)—but neither this chapter nor the black-and-white reproductions of her colorful marketing materials do this story justice, so I urge visiting www.DianasGourmetPizzeria.ca to see a lot more.

 It might interest you that in the most recent year (still with the recession hanging on), her business doubled and they doubled the store size, added a delivery vehicle, and have more growth cooked up for the next year. Here are some of the biggest contributing factors:

 Product Innovation and Premiumization

 Several times a month, new or limited-time specialty pizzas are premiered, like Pizza with Brie Cheese and Pears, and Spring Chicken with Mandarin Oranges and Olive Oil. Her regular menu (reproduced in part on the following pages) features classic favorites and unusual gourmet pizzas, plus there are take ‘n bake, pizza kits, and even flavored dough balls to make pizza at home from scratch—including Moosehead beer dough and whole-wheat multigrain. They also have pizzas for diabetics, a $150.00 party pizza, plus salads, appetizers, and beverages. By transcending ordinary pizza and with targeted, upscale-oriented marketing, Diana is able to operate a premium pizza business that supports premium pricing (and exceptional profit margins). With her clientele, she is not actually competing with Domino’s, Pizza Hut, and the others we all know by name—and that’s the big benefit of premiumization of a business.

 Another type of product innovation used by Diana is membership. Many customers are in different membership levels and continuity plans, having their credit cards automatically charged a set fee the very first day of every month in exchange for coupons totaling a predetermined value, perks like special phone access, guaranteed delivery even on superbusy days, and special offers. This stabilizes the

-----

##### business’ income, locks in customers and discourages them from succumbing to some other pizza store’s discounts or advertising, and increases the frequency of purchase per customer. This is basically the same approach as Grant Miller is using at Sun Your Buns. It is a business model we’ve perfected and teach in great detail to all Glazer- Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Members.

 Celebrity and Customer Bragging Rights

 The front of her menu tells some of this story. Diana has won Canada’s Best Pizza Chef at the world pizza championship in Italy two times, Canada’s Best Pizza Chef awards from Canadian Pizza Magazine once, and been a judge at the pizza championship games. Her pizzas have taken 4th-Best Pizza ‘America’s Plate’ in New York and have been listed as one of Canada’s 30 Best Things from Reader’s Digest. She has been featured in countless magazines.

 None of this is a happy accident. She works hard and invests time and money in staying hot. She is synonymous with premium-pricing pizza and creates demand for her pizzas because of who she is. (As an aside, I teach that most top-income earners are paid as much or more for who they are—manufactured by their deliberate efforts—than what they do or deliver. Make a note.)

 If you think making yourself into a celebrity, at least to your targeted customer audience, is beyond you, how do you explain Diana doing it for herself?

 Getting, eating, and serving gourmet pizza from a celebrity chef is, for many, a validation of who they are or aspire to be. For those serving it to friends, there is a bragging-rights story to be told. These are significant factors in this business’ success, well understood by Diana and included in her own Ultimate Marketing Plan.

 All of this ultimately attracts celebrity clientele, too, which enhances the regular customers’ bragging-rights story. Serving Diana’s pizzas, they are serving the very same pizzas demanded by and catered to Sheryl Crow and Elton John.

 Constancy

 Finally, Diana is a relentless marketer to her existing customers. She puts out an excellent monthly newsletter, communicates by e-mail and social media, and makes extensive use of postcards, frequently and seasonally. The Thanksgiving postcard shown in this book, for example, was mailed to 1,054 selected customers and 174 were redeemed (about 16 percent) for a profit over costs of $3,847.74 and return on invested dollars of 482 percent. Yes, she knows her numbers. On average, her customers are touched by some marketing media of hers between 24 and 104 times per year.

 There you have it: proof that a local, small business in a rather ordinary and crowded category can create celebrity, get publicity, use
