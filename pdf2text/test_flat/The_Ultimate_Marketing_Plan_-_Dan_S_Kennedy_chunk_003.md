I’ve used this example for more than fifteen years—it’s that good. Once upon a time, two young men determined they would put themselves through college by running a small business. Early on, the business was woefully unsuccessful, and one guy bailed out on the other. Tom Monaghan, the one who stayed and stuck it out, came up with a USP that revolutionized his entire industry and made him a multimillionaire. First, his little business grabbed dominant control of the local market. Then, rapidly, his state, America, and then the world! The right USP core of the right marketing message can give you dominance in a small pond or even take you from local to global, small to gigantic.

 The USP was: “Fresh, hot pizza delivered in 30 minutes or less, guaranteed.” Ten words that brilliantly incorporate two product benefits, the meaningful specific of delivery within 30 minutes—not “quick,” “fast,” “soon,” but precisely in thirty minutes, and a guarantee. This USP has passed into advertising history, but it fueled the growth of an empire and thoroughly frustrated competitors large and small. In fact, in its heyday, I played word association with people and asked them to say

-----

##### whatever first popped into their minds when I said “pizza,” and 85 out of 100 said: “Domino’s.”

 Question: If we went out into your marketplace and asked 100 or 1,000 people to play the game, gave them the generic name for your type of business, and 85 percent of them responded by naming you, how well would you be doing?

 I had the privilege of interviewing Tom for a magazine article, and there’s no doubt that his success and that of his company has been linked to a complex list of factors, notably including his personal success philosophy and his ability to instill it in his franchisees. Today, the company has grown far beyond dependence on Tom’s influence and is about system, geographic coverage, size, as well as consumer familiarity with the brand. But there’s also no doubt that his USP was largely responsible for the rapid rise and dominance of his company in the pizza industry. It generated enough wealth to let Tom indulge his lifelong fantasy of buying the Detroit Tigers (with a $53 million price tag), collect classic cars, give most generously to his church and favorite charities, and be financially independent and secure at a relatively young age.

 That is the power of a truly great USP. It is worth working on the invention of a strong USP for your product, service, or business. And it’s not necessarily easy. I know clients who’ve taken months, even years, to finally hit on a USP that they liked and that really worked. For each, the months of frustrating brain strain have paid off handsomely.

 I should point out that you can go to very different places in the same industry with a USP. In the pizza business, one of our most celebrated Members is Diana Coutu of Diana’s Gourmet Pizzeria, a thriving business dominant in its market, but at premium price levels—upwards from $25.00 for a large pizza—and all about gourmet quality, not speed, not price. You’ll hear more about Diana later in the book.

 Products That Have USP Power

 The Christmas shopping season always brings forth a crop of interesting new kitchen appliances—one year it was the Iced Tea Pot. When I first saw this advertised, I burst out laughing. Its manufacturer went laughing all the way to the bank. Imagine: we can no longer make iced tea in any old kettle; we must have the precisely correct Iced Tea Pot.

 It reminds me of a funny phenomenon in the Southwest: the Sun Tea Jar. Because there’s searing sunshine every day, it’s easy to sun-brew tea just by putting a large jar of water outside for a few hours with tea bags in it. Obviously, any old glass jar will do the job. But on store shelves you’ll find large glass jars with the words “Sun Tea Jar” silkscreened on them for sale at four or five times what unmarked jars in the next aisle sell for. And you’ll find people cheerfully buying them. After all, what kind of goofball would brew sun tea in a pickle jar?

##### Purely through customized or proprietary appearance, these products have taken on a USP POWER that is almost invincible.

 If you really want to see this at work, visit an athletic-shoe store. I’m not much of a casual dresser, but, immediately before a day of walking at Disney World, I decided it would be smart to get some comfortable sneaks. Forty minutes and eighty-five bucks later, I left the store with a thorough education: there are shoes for walking on pavement, for walking on grass, for walking a lot, for walking a little, for jogging, for tennis, basketball, soccer, football, baseball, trampolining, with pumps, without pumps—but there are no more sneaks.

 Consider these products with USP POWER:

 Microwave dinners: for kids to make for themselves

 A stress management seminar: for career women

 A shampoo and conditioner: for swimmer’s hair

 In these instances, the USP is based on who the product is for, and by a specialization that is more illusion than reality. Stress management techniques are stress management techniques. My wager, based on extensive experience with clients in the cosmetic, beauty, and health product fields, is that the ingredients in the shampoo for swimmer’s hair are nearly identical, maybe identical to those in other shampoos. There is a nutritional supplement formulated to improve eyesight sold under one name and label to hunters, a different name and label to sewing and quilting hobbyists, and yet another different name and label to pilots. The pill is the same in all three bottles. The difference is entirely in the marketing.

 There are, of course, actual specialization-based USP products. Diana, mentioned earlier, has pizzas specifically for diabetics that are made with different ingredients than the other pizzas.

 The important thing to understand about this USP pathway is that people very much want to believe that they are unique and that there is something specifically formulated, engineered, designed, or customized just for them. The “Hey, that’s for ME!” reaction to a marketing message moves the person toward purchase quickly and decisively, and has the added virtue of making price elastic. This is, then, a very good USP question to ask yourself about your marketing message: Does it make someone perk up and say “Wow, that’s for ME!”?

 The Productization of a Service Business,
 Another Path to a USP

 Service businesses deal with intangibles; product providers deal in tangibles. Because it is generally easier and simpler to convey value in marketing tangibles than intangibles, one of the cleverest paths to a USP is to productize services. A great example comes from a tremendously

On the following pages, however, I’ll just briefly describe his productization strategy and show you one example—his membership offerings.

 As the illustration that follows shows, there are six different Sun Your Buns memberships, each with a different collection or combination of services and use privileges, each at a different monthly price, automatically charged to the member’s credit card each month. That’s a side point not to be overlooked: automatic, reoccurring income, with payment made on the first day of each month before any services are provided. Anyway, this shows how intangible services can be organized and packaged into tangible product, in this case, membership.

 To the Prospective Customer’s Question,
 Your USP Is the Answer

 When you set out to attract a new prospective customer to your business for the first time, there is one paramount question you must answer—my proprietary, copyright-protected USP question.

 Ask yourself: “Why should I choose your business/product/service versus any/every other competitive option available to me?”

 I invented this question to help businesspeople understand what a USP is and to use as a crowbar to pry ideas out of their heads, to dig out the makings of a good USP. If you can’t answer the question, you won’t get a USP, but you also have bigger problems—typically it’ll mean that you’ve been getting your customers only because of cheapest price, convenient location, your personal smile-n-shoeshine charisma, or the good fortune of being the only provider, and all these leave you very, very vulnerable to new competition. You need a USP.

 Boosting USP Power with an Irresistible Offer

 I grew up in Ohio and briefly owned an ad agency in a rural community halfway between Cleveland and Akron. At least a dozen times each winter there was enough snow and ice on the country roads to make it ill-advised if not downright impossible to go anywhere. Those days the office stayed closed and I stayed stuck at home. It was a much bigger deal then than now: Then, no one had a computer at home, and there was no Internet, no real ways of working effectively if locked out of the office.

 On one such day, in the midst of a severe blizzard, I stared out my apartment window and watched a neighbor slog through the snow, struggle through the wind, scrape ice from his car’s windshield, unfreeze the car’s door latch with a cigarette lighter, fight to start the car, and finally slip and slide off into the storm. “I wonder,” I asked myself, “what would motivate a guy to go out in weather like this?” Marketing is really about motivating people to action, often into doing something they would not do purely of their own initiative.

 Then I remembered a very similar storm just a couple of winters before when I had quite literally risked my life and badly banged up my car driving all the way from Akron, Ohio, to Murray State University in Kentucky to spend a weekend with my girlfriend of that time. For hours, it snowed so hard I honestly couldn’t see past the hood ornament of my car. Every bridge was so icy I spun my way across it. Yet I pressed on.

 Why? Waiting for me in Murray, Kentucky, was “an irresistible offer!”

-----

##### It was, as I recall, stated in twenty words that cannot be published here.

 If you can come up with an offer that irresistible, you are really on to something! Try this one on for size: for $198.00 per person, $396.00 per couple, I’ll put you up in a luxurious minisuite in an exciting Las Vegas hotel, right on the famous Strip … give you tickets to a show with famous entertainers … put a chilled bottle of champagne in your room … let you drink as much of whatever you want whether you’re at the gaming tables, playing the slots, or in one of the lounges … hand you $1,000.00 of my money to gamble with … let you keep all your winnings … and, as a bonus, guarantee you’ll at least win either a TV or a faux-diamond ring. Obviously I’m not going to give this incredible deal to everybody in the whole world. There can only be a small number of these vacation packages available, first come, first served, and the race is on. Assuming you trust the offer, how fast can you get to a phone and call in to reserve yours? Would you go out in a blizzard and drive to the post office to get your order form in the mail before the deadline?

 Well, this was a real offer, from Bob Stupak, the entrepreneurial owner of the original Vegas World hotel (now the Stratosphere) and one of the savviest marketers I know ever to take on Las Vegas. For years, Bob kept his hotel filled to capacity, kept a waiting list going, and got paid months, even years, in advance by his guests—all thanks to his invention of this irresistible offer. He used the cash flow generated by selling that package to grow his hotel from a tiny, slots-only joint to a huge, two-towered showplace. After Bob sold out, his kind of marketing exited with him, so you won’t see it on display today.

 Sometimes the most irresistible offer is free, sometimes not. You can see our own very successful free offer at Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ by accepting the invitation at the end of this book.

 Either way, with free or with an over-the-top, stacked-benefit offer like Stupak’s, you are using a value-driven USP.

 Being in the Right Place at the Right Time with the Right USP

 Once, over a lengthy lunch, I listened to a client, Ned Allen, then a developer of planned retirement communities, reminisce about his role in starting the famous Steak and Ale restaurants smack in the middle of a national recession. He had started the first restaurant with just $2,000.00, made it successful, and committed to the construction and opening of seven new restaurants just as the recession hit.

 Ned said: “We had to quickly change our thinking to match the timing we had to work with. We developed new, lower-cost, higher-perceived- value menu items, and by offering the look, feel, atmosphere, and taste of a gourmet steakhouse at a surprisingly low price, we had the right product at just the right time.”

-----

##### As I was writing the first edition of this book, Ned was not alone in predicting another three- to four-year-long recession, and he was again busy creating just the right product for it. In this case it was a new type of a manufactured home for his companies’ communities—this one with several hundred square feet less than any other home and, therefore, a substantially lower cost but an interior design that made it seem much, much bigger than it was and that had lots of nifty “gingerbread” touches that added to its perceived value.

 Ned turned his $2,000.00 investment in Steak and Ale into over $5 million when he sold out to Green Giant Foods. He then made another fortune with his new “Land Yacht” mini retirement home and his inventive approach to low-cost retirement living in Florida.

 Of course, it’s no secret that timing is a business success factor. But matching a USP with the right timing can dramatically multiply success.

 There are two basic approaches to timing and to a timing- oriented marketing message.

 One is, as Ned did with Steak and Ale, adapt the business to the opportunity or mandate of the moment. He altered his plan for an ultraupscale steakhouse to put forward a product ideally suited to the circumstances of the moment. In taking such an approach, you have to believe the circumstances of the moment are an opportunity, with at least several years’ life to them, and a way to come out of the backside of those circumstances with a business flexible enough for long-term success.

 The other is to get into a business based on timing factors. Recently, I entered into a complicated, three-way consulting relationship with a marketing expert in the financial services industry, Matt Zagula, and a fast-growth annuity field sales organization of about 1,000 agents but primed to double in size, Advisors Excel, specifically because of timing and trends. Their target market is trailing-edge boomers and seniors of a conservative investment mind, motivated by safety, security, preservation of savings (bluntly: not running out of money before they die), and trustworthy advice. The combination of the peaking of that population of prospective clients; the huge amounts of idle, investable assets they control; and the fear and anxiety engendered in them in the 2009, 2010, and into 2011 ongoing recession and economic turmoil here and abroad, Washington’s discussions of rejiggering Social Security, Obamacare, and on and on is, from a marketing standpoint, a truly perfect storm. Thus, from my standpoint, it was the ideal timing to invest a lot of time and effort in this industry.

 How “Marketing by Values” Strengthens Your Message

 One of my first mentors in business often said: “If you stand for nothing, you’ll fall for anything.” Just about anything—recession, new competition—can topple a business devoid of values.

##### Although there are many great success stories in the fast-food industry, none stand above McDonald’s. The McDonald’s empire was built on Ray Kroc’s unwavering, some would say fanatical, commitment to consistency—the idea that the food items at a McDonald’s in Iowa are identical to those found under the arches in California. Try to find anything close to this kind of consistency in any other national restaurant chain. A few have finally gotten close. But it took them decades to get there.
