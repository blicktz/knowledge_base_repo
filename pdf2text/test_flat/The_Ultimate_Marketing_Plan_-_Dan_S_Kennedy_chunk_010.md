An accountant accidentally heard me talking to a group of chiropractors about this and cornered me after the seminar. “How can I apply that idea to my office?” he wanted to know. I asked him, “What are your clients there for? What services do you offer that most clients need but few use?”

 We agreed that his clients were there, first, to get well organized financially; second, to learn how to work in tandem with him to stay that way; and third, to get inspired to refer. We determined that financial planning and estate planning were little-used services. So, out with the magazines, in with interesting educational literature (about financial planning and estate planning); out with the F. W. Woolworth paintings, in with relevant posters and signs. And, without a nickel of external advertising, his practice increased its total services rendered to existing clients by more than 30 percent and doubled its client base through referrals in a year.

 I think just about any business can turn its environment into a much more effective marketing-oriented environment with these ideas.

### Ultimate Marketing Plan Success
 Factor #6

## Heat

##### Shortly after moving to Arizona in 1978, I went through a divorce and found myself single and “in the market”—and at that time, the market was Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights at one place and one place only: an incredibly popular nightclub called Bogart’s. Anybody who was anybody frequented Bogart’s. All the beautiful people frequented Bogart’s. In a city of three-quarters of a million people, there might as well have been only one nightclub. The line to get in the front door was often a hundred people long, but if you knew somebody, you could be granted the great and glorious privilege of buying a $100.00 membership card entitling you to enter via standing in the line at the back door, which was often shorter.

 I was there on a Thursday night when it was as I’ve just described. But that same Saturday, I returned to find a nearly empty Bogart’s. “What happened?” I asked the bartender. “Did they drop the bomb and forget to tell me?”

 He shrugged his shoulders and said, “When you’re hot you’re hot, when you’re not you’re not.”

 Bogart’s never got hot again. Only a short time later, it ceased to exist. You can sure go from hot to cold in a hurry in that business—and in many others. Best not to get complacent.

#### Ultimate Marketing Sin #3:
 Taking Your Customer’s Loyalty for Granted

##### There was a time in America when fads were rare—the hula hoop— but brand loyalty and business loyalty was the norm. A Ford man was a Ford man for life, a Chevy man a Chevy man for life, and in all likelihood their fathers were, respectively, Ford and Chevy men, too. At the local level, your family doctor was your family doctor, for life. The customers of a local restaurant could be counted on for Friday fish fry every Friday. Until we suddenly weren’t. We were a Buy American country, too. That has all changed, yet individually a whole lot of business owners act as if it hasn’t. A whole lot of business owners foolishly expect, even feel entitled to, loyalty from their customers. Sorry, but these days you need to get hot all over again, every new day.

 Why do you want heat? To keep current customers interested. To spur them to tell others about you. To attract new customers. To access tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars of free advertising, in forms of publicity, media coverage, viral spread of online media, and person-to-person word of mouth, sometimes called “buzz.” You may think the lifeblood of your business is cash, but cash flowing in is actually a result. The lifeblood of business is interest. People being interested in it, staying interested in it, thinking about it, talking about it. That’s heat.

 We can get our clues to heat from fads and from peer pressure, popularity-driven products. Hula hoop then, Silly Bandz recently (but probably extinct by the time you read this). Apple—its iPad. Things you have to have or you’re embarrassed by not having them. Even at age thirty-eight, almost everybody’s still trying to be one of the cool kids. No, you may not be setting out to create an actual fad or fad product, but the things that make a pure fad work can help any business break free of the bounds of boring ordinariness and give it some heat.

 The Fad Everybody Remembers: An April Fool’s Gag and a Sudden Millionaire

 The Pet Rock was conceived on April Fool’s Day, 1975, in a bar. Gary Dahl was hanging out there with coworkers at a small ad agency when conversation turned to pets—and everybody had stories except him. So he started describing the virtues and drawbacks of his Pet Rock. Hard to walk on a leash but he can play dead like nobody’s business. His name’s Rocky but it doesn’t matter—he never comes when he’s called. It turned into a comedy routine by committee, with everybody

-----

##### chiming in and having a good time with the fictional pet. In a spurt of odd behavior, Dahl went home and went to work on the goofy idea.

 What made the gag work as a product was the Training Manual he wrote that shipped with every rock, basically a parody of a dog training manual. First sales were at a trade show, because he knew if it caught on, distribution would be everything; people had to see it on shelves everywhere they turned. Store buyers snapped it up, and 3,000 were sold at the show. Neiman-Marcus even ordered 500 units. Since he had no capital, he chased free media exposure. Newsweek gave Gary and his Pet Rock a half page in November. He did interviews on 1,500 radio shows, there were nearly that many newspaper stories, and by Christmas they shipped the one millionth Pet Rock. Testament to the power of publicity, proof that free advertising can replace and even be more valuable than paid advertising. And Gary had his first million dollars. That was thirty- five years ago, and there’s still a lot of people who know about the Pet Rock.

 I believe I was the last guy in America to buy Nehru jackets. I bought two: a gold silk one with gold buttons, and a green velvet one, which came with white pearl buttons and matching pendant. Honest to God, they went out of style the next day. The fashionistas heard I’d finally gotten on board and that was the end of that. I imagine I could demolish Twitter overnight just by participating. (I don’t. I famously refuse to use the Internet at all.) Before my Nehru jackets, of course, there were countless fashion crazes. If you were of my father’s era, you might have had peg-leg pants. Of my grandfather’s age, spats and a pocket watch.

 Kids take to fads even better than adults—although you shouldn’t miss the fact that most of those people standing in long lines and even sleeping in tents in line all night to get the latest Apple doohickey are adults. But kids and fads marry more easily and more often. The hula hoop. Tramp tats. Same age group now. Which brings me to something you are undoubtedly already familiar with—Silly Bandz. The forty- seven-year-old guy in Toledo, Ohio, who concocted this thing has wound up selling 24-packs at $4.95 retail to the tune of $100 million and so far birthed a myriad of knockoffs that have racked up another $100 million combined. At one point, he turned down $10 million for his company. He has gone from 20 to 400 U.S. employees plus 3,000 in China, in one year. Peak sales pace has been 1 million packs a week. He has raced to develop spinoff products and do licensing deals with Marvel, Nickelodeon, Disney, Quiznos, you name it. He had his factories and offices under full surveillance so he could look in via his laptop. He did take time off to finish 187th out of 3,000 in the World Series of Poker; otherwise, he has been working nonstop, long hours, seven days a week, sometimes sleeping at the plant, for two years. Industry experts say the only question is when it will stop, and most think it’ll stop as if hit in the head with a brick. He thinks he has five years. I’d guess less.

-----

##### Here’s what a lot of you will like: The company has yet to spend a dollar on paid advertising. Sales are entirely viral, kid to kid to kid, and via Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The magic ingredient that makes that possible, though, is not the social media so much as it is the trading. There’s a trading frenzy. Kids love to trade; I have watched the phenomenon firsthand at Disney with their pin-trading, moneymaking juggernaut. No wonder Disney got this—and projects selling 20 million packs of Silly Bandz by year’s end. Being banned at schools will help sales, too. But the main life force here, that can be moved elsewhere, is involvement. Some mechanism for the customer to involve his friends, and those friends to be nearly forced to get involved, so that buying multiplies: 1 gets 10, 10 gets 100, 100 gets 1,000, and 1,000 gets 10,000—fast. MySpace did it: anybody who took a space had to drag all their friends there or what was the point? You know that pressure; you’ve gotten it about LinkedIn—well, that’s how I and those in my circle communicate now, so you have to get involved, too, or I guess you won’t be hearing from me. The peer pressure to use social media among kids and adults is enormous, intense, and relentless, just as is the kid pressure to have an arm loaded up with Silly Bandz— otherwise you can’t trade, so you’re a dorky outcast. Silly Bandz is fueled as all fads are: just by the angst of not being cool. Think iPad. It’s fueled like all fads by sell-it-by-zealot, too. But beyond that, Silly Bandz is fueled by this involvement multiplier, a baked-in component that forces multiplication. It’s not just about owning them; it’s about trading them.

 “Forced commerce” is a very interesting idea, by the way. As I said, it occurs at Disney via pin-trading. It occurs differently in in-home party plan selling where everybody attending feels obligated to buy something. To a degree, it works with fundraising: people buy things they don’t necessarily want from kids raising money for a school, band, team, or a cause. Few are ever able to combine it with the mass, high- speed, viral force that MySpace got, then Twitter got, and that Silly Bandz has.

 A client of mine, Darin Spindler, brought all this—including the multiplier effect—together for his business KidsBowlFree.com and put more than 1 million kids and families into their active user database in a matter of weeks as a result.

 The pertinent question is: What can propel your customers to a frenzy in recruiting everybody they know to follow them to you?

 Another lesson of Silly Bandz is the relationship of heat to speed and speed to heat. If you want to get people excited, something exciting has to be happening in a compressed period of time. When such speed occurs, nothing can be permitted to slow it. The owner of Silly Bandz even pays a big fat premium to fly the manufactured bands over from China, cutting delivery to four days from four weeks by boat, so he can keep pumping them out into the marketplace with not even an hour of

-----

##### “sold out” anywhere. He’s been working like a banshee. He’s in a mad race to go as far as he can as fast as he can, scooping up all he can, with certain knowledge the end is near. Most people never approach their business in this way, ever. They plod as if on an endless marathon with no sense of urgency. They never engineer mad sprints. Well, if you are going to grab peoples’ undivided attention and get them all fired up and involved in something, it better be held to a short period of time with enormous intensity. That is transferable to a promotion for any business. You can’t make fire rubbing sticks together s-l-o-w-l-y.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #9:
 Constant Change

##### We are so interested in the new and different that we express it in vernacular. When we greet someone, we say, “What’s new?” We don’t ask, “Hey, what’s old? What’s the same as it was the last time I ran into you?” Why don’t we ask that? Because we just don’t care about what’s old.

 If you want to keep your customers, keep your customers interested, and keep getting your customers to tell others about you, you’ve got to keep coming up with good answers to the question “What’s new?”

 During what insiders refer to as “the dark ages” after Walt’s death, the Disney empire was crumbling—because there was nothing new going on. Eventually, Michael Eisner came in and recreated the magic of constant, frenetic innovation, and the fortunes of the Disney business machine have never been brighter. In the post-Eisner period, Bob Iger has continued the willingness to invest in constant change.

 Probably the best example, though, is McDonald’s. Hardly a two- week period passes without something new or something different going on at McDonald’s: a new product, an incredible offer, a new game, a new free gift. “We can invent,” Ray Kroc once said, “faster than the others can copy,” and that they do. So should you.

 Eight Great Ways to Get Hot And Keep Getting Hot All Over Again

 1. Get Prestigious Recognition

 Chances are, your local newspaper or entertainment magazine publishes an annual or semiannual “Best of (your city’s name)” issue. You have publications with columnists, radio shows with hosts, and TV

-----

##### shows with reporters that all need to be wooed by you—they do have influence in your market! Having well-known people patronize your business and having the media talking about your business makes everybody else want to join the “in crowd.”

 If you market within an industry niche rather than to the general public, there’s less media, but its publishers and editors tend to be more accessible. Some years back, when I was doing a great deal of work with the dental profession, I was able to get myself named as “Marketing Guru of the Year” by an industry trade journal. It wasn’t all that difficult. I cultivated a relationship with the publisher over several months.

 At least a half dozen of our Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Members have managed to maneuver their companies onto the Inc. 500 Fastest-Growing Companies list or Entrepreneur magazine’s lists of top franchisors. I’ve gotten my books, at different times, onto the BusinessWeek magazine and Amazon bestseller lists as well as Inc. Magazine’s 100 Best Business Books lists.

 Any or all of these “honors” can be had for less enterprise than you’d imagine—it’s important to investigate the specific criteria of every such opportunity. Such an award has long life but can also be leveraged into publicity in local and national media. It is news.

 At Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™, we’ve created our own annual awards competitions, for Marketer of the Year, Service Business Marketer of the Year, Retailer Marketer of the Year, Professional Practice Marketer of the Year, etc., etc., and many of the winners of these awards do a good job of leveraging the news into publicity in their industry media, local media, and online media. Every Member is eligible to compete.

 2. New Products

 Voraciously read trade magazines, business magazines, and newspapers—and frequently attend conventions, expos, and trade shows in search of interesting, exciting new products you can offer to your customers. Or create your own from scratch.

 Let the fast-food industry be your model. Pay attention to how often Taco Bell, Burger King, Arby’s, McDonald’s, KFC, etc. run ad campaigns about a specific new product or a limited availability product. McDonald’s has “big news” a few times a year when it brings back the McRib sandwich, for a limited time. Yes, this works as news!

 If you can’t figure out how to go this far, at least make your regular products “feel” new. At Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™, for example, we have an annual Members’ convention called the Moneymaking/Marketing SuperConference. It happens in the same month every year and, in structure, is the same every year. It includes speakers, workshops, an exhibit hall, awards, and social functions. It

-----

##### could get stale, but every year we do three important things to make it feel new: one, Bill Glazer and I develop entirely new presentations in keeping with a new and different theme every year; two, we make its marketing thematic; and three, we bring in one, usually two, one-time- only celebrity entrepreneurs as speakers for meet and greets and for Members’ photo opportunities. The 2011 SuperConference’s theme, as example, different from all prior years’ themes, is “Build a Better Business,” so construction industry language and images are used throughout the marketing. As something new—this year only— attendees leave with “blueprints” for implementation of strategies from every workshop, the exhibits are in a Hard Hat Zone, and early registrants get a limited edition, souvenir denim “work shirt.” There’s no reason you couldn’t retheme your entire business month to month.
