7. Letting communications with present customers disintegrate to
 the boring and routine, letting the experience of the repeat or regular customer suffer while investing heavily in creating the best experience for the new customer.

 Definition, Please

 Notes for those unfamiliar with direct marketing terminology: ACQUISITION refers to whatever is done under the umbrella of attracting or obtaining new customers. MARKETING FUNNEL refers to your organized process or system through which leads/prospects are first brought in, converted to buyers, buyers developed to customers, additional products sold, etc. RETENTION broadly refers to the keeping of a customer, typically assessed in simple terms, i.e., number of weeks, months, years, or visits, but more sophisticated marketers factor in the comparative value of those retained, such as transaction sizes and total, accumulated spending, frequency, ascension, and referral productivity. If you are not familiar with the most important math measurements regarding acquisition and retention, refer to Chapters 42 and 43 in my book No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits.

#### Ultimate Marketing Secret Weapon #14: Make the Customer Feel Important, Appreciated, and Respected

##### The Attitude of Gratitude

 I think the kind of customer service that makes customers feel important, appreciated, and respected begins not as policies and procedures but, instead, as an attitude of gratitude. It’s easy to get caught up in our work and in our business’ problems (and even the most successful business has them) and lose touch with how fortunate we are to even have the opportunity to own our own businesses, exercise control over our own incomes, engage in activity we find interesting and rewarding, and have a clientele capable of and willing to support us. I try to remind myself of this often, and really, really remind myself of it on especially grumpy days. Given my utter absence of academic and professional qualifications, I could just as easily be wearing a paper hat and asking “Would you like fries with that?” as operating a practice as a trusted marketing and business advisor, author, and speaker with a seven-figure yearly income. When I stop at the local convenience store en route to the racetrack where my racehorses are stabled, I see the haggard, weary counterperson and think: “There, but for the grace of arrogance, ambition, initiative, persistence, and my clientele, go I.”

 When someone gives us money for our expertise, professional service, ideas, or products—or in patronage of our place of business, catalog, or website—they choose us from a vast array of other possible choices. When there is responsive audience for my next book or seminar or your Home-Style Meatloaf Week at your restaurant, we are recipients of peoples’ interest, dollars, and perhaps loyalty amidst the clutter of intense competition. Most peoples’ money is not easily come by. When they give it to us, they may have postponed or gone without something else they also needed or wanted. It’s important to think about your customers in these terms, not as numbers, statistics, or accounts. Think gratefully about each of your customers and each time they return to patronize you, rather than feel entitled to that patronage or presume it will continue.

 I was in a doctor’s office one day when he asked his receptionist, “What’s our body count today?” And that’s not uncommon. I’ve heard customers called bodies, numbers, marks, even chumps. I’ve seen owners and managers rage on and on about how miserable their customers are—in front of their staffs! These attitudes have to translate into actions, as all attitudes do.

-----

##### Although it may sound simplistic, getting maximum total value from your customers begins with valuing them—then translating that attitude of gratitude into action. Finding ways to express simple gratitude individually and en masse and publicly to your customers must be part of your Ultimate Marketing Plan.

 The Customer Appreciation Event

 Little expressions of gratitude matter, but there’s nothing quite like a periodic big event, presented to customers as an act of appreciation and used as an opportunity for customers to naturally introduce family, friends, neighbors, and associates to your business.

 To witness one such customer appreciation event done brilliantly, I visited our Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle™ Member Alan Reed in Idaho. Here’s the story, as it originally appeared in an issue of The No B.S. Marketing Letter:

 I am in Idaho Falls, Idaho, at Diamond Member Alan Reed’s Dairy, where they have a herd of some 200 cows producing milk— requiring two shifts a day of milking, thousands of gallons; a production plant for their milk, cheese, and, most famously, their ice cream; a store of their own; and a fleet of delivery trucks servicing 2,800 homes (up from only 300 a few years ago) and wholesale accounts, such as local supermarkets. I am here with my video crew for their annual Family Day, when customers and their families and friends are invited to a day of pony and horse and wagon rides, a cow milking contest, roping contest, other games, free cookout, farm and plant tours, fifty-cent ice cream cones, and other in-store discounts, which this year … despite the previous night’s 75 mile per hour winds, area power outages, and generator breakdowns at the plant … is attended by some 3,000 people. Not a typo. 3,000.

 At the event, names, addresses, and e-mail addresses are captured, some immediate sign-ups for home delivery secured, but mostly, via follow-up marketing to those identified as noncustomers, hundreds of new accounts will be added and hundreds more new store customers created. Inactive customers are reactivated. Heck, the next generation of customers is seeded.

 Many of the people who come stay on the grounds for several hours; meet up with kids, grandkids, grandparents, and neighbors; and use the picnic grounds. Some live within miles; some have driven hundreds of miles. There is a county fair atmosphere to it. If you’ve never lived in a Midwestern or heartland of America small town or rural community, never been to county fairs in these parts, and seen farms only at Farmville.com, this would be a foreign and strange scene to you. To me, perfectly natural.

 Regardless of where you live or do business or your type of business, this—the annual (or periodic) customer appreciation

-----

##### event—is transferable, and elements of it are potentially valuable for you, too. The annual big event itself is something I’ve taught for many years and successfully goaded some business owners into doing well—there was, for example, for years, a Florida chiropractor (now retired) who got attendance at the family-days event held at his lakeside home up to 2,000+ and then needed no advertising or marketing all year long; the year’s new patients came from the nonpatient new “friends” brought there by patients, met in person that day, and gently followed up on with his newsletter afterward … producing over 300 new patients each year, average value $3,000.00 = $900,000.00. Done right, and made the kind of event customers bring family and friends to, just about any local or regional business could create the same once-a-year new customer/prospect collection for themselves. I’ve seen it done by an insurance agent, a martial arts academy, and a bookstore. Note: You can’t do this on the cheap. It can’t be blatantly commercial and pitch-fest-like.

 An important element that makes this work is “community”—and peoples’ desire for it. Of course, places like Idaho Falls have it woven throughout the fabric; people stay put here, multigeneration family businesses and farms are common, kids go away to college but come back to their hometown to live, raise their families and work, and much centers around family, church, and community activities—
 so something like Alan’s event is a natural part and extension of that. It is a reunion and gathering place in much the same way as the community’s actual big events—their Frontier Days or Apple Festival or county fair—are. But it is also true that considerable effort is invested in making Reed customers part of a full-fledged, unique community. If your customers do not feel part of a community, you are, in my opinion, failing. And the number who would turn out at your big event is a good reality check on this. Social media can help facilitate this (although Reed’s Dairy uses none), but in and of itself it is not enough and certainly not a substitute.

 Most businesses remain transactional: They sell things to customers and customers buy things from them, and some of these businesses try to put fences around customers or at least foster loyalty defined as retention or frequency of patronage via quality, service, and mechanical means, like loyalty reward programs or pain of disconnect. Nothing wrong with any of that, but you should understand it falls far, far, far short of people belonging to a community. I grew up in a town where you stopped by the gas station even on days you didn’t need gas, just to have a cup of coffee with the guys and whatever other folks were there—buying gas, having cars serviced, or also just stopping by “on their rounds” to say hi. It wasn’t just a gas station; it was a place of community.

##### Every drug store and Kresge store had a soda fountain and lunch counter for this same reason; hardware stores had rocking chairs on their porches and chairs inside around a stove in winter, and in small towns still do. (As seen on Green Acres.) The Starbucks third-place concept is a throwback. In this manner, these businesses transcend their commodities and transactions to relationships and community. The ability to sustain prosperity in the unprosperous times now with us and in the near future may very well rest on how strong the connection to your community your customers feel.

 If you think your business is too giant and global, think again. Go into your numbers. You’ll find the 80/20 rule in play, which will shrink your important number considerably. Within that 20 percent from which 80 percent of your sales and/or profits and/or best-by-far TCV comes from will be 20 percent (20 percent of the 20 percent) making the greatest contribution. Even big businesses are powered by relatively small numbers. They are most likely to respond to community, and, for them, community can be created.

##### Formal Reward Programs

 You are familiar with these. Airlines started frequent flyer reward programs, and banks, retailers, and others followed that model. These days, many consumers’ wallets and key chains are filled with cards from the reward programs they’re members of. In B2B situations, many business owners try to make virtually every needed purchase through a credit card offering reward points. In some cases, with major corporations and chains, these programs have been so prostituted and commoditized, I don’t think they really do much anymore to control choice or provoke loyalty. However, for many small merchants and midsized companies with good relationships with customers, the addition of an attractive rewards program can make a measurable difference in retention and frequency of patronage.

 The world-class expert in this is the cofounder and CEO of Royalty Rewards, a long-time client and friend of mine, Rory Fatt. His company not only provides a turnkey, one-stop shop for standardized or customized rewards programs for every kind and size of business, but it integrates it with monthly promotions and marketing programs, all implemented and administered for the business owner. They’ll install and run your rewards program for you. For information, visit www.royaltyrewards.com.

 Make Everyone on Your Team an Ambassador of Customer- Service Diplomacy

 To excel in customer service—better, in customer enthusiasm— every member of your team has to understand, accept, and live it as a priority.

 Surely you’ve heard that adage: the customer is always right. But you don’t have to be in business very long before you know how totally false

-----

##### that is. Although they are thankfully a minority, some customers are grossly unreasonable, virtually impossible to satisfy. Taking “the customer is always right” approach dooms your efforts before they begin. Neither you nor the members of your team will be able to live up to that ideal. I’m not even sure that you should if you could. From time to time, there’ll be a customer you will be better off without. I have occasionally “terminated” customers and clients in my businesses, I think for good cause, and always found that the vacuum quickly filled with better business.

 A better, more accurate approach comes from customer-service training expert, Frank Cooper, who says, “The customer signs your paycheck.” With that in mind, we can design a Customer-Service Diplomacy Program that makes sense but doesn’t force us to aspire to the unattainable.

 Diplomacy is all about being Old World gracious. If you’ve ever been to a very formal party at a very wealthy person’s home, an old country club, or an embassy, you know what I mean. Walt Disney insisted that his customers be thought of, always referred to, and treated as “guests,” drawing the analogy that if you treat the customer as you would an honored guest in your home, you’ll rarely err. That has remained ingrained in Disney culture long after Walt’s death.

 I’d suggest incorporating these key ideas into your own clearly defined, written, taught, and managed Customer-Service Diplomacy Program:

-----

#### 1. Greet the Customer as a Welcome, Honored, Important Guest

##### This means that the customer can never be an interruption. Those who answer your telephones or greet customers when they enter your premises must be professionally educated in good business manners and must use them.

 If you’ve ever walked up to a cash register in a department store and stood waiting while two sales clerks finished their conversation, you’ve experienced the opposite of this idea—and I’ll bet you resented it. I occasionally catch clerks in stores actually talking on their cell phones to some distant party while operating the cash register and bagging my merchandise. I believe it should be legal to shoot them.

-----

#### 2. Be Able to Answer Customers’ Questions Knowledgeably

##### One of the reasons for the early success and growth of the Home Depot chain of hardware, housewares, and do-it-yourself product warehouse stores was the surprising helpfulness and knowledge of their employees. Their idea was to give the kind of customer service found in old, sole-proprietor hardware stores, but in a modern superstore environment with discount prices. Whether or not they are presently true to this early value, I leave you to judge. But it was major factor in their early success.

 Anybody in your operation who a customer can get to must be knowledgeable, informed, and articulate, and if you have staff members who cannot be knowledgeable experts about your products and services, then they must have a good means of immediately getting an answer for any customer at any time that the place of business is open.

 Some years back, while masquerading as a customer and secretly shopping some residential communities on behalf of a client, I asked one salesman a question like this: “If I give you a deposit today on Property A and then want to change my mind and switch it to Property B before thirty days are up, can I do that?” The salesman honestly didn’t know. He should have. But he didn’t. And at 4:45 P.M. there was no one he could go to or call to get the answer. So he stalled. Had I been a real customer, this would have been the equivalent of stopping a sale dead in its tracks. (By the way, the correct answer was yes.)

 Incidentally, what you think your salespeople or other staff members know and what they know, what answers you assume they’re giving customers and the actual answers they’re dispensing, are very, very, very often two different things with a shockingly wide gap in between. If you are not monitoring and enforcing knowledge and scripted answers, I promise, what you are getting absent such monitoring is costing you money and undermining your marketing. The axiom is accurate: Don’t expect what you don’t (constantly) inspect.

-----

#### 3. Prevent Policies from Driving Away Customers

##### I have given up counting—I no longer know (or care)—how many times I’ve been told, “That’s our policy.” In most cases, my response is, “I’ve got a policy, too. My policy is never to spend another nickel with your business after I’ve been told about your policy.”

 Of course, you have to have policies. I run businesses; I know that. But you’d better remember this one: As a prison warden, you can make up all the policies you want to because you’ve got a captive audience— they can’t leave. Your customer, however, has the final option. He can put his money back in his pocket and walk away, never to return. Nothing incenses customers more than being quoted policy.

 The very best policy is to create ways to say yes to customers’ wants and needs. I’ve been in restaurants where NO SUBSTITUTIONS is imprinted on the menu in big, bold type; where, if asked, the waitress snaps, “No separate checks.” Their policy is “Our way or the highway.” An awful lot of basically good customers choose the highway.

 Be very careful of permitting logistics or your or staff’s convenience to interfere with the most effective marketing, sales activity, or customer diplomacy.

#### 4. Have a Process for Handling Complaints in Place
