Many people answer the best hamburgers in town, or a secret sauce, or a great cook, or a commanding name, logo, or character, like Ronald McDonald, or a huge bankroll for a major advertising campaign. But Gary’s answer was: a starving crowd. Success factor #3 is a starving crowd or the close equivalent—highly motivated, highly responsive customers—for your products, services, or business. It is my contention this is paramount, above all else, more important than all other factors.

 Learning the Lesson

 My first introduction to the idea of targeted marketing was so strange that I’ve never forgotten it, and the more I’ve learned about the idea, the more I’ve appreciated that early lesson.

 A man with zero training in marketing was running a direct-sales company, selling distributorships for his products at $5,000.00 each. His system was to send out a fairly expensive direct-mail package, get back inquiries, and turn those over to staff salespeople called “recruiters,” who then phoned or visited the prospective distributors and tried to get them to attend a group meeting. As you can see, this process adds up to a sizeable investment in each prospect. And, for a while, he was literally mailing to the White Pages—to everybody and anybody. He knew this was incredibly inefficient, but he had no idea how to do it differently. One day, he took notice of the odd fact that a huge majority of his successful distributors had crew cuts. This was in the late sixties and crew cuts were supposedly “out.” But his guys with crew cuts were stubborn individualists, about forty to fifty years old, living in small towns and working in blue-collar jobs—truck drivers, policemen, high school coaches.

 To his credit, he didn’t just take notice of this odd fact. He acted on it. He sent his recruiters out to barber shops all over the state and bought the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of their customers with crew cuts! His success rate with these grade-A prospects was phenomenal.

 When he first told me about this, about twenty years ago, I laughed at him. The whole thing sounded ridiculous to me. Maybe it just did to

##### you, too. But now, with 20/20 hindsight, I can tell you that he had stumbled on to the essence of brilliant marketing. He had found one of the three means of picking the right targets: demographics.

 This Is for You, Too

 Every product, every service, every business either appeals or has the potential to appeal much more strongly to a certain definable group of people than it appeals to all people.

 Despite this fact, most marketers get to their grade-A prospects only by lucky accident—by throwing out their message to everybody and letting the right people find it. This is like getting a message to your aunt in Pittsburgh by dropping 100,000 copies of your letter out of an airplane as you fly over Pennsylvania. I call this “blind archery.” Blindfolded, given an unlimited supply of arrows, and some degree of luck, you’ll hit the target eventually. And you will hit it once out of every x times you shoot off an arrow. Of course, you’ll also hit innocent bystanders, bushes, fence posts, stray animals, and everything else around.

 And arrows are one thing. Dollars are another. Nobody has an unlimited supply of dollars to play with. For a time, in boom years, there was so much money sloshing around and so many people spending so freely on so many things, many business owners got away with playing blind archery with their marketing. The costly waste and inefficiency was concealed by sales and profits that were more than satisfactory. Super-investor Warren Buffet is widely credited with the quote: “You can’t see who’s naked until the tide goes out.” And that’s what happened. The recession arrived and the consumer spending tide went out, and a lot of business leaders were shocked by their own nakedness as well as others’. Today, the cost of gross inefficiency in marketing is unaffordable and dangerous. No business is safe from the damage brought on by untargeted marketing.

 Conversely, any and every business, from the tiniest to the largest, can convert to efficient targeted marketing. There is some way for every business to determine who is a “best customer” and then to focus resources on reaching out to and for those exact customers. If you have the will to do it, you can find a way to do it.

 A Few Examples of Targeted Marketing in Action

 Example #1

 A fellow in the carpet-cleaning business told me that direct mail never paid off for him. When we investigated the area he had mailed to, we found a very high percentage of renters. Over 70 percent were tenants, not homeowners. “How’d you pick this area, anyway?” I asked him.

 “It was the same zip code as my office,” he answered.

 “Ever drive it, like you were shopping for a home?”

-----

##### “Nope,” he admitted.

 “Let’s go,” I said, and off we went, driving up and down about thirty streets in the area for a couple of hours. We saw many homes in desperate need of repair or paint, poorly maintained lawns, and cars in the driveways and carports five years old or older, some up on jacks being fixed.

 “Based on what we’ve seen outside, who would you expect to see inside these houses?” I asked. ‘Nuff said.

 The antidote to this direct-mail failure was not fixing the literature; it was simply selecting a better target. The carpet-cleaning guy spent the next few days driving the neighborhoods in various zip codes surrounding his office until he found one where the homes shouted pride of ownership.

 In the first area, his mailing had pulled less than one-fourth of 1 percent in response. Mailing to residents in the new area, the same mailing pulled over 2½ percent.

 Now, get this: this wasn’t so much a demographic distinction as a psychographic one. The neighborhoods he wound up mailing to successfully did not have significantly higher priced or more valuable homes; the residents weren’t of different age, education, or affluence. In terms of raw demographics, the winners and losers were about the same. The difference was in their attitude about their homes. Pride of ownership is a mindset, not a demographic statistic. This is important because it is very likely that your best customers share a mindset, philosophy, way of thinking, or habitual behavior that makes them especially receptive to you and your products or services.

 Example #2

 Many of my clients in very different businesses have discovered the power and leverage of properly targeted marketing. One, in a rather curious business, ran a foreign brides brokerage, helping frustrated American men meet and marry women from dozens of different foreign countries. Others in this unusual field typically advertise and sell directories or memberships to websites where the women themselves advertise and the men shop. But he provided a comprehensive matchmaking service at significant fees, and needed clients who were quite serious about their goal of finding and marrying an imported wife and who were able and willing to pay substantial fees to do so.

 Historically, he did all of his advertising in general publications, like USA Today. At one of my group coaching meetings, I asked him who his clients were. He initially said, “Just about everybody,” and named ministers, salespeople, business owners, truck drivers, and doctors. Pushed hard by me and others in the group, he went home and closely examined his records and found that over 50 percent of his clients were twice-divorced, long-haul truck drivers. Over half! This quickly led to a

##### dramatic change in allocation of ad dollars, focusing on targeted media like truck drivers’ magazines, his own “magalog” distributed in free take-one racks placed in truck stops, and other niche media. Profits soared!

 Example #3

 Where did founder Tom Monaghan open up his early Domino’s Pizza locations? In college towns, near college campuses. Why? Who do you know who eats pizza more often than college kids? Also, smoking the funny weed was immensely popular among college kids, and in case you don’t know it, marijuana makes people very, very, very hungry, in desperate and urgent need of lots of carbs, and unable to go out and get them. I have no idea whether or not Tom thought through that, and if he did, I doubt he’d admit it, but he’s a bright guy, so you decide for yourself. The point is that, quite literally, he found a starving crowd.

 The Three Best Ways to Target Market

 The first and most commonly used target marketing is geographic targeting, just like my friend in the carpet-cleaning business did. Most businesses that need their customers to come to their store or office or that need to schedule appointments and send salespeople out obviously need to restrict the geography of their marketing. They advertise only in the local newspaper or shopper, use coupon decks mailed to their own or adjacent zip codes, and target direct mailers to those same zips. Relatively recently, it became possible and practical to use the Internet —the world wide web—to advertise local businesses to local consumers, too.

 There’s nothing wrong and many things right with this. If you’ve never read Russell Conwell’s classic book Acres of Diamonds or heard Earl Nightingale’s great recorded message “Greener Pastures,” you should; you’ll gain new appreciation for the “value” awaiting discovery right in your own backyard. Nothing wrong with the backyard at all. In fact, many businesses neglect it for no good reason whatsoever.

 However, I suggest keeping three things in mind when you are going to select your target markets via geographical considerations:

-----

#### 1. Make Sure That the Apparent Nature of the People Living There Works for You

##### This is a cheap (in fact, free) and very simplistic look at demographics, but it is nonetheless effective. Do what my carpet- cleaning entrepreneur and I did: drive the neighborhoods. Look around and get a feel for the people who live there. You can tell a lot just by driving around. What does the condition of the homes and yards tell you? What kinds of cars predominate? If compacts and sporty cars, think young marrieds. If big sedans and luxury cars, assume middle- aged. Do you see a lot of tricycles and skateboards, or a lot of basketball backboards on the garages? You may very well be able to choose preferable neighborhoods or zip code areas this way. You may also discover things that will cause you to modify your themes, copy, and offers.

 Whether your geographic market is local, regional, certain states, all across the country but only the small towns, or whatever, within it there are divisions or “clumps” of different kinds of customers. You want to rule out hunks of any geographic area you’re marketing in. You want to be able to skip streets or blocks or neighborhoods or apartment buildings or entire zip codes. You want to reduce the size of your prospect universe so that you are using your resources efficiently and can spend more on each “best” prospect because you are spending less, little, or nothing on bad prospects.

 Get this: Your net profits from marketing will be determined more by your diligence with this discriminatory selection of prospects than by anything else.

#### 2. Once You Find a Geographic Target Market That Works for You, Work It to Death

##### Dominate it. People in the real-estate business use the term “farming.” When a real-estate agent farms an area, he strives to become its best-known and loved agent. He mails to every homeowner in the area, goes around door to door and introduces himself, distributes a monthly newsletter, sends holiday greeting cards, even gets creatively involved with the community: giving away free pumpkins at Halloween, sponsoring a neighborhood block party and swap meet, and so on. It’s a lot of work, but it’s smart work. If you get adept at using media, particularly direct mail, you can replace much or even all of the manual labor stuff.

 There’s no reason any retail or service business can’t follow this example. If I had a florist shop, a restaurant, or a car wash, I could do exactly the same thing in a targeted residential or business neighborhood. I would frequently mail to everybody. I would take an hour each day and go out and personally introduce myself to the neighbors. I would send holiday greetings. I would throw a party. I would lead a charitable effort in the area for a worthwhile group.

 A second selection method has to do with demographics. Demographics are the statistical and behavioral things given groups of people have in common. Demographic selection can be as simple as targeting a preferred age group or as complex as targeting women age thirty-five to forty-five who have careers, read both the Wall Street Journal and Cosmopolitan, carry the American Express card, travel by air at least three times a year, and buy clothes by mail order or online.

 Every medium has and can provide detailed demographic information about its readers, listeners, viewers, or customers. While some media’s data are more reliable than others, most are pretty accurate—the media need this same data to make good editorial, programming, or product selections. You can and should take this information very seriously when making media decisions.

 If you’re renting mailing lists, the same kind of data is available for most lists. More significantly, you can “merge-purge” two or more lists together to get exactly the prospective customers you want. It can be quite costly to do sophisticated merge-purges, but even so it’s usually a bargain compared to the costly waste of playing blind archery with direct mail.

 I’m often asked about lists—how do I find the names of my ideal prospects? Well, good news: privacy is dead. There are compiled demographic lists, built from publicly available data, using home

-----

##### ownership, age, marital status, household income, net worth, education, occupations, and similar factors to assemble specific prospect groups out of any geography. Of more certain value, there are response lists, usually offering the same demographic breakouts, but also made up of known responders, inquirers, buyers, subscribers, or donors. Just for example, last I looked, you can rent the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty for Animals list of 260,000+ donors, sorted by donation amount, frequency of donation, gender, age, and geography. As many undoubtedly own pets, a local pet store or a national pet products catalog company might find portions or even the entirety of this list productive. But so might a local bookstore promoting a book signing with an author of a book about dogs.

 List research is best conducted yourself, painstakingly, at www.SRDS.com. It is not as easy as just calling a local list broker and leaving it up to them, unless all you want is a demographic list compiled from public data. You can also find demographic lists online at www.Info USA.com. But if you’re going after response lists, go to SRDS.com.

 A few warnings: First of all, this is more complicated than most small-business owners have the stomach for. I can’t help that. If you refuse to engage in smart and sophisticated marketing work because it is difficult or difficult to understand at first, I have neither great advice nor sympathy for you. Small income and long-standing frustration with small income is the deserved reward for insisting on having an easy- button or doing nothing at all.

 Second, if you’re a small, local business, when you go into the list rental marketplace, you’re going to bump up against minimums of 5,000 names or more. And if you’re looking for something from, say, the Artichokes of the Month Club list, there won’t be 5,000 or maybe even 1,000 in your little community. You may have to rent 5,000 but will only be able to use 460, unless you can get owners of a business like your gourmet shop that stocks 600 varieties of pickled vegetables in other cities to go in with you on the list rental. But let’s say you rent that list at $75.00 per 1,000 x 5 = $375.00, and you can only use 460 names on it. They cost you, then, $.82 each. If you can only use 46, they cost you $8.20 each. Exactly how else are you going to find the 460 or 46 passionately committed artichoke freaks in your area? And how much will you spend with mass advertising trying to flush them out of the woodwork?

 Third, don’t rule out this kind of highly targeted direct mail, even if you’re trying to do business online and be an e-commerce merchant. One of my richest clients at the time I’m writing this book mails postcards that I wrote for him to rented lists of buyers and subscribers of a certain sort, driving them to a website to see a video sales presentation and buy a product. This year, he’ll mail over 1 million of those postcards.
